The Christchurch urban area lies on the South Island's east coast, just north of Banks Peninsula. It is home to 396,700 residents,[2] making it New Zealand's third most-populous city behind Auckland and Wellington.\\r\\nThe Avon River flows through the centre of the city, with an urban park located along its banks. At the request of the Deans brotherswhose farm was the earliest settlement in the areathe river was named after the River Avon in Scotland, which rises in the Ayrshire hills near to where their grandfather's farm was located.[3]\\r\\nArchaeological evidence has indicated that the Christchurch area was first settled by humans about 1250. Christchurch became a city by Royal Charter on 31 July 1856, making it officially the oldest established city in New Zealand. The Canterbury Association, which settled the Canterbury Plains, named the city after Christ Church, Oxford. The new settlement was laid out in a grid pattern centred on Cathedral Square; during the 19th century there were few barriers to the rapid growth of the urban area, except for the Pacific to the east and the Port Hills to the south.\\r\\nAgriculture is the historic mainstay of Christchurch's economy. The early presence of the University of Canterbury and the heritage of the city's academic institutions in association with local businesses has fostered a number of technology-based industries.\\r\\nThe city suffered a series of earthquakes between September 2010 and early 2012, with the most destructive of them occurring at 12.51 p.m. on Tuesday, 22 February 2011, in which 185 people were killed and thousands of buildings across the city collapsed or suffered severe damage. By late 2013, 1,500 buildings in the city had been demolished, leading to an ongoing recovery and rebuilding project.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe name of \\"Christchurch\\" was agreed on at the first meeting of the Canterbury Association on 27 March 1848. It was suggested by founder John Robert Godley, whose alma mater was Christ Church, Oxford.[4]\\r\\nThe Mori name tautahi (\\"the place of Tautahi\\") was adopted in the 1930; originally it was the name of a specific site by the Avon River near present-day Kilmore Street.[5] The site was a seasonal dwelling of Ngi Tahu chief Te Potiki Tautahi, whose main home was Port Levy on Banks Peninsula. Prior to that the Ngi Tahu generally referred to the Christchurch area as Karaitiana,[6] a transliteration of the English word Christian.\\r\\nArchaeological evidence found in a cave at Redcliffs in 1876 has indicated that the Christchurch area was first settled by moa-hunting tribes about 1250 CE. These first inhabitants were thought to have been followed by the Waitaha tribe, who are said to have migrated from the East coast of the North Island in the 16th century. Following tribal warfare, the Waitaha (made of three peoples) were dispossessed by the Ngati Mamoe tribe. They were in turn subjugated by the Ngi Tahu tribe, who remained in control until the arrival of European settlers. Following the purchase of land at Putaringamotu (modern Riccarton) by the Weller brothers, whalers of Otago and Sydney, a party of European settlers led by Herriott and McGillivray established themselves in what is now Christchurch, early in 1840. Their abandoned holdings were taken over by the Deans brothers[7] in 1843 who stayed. The First Four Ships were chartered by the Canterbury Association and brought the first 792 of the Canterbury Pilgrims to Lyttelton Harbour. These sailing vessels were the Randolph, Charlotte Jane, Sir George Seymour, and Cressy. The Charlotte Jane was the first to arrive on 16 December 1850. The Canterbury Pilgrims had aspirations of building a city around a cathedral and college, on the model of Christ Church in Oxford.[8]\\r\\nThe name \\"Christ Church\\" was decided prior to the ships' arrival, at the Association's first meeting, on 27 March 1848. The exact basis for the name is not known. It has been suggested that it is named for Christchurch, in Dorset, England; for Canterbury Cathedral; or in honour of Christ Church, Oxford. The last explanation is the one generally accepted.[9]\\r\\nCaptain Joseph Thomas, the Canterbury Association's Chief Surveyor, surveyed the surrounding area. By December 1849 he had commissioned the construction of a road from Port Cooper, later Lyttelton, to Christchurch via Sumner.[10] However this proved more difficult than expected and road construction was stopped while a steep foot and pack horse track was constructed over the hill between the port and the Heathcote valley, where access to the site of the proposed settlement could be gained. This track became known as the Bridle Path, because the path was so steep that pack horses needed to be led by the bridle.[11] Goods that were too heavy or bulky to be transported by pack horse over the Bridle Path were shipped by small sailing vessels some eight miles (13?km) by water around the coast and up the estuary to Ferrymead. New Zealand's first public railway line, the Ferrymead Railway, opened from Ferrymead to Christchurch in 1863. Due to the difficulties in travelling over the Port Hills and the dangers associated with shipping navigating the Sumner bar, a railway tunnel was bored through the Port Hills to Lyttelton, opening in 1867.[12]\\r\\nChristchurch became a city by royal charter on 31 July 1856, the first in New Zealand. Many of the city's Gothic Revival buildings by architect Benjamin Mountfort date from this period. Christchurch was the seat of provincial administration for the Province of Canterbury, which was abolished in 1876. In 1947, New Zealand's worst fire disaster occurred at Ballantyne's Department Store in the inner city, with 41 people killed in a blaze which razed the rambling collection of buildings.[13] The Lyttelton road tunnel between Lyttelton and Christchurch was opened in 1964.[14] Christchurch hosted the 1974 British Commonwealth Games.\\r\\nChristchurch has a history of involvement in Antarctic exploration ÿ both Robert Falcon Scott and Ernest Shackleton used the port of Lyttelton as a departure point for expeditions, and in the central city there is a statue of Scott sculpted by his widow, Kathleen Scott. Within the city, the Canterbury Museum preserves and exhibits many historic artefacts and stories of Antarctic exploration.\\r\\nOn Saturday 4 September 2010, a magnitude 7.1 earthquake struck Christchurch and the central Canterbury region at 4:35?am. Located near Darfield, west of the city at a depth of 10 kilometres (6.2?mi), it caused widespread damage to the city and minor injuries, but no direct fatalities.[16][17][18]\\r\\nNearly six months later on Tuesday 22 February 2011, a second earthquake measuring magnitude 6.3 struck the city at 12:51?pm. It was located closer to the city, near Lyttelton at a depth of 5?km (3?mi).[19] Although lower on the moment magnitude scale than the previous earthquake, the intensity and violence of the ground shaking was measured to be IX (Violent), among the strongest ever recorded globally in an urban area[20] and in total 185 people were killed.[21][22] People from more than 20 countries were among the victims.[23] The city's iconic ChristChurch Cathedral was severely damaged and lost its spire.[24][25] The collapse of the CTV Building resulted in the majority of fatalities. Widespread damage across Christchurch resulted in loss of homes, major buildings and infrastructure. Significant liquefaction affected the eastern suburbs, and the total cost to insurers of rebuilding has been estimated at NZ$20ÿ30?billion.[26][27]\\r\\nOn 13 June 2011 Christchurch was hit by two more large aftershocks. A magnitude 5.6 quake at a depth of 9?km (6?mi) hit at 1:00?pm in the general location of Sumner, Christchurch. This was followed by another quake at magnitude 6.3 with a depth of 6?km (4?mi) at 2:20?pm again in the general location of Sumner, Christchurch. There were no fatalities though it resulted in further liquefaction and building damage.[28]\\r\\nThere were further earthquakes on 23 December 2011; the first, of magnitude 5.8 according to the US Geological Survey, 26?km (16?mi) north-east of the city at a depth of 4.7?km (2.9?mi), at 13:58, followed by several aftershocks and another earthquake of magnitude 6.0 and similar location 80 minutes later, with more aftershocks expected.[29][30] St John Ambulance reported after the two quakes that there were minor injuries at homes and businesses but no serious injuries and few indications of building collapses at the time.[31] Christchurch Airport was briefly closed. There were power and water outages at New Brighton and severe damage to the Parklands region, including roads and footpaths.\\r\\nChristchurch was again rattled awake on 2 January 2012; the first; a magnitude 5.1 struck at 01:27 followed five minutes later by a magnitude 4.2 aftershock; a second larger earthquake struck at 05:45 with a magnitude of 5.5. This caused power outages to the eastern suburbs of Parklands, New Brighton, Shirley, Dallington, Burwood, Spencerville and Richmond; this affected around 10,000 homes.[32]\\r\\n4,558 earthquakes were recorded in the Canterbury region above a magnitude 3.0, from 4 September 2010 to 3 September 2014.[33]\\r\\nFollowing the earthquakes over 1500 buildings in the city had been demolished or partly demolished by September 2013.[34]\\r\\nThe city has been experiencing rapid growth following the earthquakes, with the central city rebuild, which is outlined in the Christchurch Central Recovery Plan, starting to ramp up, and massive growth in the residential sector, with around 50,000 new houses expected to be constructed in the Greater Christchurch area by 2028, as outlined in the Land Use Recovery Plan (LURP).\\r\\nOn 13 February 2017, two bush fires started on the Port Hills. These merged over the next two days and the single very large wild fire extended down both sides of the Port Hill almost reaching Governors Bay in the south-west, and the Westmorland, Kennedys Bush, and Dyers Pass Road almost down to the Sign of the Takahe. Eleven houses were destroyed by fire, over one thousand residents were evacuated from their homes, and over 2,076 hectares (5,130 acres) of land has been burned.[35]\\r\\nChristchurch lies in Canterbury, near the centre of the east coast of the South Island, east of the Canterbury Plains. It is located near the southern end of Pegasus Bay, and is bounded to the east by the Pacific Ocean coast and the estuary of the Avon and Heathcote Rivers. To the south and south-east the urban portion of the city is limited by the volcanic slopes of the Port Hills separating it from Banks Peninsula. To the north the city is bounded by the braided Waimakariri River.\\r\\nChristchurch is one of only eight pairs of cities in the world that have near-exact antipodal cities. Half of these antipodal pairs are in New Zealand and Spain/Moroccoÿwith A Coru?a, Spain as Christchurch's antipode.\\r\\nChristchurch is one of a group of only four cities in the world to have been carefully planned following the same layout of a central city square, four complementing city squares surrounding it and a parklands area that embrace the city centre. The first city built with this pattern was Philadelphia. Later came Savannah and Adelaide, before Christchurch.\\r\\nChristchurch has one of the highest-quality water supplies in the world, with its water rated among the purest and cleanest in the world.[36] Untreated, naturally filtered water is sourced, via more than 50 pumping stations surrounding the city, from aquifers emanating from the foothills of the Southern Alps.[37]\\r\\nAt the city's centre is Cathedral Square, surrounding the now-earthquake-damaged ÿ landmark Anglican cathedral, Christ Church. The area around this square and within the Four Avenues of Christchurch (Bealey Avenue, Fitzgerald Avenue, Moorhouse Avenue and Deans Avenue[38]) is considered to be the central business district (CBD) of the city. The central city also has a number of residential areas, including Inner City East, Inner City West, Avon Loop, Moa Neighbourhood and Victoria, but many of the residential buildings in the CBD were demolished following the February 2011 earthquakes. Cathedral Square is located at the crossing of two major central streets, Colombo Street and Worcester Street.\\r\\nCathedral Square, the heart of the city, hosted attractions such as (until the February 2011 earthquake)[39] the Wizard of New Zealand, Ian Brackenbury Channell, and evangelist Ray Comfort; regular market days; free standing food and coffee carts; an aquarium, pubs and restaurants and the city's chief tourist information centre. it is expected that activities in Cathedral Square will increase as the rebuild progresses. The Wizard of New Zealand now operates from New Regent Street.[40]\\r\\nThe central city also includes the pedestrianised sections of Cashel and High streets commonly known pre-earthquakes as 'City Mall'. Refurbished in 2008/09 the mall featured especially designed seating, flower and garden boxes, more trees, paving, and an extension to the central city tram route. The tram route extension was nearly complete when the February 2011 earthquake struck. Following the earthquakes, most buildings in Cashel Mall were demolished. A shopping area called Re:START opened on Cashel Street adjacent to Ballantyne's Department Store in October 2011. The Re:START mall is made of colourful shipping containers that have been converted to house retail stores. The Bridge of Remembrance commemorating war dead stands at the western end of the mall, was repaired rededicated on Anzac Day, Monday 25 April 2016.[41][42]\\r\\nThe Cultural Precinct[43] provided a backdrop to a vibrant scene of ever-changing arts, cultural, and heritage attractions within an area of less than one square kilometre. The Arts Centre, the Canterbury Museum and the Art Gallery are located in the Cultural Precinct. The majority of the activities were free and a printable map was provided. There areas are slowly being reopened follow earthquake repair and strengthening work.\\r\\nIn 2010, the Christchurch City Council released \\"A City For People Action Plan\\", a programme of work through to 2022 to improve public spaces within the central city to entice more inner city residents and visitors. A primary action was to reduce the impact of motorised private vehicles and increase the comfort of pedestrians and cyclists. The plan was based on a report prepared for the council by renowned Danish design firm Gehl Architects. Since the February 2011 Christchurch earthquake Wellington architect Ian Athfield has been selected to re-plan, although many varied suggestions have been promoted for rebuilding the central city.[44][45][46][47]\\r\\nThe Central City, which was fully closed off following 22 February earthquake, opened in stages and was fully reopened in June 2013. There are still some streets closed off due to earthquake damage, infrastructure repair work, and damaged buildings.[48]\\r\\n(clockwise, starting north of the city centre)\\r\\n(clockwise, starting north of the city centre)\\r\\nChristchurch has a temperate Oceanic climate with a mild summer, cool winter, and regular moderate rainfall. It has mean daily maximum air temperatures of 22.5?C (73?F) in January and 11.3?C (52?F) in July.[49] Under the K?ppen climate classification, Christchurch has an oceanic climate (Cfb). Summer in the city is mostly warm but is often moderated by a sea breeze from the Northeast. A record temperature of 41.6?C (107?F) was reached in February 1973. A notable feature of the weather is the nor'wester, a hot f?hn wind that occasionally reaches storm force, causing widespread minor damage to property.[50] Like many cities, Christchurch experiences an urban heat island effect; temperatures are slightly higher within the inner city regions compared to the surrounding countryside.[51]\\r\\nIn winter it is common for the temperature to fall below 0?C (32?F) at night. There are on average 80 days of ground frost per year.[52] Snowfalls occur on average three times per year, although in some years no snowfall is recorded.[53] The coldest temperature recorded was ?7.1?C (19?F) on 18 July 1945, the third lowest recorded temperature of New Zealand's major cities.[53][54]\\r\\nOn cold winter nights, the surrounding hills, clear skies, and frosty calm conditions often combine to form a stable inversion layer above the city that traps vehicle exhausts and smoke from domestic fires to cause smog. While not as bad as smog in Los Angeles or Mexico City, Christchurch smog has often exceeded World Health Organisation recommendations for air pollution.[55] To limit air pollution, the regional council banned the use of open fires in the city in 2006.[56] In 2008 council prohibited the use of woodburners more than 15 years old, while making funding available to upgrade domestic home heating systems.[57]\\r\\nThe area administered by the Christchurch City Council has a population of 381,500 (June 2017),[2] making it the second-largest in New Zealand, and the largest city in the South Island.\\r\\nThe Christchurch urban area at 396,700 is the third-largest in the country by population, after Auckland and Wellington. The urban area differs from the city by including Kaiapoi in the Waimakariri District and Prebbleton in the Selwyn District, while excluding most of the Banks Peninsula.\\r\\nThe following table shows the ethnic profile of Christchurch's population, as recorded in the 2001 and 2006 New Zealand census. The percentages add up to more than 100%, as some people counted themselves as belonging to more than one ethnic group. Figures for 2006 refer to just Christchurch City, not the whole urban area. The substantial percentage drop in the numbers of 'Europeans' was mainly caused by the increasing numbers of people from this group choosing to define themselves as 'New Zealanders'ÿeven though this was not one of the groups listed on the census form.\\r\\nApproximately 62% of the South Island's Pacific Islander community reside in Christchurch and the surrounding Canterbury region, equalling approximately 11,500 people.[64] People of Samoan descent comprise about half the Pacific Islander population.[64] There are also smaller communities of Cook Islanders, Fijians, Niueans, Tokelauans and Tongans residing in the city.[64]\\r\\nThe 2006 Census also provides information about the multilinguality of the region. Of those people in Christchurch City who provided data, 86% spoke one language only, 12% spoke two, and 2% could converse in three or more languages.[66]\\r\\nThe agricultural industry has always been the economic core of Christchurch.[67] The city has long had industry based on the surrounding farming country ÿ part of the original \\"package\\" New Zealand was sold to immigrants as.[68] PGG Wrightson, New Zealand's leading agribusiness, is based in Christchurch.[69] Its local roots go back to Pyne Gould Guinness, an old stock and station agency serving the South Island.[70] Other agribusinesses in Christchurch have included malting, seed development and dressing, wool and meat processing, and small biotechnology operations using by-products from meat works.[67] Dairying has grown strongly in the surrounding areas with high world prices for milk products and the use of irrigation to lift grass growth on dry land. With its higher labour use this has helped stop declines in rural population. Many cropping and sheep farms have been converted to dairying. Conversions have been by agribusiness companies as well as by farmers, many of whom have moved south from North Island dairying strongholds such as Taranaki and the Waikato.\\r\\nCropping has always been important in the surrounding countryside. Wheat and barley and various strains of clover and other grasses for seed exporting have been the main crops. These have all created processing businesses in Christchurch. In recent years, regional agriculture has diversified, with a thriving wine industry springing up at Waipara, and beginnings of new horticulture industries such as olive production and processing. Deer farming has led to new processing using antlers for Asian medicine and aphrodisiacs. The high quality local wine in particular has increased the appeal of Canterbury and Christchurch to tourists.[71]\\r\\nChristchurch is the second largest manufacturing centre in New Zealand behind Auckland, the sector being the second largest contributor to the local economy,[72] with firms such as Anderson's making steel work for bridges, tunnels, and hydro-electric dams in the early days of infrastructure work. Now manufacturing is mainly of light products and the key market is Australia, with firms such as those pioneered by the Stewart family among the larger employers. Before clothing manufacture largely moved to Asia, Christchurch was the centre of the New Zealand clothing industry, with firms such as LWR Industries. The firms that remain mostly design and market, and manufacture in Asia. The city also had five footwear manufacturers, but these have been replaced by imports.\\r\\nIn the last few decades, technology-based industries have sprung up in Christchurch.[73] Angus Tait founded Tait Electronics, a mobile-radio manufacturer, and other firms spun off from this, such as Dennis Chapman's Swichtec. In software, Cantabrian Gil Simpson founded a company that made LINC and Jade programming languages and a management buyout spawned local firm Wynyard Group.\\r\\nThere have also been spin-offs from the electrical department of the University of Canterbury engineering school. These included Pulse Data, which became Human Ware (making reading devices and computers for blind people and those with limited vision) and CES Communications (encryption). The Pulse Data founders had moved from the Canterbury University engineering school to work for Wormald Inc. when they set up Pulse Data through a Management buyout of their division.[citation needed]\\r\\nIn recent times, the University of Canterbury engineering school and computer science department play an important role in supplying staff and research for the technology industries, and the Christchurch Polytechnic Institute of Technology provides a flow of trained technicians and engineers. Locally and nationally, the IT sector is known not for its size (the third largest in New Zealand) but for producing innovative and entrepreneurial solutions, products and concepts.[74]\\r\\nTourism is also a significant factor of the local economy. The close proximity of the ski fields and other attractions of the Southern Alps, and hotels, a casino, and an airport that meet international standards make Christchurch a stopover destination for many tourists. The city is popular with Japanese tourists,[75] with signage around Cathedral Square in Japanese.\\r\\nThe International Antarctic Centre provides both base facilities and a museum and visitor centre focused upon current Antarctic activities. The United States Navy and latterly the United States Air National Guard, augmented by the New Zealand and Australian air forces, use Christchurch Airport as take-off for the main supply route to McMurdo and Scott Bases in Antarctica. The Clothing Distribution Center (CDC) in Christchurch, had more than 140,000 pieces of extreme cold weather (ECW) gear for issue to nearly 2,000 US Antarctic Program (USAP) participants in the 2007ÿ08 season.[76]\\r\\nChristchurch's local government is a democracy with various elements including:\\r\\nSome of the local governments in Canterbury and the NZ Transport Agency have created the Greater Christchurch Urban Development Strategy to facilitate future urban planning.[79]\\r\\nChristchurch is covered by seven general electorates (Christchurch Central, Christchurch East, Ilam, Port Hills, Selwyn, Waimakariri and Wigram) and one Mori electorate (Te Tai Tonga),[80] each returning one member to the New Zealand House of Representatives. As of the New Zealand general election, 2017 there are four members of the Labour party and three members of the National party.\\r\\nChristchurch is home to the fourth largest school in New Zealand, co-educational state school Burnside High School, with 2519 pupils. Cashmere High School, Papanui High School and Riccarton High School are other large schools. There are four single-sex state schools: Shirley Boys' High School, Christchurch Boys' High School, Avonside Girls' High School and Christchurch Girls' High School.\\r\\nChristchurch is also well known for several independent schools and church schools, some of them of the traditional English public school type. These include St Thomas of Canterbury College, St Margaret's College, Christ's College, St Bede's College, Marian College, St Andrew's College, Villa Maria College and Rangi Ruru Girls' School. Less conventional schools in the city include Unlimited Paenga Tawhiti and Hagley Community College.\\r\\nA number of tertiary education institutions have campuses in Christchurch, or in the surrounding areas.\\r\\nChristchurch is served by Christchurch International Airport and by buses (local and long-distance) and trains. The local bus service, known as Metro,[81] is provided by Environment Canterbury. The car, however, remains the dominant form of transport in the city, as with the rest of New Zealand.\\r\\nChristchurch has an extensive bus network with bus routes serving most areas of the city and satellite towns. Nearly all bus routes travelled through the central city Bus Exchange before the earthquake but due to reduced passenger numbers since the earthquakes, especially in the central city, the bus network was reorganised to direct more localised services to 'hubs', such as major shopping centres, where they connect to the central station via core bus routes. Before the 2011 earthquakes, in addition to normal bus services, Christchurch also had a pioneering zero-fare hybrid bus service, the Shuttle, in the inner city. The service has been suspended following the earthquakes and it is unclear whether it will resume again in the future.[82] Bus services are also available leaving Christchurch, daily passenger bus services[83] operates between Dunedin and Christchurch on the State Highway 1.\\r\\nHistorically, Christchurch has been known as New Zealand's cycling city[84] and currently still attracts about 7% of commuters cycling. The central city has very flat terrain and the Christchurch City Council has established a network of cycle lanes and paths, such as the Railway Cycleway. Post-quake public consultation on rebuilding the city expressed a strong desire for a more sustainable transport system, particularly greater use of cycling again, and this has been reflected in the Council's strategic transport plan.[85]\\r\\nThe Christchurch City Council has committed NZ$68.5?million to build a network of modern cycleways over the next five years.[citation needed]\\r\\nThere is a functioning Christchurch tramway system in Christchurch, but as a tourist attraction; its loop is restricted to a circuit of the central city. The trams were originally introduced in 1905 as a form of public transport, and ceased operating in 1954,[86] but returned to the inner city (as a tourist attraction) in 1995. However, following the February 2011 earthquake, the system was damaged and within the cordoned off 'Red Zone' of the central city. The tramway reopened in November 2013 on a limited route, with plans to extend the tram route in 2014, first to reopen the complete pre-earthquake circuit, and then to open the extension travelling through the Re:Start Mall and High Street, which was being constructed when the 2011 earthquake struck.\\r\\nThere is a cable car system called the Christchurch Gondola which operates as a tourist attraction, providing transport from the Heathcote Valley to the top of Mount Cavendish in the city's south-east.\\r\\nRail services, both long-distance and commuter, used to focus on the former railway station on Moorhouse avenue. Commuter trains were progressively cancelled in the 1960s and 1970s. The last such service, between Christchurch and Rangiora, ceased in 1976. After the reduction in services a new Christchurch railway station was established at Addington Junction. The Main North Line railway travels northwards via Kaikoura to Picton and is served by the TranzCoastal passenger train, while the Main South Line heads to Invercargill via Dunedin and was used by the Southerner until its cancellation in 2002. The most famous train to depart Christchurch is the TranzAlpine, which travels along the Main South Line to Rolleston and then turns onto the Midland Line, passes through the Southern Alps via the Otira Tunnel, and terminates in Greymouth on the West Coast. This trip is often regarded as one of the ten great train journeys in the world for the amazing scenery through which it passes. The TranzAlpine service is primarily a tourist service and carries no significant commuter traffic.\\r\\nThe Christchurch International Airport serves as the major base for the New Zealand, Italian and United States Antarctic programs.\\r\\nChristchurch is a distinctly English city, however it contains various European elements, with strong Gothic Revival architecture. As early settlers of New Zealand, Mori culture is also prevalent in the city. It features many public open spaces and parks, river beds and cafs and restaurants situated in the city centre and surrounding suburbs.\\r\\nWhile historically most cinemas were grouped around Cathedral Square,[87] only two cinemas remain there. The Regent complex was rebuilt as 'Regent on Worcester' in 1996. In 2009 Metro Cinemas opened in Worcester Street with three screens.\\r\\nOnly one of the first generation of suburban cinemas, the Hollywood in Sumner, remains open.[88] The largest multiplexes were the Hoyts 8 in the old railway station on Moorhouse Avenue (now demolished) and Reading Cinemas (also eight screens) in the Palms shopping centre in Shirley. Hoyts in Riccarton opened in 2005[89] with one of its screens for a time holding the record for the largest in New Zealand.\\r\\nThe Rialto Cinemas on Moorhouse avenue specialised in international films and art house productions. The Rialto also hosted the majority of the city's various film festivals and was home to the local film society. The Rialto was closed following the February 2011 earthquake.\\r\\nThe Christchurch Arts Centre includes two art house cinemas, Cloisters and The Academy, screening a wide selection of contemporary, classic and foreign language films.\\r\\nThe Canterbury Film Society is active in the city.[90]\\r\\nThe matricidal Peter Jackson film Heavenly Creatures (1994), starring Melanie Lynskey and Kate Winslet, was set in Christchurch.[91]\\r\\nThe large number of public parks and well-developed residential gardens with many trees has given Christchurch the name of The Garden City.[92] Hagley Park and the 30-hectare (75 acre) Christchurch Botanic Gardens, founded in 1863, are in the central city, with Hagley Park being a site for sports such as golf, cricket, netball, and rugby, and for open-air concerts by local bands and orchestras. To the north of the city is the Willowbank wildlife park. Travis Wetland, an ecological restoration programme to create a wetland, is to the east of the city centre in the suburb of Burwood.\\r\\nChristchurch had its own regional television station Canterbury Television. CTV was first formed in 1991 and ceased broadcasting on 16 December 2016. It aired both local, national and international content, including DW-TV and Al-jazeera World. Since 19 December 2016 CTV has operated as a web-based platform under the Star Media brand.\\r\\nVTV, a Korean TV channel airs in Christchurch (also Auckland). It offers English content about Korea, from arirang World, and Korean-speaking content in SBS. This channel broadcasts many of the latest dramas airing in Korea.\\r\\nThe city's main television transmitter is located atop Sugarloaf, in the Port Hills due south of the city centre, and broadcasts all major national television channels as well as the two local channels. All television channels in Christchurch have been broadcast in digital since analogue switch-off on 28 April 2013.\\r\\nChristchurch has one full-time professional theatre, the Court Theatre,[93] founded in 1971. Originally based in the Christchurch Arts Centre, the Court Theatre has been located in the suburb of Addington in temporary accommodation following the 2011 earthquakes. Alongside the Court, the co-operative and experimental Free Theatre Christchurch was established in 1979 and based in the Arts Centre from 1982.[94] There is also an active recreational theatre scene with community based theatre companies, such as the Christchurch Repertory Society,[95] Elmwood Players,[96] Riccarton Players,[97] and Canterbury Children's Theatre,[98] producing many quality shows. The Ngaio Marsh Theatre, located at the University of Canterbury, hosts a range of student drama groups, as well as other theatre groups. The Isaac Theatre Royal was originally opened in 1863, and has since been rebuilt four times, most recently following the 2011 Christchurch earthquake.[99] The Isaac Theatre Royal reopened to the public on 17 November 2014.\\r\\nThe city is known for its many live acts,[100][101][102][103] has a professional symphony orchestra,[104] and is the base of professional opera company, Southern Opera.[105] Christchurch is a home for the experimental music scene of New Zealand. The town is the home to such bands as The Bats, The Narcs, Shocking Pinks and Bailter Space.\\r\\nThere are usually buskers around the town square and Christchurch also hosts the World Buskers Festival in January each year.[citation needed] Singer/songwriter Hayley Westenra launched her international career by busking in Christchurch. Soon she was signed to Universal Music Group New Zealand, then later to Decca Label Group in London, England, where she now bases her career.\\r\\nChristchurch also has a Metal scene, with metal acts playing in various locations around the central city.[citation needed]\\r\\nSome of New Zealand's acts such as Shapeshifter, Ladi6, Tiki Taane and Truth are from Christchurch. Promoters, Venues and clubs such as Bassfreaks, The Bedford and Dux Live regularly have international and New Zealand acts within the Drum and Bass scene performing live in Christchurch, along with dance parties, raves and gigs all featuring NZ and local Drum and Bass DJs, with often two or three happening on a single night or weekend (e.g. 2010 when UK Dubstep DJ Doctor P with Crushington was playing at The Bedford, while simultaneously Concord Dawn featuring Trei and Bulletproof was playing at Ministry).[citation needed] Independent Christchurch based radio station Pulzar FM is one of the few radio stations in New Zealand that plays Drum and Bass during the day.\\r\\nIn recent developments, hip hop has effectively landed in Christchurch.[clarification needed] In 2000, First Aotearoa Hip Hop Summit was held there. And in 2003, Christchurch's own Scribe released his debut album in New Zealand and has received five times platinum in that country, in addition to achieving two number one singles.[106][107]\\r\\nThe Horncastle Arena is New Zealand's second largest permanent multipurpose arena, seating between 5000 and 8000, depending on configuration. It is home of the Canterbury Tactix netball side. It was the venue for the 1999 World Netball championships and has been host to many concerts in recent years.\\r\\nThe Christchurch Town Hall auditorium (2500 seats, opened 1972) was the first major auditorium design by architects Warren and Mahoney and acoustician Marshall Day. It is still recognised as a model example of concert-hall design with an excellent modern pipe organ. The town hall is currently closed for repair after the significant damage caused by the February 2011 Christchurch earthquake.\\r\\nChristchurch also has a casino,[108] and there are also a wide range of live music venues[100][109]some short-lived, others with decades of history. Classical music concerts are held at the Christchurch Music Centre.\\r\\nIn late 2014 it was announced that a 284 million dollar project was underway to build a convention centre located on the block defined by Armagh Street, Oxford Terrace, Worcester Street and Colombo Street. Gloucester Street will become part of the Centre itself, but will allow for retail use and public access. The convention centre will be able to host several events at the same time; starting with space for up to 2,000 people, this will complement facilities in Auckland and Queenstown. The scheduled opening of the convention centre is uncertain.[110]\\r\\nChristchurch has seven sister cities around the world.

It won the 1998 U.S. National Book Award for Young People's Literature[1] and the 1999 Newbery Medal for the year's \\"most distinguished contribution to American literature for children\\".[2] In 2012 it was ranked number 6 among all-time children's novels in a survey published by School Library Journal.[3]\\r\\nHoles was adapted as a feature film of the same name by Walt Disney Pictures, and was released in 2003.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nStanley Yelnats IV is a 14-year-old boy from a hard-working but poor family that is allegedly affected by a curse of bad luck, which they blame on Stanley's \\"no-good-dirty-rotten pig-stealing-great-great-grandfather\\".[4] Stanley's latest stroke of misfortune occurs when he is mistakenly convicted of the theft of a pair of athletic shoes once owned by Clyde \\"Sweet Feet\\" Livingston, which had been donated to a homeless shelter to raise money.\\r\\nStanley is sent to Camp Green Lake, a juvenile imprisonment and disciplinary facility which is ironically in the middle of a sterile desert. As a punishment, the inmates of the camp have to dig 1 hole a day 5 feet wide and 5 feet deep to 'build character'. Stanley soon begins to suspect that they are not digging to build character, but rather to find something hidden beneath the dry, rocky ground.\\r\\nStanley's \\"no-good-dirty-rotten-pig-stealing-great-great-grandfather\\", Elya Yelnats, is in love with a girl named Myra Menke, but a much older pig farmer named Igor Barkov also wants to marry her, offering Myra's father his heaviest pig in exchange for Myra's hand in marriage.\\r\\nDesperate to impress Myra and her father, Elya goes to his friend Madame Zeroni for help. She warns him that Myra is not intelligent and will not be a good wife, and advises him to move to America, as her son has. She gives him a tiny piglet, telling him to carry the piglet up a mountain every day, and let it drink from a stream while singing to it. Each day the water will make it grow bigger, and Elya will grow stronger. On the last day, after he carries the pig one last time, he must carry Madame Zeroni herself up the mountain to do the same, as he will then be strong enough to carry her. However, Zeroni warns him that if Elya does not carry her up the mountain, his family will be cursed.\\r\\nElya follows her directions, and the piglet grows to a large size, but he does not carry the pig up on the final day in order to have time to clean up. Elya nearly wins Myra as his bride, but his pig is revealed to be the same weight as Igor's. Since the pigs weigh the same, Myra is given the choice between Elya and Igor, but fails to decide. When Myra has Elya and Igor try to guess what number she's thinking of in order to win her, Elya walks away in disgust. Elya, forgetting his promise to Madame Zeroni, moves to America to start a new life, falls in love, and marries, but he is beset by Zeroni's curse. The song that he sang to the piglet becomes a lullaby that is passed down among Elya's descendants, who are all named Stanley due to its palindromic relation to the name Yelnats.\\r\\nIn the year 1888, the town of Green Lake is a flourishing lakeside community. Katherine \\"Kate\\" Barlow, the local teacher, falls in love with Sam, an African-American onion seller, while rejecting advances from wealthy resident Charles \\"Trout\\" Walker (named due to the smell of his feet). There is an uproar in the town after Hattie Parker sees Kate and Sam kissing in an alley, proclaiming God will punish them. After no children arrive at the schoolhouse the following day, a mob led by Trout Walker ransacks and burns the schoolhouse. Kate realizes that Sam is in danger of being lynched and seeks the help of the sheriff. The sheriff is drunk and states that Sam is to be hanged in accordance with the law, but will spare Sam if she gives him a kiss. Kate leaves in disgust. She finds Sam and they attempt an escape across the lake in Sam's rowboat, but Walker and the mob intercept them with Walker's motorboat, ramming the smaller vessel and sinking it. Sam is shot and killed in the water, while Kate is \\"rescued\\" against her wishes. Following the death of Sam, no rain falls ever again on the town, and the reader is asked: 'who did God punish?'\\r\\nKate becomes a prominent outlaw, who leaves a kiss-mark in lipstick on her first dead victim, earning her the nickname \\"Kissin' Kate Barlow.\\" Kate robs Stanley's great-grandfather, Stanley Yelnats I, of his entire fortune, but rather than kill him, she abandons him in the desert that was previously Green Lake. Miraculously, he survives after he is found by lizard and snake hunters, who believe Stanley I to be crazy. Stanley I is subsequently taken to the hospital where he stays for a number of weeks. During his hospital stay, Stanley I falls in love with the nurse that is caring for him, and the two later marry.\\r\\nTwenty years later, Kate returns to an old cabin on the former lakeside and is tracked down by Trout and his wife, who are bankrupt and desperate for money. They try to force her to reveal where she buried her loot, but she is bitten by a yellow-spotted lizard and dies. As she dies, she taunts them by saying, \\"start digging\\". The Walkers are left to dig the entire area in order to find the buried treasure.\\r\\nThe inmates at Camp Green Lake are forced to dig cylindrical holes five feet deep and five feet wide, which the warden says \\"builds their character.\\" They are promised the rest of their day off if they find anything that the Warden considers \\"interesting\\". Stanley finds a fossil, but Mr Pendanski tells him that the Warden \\"isn't interested in fossils\\", leading Stanley to suspect they are looking for something in particular. During one dig, Stanley finds one of Barlow's lipstick tubes (though he doesn't recognize it for what it is), but he pawns it off to X-Ray, the ringleader of Tent D, who convinces him that he deserves it more than Stanley. The Warden is excited by the discovery and orders them to greatly enlarge X-Ray's hole (the wrong hole) and to sift through the dirt from it for several weeks.\\r\\nMeanwhile, Stanley and Zero, the smallest inmate in Tent D, who got his nickname because \\"he has nothing in his head\\", become friends. Stanley agrees to teach Zero how to read, and in return, Zero digs Stanley's hole part of the time. The other boys eventually become jealous after seeing Stanley getting help, eventually resulting in a fight. The Warden and the staff arrive and, learning that Zero has been assisting Stanley with digging in return for receiving education, mock him. The argument culminates in Zero angrily hitting Mr. Pendanski with a shovel and running away, and the camp staff decide to erase their records of him and let him die in the desert. A few days later, Stanley follows Zero and finds him living under the remains of Sam's boat, eating very old jars of Kate's spiced peaches, which he calls \\"Sploosh\\". Stanley notices a mountain resembling a human fist giving the thumbs up sign, and recalls that Stanley Yelnats I claimed to find \\"refuge on Gods thumb\\". On the mountain, Zero admits that he was the one who stole \\"Sweet Feet\\" Livingston's shoes.\\r\\nAtop the mountain, Stanley discovers a field of onions that was once Sam's. The boys eat the onions and find water by digging in the ground, and Stanley sings Madame Zeroni's song to Zero, Zeroni's descendant, unknowingly breaking the curse. Stanley suggests that they return to the hole where Stanley found the lipstick to find the buried treasure. They find a suitcase buried in the hole, but they are captured by the Warden, and surrounded by a group of lethal yellow-spotted lizards. A stalemate develops: they cannot move, but the lizards prevent the Warden's staff from approaching them. The lizards do not bite Stanley and Zero because they are repelled by the onions the boys have been eating. They remain in the hole until the next morning, when an attorney arrives demanding Stanley's release, having received testimony that gives him an alibi during the time the shoes were stolen. The Warden tries to claim they stole the suitcase from her, but Zero reveals that the name 'Stanley Yelnats' is written on it, as the suitcase had belonged to Stanley's great-grandfather. Fearing that the warden will kill Zero if he leaves him behind, Stanley refuses to leave the camp unless Zero can come along. The attorney orders the Warden to get Zero's file, but the camp staff are naturally unable to find it, and Zero is also released.\\r\\nStanley's family open the case, discovering the jewels, deeds, stocks and promissory notes stolen from Stanley Yelnats I. Using the money raised from the bonds, Stanley's family buys a new house and Zero hires a team of investigators to find his missing mother; meanwhile, the drought at Green Lake is brought to an end by rainfall. The family's luck seems to change as if in response to Stanley's fulfillment of his ancestor's promise (a suggestion left purposely ambiguous by the narration). In a final scene, Clyde Livingston and his wife, along with the Yelnats and Zeroni families, celebrate the success of Stanley's father's antidote to foot odor, composed of preserved and fermented spiced peaches and onions and named \\"Sploosh\\" by Zero. The Warden is forced to sell Green Lake to \\"a national organization dedicated to the well-being of young girls\\", which turns it into a Girl Scout camp.\\r\\nCamp Green Lake is located on a dried-up lake in the U.S. state of Texas.[7] The area is not green and there is no lake, besides the fact that there is such a little amount of shade (two oak trees) which are owned by the Warden. Camp Green Lake is a parched barren place with the scorching sun above them with hardly any clouds, so the sun is always shining, making the environment much hotter. Camp Green Lake is a juvenile detention center, where inmates spend most of their time digging holes. The majority of the book takes place between the past and present. Protagonists deal with flashbacks existing from pre-dried up Green Lake to Latvia (mid-1800s) back to modern day Camp Green Lake.\\r\\nIn 2003, Walt Disney Pictures released a film version of Holes, which was directed by Andrew Davis and written by Louis Sachar.[8]\\r\\nTwo companion novels have followed Holes: Stanley Yelnats' Survival Guide to Camp Green Lake (2003) and Small Steps (2006).[9]\\r\\nAs Louis Sachar states: \\"Should you ever find yourself at Camp Green Lakeor somewhere similarthis is the guide for you.\\" Written from Stanley's point of view, the book offers advice on everything from scorpions, rattlesnakes, yellow-spotted lizards, etc.[10]\\r\\nIn this sequel to Holes, former inmate Armpit is now 17 and struggling with the challenges facing an African American teenager with a criminal history. A new friendship with Ginny, who has cerebral palsy, a reunion with former friend X-Ray, a ticket-scalping scheme, a beautiful pop singer, and a frame-up all test Armpits resolve to \\"Just take small steps and keep moving forward\\".[11]","input":"What is the genre of holes by louis sachar?"},{"output":"September 21","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nAutumn, also known as fall in North American English,[1] is one of the four temperate seasons. Autumn marks the transition from summer to winter, in September (Northern Hemisphere) or March (Southern Hemisphere), when the duration of daylight becomes noticeably shorter and the temperature cools down considerably. One of its main features is the shedding of leaves from deciduous trees.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome cultures regard the autumnal equinox as \\"mid-autumn\\", while others with a longer temperature lag treat it as the start of autumn.[2] Meteorologists (and most of the temperate countries in the southern hemisphere)[3] use a definition based on Gregorian calendar months, with autumn being September, October, and November in the northern hemisphere,[4] and March, April, and May in the southern hemisphere.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn North America, traditionally  autumn starts on September 21 and ends on December 21. It is considered to start with the September equinox (21 to 24 September)[5] and end with the winter solstice (21 or 22 December).[6] Popular culture in the United States associates Labor Day, the first Monday in September, as the end of summer and the start of autumn; certain summer traditions, such as wearing white, are discouraged after that date.[7] As daytime and nighttime temperatures decrease, trees shed their leaves.[8] In traditional East Asian solar term, autumn starts on or around 8 August and ends on or about 7 November. In Ireland, the autumn months according to the national meteorological service, Met ireann, are September, October and November.[9] However, according to the Irish Calendar, which is based on ancient Gaelic traditions, autumn lasts throughout the months of August, September and October, or possibly a few days later, depending on tradition.[citation needed] In Australia[10] and New Zealand, autumn officially begins on 1 March and ends on 31 May.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe word autumn comes from the ancient Etruscan root autu- and has within it connotations of the passing of the year.[11] It was borrowed by the neighbouring Romans, and became the Latin word autumnus.[12] After the Roman era, the word continued to be used as the Old French word autompne (automne in modern French) or autumpne in Middle English,[13] and was later normalised to the original Latin. In the Medieval period, there are rare examples of its use as early as the 12th century, but by the 16th century, it was in common use.\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore the 16th century, harvest was the term usually used to refer to the season, as it is common in other West Germanic languages to this day (cf. Dutch herfst, German Herbst and Scots hairst). However, as more people gradually moved from working the land to living in towns, the word harvest lost its reference to the time of year and came to refer only to the actual activity of reaping, and autumn, as well as fall, began to replace it as a reference to the season.[14][15]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe alternative word fall for the season traces its origins to old Germanic languages. The exact derivation is unclear, with the Old English fi?ll or feallan and the Old Norse fall all being possible candidates. However, these words all have the meaning \\"to fall from a height\\" and are clearly derived either from a common root or from each other. The term came to denote the season in 16th-century England, a contraction of Middle English expressions like \\"fall of the leaf\\" and \\"fall of the year\\".[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the 17th century, English emigration to the British colonies in North America was at its peak, and the new settlers took the English language with them. While the term fall gradually became obsolete in Britain, it became the more common term in North America.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe name backend, a once common name for the season in Northern England, has today been largely replaced by the name autumn.[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nAssociation with the transition from warm to cold weather, and its related status as the season of the primary harvest, has dominated its themes and popular images. In Western cultures, personifications of autumn are usually pretty, well-fed females adorned with fruits, vegetables and grains that ripen at this time. Many cultures feature autumnal harvest festivals, often the most important on their calendars. Still extant echoes of these celebrations are found in the autumn Thanksgiving holiday of the United States and Canada, and the Jewish Sukkot holiday with its roots as a full-moon harvest festival of \\"tabernacles\\" (living in outdoor huts around the time of harvest).[citation needed] There are also the many North American Indian festivals tied to harvest of ripe foods gathered in the wild, the Chinese Mid-Autumn or Moon festival, and many others. The predominant mood of these autumnal celebrations is a gladness for the fruits of the earth mixed with a certain melancholy linked to the imminent arrival of harsh weather.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis view is presented in English poet John Keats' poem To Autumn, where he describes the season as a time of bounteous fecundity, a time of 'mellow fruitfulness'.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn North America, while most foods are harvested during the autumn, foods particularly associated with the season include pumpkins (which are integral parts of both Thanksgiving and Halloween) and apples, which are used to make the seasonal beverage apple cider.\\r\\n\\r\\nAutumn, especially in poetry, has often been associated with melancholia. The possibilities and opportunities of summer are gone, and the chill of winter is on the horizon. Skies turn grey, the amount of usable daylight drops rapidly, and many people turn inward, both physically and mentally.[18] It has been referred to as an unhealthy season.[19]\\r\\n\\r\\nSimilar examples may be found in Irish poet William Butler Yeats' poem The Wild Swans at Coole where the maturing season that the poet observes symbolically represents his own ageing self. Like the natural world that he observes, he too has reached his prime and now must look forward to the inevitability of old age and death. French poet Paul Verlaine's \\"Chanson d'automne\\" (\\"Autumn Song\\") is likewise characterised by strong, painful feelings of sorrow. Keats' To Autumn, written in September 1819, echoes this sense of melancholic reflection, but also emphasises the lush abundance of the season. The song, Autumn Leaves, which is based on a French song, \\" \\"Les Feuilles mortes\\", uses the melancholic atmosphere of the season and the end of summer as a simile to compare to the mood of being separated from a loved one.[20]\\r\\n\\r\\nAutumn is associated with Halloween (influenced by Samhain, a Celtic autumn festival),[21] and with it a widespread marketing campaign that promotes it. Halloween is in autumn in the northern hemisphere. The television, film, book, costume, home decoration, and confectionery industries use this time of year to promote products closely associated with such a holiday, with promotions going from early September to 31 October, since their themes rapidly lose strength once the holiday ends, and advertising starts concentrating on Christmas.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn some parts of the northern hemisphere, autumn has a strong association with the end of summer holiday and the start of a new school year, particularly for children in primary and secondary education. \\"Back to School\\" advertising and preparations usually occurs in the weeks leading to the beginning of autumn.\\r\\n\\r\\nEaster falls in autumn in the southern hemisphere. \\r\\n\\r\\nThanksgiving Day is a national holiday celebrated in Canada, in the United States, in some of the Caribbean islands and in Liberia. Thanksgiving is celebrated on the second Monday of October in Canada and on the fourth Thursday of November in the United States, and around the same part of the year in other places. Similarly named festival holidays occur in Germany and Japan.\\r\\n\\r\\nTelevision stations and networks, particularly in North America, traditionally begin their regular seasons in their autumn, with new series and new episodes of existing series debuting mostly during late September or early October (series that debut outside the fall season are usually known as mid-season replacements). A sweeps period takes place in November to measure Nielsen Ratings.\\r\\n\\r\\nAmerican football is played almost exclusively in the autumn months; at the high school level, seasons run from late August through early November, with some playoff games and holiday rivalry contests being played as late as Thanksgiving.  In many American states, the championship games take place in early December. College football's regular season runs from September through November, while the main professional circuit, the National Football League, plays from September through to early January. Summer sports, such as stock car racing, Major League Soccer, and Major League Baseball, wrap up their seasons in early to late autumn; MLB's championship World Series is known popularly as the \\"Fall Classic\\".[22] (Amateur baseball is usually finished by August.) Likewise, professional winter sports, such as professional ice hockey, basketball and most leagues of soccer football in Europe, are in the early stages of their seasons during autumn; American college basketball and college ice hockey play teams outside their athletic conferences during the late autumn before their in-conference schedules begin in winter.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Christian religious holidays of All Saints' Day and All Souls' Day are observed in autumn in the Northern hemisphere.\\r\\n\\r\\nSince 1997, Autumn has been one of the top 100 names for girls in the United States.[23]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Indian mythology, autumn is considered to be the preferred season for the goddess of learning Saraswati, who is also known by the name of \\"goddess of autumn\\" (Sharada).\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Asian mysticism, Autumn is associated with the element of metal, and subsequently with the colour white, the White Tiger of the West, and death and mourning.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough colour change in leaves occurs wherever deciduous trees are found, coloured autumn foliage is noted in various regions of the world: most of North America, Eastern Asia (including China, Korea, and Japan), Europe, the forest of Patagonia, eastern Australia and New Zealand's South Island.\\r\\n\\r\\nEastern Canada and New England are famous for their autumnal foliage,[24][25] and this attracts major tourism (worth billions of US dollars) for the regions.[26][27]\\r\\n\\r\\nOto?o, Frederic Edwin Church, 1875.

The term symbolizes the efforts by the Soviet Union to block itself and its satellite states from open contact with the West and non-Soviet-controlled areas. On the east side of the Iron Curtain were the countries that were connected to or influenced by the Soviet Union. Separate international economic and military alliances were developed on each side of the Iron Curtain:\\r\\nPhysically, the Iron Curtain took the form of border defences between the countries of Europe in the middle of the continent. The most notable border was marked by the Berlin Wall and its Checkpoint Charlie, which served as a symbol of the Curtain as a whole.[1]\\r\\nThe events that demolished the Iron Curtain started in discontent in Poland,[2][3] and continued in Hungary, the German Democratic Republic (East Germany), Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, and Romania. Romania became the only communist state in Europe to overthrow its totalitarian government with violence.[4][5]\\r\\nThe use of the term iron curtain as a metaphor for strict separation goes back at least as far as the early 19th century. It originally referred to fireproof curtains in theaters.[6] Although its popularity as a Cold War symbol is attributed to its use in a speech Winston Churchill gave in 5 March 1946 in Fulton, Missouri,[6] German Minister of Propaganda Joseph Goebbels had already used the term in reference to the Soviet Union.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nVarious usages of the term \\"iron curtain\\" (Russian: A춶ֳ ־ Zheleznyj zanaves; German: Eiserner Vorhang; Georgian: ?????? ????? Rkinis pharda; Czech and Slovak: ?elezn opona; Hungarian: Vasfgg?ny; Romanian: Cortina de fier; Italian: Cortina di ferro; Serbian: ־ ־ Gvozdena zavesa; Estonian: Raudne eesriie; Bulgarian: A춶 ־ Zhelyazna zaves?) pre-date Churchill's use of the phrase. The concept goes back to the Babylonian Talmud of the 3rd to 5th centuries CE, where Tractate Sota 38b refers to a \\"mechitza shel barzel\\", an iron barrier or divider: \\"????? ????? ?? ???? ???? ????? ??? ????? ?????? ??????\\" (Even an iron barrier cannot separate [the people of] Israel from their heavenly father).\\r\\nThe term \\"iron curtain\\" has since been used metaphorically in two rather different senses ÿ firstly to denote the end of an era and secondly to denote a closed geopolitical border. The source of these metaphors can refer to either the safety curtain deployed in theatres (the first one was installed by the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane in 1794[8]) or to roller shutters used to secure commercial premises.[9]\\r\\nThe first metaphorical usage of \\"iron curtain\\", in the sense of an end of an era, perhaps should be attributed to British author Arthur Machen (1863ÿ1947), who used the term in his 1895 novel The Three Impostors: \\"...the door clanged behind me with the noise of thunder, and I felt that an iron curtain had fallen on the brief passage of my life\\".[10] It is interesting to note the English translation of a Russian text shown immediately below repeats the use of \\"clang\\" with reference to an \\"iron curtain\\", suggesting that the Russian writer, publishing 23 years after Machen, may have been familiar with the popular British author.\\r\\nQueen Elisabeth of the Belgians used the term \\"Iron Curtain\\" in the context of World War I to describe the political situation between Belgium and Germany in 1914.[11]\\r\\nThe first recorded application of the term to Communist Russia, again in the sense of the end of an era, comes in Vasily Rozanov's 1918 polemic The Apocalypse of Our Times, and it is possible that Churchill read it there following the publication of the book's English translation in 1920. The passage runs:\\r\\nWith clanging, creaking, and squeaking, an iron curtain is lowering over Russian History. \\"The performance is over.\\" The audience got up. \\"Time to put on your fur coats and go home.\\" We looked around, but the fur coats and homes were missing.[12]\\r\\n(Incidentally, this same passage provides a definition of nihilism adopted by Raoul Vaneigem,[13] Guy Debord and other Situationists as the intention of situationist intervention.)\\r\\nThe first English-language use of the term iron curtain applied to the border of communist Russia in the sense of \\"an impenetrable barrier\\" was used in 1920 by Ethel Snowden, in her book Through Bolshevik Russia.[14][15]\\r\\nG.K. Chesterton used the phrase in a 1924 essay in The Illustrated London News. Chesterton, while defending Distributism, refers to \\"that iron curtain of industrialism that has cut us off not only from our neighbours' condition, but even from our own past\\".[16]\\r\\nThe term also appears in the 1933 satirical novel England, Their England; used there to describe the way an artillery barrage protected the infantry from an enemy assault: \\"...the western sky was a blaze of yellow flame. The iron curtain was down\\". Sebastian Haffner used the metaphor in his book Germany: Jekyll & Hyde, published in London in 1940, in introducing his discussion of the Nazi rise to power in Germany in 1933: \\"Back then to March 1933. How, a moment before the iron curtain was wrung down on it, did the German political stage appear?\\"[17]\\r\\nAll German theatres[when?] had to install an iron curtain (eiserner Vorhang) as an obligatory precaution to prevent the possibility of fire spreading from the stage to the rest of the theatre. Such fires were rather common because the decor often was very flammable. In case of fire, a metal wall would separate the stage from the theatre, secluding the flames to be extinguished by firefighters. Douglas Reed used this metaphor in his book Disgrace Abounding: \\"The bitter strife [in Yugoslavia between Serb unionists and Croat federalists] had only been hidden by the iron safety-curtain of the King's dictatorship\\".[18]\\r\\nA May 1943 article in Signal, a Nazi illustrated propaganda periodical published in many languages, bore the title \\"Behind the Iron Curtain\\". It discussed \\"the iron curtain that more than ever before separates the world from the Soviet Union\\".[7] The German Minister of Propaganda Joseph Goebbels wrote in his weekly newspaper Das Reich that if the Nazis should lose the war a Soviet-formed \\"iron curtain\\" would arise because of agreements made by Stalin, Franklin D. Roosevelt and Winston Churchill at the Yalta Conference: \\"An iron curtain would fall over this enormous territory controlled by the Soviet Union, behind which nations would be slaughtered\\".[6][19] The first recorded oral intentional mention of an Iron Curtain in the Soviet context occurred in a broadcast by Lutz von Krosigk to the German people on 2 May 1945: \\"In the East the iron curtain behind which, unseen by the eyes of the world, the work of destruction goes on, is moving steadily forward\\".[20]\\r\\nChurchill's first recorded use of the term \\"iron curtain\\" came in a 12 May 1945 telegram he sent to U.S. President Harry S. Truman regarding his concern about Soviet actions, stating \\"[a]n iron curtain is drawn down upon their front. We do not know what is going on behind\\".[21] He was further concerned about \\"another immense flight of the German population westward as this enormous Muscovite advance towards the centre of Europe\\".[21] Churchill concluded \\"then the curtain will descend again to a very large extent, if not entirely. Thus a broad land of many hundreds of miles of Russian-occupied territory will isolate us from Poland\\".[21][22]\\r\\nChurchill repeated the words in a further telegram to President Truman on 4 June 1945, in which he protested against such a U.S. retreat to what was earlier designated as, and ultimately became, the U.S. occupation zone, saying the military withdrawal would bring \\"Soviet power into the heart of Western Europe and the descent of an iron curtain between us and everything to the eastward\\".[23] At the Potsdam Conference, Churchill complained to Stalin about an \\"iron fence\\" coming down upon the British Mission in Bucharest.\\r\\nThe first American print reference to the \\"Iron Curtain\\" occurred when C.L. Sulzberger of The New York Times first used it in a dispatch published on 23 July 1945. He had heard the term used by Vladko Ma?ek, a Croatian politician, a Yugoslav opposition leader who had fled his homeland for Paris in May 1945. Ma?ek told Sulzberger, \\"During the four years while I was interned by the Germans in Croatia I saw how the Partisans were lowering an iron curtain over Jugoslavia [Yugoslavia] so that nobody could know what went on behind it\\".[24]\\r\\nThe term was first used in the British House of Commons by Churchill on 16 August 1945 when he stated \\"it is not impossible that tragedy on a prodigious scale is unfolding itself behind the iron curtain which at the moment divides Europe in twain\\".[25]\\r\\nAllen Dulles used the term in a speech on 3 December 1945, referring to only Germany, following his conclusion that \\"in general the Russians are acting little better than thugs\\", had \\"wiped out all the liquid assets\\", and refused to issue food cards to emigrating Germans, leaving them \\"often more dead than alive\\". Dulles concluded that \\"[a]n iron curtain has descended over the fate of these people and very likely conditions are truly terrible. The promises at Yalta to the contrary, probably 8 to 10 million people are being enslaved\\".[citation needed]\\r\\nThe antagonism between the Soviet Union and the West that came to be described as the \\"iron curtain\\" had various origins.\\r\\nDuring the summer of 1939, after conducting negotiations both with a British-French group and with Nazi Germany regarding potential military and political agreements,[26] the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany signed the GermanÿSoviet Commercial Agreement (which provided for the trade of certain German military and civilian equipment in exchange for Soviet raw materials)[27][28] and the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact (signed in late August 1939), named after the foreign secretaries of the two countries (Vyacheslav Molotov and Joachim von Ribbentrop), which included a secret agreement to split Poland and Eastern Europe between the two states.[29][30]\\r\\nThe Soviets thereafter occupied Eastern Poland (September 1939), Latvia (June 1940), Lithuania (1940), northern Romania (Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina, late June 1940), Estonia (1940) and eastern Finland (March 1940). From August 1939, relations between the West and the Soviets deteriorated further when the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany engaged in an extensive economic relationship by which the Soviet Union sent Germany vital oil, rubber, manganese and other materials in exchange for German weapons, manufacturing machinery and technology.[31][32] Nazi-Soviet trade ended in June 1941 when Germany broke the Pact and invaded the Soviet Union in Operation Barbarossa.\\r\\nIn the course of World War II, Stalin determined[citation needed] to acquire a buffer area against Germany, with pro-Soviet states on its border in an Eastern bloc. Stalin's aims led to strained relations at the Yalta Conference (February 1945) and the subsequent Potsdam Conference (August 1945).[33] People in the West expressed opposition to Soviet domination over the buffer states, and the fear grew that the Soviets were building an empire that might be a threat to them and their interests.\\r\\nNonetheless, at the Potsdam Conference, the Allies assigned parts of Poland, Finland, Romania, Germany, and the Balkans to Soviet control or influence. In return, Stalin promised the Western Allies that he would allow those territories the right to national self-determination. Despite Soviet cooperation during the war, these concessions left many in the West uneasy. In particular, Churchill feared that the United States might return to its pre-war isolationism, leaving the exhausted European states unable to resist Soviet demands. (President Franklin D. Roosevelt had announced at Yalta that after the defeat of Germany, U.S. forces would withdraw from Europe within two years.)[34]\\r\\nWinston Churchill's \\"Sinews of Peace\\" address of 5 March 1946, at Westminster College, used the term \\"iron curtain\\" in the context of Soviet-dominated Eastern Europe:\\r\\nFrom Stettin in the Baltic to Trieste in the Adriatic an iron curtain has descended across the Continent. Behind that line lie all the capitals of the ancient states of Central and Eastern Europe. Warsaw, Berlin, Prague, Vienna, Budapest, Belgrade, Bucharest and Sofia; all these famous cities and the populations around them lie in what I must call the Soviet sphere, and all are subject, in one form or another, not only to Soviet influence but to a very high and in some cases increasing measure of control from Moscow.[35]\\r\\nMuch of the Western public still regarded the Soviet Union as a close ally in the context of the recent defeat of Nazi Germany and of Japan. Although not well received at the time, the phrase iron curtain gained popularity as a shorthand reference to the division of Europe as the Cold War strengthened. The Iron Curtain served to keep people in and information out, and people throughout the West eventually came to accept and use the metaphor.[36]\\r\\nChurchill's \\"Sinews of Peace\\" address was to strongly criticise the Soviet Union's exclusive and secretive tension policies along with the Eastern Europe's state form, Police State (Polizeistaat). He expressed the Allied Nations' distrust of the Soviet Union after the World War II. In September that year, US-Soviet Union cooperation collapsed due to the US disavowal of the Soviet Union's opinion on the German problem in the Stuttgart Council, and then followed the announcement by US President, Harry S. Truman, of a hard line anti-Soviet, anticommunist policy. After that the phrase became more widely used as anti-Soviet term in the West.[37]\\r\\nIn addition, Churchill mentioned in his speech that regions under the Soviet Union's control were expanding their leverage and power without any restriction. He asserted that in order to put a brake on this ongoing phenomenon, the commanding force of and strong unity between the UK and the US was necessary.[38]\\r\\nStalin took note of Churchill's speech and responded in Pravda soon afterward. He accused Churchill of warmongering, and defended Soviet \\"friendship\\" with eastern European states as a necessary safeguard against another invasion. He further accused Churchill of hoping to install right-wing governments in eastern Europe with the goal of agitating those states against the Soviet Union.[39] Andrei Zhdanov, Stalin's chief propagandist, used the term against the West in an August 1946 speech:[40]\\r\\nHard as bourgeois politicians and writers may strive to conceal the truth of the achievements of the Soviet order and Soviet culture, hard as they may strive to erect an iron curtain to keep the truth about the Soviet Union from penetrating abroad, hard as they may strive to belittle the genuine growth and scope of Soviet culture, all their efforts are foredoomed to failure.\\r\\nWhile the Iron Curtain remained in place, much of Eastern Europe and parts of Central Europe (except West Germany, Liechtenstein, Switzerland and Austria) found themselves under the hegemony of the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union annexed:\\r\\nas Soviet Socialist Republics within the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics.\\r\\nGermany effectively gave Moscow a free hand in much of these territories in the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact of 1939, signed before Germany invaded the Soviet Union in 1941.\\r\\nOther Soviet-annexed territories included:\\r\\nBetween 1945 and 1949 the Soviets converted the following areas into Soviet satellite states:\\r\\nSoviet-installed governments ruled the Eastern Bloc countries, with the exception of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, which retained its full independence.\\r\\nThe majority of European states to the east of the Iron Curtain developed their own international economic and military alliances, such as COMECON and the Warsaw Pact.\\r\\nTo the west of the Iron Curtain, the countries of Western Europe, Northern Europe and Southern Europe ÿ along with Austria, West Germany, Liechtenstein and Switzerland ÿ operated market economies. With the exception of a period of fascism in Spain (until 1975) and Portugal (until 1974) and a military dictatorship in Greece (1967ÿ1974), democratic governments ruled these countries.\\r\\nMost of the states of Europe to the west of the Iron Curtain ÿ with the exception of neutral Switzerland, Liechtenstein, Austria, Sweden, Finland, Malta and Republic of Ireland ÿ allied themselves with the United States and Canada within NATO. Economically, the European Community and the European Free Trade Association represented Western counterparts to COMECON. Most of the nominally neutral states were economically closer to the United States than they were to the Warsaw Pact.[citation needed]\\r\\nIn January 1947 Harry Truman appointed General George Marshall as Secretary of State, scrapped Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) directive 1067 (which embodied the Morgenthau Plan) and supplanted it with JCS 1779, which decreed that an orderly and prosperous Europe requires the economic contributions of a stable and productive Germany.\\"[51] Administration officials met with Soviet Foreign Minister Vyacheslav Molotov and others to press for an economically self-sufficient Germany, including a detailed accounting of the industrial plants, goods and infrastructure already removed by the Soviets.[52]\\r\\nAfter five and a half weeks of negotiations, Molotov refused the demands and the talks were adjourned.[52] Marshall was particularly discouraged after personally meeting with Stalin, who expressed little interest in a solution to German economic problems.[52] The United States concluded that a solution could not wait any longer.[52] In a 5 June 1947 speech,[53] Marshall announced a comprehensive program of American assistance to all European countries wanting to participate, including the Soviet Union and those of Eastern Europe, called the Marshall Plan.[52]\\r\\nStalin opposed the Marshall Plan. He had built up the Eastern Bloc protective belt of Soviet controlled nations on his Western border,[54] and wanted to maintain this buffer zone of states combined with a weakened Germany under Soviet control.[55] Fearing American political, cultural and economic penetration, Stalin eventually forbade Soviet Eastern bloc countries of the newly formed Cominform from accepting Marshall Plan aid.[52] In Czechoslovakia, that required a Soviet-backed Czechoslovak coup d'tat of 1948,[56] the brutality of which shocked Western powers more than any event so far and set in a motion a brief scare that war would occur and swept away the last vestiges of opposition to the Marshall Plan in the United States Congress.[57]\\r\\nRelations further deteriorated when, in January 1948, the U.S. State Department also published a collection of documents titled Nazi-Soviet Relations, 1939 ÿ 1941: Documents from the Archives of The German Foreign Office, which contained documents recovered from the Foreign Office of Nazi Germany[58][59] revealing Soviet conversations with Germany regarding the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, including its secret protocol dividing eastern Europe,[60][61] the 1939 German-Soviet Commercial Agreement,[60][62] and discussions of the Soviet Union potentially becoming the fourth Axis Power.[63] In response, one month later, the Soviet Union published Falsifiers of History, a Stalin-edited and partially re-written book attacking the West.[58][64]\\r\\nAfter the Marshall Plan, the introduction of a new currency to Western Germany to replace the debased Reichsmark and massive electoral losses for communist parties, in June 1948, the Soviet Union cut off surface road access to Berlin, initiating the Berlin Blockade, which cut off all non-Soviet food, water and other supplies for the citizens of the non-Soviet sectors of Berlin.[65] Because Berlin was located within the Soviet-occupied zone of Germany, the only available methods of supplying the city were three limited air corridors.[66] A massive aerial supply campaign was initiated by the United States, Britain, France and other countries, the success of which caused the Soviets to lift their blockade in May 1949.\\r\\nOne of the conclusions of the Yalta Conference was that the western Allies would return all Soviet citizens who found themselves in their zones to the Soviet Union.[67] This affected the liberated Soviet prisoners of war (branded as traitors), forced laborers, anti-Soviet collaborators with the Germans, and anti-communist refugees.[68]\\r\\nMigration from east to west of the Iron Curtain, except under limited circumstances, was effectively halted after 1950. Before 1950, over 15 million people (mainly ethnic Germans) emigrated from Soviet-occupied eastern European countries to the west in the five years immediately following World War II.[69] However, restrictions implemented during the Cold War stopped most East-West migration, with only 13.3 million migrations westward between 1950 and 1990.[70] More than 75% of those emigrating from Eastern Bloc countries between 1950 and 1990 did so under bilateral agreements for \\"ethnic migration.\\"[70]\\r\\nAbout 10% were refugees permitted to emigrate under the Geneva Convention of 1951.[70] Most Soviets allowed to leave during this time period were ethnic Jews permitted to emigrate to Israel after a series of embarrassing defections in 1970 caused the Soviets to open very limited ethnic emigrations.[71] The fall of the Iron Curtain was accompanied by a massive rise in European East-West migration.[70]\\r\\nThe Iron Curtain took physical shape in the form of border defenses between the countries of western and eastern Europe. These were some of the most heavily militarised areas in the world, particularly the so-called \\"inner German border\\" ÿ commonly known as die Grenze in German ÿ between East and West Germany. The inner German border was marked in rural areas by double fences made of steel mesh (expanded metal) with sharp edges, while near urban areas a high concrete barrier similar to the Berlin Wall was built. The installation of the Wall in 1961 brought an end to a decade during which the divided capital of divided Germany was one of the easiest places to move west across the Iron Curtain.[72]\\r\\nThe barrier was always a short distance inside East German territory to avoid any intrusion into Western territory. The actual borderline was marked by posts and signs and was overlooked by numerous watchtowers set behind the barrier. The strip of land on the West German side of the barrier ÿ between the actual borderline and the barrier ÿ was readily accessible but only at considerable personal risk, because it was patrolled by both East and West German border guards.\\r\\nSeveral villages, many historic, were destroyed as they lay too close to the border, for example Erlebach. Shooting incidents were not uncommon, and a total of 28 East German border guards and several hundred civilians were killed between 1948 ÿ 1981 (some may have been victims of \\"friendly fire\\" by their own side).\\r\\nElsewhere along the border between West and East, the defense works resembled those on the intra-German border. During the Cold War, the border zone in Hungary started 15 kilometres (9.3?mi) from the border. Citizens could only enter the area if they lived in the zone or had a passport valid for traveling out. Traffic control points and patrols enforced this regulation.\\r\\nThose who lived within the 15 kilometres (9.3?mi) border-zone needed special permission to enter the area within 5 kilometres (3.1?mi) of the border. The area was very difficult to approach and heavily fortified. In the 1950s and 1960s, a double barbed-wire fence was installed 50 metres (160?ft) from the border. The space between the two fences were laden with land mines. The minefield was later replaced with an electric signal fence (about 1 kilometre (0.62?mi) from the border) and a barbed wire fence, along with guard towers and a sand strip to track border violations.\\r\\nRegular patrols sought to prevent escape attempts. They included cars and mounted units. Guards and dog patrol units watched the border 24/7 and were authorised to use their weapons to stop escapees. The wire fence nearest the actual border was irregularly displaced from the actual border, which was marked only by stones. Anyone attempting to escape would have to cross up to 400 metres (1,300?ft) before they could cross the actual border. Several escape attempts failed when the escapees were stopped after crossing the outer fence.\\r\\nIn parts of Czechoslovakia, the border strip became hundreds of meters wide, and an area of increasing restrictions was defined as the border was approached. Only people with the appropriate government permissions were allowed to get close to the border.\\r\\nThe Soviet Union built a fence along the entire border to Norway and Finland. It is located one or a few kilometres from the border, and has automatic alarms detecting if someone climbs over it.\\r\\nIn Greece, a highly militarised area called the \\"?ך ?\\" (\\"Surveillance Area\\") was created by the Greek Army along the Greek-Bulgarian border, subject to significant security-related regulations and restrictions. Inhabitants within this 25?km wide strip of land were forbidden to drive cars, own land bigger than 60 m2 and had to travel within the area with a special passport issued by Greek military authorities. Additionally, the Greek state used this area to encapsulate and monitor a non-Greek ethnic minority, the Pomaks, a Muslim and Bulgarian-speaking minority which was regarded as hostile to the interests of the Greek state during the Cold War because of its familiarity with their fellow Pomaks living on the other side of the Iron Curtain.[73]\\r\\nThe Hungarian outer fence became the first part of the Iron Curtain to be dismantled. After the border fortifications were dismantled, a section was rebuilt for a formal ceremony. On 27 June 1989, the foreign ministers of Austria and Hungary, Alois Mock and Gyula Horn, ceremonially cut through the border defences separating their countries.\\r\\nThe creation of these highly militarised no-man's lands led to de facto nature reserves and created a wildlife corridor across Europe; this helped the spread of several species to new territories. Since the fall of the Iron Curtain, several initiatives are pursuing the creation of a European Green Belt nature preserve area along the Iron Curtain's former route. In fact, a long-distance cycling route along the length of the former border called the Iron Curtain Trail (ICT) exists as a project of the European Union and other associated nations. The trail is 6,800?km (4,200?mi) long and spans from Finland to Greece.[74]\\r\\nThe term \\"Iron Curtain\\" was only used for the fortified borders in Europe; it was not used for similar borders in Asia between communist and capitalist states (these were, for a time, dubbed the Bamboo Curtain). The border between North Korea and South Korea is very comparable to the former inner German border, particularly in its degree of militarisation, but it has never conventionally been considered part of any Iron Curtain.\\r\\nFollowing a period of economic and political stagnation under Brezhnev and his immediate successors, the Soviet Union decreased its intervention in Eastern Bloc politics. Mikhail Gorbachev (General Secretary from 1985) decreased adherence to the Brezhnev Doctrine,[75] which held that if socialism were threatened in any state then other socialist governments had an obligation to intervene to preserve it, in favor of the \\"Sinatra Doctrine\\". He also initiated the policies of glasnost (openness) and perestroika (economic restructuring). A wave of Revolutions occurred throughout the Eastern Bloc in 1989.[76]\\r\\nIn April 1989 the People's Republic of Poland legalised the Solidarity organisation, which captured 99% of available parliamentary seats in June.[77] These elections, in which anti-communist candidates won a striking victory, inaugurated a series of peaceful anti-communist revolutions in Central and Eastern Europe[78][79][80] that eventually culminated in the fall of communism.[81][82]\\r\\nOn 19 August 1989, more than 600 East Germans attending the \\"Pan-European Picnic\\" on the Hungarian border broke through the Iron Curtain and fled into Austria. Hungarian border guards had threatened to shoot anyone crossing the border, but when the time came, they did not intervene and allowed the people to cross. In a historic session from 16 to 20 October, the Hungarian parliament adopted legislation providing for multi-party parliamentary elections and a direct presidential election.[83]\\r\\nThe legislation transformed Hungary from a People's Republic into the Republic of Hungary, guaranteed human and civil rights, and created an institutional structure that ensured separation of powers among the judicial, legislative, and executive branches of government. In November 1989, following mass protests in East Germany and the relaxing of border restrictions in Czechoslovakia, tens of thousands of East Berliners flooded checkpoints along the Berlin Wall, crossing into West Berlin.[83]\\r\\nIn the People's Republic of Bulgaria, the day after the mass crossings across the Berlin Wall, leader Todor Zhivkov was ousted.[84] In the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic, following protests of an estimated half-million Czechoslovaks, the government permitted travel to the west and abolished provisions guaranteeing the ruling Communist party its leading role, preceding the Velvet Revolution.[85]\\r\\nIn the Socialist Republic of Romania, on 22 December 1989, the Romanian military sided with protesters and turned on Communist ruler Nicolae Ceau?escu, who was executed after a brief trial three days later.[86] In the People's Socialist Republic of Albania, a new package of regulations went into effect on 3 July 1990 entitling all Albanians over the age of 16 to own a passport for foreign travel. Meanwhile, hundreds of Albanian citizens gathered around foreign embassies to seek political asylum and flee the country.\\r\\nThe Berlin Wall officially remained guarded after 9 November 1989, although the inter-German border had become effectively meaningless. The official dismantling of the Wall by the East German military did not begin until June 1990. In July 1990, the day East Germany adopted the West German currency, all border-controls ceased and West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl convinced Gorbachev to drop Soviet objections to a reunited Germany within NATO in return for substantial German economic aid to the Soviet Union.\\r\\nThere is an Iron Curtain monument in the southern part of the Czech Republic at approximately 485232N 155229E? / ?48.8755N 15.87477E? / 48.8755; 15.87477? (Iron Curtain monument). A few hundred meters of the original fence, and one of the guard towers, has remained installed. There are interpretive signs in Czech and English that explain the history and significance of the Iron Curtain. This is the only surviving part of the fence in the Czech Republic, though several guard towers and bunkers can still be seen. Some of these are part of the Communist Era defences, some are from the never-used Czechoslovak border fortifications in defence against Adolf Hitler, and some towers were, or have become, hunting platforms.\\r\\nAnother monument is located in Fert?rkos, Hungary, at the site of the Pan-European Picnic. On the eastern hill of the stone quarry stands a metal sculpture by Gabriela von Habsburg. It is a column made of metal and barbed wire with the date of the Pan-European Picnic and the names of participants. On the ribbon under the board is the Latin text: \\"In necessariis unitas ÿ in dubiis libertas ÿ in omnibus caritas.\\" (Unity in unavoidable matters ÿ freedom in doubtful matters ÿ love in all things.) The memorial symbolises the iron curtain and recalls forever the memories of the border breakthrough in 1989.\\r\\nAnother monument is located in the village of Devn, now part of Bratislava, Slovakia, at the confluence of the Danube and Morava rivers. Another monument is located in Fert?rkos, Hungary, at the site of the Pan-European Picnic. On the eastern hill of the stone quarry stands a metal sculpture by Gabriela von Habsburg. It is a column made of metal and barbed wire with the date of the Pan-European Picnic and the names of participants. On the ribbon under the board is the Latin text: \\"In necessariis unitas ÿ in dubiis libertas ÿ in omnibus caritas.\\" (Unity in unavoidable matters ÿ freedom in doubtful matters ÿ love in all things.) The memorial symbolises the iron curtain and recalls forever the memories of the border breakthrough in 1989.\\r\\nThere are several open air museums in parts of the former inner German border, as for example in Berlin and in M?dlareuth, a village that has been divided for several hundred years. The memory of the division is being kept alive in many other places along the Grenze.\\r\\nThroughout the Cold War the term \\"curtain\\" would become a common euphemism for boundaries ÿ physical or ideological ÿ between communist and capitalist states.\\r\\nPost Cold War:\\r\\nGeography:","input":"What country was divided by the iron curtain?"},{"output":"Farhad Moshiri","context":"Everton Football Club (/??v?rt?n/) is a football club in Liverpool, England, that competes in the Premier League, the top flight of English football. The club have competed in the top division for a record 114 seasons, missing the top division only four times (1930ÿ31 and three consecutive seasons starting with 1951ÿ52) since The Football League was created in 1888. Everton have won 15 major trophies: the League Championship nine times (fourth most as of 2017ÿ18), the FA Cup five times (ninth most) and the UEFA Cup Winners Cup once.\\r\\nFormed in 1878, Everton were founding members of The Football League in 1888 and won their first League Championship two seasons later. Following four League Championship and two FA Cup wins, Everton experienced a lull in the immediate post World War Two period, until a revival in the 1960s, which saw the club win two League Championships and an FA Cup. The mid-1980s represented their most recent period of sustained success, with two League Championships, an FA Cup, and the 1985 European Cup Winners' Cup. The club's most recent major trophy was the 1995 FA Cup.\\r\\nThe club's supporters are known as Evertonians. Everton have a rivalry with neighbours Liverpool, and the two sides contest the Merseyside derby. The club has been based at Goodison Park in Walton, Liverpool, since 1892, after moving from Anfield following a row over its rent. The club's home colours are royal blue shirts with white shorts and socks.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nEverton were founded as St Domingo FC in 1878[2][3] so that members of the congregation of St Domingo Methodist New Connexion Chapel in Breckfield Road North, Everton could play sport year round?ÿ cricket was played in summer. The club's first game was a 1ÿ0 victory over Everton Church Club.[4] The club was renamed Everton in November 1879 after the local area, as people outside the congregation wished to participate.[4][5]\\r\\nThe club was a founding member of the Football League in 1888ÿ89 and won their first League Championship title in the 1890ÿ91 season. Everton won the FA Cup for the first time in 1906 and the League Championship again in 1914ÿ15. The outbreak of the First World War in 1914 interrupted the football programme while Everton were champions, which was something that would again occur in 1939.[6][7]\\r\\nIt was not until 1927 that Everton's first sustained period of success began. In 1925 the club signed Dixie Dean from Tranmere Rovers. In 1927ÿ28, Dean set the record for top-flight league goals in a single season with 60 goals in 39 league games, which is a record that still stands. He helped Everton win their third League Championship that season.[8] However, Everton were relegated to the Second Division two years later during internal turmoil at the club. The club quickly rebounded and was promoted at the first attempt, while scoring a record number of goals in the Second Division. On return to the top flight in 1931ÿ32, Everton wasted no time in reaffirming their status and won a fourth League Championship at the first opportunity. Everton also won their second FA Cup in 1933 with a 3ÿ0 win against Manchester City in the final. The era ended in 1938ÿ39 with a fifth League Championship.[9][10]\\r\\nThe outbreak of the Second World War again saw the suspension of league football, and when official competition resumed in 1946, the Everton team had been split up and paled in comparison to the pre-war team. Everton were relegated for the second time in 1950ÿ51 and did not earn promotion until 1953ÿ54, when they finished as runners-up in their third season in the Second Division. The club have been a top-flight presence ever since.[11]\\r\\nEverton's second successful era started when Harry Catterick was made manager in 1961. In 1962ÿ63, his second season in charge, Everton won the League Championship.[12] In 1966 the club won the FA Cup with a 3ÿ2 win over Sheffield Wednesday.[13] Everton again reached the final in 1968, but this time were unable to overcome West Bromwich Albion at Wembley.[14] Two seasons later in 1969ÿ70, Everton won the League Championship, finishing nine points clear of nearest rivals Leeds United.[15] During this period, Everton were the first English club to achieve five consecutive years in European competitions ÿ covering the seasons from 1961ÿ62 to 1966ÿ67.[16]\\r\\nHowever, the success did not last; the team finished fourteenth, fifteenth, seventeenth and seventh in the following seasons. Harry Catterick retired, but his successors failed to win any silverware for the remainder of the 1970s despite finishing fourth in 1974ÿ75 under manager Billy Bingham, third in 1977ÿ78 and fourth the following season under manager Gordon Lee. Lee was sacked in 1981.[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nHoward Kendall took over as manager and guided Everton to their most successful era. Domestically, Everton won the FA Cup in 1984 and two League Championships in 1984ÿ85 and 1986ÿ87. In Europe, the club won its first, and so far only, European trophy by securing the European Cup Winners' Cup in 1985.[18] The European success came after first beating University College Dublin, Inter Bratislava and Fortuna Sittard. Then, Everton defeated German giants Bayern Munich 3ÿ1 in the semi-finals, despite trailing at half time (in a match voted the greatest in Goodison Park history), and recorded the same scoreline over Austrian club Rapid Vienna in the final.[19] Having won both the League and Cup Winners' Cup in 1985, Everton came very close to winning a treble, but lost to Manchester United in the FA Cup final.[18] The following season, 1985ÿ86, Everton were runners-up to neighbours Liverpool in both the League and the FA Cup, but did recapture the League Championship in 1986ÿ87.\\r\\nAfter the Heysel Stadium disaster and the subsequent ban of all English clubs from continental football, Everton lost the chance to compete for more European trophies. A large proportion of the title-winning side was broken up following the ban. Kendall himself moved to Athletic Bilbao after the 1987 title triumph and was succeeded by assistant Colin Harvey. Harvey took Everton to the 1989 FA Cup Final, but lost 3ÿ2 after extra time to Liverpool.\\r\\nEverton were founding members of the Premier League in 1992, but struggled to find the right manager. Howard Kendall had returned in 1990, but could not repeat his previous success. His successor, Mike Walker, was statistically the least successful Everton manager to date. When former Everton player Joe Royle took over in 1994, the club's form started to improve; his first game in charge was a 2ÿ0 victory over derby rivals Liverpool. Royle dragged Everton clear of relegation and led the club to the FA Cup for the fifth time in its history by defeating Manchester United 1ÿ0 in the final. The cup triumph was also Everton's passport to the Cup Winners' Cup ÿ their first European campaign in the post-Heysel era. Progress under Royle continued in 1995ÿ96 as they climbed to sixth place in the Premiership.[18] A fifteenth-place finish the following season saw Royle resign towards the end of the campaign, and he was temporarily replaced by club captain Dave Watson.\\r\\nHoward Kendall was appointed Everton manager for the third time in 1997, but the appointment proved unsuccessful as Everton finished seventeenth in the Premiership. The club only avoided relegation due to their superior goal difference over Bolton Wanderers. Former Rangers manager Walter Smith then took over from Kendall in the summer of 1998, but only managed three successive finishes in the bottom half of the table.[18] The Everton board finally ran out of patience with Smith, and he was sacked in March 2002 after an FA Cup exit at Middlesbrough and with Everton in real danger of relegation.[20] His replacement, David Moyes, guided Everton to a safe finish in fifteenth place.[21][22]\\r\\nIn 2002ÿ03 Everton finished seventh, which was their highest finish since 1996. It was under Moyes' management that Wayne Rooney broke into the first team before being sold to Manchester United for a club record fee of S28?million in the summer of 2004.[23] A fourth-place finish in 2004ÿ05 ensured that Everton qualified for the UEFA Champions League qualifying round. The team failed to make it through to the Champions League group stage and were then eliminated from the UEFA Cup. Everton qualified for the 2007ÿ08[24] and 2008ÿ09 UEFA Cup competitions, and they were runners-up in the 2009 FA Cup Final. During this period, Moyes broke the club record for highest transfer fee paid on four occasions: signing James Beattie for S6?million in January 2005,[25] Andy Johnson for S8.6?million in summer 2006,[25] Yakubu for S11.25?million in summer 2007,[26] and Marouane Fellaini for S15?million in September 2008.[27]\\r\\nAt the end of the 2012ÿ13 season, Moyes left his position at Everton to take over at Manchester United. He was replaced by Roberto Martnez,[28] who led Everton to 5th place in the Premier League in his first season while amassing the club's best points tally in 27 years with 72.[29] The following season, Martnez led Everton to the last 16 of the 2014-15 UEFA Europa League, where they were defeated by Dynamo Kyiv,[30] whilst domestically finishing 11th in the Premier League. Everton reached the semi-finals of both the League Cup and the FA Cup in 2015ÿ16, but were defeated in both. After a poor run of form in the Premier League, Martnez was sacked following the penultimate game of the season, with Everton lying in 12th place.[31]\\r\\nMartnez was replaced in the summer of 2016 by Ronald Koeman, who left Southampton to sign a 3-year contract with Everton.[32] In his first season at the club he guided them back into the group stages of the Europa League, after finishing 7th. A poor start to the following season left Everton in the relegation zone after nine games, and Koeman was sacked on 23 October following a 5ÿ2 home defeat to Arsenal.[33] After a five-week period with David Unsworth acting as caretaker manager, Sam Allardyce was appointed as Everton manager in November 2017,[34] but he was sacked at the end of the season amid fan discontent at his style of play.[35] Marco Silva was named Everton manager in May 2018.[36]\\r\\nEverton's traditional home colours are royal blue shirts, white shorts and white socks. However, during the first decades of their history, Everton had several different kit colours. The team originally played in white and then blue and white stripes, but as new players arriving at the club wore their old team's shirts during matches, confusion soon ensued. It was decided that the shirts would be dyed black, both to save on expenses and to instill a more professional look. However, the kit appeared morbid, so a scarlet sash was added.[37] When the club moved to Goodison Park in 1892, the colours were salmon pink and dark blue striped shirts with dark blue shorts. The club later switched to ruby shirts with blue trim and dark blue shorts. Royal blue jerseys with white shorts were first used in the 1901ÿ02 season.[37] The club played in sky blue in 1906; however, the fans protested, and the colour reverted to royal blue. Occasionally, Everton have played in lighter shades than royal blue (such as in 1930ÿ31 and 1997ÿ98).[38] The home kit today is royal blue shirts with white shorts and socks. The club may also wear all blue to avoid any colour clashes. The home goalkeeper attire for the 2014ÿ15 season was all yellow.\\r\\nEverton's traditional away colours were white shirts with black shorts, but from 1968 amber shirts and royal blue shorts became common. Various editions appeared throughout the 1970s and 1980s. Recently, black, white, grey and yellow away shirts have been used. The away shirt for the 2011ÿ12 season was reverted to an amber shirt with navy blue shorts.[39] The current away kit is a black shirt with an orange collar, while their third kit is a yellow shirt with blue trim.\\r\\nAt the end of the 1937ÿ38 season, Everton secretary Theo Kelly, who later became the club's first manager, wanted to design a club necktie. It was agreed that the colour be blue, and Kelly was given the task of designing a crest to be featured on the necktie. He worked on it for four months until deciding on a reproduction of Everton Lock-Up, which stands in the heart of the Everton district.[40] The Lock-Up has been inextricably linked with the Everton area since its construction in 1787. It was originally used as a bridewell to incarcerate mainly drunks and minor criminals, and it still stands today on Everton Brow. The Lock-Up was accompanied by two laurel wreaths on either side and, according to the College of Arms in London, Kelly chose to include the laurels as they were the sign of winners. The crest was accompanied by the club motto, \\"Nil Satis Nisi Optimum\\", meaning \\"Nothing but the best is good enough\\".[40] The ties were first worn by Kelly and the Everton chairman, Mr. E. Green, on the first day of the 1938ÿ39 season.[40]\\r\\nThe club rarely incorporated a badge of any description on its shirts. An interwoven \\"EFC\\" design was adopted between 1922 and 1930 before the club reverted to plain royal blue shirts until 1972 when bold \\"EFC\\" lettering was added. The crest designed by Kelly was first used on the team's shirts in 1978 and has remained there ever since, while undergoing gradual change to become the version used today.\\r\\nIn May 2013, the club launched a new crest to improve the reproducibility of the design in print and broadcast media, particularly on a small scale.[41] Critics[who?] suggested that it was external pressure from sports manufacturer Nike, Inc. that evoked the redesign as the number of colours had been reduced and the radial effect was removed, which made the kit more cost efficient to reproduce.[citation needed] The redesign was poorly received by supporters, with a poll on an Everton fan site registering a 91% negative response to the crest.[42] A protest petition reached over 22,000 signatures before the club offered an apology and announced a new crest would be created for the 2014ÿ15 season with an emphasis on fan consultation. Shortly afterwards, the Head of Marketing left the club. The latest crest was revealed by the club on 3 October 2013. After a consultation process with the supporters, three new crests were shortlisted. In the final vote, the new crest was chosen by almost 80% of the supporters that took part[43][44] and began being used in July 2014.[45]\\r\\nMonochrome Everton crest (2000ÿ13)\\r\\n2013ÿ14 season crest\\r\\nCurrent crest - 2014ÿ15 season onwards.\\r\\nEverton's most widely recognised nickname \\"The Toffees\\" or \\"The Toffeemen\\", which came about after Everton had moved to Goodison. There are several explanations for how this name came to be adopted with the best known being that there was a business in Everton village, between Everton Brow and Brow Side, named Mother Noblett's, which was a toffee shop that sold sweets including the Everton Mint. It was also located opposite the lock up which Everton's club crest is based on. The Toffee Lady tradition in which a girl walks around the perimeter of the pitch before the start of a game tossing free Everton Mints into the crowd symbolises the connection. Another possible reason is that there was a house named Ye Anciente Everton Toffee House in nearby Village Street, Everton, run by Ma Bushell. The toffee house was located near the Queen's Head hotel in which early club meetings took place.[46]\\r\\nEverton have had many other nicknames over the years. When the black kit was worn, Everton were nicknamed \\"The Black Watch\\" after the famous army regiment.[47] Since going blue in 1901, Everton have been given the simple nickname \\"The Blues\\". Everton's attractive style of play led to Steve Bloomer calling the team \\"scientific\\" in 1928, which is thought to have inspired the nickname \\"The School of Science\\".[48] The battling 1995 FA Cup winning side were known as \\"The Dogs of War\\". When David Moyes arrived as manager, he proclaimed Everton as \\"The People's Club\\", which has been adopted as a semi-official club nickname.[49]\\r\\nEverton originally played in the southeast corner of Stanley Park. The first official match took place in 1879. In 1882, a man named J. Cruitt donated land at Priory Road which became the club's home. In 1884 Everton became tenants at Anfield, which was owned by John Orrell, a land owner who was a friend of Everton F.C. member John Houlding. Orrell lent Anfield to the club in exchange for a small rent. Houlding purchased the land from Orrell in 1885 and effectively became Everton's landlord by charging the club rent, which increased from S100 to S240 a year by 1888 ÿ and was still rising until Everton left the ground in 1892.[50][51] The club regarded the increase in rent as unacceptable.[51] A further dispute between Houlding and the club's committee led to Houlding attempting to gain full control of the club by registering the company, \\"Everton F.C. and Athletic Grounds Ltd\\". Everton left Anfield for a new ground, Goodison Park, where the club have played ever since. Houlding attempted to take over Everton's name, colours, fixtures and league position, but was denied by The Football Association. Instead, Houlding formed a new club, Liverpool F.C.[52]\\r\\nGoodison Park, the first major football stadium to be built in England, was opened in 1892.[53] Goodison Park has staged more top-flight football games than any other ground in the United Kingdom and was the only English club ground to host a semi-final at the 1966 FIFA World Cup. It was also the first English ground to have under soil heating and the first to have two tiers on all sides. The church grounds of St Luke the Evangelist are adjacent to the corner of the Main Stand and the Howard Kendall Gwladys Street End.[54]\\r\\nOn match days, in a tradition going back to 1962, players walk out to the theme song for Z-Cars, which is named \\"Johnny Todd\\".[55] It is a traditional Liverpool children's song collected in 1890 by Frank Kidson and tells the story of a sailor betrayed by his lover while away at sea.[56] On two separate occasions in 1994, the club walked out to different songs. In August 1994, the club played 2 Unlimited's song \\"Get Ready For This\\". A month later, the club used a reworking of the Creedence Clearwater Revival classic \\"Bad Moon Rising\\". Both songs were met with complete disapproval by Everton fans.[57]\\r\\nFrom 1966 to 2007, Everton trained at Bellefield in the West Derby area of Liverpool.[58] They moved to the Finch Farm training complex in Halewood in 2007. The training ground houses both the Everton first team and the youth academy.\\r\\nThere have been indications since 1996 that Everton will move to a new stadium. The original plan was for a new 60,000 seat stadium, but in 2000 a proposal was submitted to build a 55,000 seat stadium as part of the King's Dock regeneration. This proposal was unsuccessful as Everton failed to generate the S30?million needed for a half stake in the stadium project, and the city council rejected the proposal in 2003.[59] Late in 2004, driven by the Liverpool Council and the Northwest Development Corporation, the club entered talks with Liverpool F.C. about sharing a proposed stadium on Stanley Park. However, negotiations broke down as Everton failed to raise 50% of the costs.[60] On 11 January 2005, Liverpool announced that ground-sharing was not a possibility and proceeded to plan their own Stanley Park Stadium.[61]\\r\\nEverton entered into talks with the Knowsley Council and Tesco in June 2006 over the possibility of building a new 55,000 seat stadium, expandable to over 60,000, in Kirkby.[62] The plan became known as The Kirkby Project. The club took the unusual move of giving its supporters a say in the club's future by holding a ballot on the proposal with the results being in favour of it, 59% to 41%.[63] Opponents to the plan included other local councils concerned by the effect of a large Tesco store being built as part of the development and a group of fans demanding that Everton should remain within the city boundaries of Liverpool.[63] Following a public inquiry into the project,[64] the central government rejected the proposal.[65] Local and regional politicians attempted to put together an amended rescue plan with the Liverpool City Council calling a meeting with Everton F.C. The plan was to assess some suitable sites short listed within the city boundary.[66][67] However, the amended plan was also not successful.\\r\\nThe Liverpool City Council Regeneration and Transport Select Committee meeting on 10 February 2011 featured a proposal to open the Bootle Branch line using \\"Liverpool Football Club and Everton Football Club as priorities, as economic enablers of the project\\".[68] This proposal would place both football clubs on a rapid transit Merseyrail line that would circle the city and ease transport access. In September 2014 the club, working with the Liverpool City Council and Liverpool Mutual Homes, outlined initial plans to build a new stadium in Walton Hall Park.[69] However, those plans were later scrapped in May 2016 with the prospect of two new sites being identified for the club.[70] At the Annual General Meeting in January 2017, the chairman, Bill Kenwright revealed that Bramley-Moore Dock was the preferred site for the new stadium, with a new railway station and a new road being funded by the City Council.[71]\\r\\nEverton have a large fanbase, with the eighth highest average attendance in the Premier League in the 2008ÿ09 season.[72] The majority of Everton's matchday support comes from the North West of England, primarily Merseyside, Cheshire, West Lancashire and parts of Western Greater Manchester along with many fans who travel from North Wales and Ireland. Within the city of Liverpool, support for Everton and city rivals Liverpool is not determined by geographical basis with supporters mixed across the city. Everton also have many supporters' clubs worldwide[73] in places such as North America,[74] Singapore,[75] Indonesia, Lebanon, Malaysia,[76] Thailand and Australia.[77][78] The official supporters club is FOREVERTON,[79] and there are also several fanzines including When Skies are Grey and Speke from the Harbour, which are sold around Goodison Park on match days.\\r\\nEverton regularly take large numbers away from home both domestically and in European fixtures. The club implements a loyalty points scheme offering the first opportunity to purchase away tickets to season ticket holders who have attended the most away matches. Everton often sell out the full allocation in away grounds, and tickets sell particularly well for North West England away matches. In October 2009, Everton took 7,000 travelling fans to Benfica,[80] which was their largest ever away crowd in Europe since the 1985 European Cup Winners' Cup Final.\\r\\nEverton's biggest rivalry is with neighbours Liverpool, against whom they contest the Merseyside derby. The rivalry stems from an internal dispute between Everton officials and the owners of Anfield, which was then Everton's home ground. The dispute resulted in Everton moving to Goodison Park and the subsequent formation of Liverpool F.C. in 1892. Following these events, a fierce rivalry has existed between Everton and Liverpool, albeit one that is generally perceived as more respectful than many other derbies in English football. This was illustrated by a chain of red and blue scarves that were linked between the gates of both grounds across Stanley Park as a tribute to the Liverpool fans killed in the Hillsborough disaster.[81] The derby is usually a sellout fixture and has been known as the \\"friendly derby\\" because both sets of fans can often be seen side by side dressed in red and blue inside both Anfield and Goodison Park. Recently on the field, matches tend to be extremely stormy affairs; the derby has had more red cards than any other fixture in Premiership history.[82]\\r\\nNote: Flags indicate national team as defined under FIFA eligibility rules. Players may hold more than one non-FIFA nationality.\\r\\nSee also List of Everton F.C. international players.\\r\\nThe following players are considered \\"Giants\\" for their great contributions to Everton. A panel appointed by the club established the inaugural list in 2000 and a new inductee is announced every season.[85]\\r\\nAt the start of the 2003ÿ04 season, as part of the club's official celebration of their 125th anniversary, supporters cast votes to determine the greatest ever Everton team.[86]\\r\\nA number of Everton players have been inducted into the English Football Hall of Fame:[87]\\r\\nThe Football League 100 Legends is a list of \\"100 legendary football players\\" produced by The Football League in 1998 to celebrate the 100th season of League football.[89]\\r\\nAs of 31 May 2018\\r\\nSource: uefa.com\\r\\nPld = Matches played; W = Matches won; D = Matches drawn; L = Matches lost; GF = Goals for; GA = Goals against.

The loan was a consolidation of debts at the time as well as a source of capital for new player acquisitions.[100] Goodison Park is secured as collateral. On 27 February 2016, it was announced that Farhad Moshiri would buy a 49.9% stake in the club.[101]\\r\\nFigures taken from 2013ÿ14 accounts.[102]\\r\\nCommencing in the 2017ÿ18 season, Everton's shirts are sponsored by SportPesa.[103][104] Previous sponsors include Chang Beer (2004ÿ17) Hafnia (1979ÿ85), NEC (1985ÿ95), Danka (1995ÿ97), one2one (1997ÿ2002) and Kejian (2002ÿ04). For the 2008ÿ09 season, Everton sold junior replica jerseys without the current name or logo of its main sponsor Chang beer, which followed a recommendation from the Portman Group that alcoholic brand names be removed from kits sold to children.[105] Everton's current kit manufacturers are Umbro,[106] who have been the club's kit manufacturer three times previously (1974ÿ83, 1986ÿ2000, and 2004ÿ09). Other previous manufacturing firms are Le Coq Sportif (1983ÿ86, 2009ÿ12),[107] Puma (2000ÿ04) and Nike (2012ÿ14).[108] The club currently has two 'megastores': one located near Goodison Park on Walton Lane named 'Everton One' and one located in the Liverpool One shopping complex named 'Everton Two', which gives the second store the address 'Everton Two, Liverpool One'.[109]\\r\\nThe club's current manager, Marco Silva, is the seventeenth permanent holder of the position since it was established in 1939.[110] There have also been four caretaker managers, and before 1939 the team was selected by either the club secretary or by committee. The club's longest-serving manager has been Harry Catterick, who was in charge of the team from 1961ÿ73 for 594 first team matches.[111] The Everton manager to win the most domestic and international trophies is Howard Kendall, who won two First Division championships, the 1984 FA Cup, the 1985 UEFA Cup Winners' Cup, and three FA Charity Shields.\\r\\nNeville Southall holds the record for the most Everton appearances with 751 first-team matches between 1981 and 1997. The late centre half and former captain Brian Labone comes in second with 534 matches. The longest serving player is goalkeeper Ted Sagar, who played for 23 years between 1929 and 1953. This tenure covered both sides of the Second World War and included a total of 495 appearances. Southall also previously held the record for the most league clean sheets during a season with 15. However, this record was beaten during the 2008ÿ09 season by American goalkeeper Tim Howard, who ended the season with 17 clean sheets.[112] The club's top goalscorer, with 383 goals in all competitions, is Dixie Dean; the second-highest goalscorer is Graeme Sharp with 159. Dean still holds the English national record of most goals in a season with 60.[113]\\r\\nThe record attendance for an Everton home match is 78,299 against Liverpool on 18 September 1948. Remarkably, there was only one injury at this game, which occurred when Tom Fleetwood was hit on the head by a coin thrown from the crowd whilst he marched around the perimeter and played the cornet with St Edward's Orphanage Band. Goodison Park, like all major English football grounds since the recommendations of the Taylor Report were implemented, is now an all-seater and only holds just under 40,000, meaning it is unlikely that this attendance record will ever be broken at Goodison.[113] Everton's record transfer paid was to Swansea City for the Icelandic midfielder Gylfi Siguresson for a sum of S45m in 2017.[114] The sale of Romelu Lukaku to Manchester United was for an initial sum of S75m, a record fee between two English clubs and the largest sum Everton have received for a player.\\r\\nEverton hold the record for the most seasons in England's top tier (Division One/Premier League), at 114 seasons out of 118 as of 2016ÿ17 (the club played in Division 2 in 1930ÿ31 and from 1951ÿ54). They are one of six teams to have played in every season of the Premier League since its inception in August 1992?ÿ the others being Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester United, and Tottenham Hotspur. Everton against Aston Villa is the most played fixture in England's top flight. As of the 2012ÿ13 season, the two founding members of the Football League have played a record 196 league games.[115]\\r\\nEverton's community department, Everton in the Community (EitC), is a charity that provides sports and other social activities for the local community including for people with disabilities.[116] EitC represents the club in the European Multisport Club Association.[117]\\r\\nEverton have a link with Republic of Ireland football academy Ballyoulster United based in Celbridge,[118] Canada's Ontario Soccer Association,[119] and the Football Association of Thailand where they have a competition named the Chang-Everton cup which local schoolboys compete for.[120] The club also have a football academy in Limassol, Cyprus[121] and a partnership agreement with American club Pittsburgh Riverhounds.[122][123]\\r\\nThe club also owned and operated a professional basketball team, by the name of Everton Tigers, who competed in the elite British Basketball League. The team was launched in the summer of 2007 as part of the club's Community programme and played their home games at the Greenbank Sports Academy. The team was an amalgam of the Toxteth Tigers community youth programme, which started in 1968. The team quickly became one of the most successful in the league by winning the BBL Cup in 2009 and the play-offs in 2010. However, Everton withdrew funding before the 2010ÿ11 season, and the team was re-launched as the Mersey Tigers.[124]\\r\\nEverton also have links with Chilean team Everton de Vi?a del Mar who were named after the English club.[125][126] On 4 August 2010, the two Evertons played each other in a friendly named the Copa Hermandad at Goodison Park to mark the centenary of the Chilean team.[127] The occasion was organised by The Ruleteros Society, which is a society founded to promote connections between the two clubs.[128] Other Everton clubs exist in Rosario, Colonia in Uruguay,[129] La Plata and Ro Cuarto in Argentina,[130][131] Elk Grove, California in the United States,[132] and in Cork, Ireland.[133]\\r\\nThe 1997 television film The Fix dramatised the true story of a match fixing scandal in which the club's recent newly signed wing half Tony Kay, played by Jason Isaacs, is implicated in having helped to throw a match between his previous club Sheffield Wednesday and Ipswich Town. The majority of the story is set during Everton's 1962ÿ63 League Championship winning season with then manager Harry Catterick played by Colin Welland.[134]\\r\\nFirst shown in 1969, the television movie The Golden Vision, directed by Ken Loach, combined improvised drama with documentary footage to tell of a group of Everton fans for whom the main purpose of life, following the team, is interrupted by such inconveniences as work and weddings. The film's title character, celebrated forward Alex Young, was one of several who appeared as themselves.[135]\\r\\nIn the 2015 film Creed, part of the Rocky franchise, Goodison Park features prominently and serves as the venue of climatic fight scene. Filming for this had been taken of the stadium and crowd during a match against West Bromwich Albion. Boxer Tony Bellew plays Creed's opponent Ricky Conlon and wears the Everton badge on his training gear and shorts.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe club have entered the UK pop charts on four occasions under different titles during the 1980s and 1990s when many clubs released a song to mark their reaching the FA Cup Final. \\"The Boys in Blue\\", released in 1984, peaked at number 82.[136] The following year the club scored their biggest hit when \\"Here We Go\\" peaked at 14.[137] In 1986 the club released \\"Everybody's Cheering the Blues\\" which reached number 83.[138] \\"All Together Now\\", a reworking of a song by Merseyside band The Farm, was released for the 1995 FA Cup Final and reached number 27.[139] When the club next reached the 2009 FA Cup Final, the tradition had passed into history and no song was released.","input":"Who is the owner of everton football club?"},{"output":"traditionally a calico Japanese Bobtail","context":"The maneki-neko (Japanese: NV, literally \\"beckoning cat\\") is a common Japanese figurine (lucky charm, talisman) which is often believed to bring good luck to the owner. In modern times, they are usually made of ceramic or plastic. The figurine depicts a cat (traditionally a calico Japanese Bobtail) beckoning with an upright paw, and is usually displayed inoften at the entrance ofshops, restaurants, pachinko parlors, and other businesses. Some of the sculptures are electric or battery-powered and have a slow-moving paw beckoning.\\r\\nManeki-neko comes in different colors, styles and degrees of ornateness. Common colors are white, black, gold and sometimes red. In addition to ceramic figurines, maneki-neko can be found as keychains, piggy banks, air fresheners, house-plant pots, and miscellaneous ornaments, as well as large statues. It is also sometimes called the \\"Chinese lucky cat\\" because of its popularity among Chinese merchants.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTo some Westerners (Italians and Spaniards are notable exceptions) it may seem as if the maneki-neko is waving rather than beckoning.[1][2] This is due to the difference in gestures and body language recognized by some Westerners and the Japanese. The Japanese beckoning gesture is made by holding up the hand, palm down, and repeatedly folding the fingers down and back, thus the cat's appearance. Some maneki-neko made specifically for some Western markets will have the cat's paw facing upwards, in a beckoning gesture that is more familiar to most Westerners.[3]\\r\\nManeki-neko can be found with either the right or left paw raised (and sometimes both). The significance of the right and left raised paw differs with time and place.[4] Some say that a left paw raised is best for drinking establishments, the right paw for other stores; another interpretation is that right is for home and left for business.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nSome maneki-neko feature battery- or solar-powered moving arms endlessly engaged in the beckoning gesture.\\r\\nAntique examples of maneki-neko may be made of carved wood or stone, handmade porcelain or cast iron.[4]\\r\\nIt is commonly believed that Maneki-neko originated in Tokyo (then named Edo), while some insist it was Kyoto.[4] Maneki-neko first appeared during the later part of the Edo period in Japan.[4] The earliest records of Maneki-neko appear in the Buk nenpy's (a chronology of Edo) entry dated 1852. The Utagawa Hiroshige's ukiyo-e, \\"Joruri-machi Hanka no zu\\", painted also in 1852, depicts the Marushime-neko, a variation of Maneki-neko, being sold at Senso temple, Tokyo. In 1876, during the Meiji era, it was mentioned in a newspaper article, and there is evidence that kimono-clad maneki-neko were distributed at a shrine in Osaka during this time. A 1902 advertisement for maneki-neko indicates that by the turn of the century they were popular.[5]\\r\\nBeyond this the exact origins of maneki-neko are uncertain, though several folktales offer explanations.\\r\\nOthers have noted the similarities between the maneki-neko's gesture and that of a cat washing its face. There is a Japanese belief that a cat washing its face means a visitor will soon arrive. This belief may in turn be related to an even older Chinese proverb that states that if a cat washes its face, it will rain. Thus, it is possible a belief arose that a figure of a cat washing its face would bring in customers. In his Miscellaneous Morsels from Youyang, China's Tang Dynasty author Duan Chengshi (803?-863) wrote: \\"If a cat raises its paw over the ears and washes its face, then patrons will come\\".\\r\\nManeki-neko is the subject of a number of folktales. Here are some of the most popular, explaining the cat's origins:\\r\\nThe stray cat and the shop: The operator of an impoverished shop (or inn, tavern, temple, etc.) takes in a starving, stray cat despite barely having enough to feed himself. In gratitude, the cat sits in the front of the store beckoning customers, thus bringing prosperity as a reward to the charitable proprietor. Ever after, the \\"beckoning cat\\" has been a symbol of good luck for small business owners.[4]\\r\\nModern Japanese folklore suggests that keeping a talisman of good fortune, such as the maneki-neko, in bedrooms and places of study will bring about favorable results and life successes.\\r\\nBecause of its popularity in Chinese communities (including Chinatowns in the United States)[4] the maneki-neko is frequently mistaken for being Chinese in origin rather than Japanese, and is incorrectly referred to as a \\"Chinese lucky cat\\" [4] or jؐnmo (\\"golden cat\\").\\r\\nThe Pokmon named Meowth is based upon the maneki-neko.[6]","input":"What kind of cat is the maneki neko?"},{"output":"serous pericardium","context":"The pericardium (from the Greek ?, \\"around\\" and ?Ѵ, \\"heart\\") is a double-walled sac containing the heart and the roots of the great vessels. The pericardial sac has two layers, a serous layer and a fibrous layer. It encloses the pericardial cavity which contains pericardial fluid.\\r\\nThe pericardium fixes the heart to the mediastinum, gives protection against infection, and provides the lubrication for the heart.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe pericardium is a tough double layered fibroserous sac which covers the heart.[1] The space between the two layers of serous pericardium (see below), the pericardial cavity, is filled with serous fluid which protects the heart from any kind of external jerk or shock. There are two layers to the pericardial sac: the outermost fibrous pericardium and the inner serous pericardium.\\r\\nThe fibrous pericardium is the most superficial layer of the pericardium. It is made up of dense and loose connective tissue,[2] which acts to protect the heart, anchoring it to the surrounding walls, and preventing it from overfilling with blood. It is continuous with the outer adventitial layer of the neighboring great blood vessels.\\r\\nThe serous pericardium, in turn, is divided into two layers, the parietal pericardium, which is fused to and inseparable from the fibrous pericardium, and the visceral pericardium, which is part of the epicardium. Both of these layers function in lubricating the heart to prevent friction during heart activity.\\r\\nThe visceral layer extends to the beginning of the great vessels (the large blood vessels serving the heart) becoming one with the parietal layer of the serous pericardium. This happens at two areas: where the aorta and pulmonary trunk leave the heart and where the superior vena cava, inferior vena cava and pulmonary veins enter the heart.[3]\\r\\nIn between the parietal and visceral pericardial layers there is a potential space called the pericardial cavity, which contains a supply of lubricating serous fluid known as the pericardial fluid.\\r\\nWhen the visceral layer of serous pericardium comes into contact with heart (not the great vessels) it is known as the epicardium. The epicardium is the layer immediately outside of the heart muscle proper (the myocardium).[3] The epicardium is largely made of connective tissue and functions as a protective layer. During ventricular contraction, the wave of depolarization moves from the endocardial to the epicardial surface.\\r\\nInflammation of the pericardium is called pericarditis, and may be detected by the medical sign pericardial friction rub.\\r\\nAn excess of fluid in the cavity (such as in a pericardial effusion) can result in cardiac tamponade (compression of the heart within the pericardial sac). A pericardiectomy is sometimes needed to remedy this. The surgical removing of the epicardium is referred to as epicardiectomy.[citation needed]\\r\\nCutaway illustration of pericardial sac\\r\\nFibrous pericardium","input":"Where are the visceral and parietal pericardium located?"},{"output":"New Mexico","context":"The following are lists of the Hispanic and Latino population per each state in the United States.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs of 2012, Hispanics and Latinos make up about 17% of the total U.S. population.

Soil structure, crop planting, type and application rates of fertilizers, and other factors are taken into account to avoid excessive nutrient loss.","context":"In agriculture, leaching refers to the loss of water-soluble plant nutrients from the soil, due to rain and irrigation. Soil structure, crop planting, type and application rates of fertilizers, and other factors are taken into account to avoid excessive nutrient loss. Leaching may also refer to the practice of applying a small amount of excess irrigation where the water has a high salt content to avoid salts from building up in the soil (salinity control). Where this is practiced, drainage must also usually be employed, to carry away the excess water.\\r\\nLeaching is an environmental concern when it contributes to groundwater contamination. As water from rain, flooding, or other sources seeps into the ground, it can dissolve chemicals and carry them into the underground water supply. Of particular concern are hazardous waste dumps and landfills, and, in agriculture, excess fertilizer, improperly stored animal manure, and biocides (e.g. pesticides, fungicides, insecticides and herbicides).\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNitrogen is a common element in nature and an essential plant nutrient. Approximately 78% of Earth's atmosphere is nitrogen (N2). The strong bond between the atoms of N2 makes this gas quite inert and not directly usable by plants and animals. As nitrogen naturally cycles through the air, water and soil it undergoes various chemical and biological transformations. Nitrogen promotes plant growth. Livestock then eat the crops producing manure, which is returned to the soil, adding organic and mineral forms of nitrogen. The cycle is complete when the next crop uses the amended soil.[1] To increase food production, fertilizers, such as nitrate (NO3) and ammonium (NH4), which are easily absorbed by plants, are introduced to the plant root zone. However, soils do not absorb the excess NO3 ions, which then move downward freely with drainage water, and are leached into groundwater, streams and oceans.[2] The degree of leaching is affected by:\\r\\nThe level of nitrous oxide (N2O) in the Earth's atmosphere is increasing at a rate of 0.2 to 0.3% annually. Anthropogenic sources of nitrogen are 50% greater than from natural sources, such as, soils and oceans. Leached agricultural inputs, i.e. fertilizers and manures, accounts for 75% of the anthropogenic source of nitrogen.[4] The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) estimates world demand for nitrogen fertilizers will increase by 1.7% annually between 2011 and 2015. An increase of 7.5 million tonnes. Regional increases of nitrogen fertilizer use are expected to be 67% by Asia, 18% by the Americas, 10% by Europe, 3% by Africa,and 1% by Oceania.[5]\\r\\nHigh levels of NO3 in water can adversely affect oxygen levels for both humans and aquatic systems. Human health issues include methemoglobinemia and anoxia, commonly referred to as blue baby syndrome. As a result of these toxic effects, regulatory agencies limit the amount of NO3 permissible in drinking water to 45ÿ50 mg1-1. Eutrophication, a decline in oxygen content of water, of aquatic systems can cause the death of fish and other marine species. Finally, leaching of NO3 from acidic sources can increase the loss of calcium and other soil nutrients, thereby reducing an ecosystem's productivity.[2]","input":"What is leaching and why is it a problem?"},{"output":"early 1910s","context":"A horse and buggy (in American English) or horse and carriage (in British English and American English) refers to a light, simple, two-person carriage of the late 18th, 19th and early 20th centuries, drawn usually by one or sometimes by two horses. Also called a roadster or a trap, it was made with two wheels in England and the United States, and with four wheels in the United States as well. It had a folding or falling top.\\r\\n\\r\\nA Concorde buggy, first made in Concord, New Hampshire, had a body with low sides and side-spring suspension. A buggy having two seats was a double buggy. A buggy called a stanhope typically had a high seat and closed back.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe bodies of buggies were sometimes suspended on a pair of longitudinal elastic wooden bars called sidebars. A buggy whip had a small, usually tasseled tip called a snapper.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn countries such as the United States, the United Kingdom, and Canada, it was a primary mode of short-distance personal transportation, especially between 1815 and 1915. At that time, horseback riding in towns and rural areas was less common and required more specific skills than driving a buggy. Horsemanship tended to be an aristocratic skill of larger American and British landowners, North American western pioneers, the military and scouts. Buggies required at least crudely graded main roadways, where horses could go almost anywhere. The growing use of\\r\\nbuggies for local travel expanded, along with stage lines and railroads for longer trips. In cities and towns, horse-drawn railed vehicles gave carriage to poor workers and the lower middle class. The upper middle class used buggies, as did farmers, while the rich had the more elegant 4-wheel carriages for local use. In the late 19th century, bicycles became another factor in urban personal transport.\\r\\n\\r\\nUntil mass production of the automobile brought its price within the reach of the working class, horse-drawn conveyances were the most common means of local transport in towns and nearby countryside. Buggies cost around $25 to $50, and could easily be hitched and driven by untrained men, women, or children. In the United States, hundreds of small companies produced buggies, and their wide use helped to encourage the grading and graveling of main rural roads and actual paving in towns. This provided all-weather passage within and between larger towns.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy the early 1910s, the number of automobiles had surpassed the number of buggies, but their use continued well into the 1920s in out of the way places.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the 1930s, unemployment due to the Great Depression and high gasoline prices meant many car owners in the U.S. and Canada could no longer afford to drive.

Her other film credits included Shampoo (1975), The Blues Brothers (1980), Hannah and Her Sisters (1986), The 'Burbs (1989), When Harry Met Sally... (1989), Soapdish (1991), and The Women (2008).[3] She was nominated twice for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Comedy Series for her performances on the television series 30 Rock and Catastrophe. She was posthumously made a Disney Legend in 2017.[4]\\r\\nFisher wrote several semi-autobiographical novels, including Postcards from the Edge and an autobiographical one-woman play, and its non-fiction book, Wishful Drinking, based on the play. She wrote the screenplay for the film version of Postcards From The Edge which garnered her a BAFTA Award for Best Adapted Screenplay nomination, and her one-woman stage show of Wishful Drinking was filmed for television and received a nomination for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Variety Special. She worked on other writers' screenplays as a script doctor; including tightening the scripts for Hook (1991), Sister Act (1992), The Wedding Singer (1998), and many of the films from the Star Wars franchise, among others.[5] In later years, she earned praise for speaking publicly about her experiences with bipolar disorder and drug addiction.[6]\\r\\nFisher was the daughter of singer Eddie Fisher and actress Debbie Reynolds. She and her mother appear in Bright Lights: Starring Carrie Fisher and Debbie Reynolds, a documentary about their relationship. It premiered at the 2016 Cannes Film Festival. Fisher died of cardiac arrest on December 27, 2016, at age 60, four days after experiencing a medical emergency during a transatlantic flight from London to Los Angeles. Her final film, Star Wars: The Last Jedi, was released on December 15, 2017 and is dedicated to her.[7][8]\\r\\nCarrie Frances Fisher[9] was born on October 21, 1956, in Burbank, California,[10] to actors and singers Eddie Fisher and Debbie Reynolds.[11] Fisher's paternal grandparents were Jewish Russian immigrants, while her mother, who was raised a Nazarene, was of Scots-Irish and English descent.[12][13][14][15]\\r\\nFisher was two years old when her parents divorced in 1959. Her father's third marriage, to actress Connie Stevens, resulted in the births of Fisher's two half-sisters, Joely Fisher and Tricia Leigh Fisher. In 1960, her mother married Harry Karl, owner of a chain of shoe stores. Reynolds and Karl divorced in 1973, when Fisher was 17 years old.[16]\\r\\nFisher \\"hid in books\\" as a child, becoming known in her family as \\"the bookworm\\".[17] She spent her earliest years reading classic literature, and writing poetry. She attended Beverly Hills High School until age 15, when she appeared as a debutante and singer in the hit Broadway revival Irene (1973), starring her mother.[18] Her time on Broadway interfered with her education, resulting in Fisher's dropping out of high school.[19] In 1973, Fisher enrolled at London's Central School of Speech and Drama, which she attended for 18 months.[17][20] Following her time there, Fisher applied to and was accepted at Sarah Lawrence College, where she planned to study the arts. She later left without graduating.[21][22][23]\\r\\nFisher made her film debut at age 18 as the precociously seductive character Lorna Karpf in the Columbia Pictures comedy Shampoo (1975). Lee Grant and Jack Warden play the role of her parents in the film. Warren Beatty, Julie Christie and Goldie Hawn also star in the film.[3] In 1977, Fisher starred as Princess Leia in George Lucas' science-fiction film Star Wars (later retitled Star Wars: Episode IV ÿ A New Hope) opposite Mark Hamill and Harrison Ford.[25] At the time, she believed the script for Star Wars was fantastic, but did not expect many people to agree with her. Though her fellow actors were not close at the time, they bonded after the commercial success of the film.[26]\\r\\nIn April 1978, Fisher appeared as the love interest in Ringo Starr's 1978 TV special Ringo.[27] The next month, she starred alongside John Ritter (who had also appeared in Ringo) in the ABC-TV film Leave Yesterday Behind.[28] At this time, Fisher appeared with Laurence Olivier and Joanne Woodward in the anthology series Laurence Olivier Presents in a television version of the William Inge play Come Back, Little Sheba.[29] That November, she played Princess Leia in the 1978 TV production Star Wars Holiday Special, and sang in the last scene.[30]\\r\\nFisher appeared in the film The Blues Brothers as Jake's vengeful ex-lover; she is listed in the credits as \\"Mystery Woman\\".[31] While Fisher was in Chicago filming the movie, she choked on a Brussels sprout; Dan Aykroyd performed the Heimlich maneuver and \\"saved my life\\".[32] She appeared on Broadway in Censored Scenes from King Kong in 1980. The same year, she reprised her role as Princess Leia in The Empire Strikes Back, and appeared with her Star Wars co-stars on the cover of the July 12, 1980 issue of Rolling Stone to promote the film.[33] She also starred as Sister Agnes in the Broadway production of Agnes of God in 1982.[34]\\r\\nIn 1983, Fisher returned to the role of Princess Leia in Return of the Jedi, and posed in the character's metal bikini on the cover of the Summer 1983 issue of Rolling Stone to promote the film.[35][36] The costume later achieved a following of its own.[37] In 1986 she starred along with Barbara Hershey and Mia Farrow in Woody Allen's Hannah and Her Sisters.\\r\\nIn 1987, Fisher published her first novel, Postcards from the Edge. The book was semi-autobiographical in the sense that she fictionalized and satirized real-life events such as her drug addiction of the late 1970s and her relationship with her mother. It became a bestseller, and she received the Los Angeles Pen Award for Best First Novel. Also during 1987, she was in the Australian film The Time Guardian. In 1989 Fisher played a major supporting role in When Harry Met Sally..., and in the same year she appeared with Tom Hanks as his character's wife in The 'Burbs.[3]\\r\\nIn 1990, Columbia Pictures released a film version of Postcards from the Edge, adapted for the screen by Fisher and starring Meryl Streep, Shirley MacLaine and Dennis Quaid.[38] Fisher appeared in the fantasy comedy film Drop Dead Fred in 1991, and played a therapist in Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery (1997).[3] During the 1990s, Fisher also published the novels Surrender the Pink (1990) and Delusions of Grandma (1993).

Fellow roaster Wayne Brady poked fun at Fisher's career, saying she was the only celebrity \\"whose action figure is worth more than you are.\\"[64]\\r\\nShe was selected as a member of the main competition jury at the 2013 Venice Film Festival.[65] She filmed an appearance on the UK comedy panel show QI that was broadcast on December 25, 2014.[66] Fisher starred alongside Sharon Horgan and comedian Rob Delaney in the British comedy series Catastrophe, that was first broadcast on Channel 4 in the UK on January 19, 2015.[67][68] Her last appearance on Catastrophe, which aired in the UK on April 4, 2017, left many viewers in tears[69] and earned her a posthumous Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Comedy Series nomination.\\r\\nFisher's memoir, The Princess Diarist, was released in November 2016. The book is based on diaries she kept while filming the original Star Wars trilogy in the late 1970s and early 1980s.[70][71]\\r\\nIn a March 2013 interview following the announcement that a new trilogy of films would be produced, Fisher confirmed that she would reprise her role as Princess Leia in Episode VII of the Star Wars series. Fisher claimed that Leia was \\"Elderly. She's in an intergalactic old folks' home [laughs]. I just think she would be just like she was before, only slower and less inclined to be up for the big battle.\\"[72] After other media outlets reported this on March 6, 2013, her representative said the same day that Fisher was joking and that nothing was announced.[73]\\r\\nIn a January 2014 interview, Fisher confirmed her involvement and the involvement of the original cast in the upcoming sequels by saying \\"as for the next Star Wars film, myself, Harrison Ford and Mark Hamill are expected to report to work in March or April. I'd like to wear my old cinnamon buns hairstyle again but with white hair. I think that would be funny.\\"[74]\\r\\nIn March 2014, Fisher stated that she was moving to London for six months because that was where Star Wars Episode VII filming would take place.[75] On April 29, 2014, the cast for the new sequel was officially announced, and Fisher, along with Harrison Ford, Mark Hamill, Peter Mayhew, Anthony Daniels, and Kenny Baker, were all cast in their original roles for the film. Star Wars Episode VII, subtitled The Force Awakens, was released worldwide on December 18, 2015. Fisher was nominated for a 2016 Saturn Award for Best Supporting Actress for her portrayal.[76]\\r\\nIn Rogue One (2016), which predates the original trilogy, a young version of Leia and the character Grand Moff Tarkin appear, both through computer animation.[77][78] Fisher had completed filming her role as Leia in Star Wars: The Last Jedi (2017) shortly before her death.[79] Variety reported following her death that Fisher was slated to appear in Episode IX and that now Lucasfilm, Disney, and others involved with the film will need to find a way to address her death and what will become of her character.[80][81][82]\\r\\nFisher and her mother appear in Bright Lights: Starring Carrie Fisher and Debbie Reynolds,[83] a 2016 documentary about their close relationship featuring interviews, photographs and home movies. The documentary premiered at the 2016 Cannes Film Festival and broadcast on January 7, 2017.[84]\\r\\nShe will be featured in the film Wonderwell with Rita Ora, which was filmed in the summer of 2016 in Italy.[85]\\r\\nFisher met musician Paul Simon while filming Star Wars, and the pair dated from 1977 until 1983.[86] In 1980, she was briefly engaged to Canadian actor and comedian Dan Aykroyd, who proposed to her on the set of their film The Blues Brothers. She said: \\"We had rings, we got blood tests, the whole shot. But then I got back together with Paul Simon.\\"[87] Fisher was married to Simon from August 1983 to July 1984, and they dated again for a time after their divorce.[citation needed] During their marriage, she appeared in Simon's music video for the song \\"Rene and Georgette Magritte with Their Dog after the War\\". Simon's song \\"Hearts and Bones\\" is about their romance.[88][89]\\r\\nShe subsequently had a relationship with Creative Artists Agency principal and talent agent Bryan Lourd. They had one child together, Billie Lourd (b. 1992). Eddie Fisher stated in his autobiography (Been There Done That) that his granddaughter's name is Catherine Fisher Lourd and her nickname is \\"Billy\\". The couple's relationship ended when Lourd left to be in a homosexual relationship. In interviews, Fisher described Lourd as her second husband, but a 2004 profile of the actress and writer revealed that she and Lourd were never legally married.[90]\\r\\nIn her 2016 autobiography The Princess Diarist, Fisher wrote that she and Harrison Ford had a three-month affair during the filming of Star Wars in 1976.[91]\\r\\nFisher also had a close relationship with singer James Blunt. While working on his album Back to Bedlam in 2003, Blunt spent much of his time at Fisher's residence. When Vanity Fair's George Wayne asked Fisher if their relationship was sexual, she replied: \\"Absolutely not, but I did become his therapist. He was a soldier. This boy has seen awful stuff. Every time James hears fireworks or anything like that, his heart beats faster, and he gets 'fight or flight.' You know, he comes from a long line of soldiers dating back to the 10th century. He would tell me these horrible stories. He was a captain, a reconnaissance soldier. I became James' therapist.

The final autopsy report listed the cause of death as \\"cocaine and oxycodone use\\" but added chronic, and apparently previously undiagnosed, heart disease as contributing factors. Media coverage of an initial autopsy report used the word \\"overdose,\\" but that wording is not in the final report.[92] In an interview, Fisher claimed that Stevens' ghost haunted her mansion, which unsettled her: \\"I was a nut for a year\\", she explained, \\"and in that year I took drugs again.\\"[25]\\r\\nFisher described herself as an \\"enthusiastic agnostic who would be happy to be shown that there is a God\\".[93] She was raised Protestant,[94] but often attended Jewish services (her father's faith) with Orthodox friends.[95]\\r\\nIn 2016, Harvard College gave Fisher its Annual Outstanding Lifetime Achievement Award in Cultural Humanism, noting that \\"her forthright activism and outspokenness about addiction, mental illness, and agnosticism have advanced public discourse on these issues with creativity and empathy.\\"[6]\\r\\nFisher was a supporter and advocate for several causes, including women's advocacy,[96] animal rights,[97] and LGBT causes.[98] She was open about her experiences caring for friends who suffered from AIDS, contributing financially to various AIDS and HIV organizations, including hosting a benefit for amfAR, The Foundation for AIDS Research.[99] She also served as an honorary board member for the International Bipolar Foundation,[100] and, in 2014, received the Golden Heart Award for her work with The Midnight Mission.[101]\\r\\nShe was a spokesperson for Jenny Craig weight loss television ads that aired in January 2011.[102]\\r\\nDuring appearances on 20/20 and The Secret Life of the Manic Depressive with Stephen Fry, Fisher publicly discussed her diagnosis of bipolar disorder and her addictions to cocaine and prescription medication.[103] She said her drug use was a form of self-medication; she used pain medication such as Percodan to \\"dial down\\" the manic aspect of her bipolar disorder.[104] She gave nicknames to her bipolar moods: Roy (\\"the wild ride of a mood\\") and Pam (\\"who stands on the shore and sobs\\").[105] \\"Drugs made me feel more normal\\", she explained to Psychology Today in 2001. \\"They contained me.\\"[104] She discussed her 2008 memoir Wishful Drinking and various topics in it with Matt Lauer on NBC's Today that same year, and also revealed that she would have turned down the role of Princess Leia had she realized it would give her the celebrity status that made her parents' lives difficult.[106] This interview was followed by a similar appearance on The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson on December 12, 2008, where she discussed her electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) treatments.[107] At one point, she received ECT every six weeks to \\"blow apart the cement\\" in her brain.[108] In 2014, she said she was no longer receiving the treatment.[109]\\r\\nIn another interview, Fisher revealed that she used cocaine during the filming of The Empire Strikes Back. \\"Slowly, I realized I was doing a bit more drugs than other people and losing my choice in the matter\\", she noted.[110][111] In 1985, after months of sobriety, she accidentally overdosed on a combination of prescription medication and sleeping pills.[112] She was rushed to the hospital, creating the turn of events that led to much of the material in her novel and screenplay, Postcards from the Edge. Asked why she did not take on the role of her story's protagonist, named Suzanne, in the film version, Fisher remarked, \\"I've already played Suzanne.\\"[113]\\r\\nIn her later years, Fisher had an emotional support animal, a French Bulldog named Gary, whom she brought to numerous appearances and interviews.[114] Following her death, reports indicated that Fisher's daughter Billie Lourd would take care of Gary.[115]\\r\\nAfter finishing the European leg of her book tour, Fisher was on a commercial flight on December 23, 2016 from London to Los Angeles when she suffered a medical emergency around fifteen minutes before the aircraft landed.[116][a] A passenger seated near Fisher reported that she had stopped breathing;[119] another passenger performed CPR on Fisher until paramedics arrived at the scene. Emergency services in Los Angeles were contacted when the flight crew reported a passenger in distress prior to landing. Fisher was taken by ambulance to the Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center, where she was placed on a ventilator.[120][121]\\r\\nFollowing four days in intensive care at UCLA Medical Center, Fisher died on December 27, 2016, at 8:55?a.m. (PST); she was 60 years old.[122] Fisher's daughter, Billie Lourd, confirmed her mother's death in a statement to the press.[120] Many of her co-stars and directors from Star Wars and other works also shared their thoughts on her death.[123]\\r\\nOn January 9, 2017, the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health issued a death certificate that stated \\"cardiac arrest/deferred\\" as the cause of death. More tests were expected.[124] In a June 16, 2017 news release, the Los Angeles County coroner's office said that the exact cause of death could not be determined, but sleep apnea and the buildup of fatty tissue on the walls of arteries were among the contributing factors.[125] A full report from June 19, 2017, stated that Fisher had cocaine in her system, as well as traces of heroin, other opiates, and MDMA. The report also stated that the investigation was unable to determine when she had taken the drugs, and whether they contributed to her death.[126] Her daughter Billie Lourd stated that Fisher \\"battled drug addiction and mental illness her entire life [and] ultimately died of it. She was purposefully open in all of her work about the social stigmas surrounding these diseases... I know my Mom, shed want her death to encourage people to be open about their struggles.\\"[127]\\r\\nThe day after Fisher's death, her mother Debbie Reynolds suffered a stroke at the home of son Todd, where the family was planning Fisher's burial arrangements.[128] She was taken to a hospital, where she died later that afternoon.[129][130] According to Todd Fisher, Reynolds had said, \\"I really want to be with Carrie\\" immediately prior to suffering the stroke.[131][132][b] On January 5, 2017, a joint private memorial was held for Fisher and Reynolds. A portion of Fisher's ashes were laid to rest beside Reynolds in a crypt at Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Hollywood Hills.[134] The remainder of her ashes are held in a giant, novelty Prozac pill.[135]\\r\\nIn her 2008 book, Wishful Drinking, Fisher wrote about what she hoped would eventually be her obituary: \\"I want it reported that I drowned in moonlight, strangled by my own bra.\\" Several obituaries and retrospectives featured the quote.[136] In the absence of a star for Fisher on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, fans created their own memorial using a blank star. Along with flowers and candles, words put on the blank star read, \\"Carrie Fisher may the force be with you always\\".[2] In the video game Star Wars: The Old Republic, thousands of fans paid tribute to Fisher by gathering at House Organa on the planet Alderaan where Fisher's character in Star Wars resided.[137][138] Lightsaber vigils and similar events in Fisher's honor were held at various Alamo Drafthouse Cinemas theaters and other sites.[139][140][141] On January 6, 2017, the lights on Broadway in Manhattan were darkened for one minute in honor of Fisher and her mother.[142] Fisher and Reynolds were also both featured in the 89th Academy Awards In Memoriam segment.[143] On March 25, 2017, a public memorial for mother and daughter was held at the Hall of Liberty theater in Forest Lawn Memorial Park. The event was streamed live on Reynolds' website. On April 14, a special tribute to Fisher was held by Mark Hamill during the Star Wars Celebration in Orlando.[144]\\r\\nNovels\\r\\nNon-fiction\\r\\nScreenplays\\r\\nPlays\\r\\nOther\\r\\nNomination","input":"Who is the actress who played princess leia?"},{"output":"New South Wales","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Atracidae, commonly known as Australian funnel-web spiders, are a family of mygalomorph spiders. They have been included as a subfamily of Hexathelidae, but are now recognized as a separate family.[1] All members of the family are native to Australia.[1][3] Atracidae consists of three genera: Atrax, Hadronyche, and Illawarra, comprising 35 species.[1] A number of the species produce venom which is dangerous to humans and bites by spiders of six of the species have caused severe injuries to victims. The bite of the Sydney funnel-web spider (Atrax robustus) is potentially deadly, but no fatalities have occurred since the introduction of modern first-aid techniques and antivenom.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nThese spiders are medium to large in size, with body lengths ranging from 1 to 5?cm (0.4 to 2.0 in). They have a hairless carapace covering the front part of the body. Like the related diplurid spiders, some hexathelids have relatively long spinnerets; this is especially true of A. robustus. Males have a large mating spur projecting from the middle of their second pair of legs.[3]\\r\\nLike other Mygalomorphae (also incorrectly called \\"Orthognatha\\") an infraorder of spiders that includes the tropical tarantulas[5] these spiders have fangs which point straight down the body and do not point towards each other (cf Araneomorphae). They have ample venom glands that lie entirely within their chelicerae. Their fangs are large and powerful, capable of  penetrating fingernails and soft shoes.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nFunnel-webs make their burrows in moist, cool, sheltered habitatsunder rocks, in and under rotting logs, some in rough-barked trees (occasionally metres above ground). They are commonly found in suburban rockeries and shrubberies, rarely in lawns or other open terrain. A funnel-web's burrow characteristically has irregular silk trip-lines radiating from the entrance.[3] Unlike some related trapdoor spiders, funnel-webs do not build lids to their burrows.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe primary range of the Australian funnel-web spiders is the eastern coast of Australia, with specimens found in New South Wales, South Australia, Victoria, and Queensland.[3][7] The only Australian states or territories without funnel-webs are Western Australia[8] and the Northern Territory.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first atracide spider, Hadronyche cerberea, was described by Carl Ludwig Koch in 1873. Octavius Pickard-Cambridge described another atracide species, A. robustus, four years later. For a considerable time, confusion existed as to the limits of the genera Hadronyche and Atrax, not helped by the destruction of type specimens of Hadronyche cerberea during World War II. In 1980, Robert J. Raven merged the two genera under Atrax. In 1988, Michael R. Gray separated them again, and in 2010 added a further genus, Illawarra.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe family placement of the group has varied. In 1892, Eugne Simon placed Atrax and Hadronyche in the family Dipluridae. In 1901, Henry R. Hogg considered them to be sufficiently distinctive to form a separate group, which he called \\"Atraceae\\"[9] ÿ the basis of the modern family name Atracidae. When in the 1980s, Raven elevated part of Simon's Dipluridae to the family Hexathelidae, he included the atracine group. Molecular phylogenetic studies consistently threw doubt on the monophyly of the Hexathelidae.[3][10] In 2018, the group was restored to a full family as Atracidae. The following cladogram shows the relationship found between Atracidae and related taxa. Its sister is Actinopodidae.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nDipluridae\\r\\n\\r\\nHexathelidae\\r\\n\\r\\nPorrhothelidae\\r\\n\\r\\nMacrothelidae\\r\\n\\r\\nCalisoga (Nemesiidae)\\r\\n\\r\\nHebestatis (Halonoproctidae)\\r\\n\\r\\nAtracidae\\r\\n\\r\\nActinopodidae\\r\\n\\r\\nThe family includes the following genera.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAustralian funnel-webs are one of the most dangerous groups of spiders in the world and are regarded by some to be the most deadly, both in terms of clinical cases and venom toxicity.[12][13] Six species have caused severe injuries to human victims, including the Sydney funnel-web (Atrax robustus), northern tree funnel-web (Hadronyche formidabilis), southern tree funnel-web (H. cerberea),[14] Blue Mountains funnel-web (H. versuta), Darling Downs funnel-web (H. infensa), and the Port Macquarie funnel-web (H. macquariensis).\\r\\n\\r\\nExamination of bite records has implicated wandering males in most if not all fatal funnel-web bites to humans. Adult males, recognised by the modified terminal segment of the palp, tend to wander during the warmer months of the year looking for receptive females for mating.[15] They are attracted to water, hence are often found in swimming pools, into which they often fall while wandering. The spiders can survive immersion in water for several hours and can deliver a bite when removed from the water.[16]:p.313ÿ22 They also show up in garages and yards in suburban Sydney. Contrary to commonly held belief, funnel-web spiders are not able to jump, although they can run quickly.[16]:p.313ÿ22\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile some very venomous spiders do not always inject venom when they bite, these spiders most often do.[citation needed] The volume of venom delivered to large animals is often small, possibly due to the angle of the fangs, which are not horizontally opposed, and the fact that contact is often brief before the spider is brushed off. About 10% to 25% of bites are claimed to produce significant toxicity,[12] but the likelihood cannot be predicted and all bites should be treated as potentially life-threatening.\\r\\n\\r\\nBites from Sydney funnel-web spiders have caused 13 deaths (seven in children).[12] In all cases where the sex of the biting spider could be determined, it was found to be the male of the species.[17] One member of the genus Hadronyche, the northern tree funnel-web, has also been claimed to cause fatal envenomation,[7] but to date, this lacks the support of a specific medical report. Assays of venom from several Hadronyche species have shown it to be similar to Atrax venom.\\r\\n\\r\\nMany different toxins are found in the venom of Atrax and Hadronyche spiders. Collectively, these spider toxins are given the name atracotoxins (ACTX), as all these spiders belong to the family Atracidae. The first toxins isolated were the Ѵ-ACTX toxins present in the venom of both A. robustus (Ѵ-ACTX-Ar1, formerly known as robustoxin or atracotoxin) and H. versuta (Ѵ-ACTX-Hv1a, formerly known as versutotoxin). Both these toxins produce the same effects in monkeys as those seen in humans, suggesting that they are responsible for the physiological effects seen with crude venom.[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nThese toxins are thought to operate by opening sodium channels. They are presynaptic neurotoxins that, via sodium channels, induce spontaneous, repetitive firing of action potentials in autonomic and motor neurons and inhibit neurally mediated transmitted release resulting in a surge of endogenous acetylcholine, noradrenaline, and adrenaline.[18]\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough extremely toxic to primates, the venom appears to be fairly harmless to many other animals. These animals may be resistant to the venom's effects due to the presence of IgG, and possibly cross-linked IgG and IgM inactivating factors in their blood plasma that bind to the toxins responsible and neutralise them.[19]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe female venom was thought to be only about a sixth as potent to humans as that of the male.[20][citation needed] The bite of a female or juvenile may still be serious; however, considerable variability occurs in venom toxicity between species, together with assumed degrees of inefficiency in the method of venom delivery.\\r\\n\\r\\nEnvenomation symptoms observed following bites by these spiders are very similar. The bite is initially very painful, due to the size of the fangs penetrating the skin.[14] Puncture marks and local bleeding are also usually visible. If substantial envenomation occurs, symptoms generally occur within minutes and progress rapidly.\\r\\n\\r\\nEarly symptoms of systemic envenomation include goose bumps, sweating, tingling around the mouth and tongue, twitching (initially facial and intercostal), salivation, watery eyes, elevated heart rate, and elevated blood pressure. As systemic envenomation progresses, symptoms include nausea, vomiting, shortness of breath (caused by airway obstruction), agitation, confusion, writhing, grimacing, muscle spasms, pulmonary oedema (of neurogenic or hypertensive origin), metabolic acidosis, and extreme hypertension. The final stages of severe envenomation include dilation of the pupils (often fixed), uncontrolled generalised muscle twitching, unconsciousness, elevated intracranial pressure, and death. Death generally is a result of progressive hypotension or possibly elevated intracranial pressure consequent on cerebral oedema.[12][21][22]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe onset of severe envenomation can be rapid. In one prospective study, the median time to onset of envenomation was 28 minutes, with only two cases having onset after 2 hours (both had pressure immobilisation bandages applied).[12] Death may occur within a period ranging from 15 minutes[17] (this occurred when a small child was bitten) to three days.\\r\\n\\r\\nDue to the severity of symptoms, and the speed with which they progress, in areas where these spiders are known to live, all bites from large, black spiders should be treated as though they were caused by a funnel-web spider. First-aid treatment for a suspected funnel-web spider bite consists of immediately applying a pressure immobilization bandage; a technique which consists of wrapping the bitten limb with a crepe bandage, as well as applying a splint to limit movement of the limb. This technique was originally developed for snakebites, but has also been shown to be effective at slowing venom movement and preventing systemic envenomation in case of a funnel-web spider bite. Some evidence suggests that periods of prolonged localisation may slowly inactivate the venom.[21][23] Emergency medical treatment should be sought as soon as possible. It is important that the pressure immobilisation bandage is not removed prematurely. It should remain in place until intravenous access has been established, adequate medical monitoring is in place, and a supply of antivenom is available. A patient who is not displaying any symptoms of systemic envenomation may deteriorate rapidly when the bandage is removed.\\r\\n\\r\\nFurther supportive care may be necessary, but the mainstay of treatment is antivenom. Venom from the male A. robustus is used in producing the antivenom, but it appears to be effective against the venom of all species of funnel-web spiders.[24] Funnel-web antivenom has also been shown, in vitro, to reverse the effects of Eastern mouse spider (Missulena bradleyi) venom.[25]\\r\\n\\r\\nPrior to the introduction of antivenom, envenomation resulted in significant morbidity and mortality.[26] The purified rabbit IgG antivenom was developed in 1981 through a team effort led by Dr Struan Sutherland, head of immunology at the Australian Commonwealth Serum Laboratories in Melbourne.[27] Fortunately, the antivenom is fast-acting and highly and globally effective.[28] Antivenom therapy has shortened the course of envenomation effects; prior to antivenom availability, the average length of hospital treatment for severe bites was about 14 days. Today, antivenom-treated patients are commonly discharged from hospital within 1 to 3 days.[17] No deaths are known since it became available.[12]","input":"Where do funnel web spiders live in australia?"},{"output":"June 1975","context":"The ICC Cricket World Cup is the international championship of One Day International (ODI) cricket. The event is organised by the sport's governing body, the International Cricket Council (ICC), every four years, with preliminary qualification rounds leading up to a finals tournament. The tournament is one of the world's most viewed sporting events and is considered the \\"flagship event of the international cricket calendar\\" by the ICC.[1]\\r\\nThe first World Cup was organised in England in June 1975, with the first ODI cricket match having been played only four years earlier. However, a separate Women's Cricket World Cup had been held two years before the first men's tournament, and a tournament involving multiple international teams had been held as early as 1912, when a triangular tournament of Test matches was played between Australia, England and South Africa. The first three World Cups were held in England. From the 1987 tournament onwards, hosting has been shared between countries under an unofficial rotation system, with fourteen ICC members having hosted at least one match in the tournament.\\r\\nThe World Cup is open to all members of the International Cricket Council (ICC), although the highest-ranking teams receive automatic qualification. The remaining teams are determined via the World Cricket League and the ICC World Cup Qualifier. A total of twenty teams have competed in the eleven editions of the tournament, with fourteen competing in the latest edition in 2015; the next edition in 2019 will have only ten teams. Australia has won the tournament five times, with the West Indies, India (twice each), Pakistan and Sri Lanka (once each) also having won the tournament. The best performance by a non-full-member team came when Kenya made the semi-finals of the 2003 tournament. The tournament is the worlds 4th biggest sporting event behind the FIFA World Cup, Summer Olympics and the Rugby World Cup.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first international cricket match was played between Canada and the United States, on 24 and 25 September 1844.[2] However, the first credited Test match was played in 1877 between Australia and England, and the two teams competed regularly for The Ashes in subsequent years. South Africa was admitted to Test status in 1889.[3] Representative cricket teams were selected to tour each other, resulting in bilateral competition. Cricket was also included as an Olympic sport at the 1900 Paris Games, where Great Britain defeated France to win the gold medal.[4] This was the only appearance of cricket at the Summer Olympics.\\r\\nThe first multilateral competition at international level was the 1912 Triangular Tournament, a Test cricket tournament played in England between all three Test-playing nations at the time: England, Australia and South Africa. The event was not a success: the summer was exceptionally wet, making play difficult on damp uncovered pitches, and attendances were poor, attributed to a \\"surfeit of cricket\\".[5] Since then, international Test cricket has generally been organised as bilateral series: a multilateral Test tournament was not organised again until the triangular Asian Test Championship in 1999.[6]\\r\\nThe number of nations playing Test cricket increased gradually over time, with the addition of West Indies in 1928, New Zealand in 1930, India in 1932, and Pakistan in 1952. However, international cricket continued to be played as bilateral Test matches over three, four or five days.\\r\\nIn the early 1960s, English county cricket teams began playing a shortened version of cricket which only lasted for one day. Starting in 1962 with a four-team knockout competition known as the Midlands Knock-Out Cup,[7] and continuing with the inaugural Gillette Cup in 1963, one-day cricket grew in popularity in England. A national Sunday League was formed in 1969. The first One-Day International match was played on the fifth day of a rain-aborted Test match between England and Australia at Melbourne in 1971, to fill the time available and as compensation for the frustrated crowd. It was a forty over game with eight balls per over.[8]\\r\\nIn the late 1970s, Kerry Packer established the rival World Series Cricket (WSC) competition. It introduced many of the now commonplace features of One Day International cricket, including coloured uniforms, matches played at night under floodlights with a white ball and dark sight screens, and, for television broadcasts, multiple camera angles, effects microphones to capture sounds from the players on the pitch, and on-screen graphics. The first of the matches with coloured uniforms was the WSC Australians in wattle gold versus WSC West Indians in coral pink, played at VFL Park in Melbourne on 17 January 1979. The success and popularity of the domestic one-day competitions in England and other parts of the world, as well as the early One-Day Internationals, prompted the ICC to consider organising a Cricket World Cup.[9]\\r\\nThe inaugural Cricket World Cup was hosted in 1975 by England, the only nation able to put forward the resources to stage an event of such magnitude at the time. The 1975 tournament started on 7 June.[10] The first three events were held in England and officially known as the Prudential Cup after the sponsors Prudential plc. The matches consisted of 60 six-ball overs per team, played during the daytime in traditional form, with the players wearing cricket whites and using red cricket balls.[11]\\r\\nEight teams participated in the first tournament: Australia, England, India, New Zealand, Pakistan, and the West Indies (the six Test nations at the time), together with Sri Lanka and a composite team from East Africa.[12] One notable omission was South Africa, who were banned from international cricket due to apartheid. The tournament was won by the West Indies, who defeated Australia by 17 runs in the final at Lord's.[12]\\r\\nThe 1979 World Cup saw the introduction of the ICC Trophy competition to select non-Test playing teams for the World Cup,[13] with Sri Lanka and Canada qualifying.[14] The West Indies won a second consecutive World Cup tournament, defeating the hosts England by 92 runs in the final. At a meeting which followed the World Cup, the International Cricket Conference agreed to make the competition a quadrennial event.[14]\\r\\nThe 1983 event was hosted by England for a third consecutive time. By this stage, Sri Lanka had become a Test-playing nation, and Zimbabwe qualified through the ICC Trophy. A fielding circle was introduced, 30 yards (27?m) away from the stumps. Four fieldsmen needed to be inside it at all times.[15] The teams faced each other twice, before moving into the knock-outs. India, an outsider, quoted at 66ÿ1 to win by bookmakers before the competition began, were crowned champions after upsetting the West Indies by 43 runs in the final.[9][16]\\r\\nIndia and Pakistan jointly hosted the 1987 tournament, the first time that the competition was held outside England. The games were reduced from 60 to 50 overs per innings, the current standard, because of the shorter daylight hours in the Indian subcontinent compared with England's summer.[17] Australia won the championship by defeating England by 7 runs in the final, the closest margin in World Cup final history.[18][19]\\r\\nThe 1992 World Cup, held in Australia and New Zealand, introduced many changes to the game, such as coloured clothing, white balls, day/night matches, and a change to the fielding restriction rules. The South African cricket team participated in the event for the first time, following the fall of the apartheid regime and the end of the international sports boycott.[20] Pakistan overcame a dismal start in the tournament to eventually defeat England by 22 runs in the final and emerge as winners.[21]\\r\\nThe 1996 championship was held in the Indian subcontinent for a second time, with the inclusion of Sri Lanka as host for some of its group stage matches.[22] In the semi-final, Sri Lanka, heading towards a crushing victory over India at Eden Gardens after the hosts lost eight wickets while scoring 120 runs in pursuit of 252, were awarded victory by default after crowd unrest broke out in protest against the Indian performance.[23] Sri Lanka went on to win their maiden championship by defeating Australia by seven wickets in the final at Lahore.[24]\\r\\nIn 1999 the event was hosted by England, with some matches also being held in Scotland, Ireland, Wales and the Netherlands.[25][26] Twelve teams contested the World Cup. Australia qualified for the semi-finals after reaching their target in their Super 6 match against South Africa off the final over of the match.[27] They then proceeded to the final with a tied match in the semi-final also against South Africa where a mix-up between South African batsmen Lance Klusener and Allan Donald saw Donald drop his bat and stranded mid-pitch to be run out. In the final, Australia dismissed Pakistan for 132 and then reached the target in less than 20 overs and with eight wickets in hand.[28]\\r\\nSouth Africa, Zimbabwe and Kenya hosted the 2003 World Cup. The number of teams participating in the event increased from twelve to fourteen. Kenya's victories over Sri Lanka and Zimbabwe, among others?ÿ and a forfeit by the New Zealand team, which refused to play in Kenya because of security concerns?ÿ enabled Kenya to reach the semi-finals, the best result by an associate.[29] In the final, Australia made 359 runs for the loss of two wickets, the largest ever total in a final, defeating India by 125 runs.[30][31]\\r\\nIn 2007 the tournament was hosted by the West Indies and expanded to sixteen teams.[32] Following Pakistan's upset loss to World Cup debutants Ireland in the group stage, Pakistani coach Bob Woolmer was found dead in his hotel room.[33] Jamaican police had initially launched a murder investigation into Woolmer's death but later confirmed that he died of heart failure.[34] Australia defeated Sri Lanka in the final by 53 runs (D/L) in farcical light conditions, and extended their undefeated run in the World Cup to 29 matches and winning three straight championships.[35]\\r\\nIndia, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh together hosted the 2011 Cricket World Cup. Pakistan were stripped of their hosting rights following the terrorist attack on the Sri Lankan cricket team in 2009, with the games originally scheduled for Pakistan redistributed to the other host countries.[36] The number of teams participating in the World Cup dropped down to fourteen.[37] Australia lost their final group stage match against Pakistan on 19 March 2011, ending an unbeaten streak of 35 World Cup matches, which had begun on 23 May 1999.[38] India won their second World Cup title by beating Sri Lanka by 6 wickets in the final in Mumbai, and became the first country to win the final on home soil.[37] MS Dhoni later became the first captain in history to win all the major ICC tournaments - World T20 in 2007, Champions Trophy in 2013 and this edition of the World Cup.\\r\\nAustralia and New Zealand jointly hosted the 2015 Cricket World Cup. The number of participants remained at fourteen. Ireland was the most successful Associate nation with a total of three wins in the tournament. New Zealand beat South Africa in a thrilling first semi-final to qualify for their maiden World Cup final. Australia defeated New Zealand by seven wickets in the final at Melbourne to lift the World Cup for the fifth time.[39]\\r\\nThe Test-playing nations qualify automatically for the World Cup main event while the other teams have to qualify through a series of preliminary qualifying tournaments. A new qualifying format was introduced for the 2015 Cricket World Cup. The top two teams of the 2011ÿ13 ICC World Cricket League Championship qualify directly. The remaining six teams join the third and fourth-placed teams of 2011 ICC World Cricket League Division Two and the top two teams of the 2013 ICC World Cricket League Division Three in the World Cup Qualifier to decide the remaining two places.[40][41]\\r\\nQualifying tournaments were introduced for the second World Cup, where two of the eight places in the finals were awarded to the leading teams in the ICC Trophy.[13] The number of teams selected through the ICC Trophy had varied throughout the years. The World Cricket League (administered by the International Cricket Council) is the qualification system provided to allow the Associate and Affiliate members of the ICC more opportunities to qualify. The name \\"ICC Trophy\\" has been changed to \\"ICC World Cup Qualifier\\".[42]\\r\\nUnder the current qualifying process, the World Cricket League, all Associate and Affiliate members of the ICC are able to qualify for the World Cup. Associate and Affiliate members must play between two and five stages in the ICC World Cricket League to qualify for the World Cup finals, depending on the Division in which they start the qualifying process.\\r\\nProcess summary in chronological order (2011-2014):\\r\\nThe format of the Cricket World Cup has changed greatly over the course of its history. Each of the first four tournaments was played by eight teams, divided into two groups of four.[43] The competition consisted of two stages, a group stage and a knock-out stage. The four teams in each group played each other in the round-robin group stage, with the top two teams in each group progressing to the semi-finals. The winners of the semi-finals played against each other in the final. With South Africa returning in the fifth tournament in 1992 as a result of the end of the apartheid boycott, nine teams played each other once in the group phase, and the top four teams progressed to the semi-finals.[44] The tournament was further expanded in 1996, with two groups of six teams.[45] The top four teams from each group progressed to quarter-finals and semi-finals.\\r\\nA distinct format was used for the 1999 and 2003 World Cups. The teams were split into two pools, with the top three teams in each pool advancing to the Super 6.[46] The Super 6 teams played the three other teams that advanced from the other group. As they advanced, the teams carried their points forward from previous matches against other teams advancing alongside them, giving them an incentive to perform well in the group stages.[46] The top four teams from the Super 6 stage progressed to the semi-finals, with the winners playing in the final.\\r\\nThe format used in the 2007 World Cup involved 16 teams allocated into four groups of four.[47] Within each group, the teams played each other in a round-robin format. Teams earned points for wins and half-points for ties. The top two teams from each group moved forward to the Super 8 round. The Super 8 teams played the other six teams that progressed from the different groups. Teams earned points in the same way as the group stage, but carried their points forward from previous matches against the other teams who qualified from the same group to the Super 8 stage.[48] The top four teams from the Super 8 round advanced to the semi-finals, and the winners of the semi-finals played in the final.\\r\\nThe format used in the 2011 and 2015[49] World Cups featured two groups of seven teams, each playing in a round-robin format. The top four teams from each group proceeded to the knock out stage consisting of quarter-finals, semi-finals and ultimately the final.[50]\\r\\nIt is proposed that in 2019 World Cup, the number of teams participating will go down to 10 and all the teams will play against each other once in round robin format, before entering the semifinals. This would be similar to the one used in 1992 World Cup.\\r\\nThe ICC Cricket World Cup Trophy is presented to the winners of the World Cup. The current trophy was created for the 1999 championships, and was the first permanent prize in the tournament's history. Prior to this, different trophies were made for each World Cup.[51] The trophy was designed and produced in London by a team of craftsmen from Garrard & Co over a period of two months.\\r\\nThe current trophy is made from silver and gilt, and features a golden globe held up by three silver columns. The columns, shaped as stumps and bails, represent the three fundamental aspects of cricket: batting, bowling and fielding, while the globe characterises a cricket ball.[52] The seam is tilted to symbolize the axial tilt of the Earth. It stands 60?centimetres high and weighs approximately 11?kilograms. The names of the previous winners are engraved on the base of the trophy, with space for a total of twenty inscriptions. The ICC keeps the original trophy. A replica differing only in the inscriptions is permanently awarded to the winning team.[53]\\r\\nThe tournament is the world's third largest[54] with only the FIFA World Cup and the Summer Olympics exceeding it. The 2011 Cricket World Cup final was televised in over 200 countries to over 2.2?billion television viewers.[55][56][57] Television rights, mainly for the 2011 and 2015 World Cup, were sold for over US$1.1?billion,[58] and sponsorship rights were sold for a further US$500?million.[59] The 2003 Cricket World Cup matches were attended by 626,845 people,[60] while the 2007 Cricket World Cup sold more than 672,000 tickets.[61][62]\\r\\nSuccessive World Cup tournaments have generated increasing media attention as One-Day International cricket has become more established. The 2003 World Cup in South Africa was the first to sport a mascot, Dazzler the zebra.[63] An orange mongoose known as Mello was the mascot for the 2007 Cricket World Cup.[64] Stumpy, a blue elephant was the mascot for the 2011 World Cup.[65]\\r\\nOn 13 February, the opening of the 2015 tournament was celebrated with a Google Doodle.[66]\\r\\nThe International Cricket Council's executive committee votes for the hosts of the tournament after examining the bids made by the nations keen to hold a Cricket World Cup.[67]\\r\\nEngland hosted the first three competitions. The ICC decided that England should host the first tournament because it was ready to devote the resources required to organising the inaugural event.[10] India volunteered to host the third Cricket World Cup, but most ICC members preferred England as the longer period of daylight in England in June meant that a match could be completed in one day.[68] The 1987 Cricket World Cup was held in India and Pakistan, the first hosted outside England.[69]\\r\\nMany of the tournaments have been jointly hosted by nations from the same geographical region, such as South Asia in 1987, 1996 and 2011, Australasia in 1992 and 2015, Southern Africa in 2003 and West Indies in 2007 and Kuthiathode in 2016.\\r\\nTwenty nations have qualified for the Cricket World Cup at least once. Seven teams have competed in every tournament, five of which have won the title.[9] The West Indies won the first two tournaments, Australia has won five, India has won two, while Pakistan and Sri Lanka have each won once. The West Indies (1975 and 1979) and Australia (1999, 2003 and 2007) are the only nations to have won consecutive titles.[9] Australia has played in seven of the eleven finals (1975, 1987, 1996, 1999, 2003, 2007, 2015). England has yet to win the World Cup, but has been runners-up three times (1979, 1987, 1992). The best result by a non-Test playing nation is the semi-final appearance by Kenya in the 2003 tournament; while the best result by a non-Test playing team on their debut is the Super 8 (second round) by Ireland in 2007.[9]\\r\\nSri Lanka as a co-host of the 1996 Cricket World Cup was the first host to win the tournament though the final was held in Pakistan.[9] India won in 2011 as host and was the first team to win in a final played in their own country.[70] Australia repeated the feat in 2015.[39] England is the only other host to have made the final, in 1979. Other countries which have achieved or equalled their best World Cup results while co-hosting the tournament are New Zealand as finalists in 2015; Zimbabwe who reached the Super Six in 2003; and Kenya as semi-finalists in 2003.[9] In 1987, co-hosts India and Pakistan both reached the semi-finals, but were eliminated by Australia and England respectively.[9] Australia in 1992, England in 1999, South Africa in 2003, and Bangladesh in 2011 have been the host teams that were eliminated in the first round.\\r\\nAn overview of the teams' performances in every World Cup:\\r\\n?No longer exists.\\r\\nBefore the 1992 World Cup, South Africa was banned due to apartheid.\\r\\nThe number of wins followed by Run-rate is the criteria for determining the rankings till the 1987 World Cup.\\r\\nThe number of points followed by, head to head performance and then net run-rate is the criteria for determining the rankings for the World Cups from 1992 onwards.\\r\\nLegend\\r\\n?No longer exists.\\r\\nThe table below provides an overview of the performances of teams over past World Cups, as of the end of group stage of the 2015 tournament.

At the village's northerly position, day length varies from three hours in December to twenty-one hours in June.[6]\\r\\nDuring World War II, an airfield was built here for the Alaska-Siberian (ALSIB) air route used to ferry American Lend-Lease aircraft to the Eastern Front.[7]\\r\\nWith an extreme subarctic climate (K?ppen climate classification Dwd), Oymyakon is known as one of the places considered the Northern Pole of Cold, the other being the town of Verkhoyansk, located 629 km (391 miles) away by air. The ground is permanently frozen (continuous permafrost).\\r\\nOn February 6, 1933, a temperature of ?67.7?C (?89.9?F) was recorded at Oymyakon's weather station.[8][9] This was the coldest officially recorded temperature in the Northern Hemisphere. Only Antarctica has recorded lower official temperatures (the lowest being ?89.2?C (?128.6?F), recorded at Vostok Station on 21 July 1983.)[10][11]\\r\\nThe weather station is in a valley between Oymyakon and Tomtor. The station is at 750 meters (2,460?ft) and the surrounding mountains at 1,100 meters (3,600?ft), causing cold air to pool in the valley: in fact, recent studies show that winter temperatures in the area increase with altitude by as much as 10?C (18?F).[12]\\r\\nSome years the temperature drops below 0?C (32?F) in late September and may remain below freezing until mid-May. In Oymyakon sometimes the average minimum temperature for January, February and December remains below ?50?C (?58?F). Sometimes summer months can also be quite cold, but June and July are the only months where temperature has never dropped below ?10?C (14?F). Oymyakon and Verkhoyansk are the only two permanently inhabited places in the world that have recorded temperatures below ?60.0?C (?76?F) for every day in January.[13][14]\\r\\nOymyakon has never recorded an above freezing temperature between October 25 and March 17.[15]\\r\\nAlthough winters in Oymyakon are long and excessively cold, summers are mild to warm, sometimes hot. The warmest month on record is July 2010 with an average temperature of +18.7?C (65.7?F).[citation needed] In June, July and August temperatures over 30?C (86?F) are not rare during the day. On July 28,?2010, Oymyakon recorded a record high temperature of 34.6?C (94?F),[16] yielding a temperature range of 102.3?C (184.1?F). Verkhoyansk and Yakutsk are the only other places in the world with a temperature amplitude higher than 100?C (180?F).[citation needed]\\r\\nThe climate is quite dry, but as average monthly temperatures are below freezing for seven months of the year, substantial evaporation occurs only in summer months.

Another likely candidate is Alpha Centauri, Earths nearest Sun-like star system 4.37 light years away. Estimates place the probability of finding a habitable planet around Alpha Centauri A or B at roughly 85%.[11] Alpha Centauri is the target of several exoplanet-finding missions, including Breakthrough Starshot and Mission Centaur, the latter of which is chronicled in the 2016 documentary film, \\"The Search for Earth Proxima.\\"[12]\\r\\n172?C\\r\\nNote: There is no scientific consensus about terrestrial composition of most of the planets in the list.

For most, it is an agreed-upon list of twenty-seven books[1] that includes the Canonical Gospels, Acts, letters of the Apostles, and Revelation. The books of the canon of the New Testament were written before 120 AD.[1]\\r\\nFor the Orthodox, the recognition of these writings as authoritative was formalized in the Second Council of Trullan of 692. The Catholic Church made dogmatic definition upon its Biblical canon in 382 at the Council of Rome [2] as well as at the Council of Trent of 1546, reaffirming the Canons of Florence of 1442 and North African Councils (Hippo and Carthage) of 393ÿ419.[3][4] For the Church of England, it was made dogmatic on the Thirty-Nine Articles of 1563; for Calvinism, on the Westminster Confession of Faith of 1647.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWritings attributed to the Apostles circulated among the earliest Christian communities. The Pauline epistles were circulating, perhaps in collected forms, by the end of the 1st century AD.[a] Justin Martyr, in the mid 2nd century, mentions \\"memoirs of the apostles\\" as being read on \\"the day called that of the sun\\" (Sunday) alongside the \\"writings of the prophets.\\" [5] A defined set of four gospels (the Tetramorph) was asserted by Irenaeus, c. 180, who refers to it directly.[6][7]\\r\\nBy the early 3rd century, Origen may have been using the same twenty-seven books as in the present New Testament canon, though there were still disputes over the acceptance of the Letter to the Hebrews, James, II Peter, II John, III John, Jude and Revelation,[8] known as the Antilegomena. Likewise, the Muratorian fragment is evidence that, perhaps as early as 200, there existed a set of Christian writings somewhat similar to the twenty-seven-book NT canon, which included four gospels and argued against objections to them.[9] Thus, while there was a good measure of debate in the Early Church over the New Testament canon, the major writings are claimed to have been accepted by almost all Christians by the middle of the 3rd century.[10]\\r\\nIn his Easter letter of 367, Athanasius, Bishop of Alexandria, gave a list of the books that would become the twenty-seven-book NT canon,[11] and he used the word \\"canonized\\" (Greek: ϫ?ךϫ kanonizomena) in regards to them.[12][page?needed] The first council that accepted the present canon of the New Testament may have been the Synod of Hippo Regius in North Africa (393). A brief summary of the acts was read at and accepted by the Councils of Carthage in 397 and 419.[13] These councils were under the authority of St. Augustine, who regarded the canon as already closed.[14][15][16] Pope Damasus I's Council of Rome in 382, if the Decretum Gelasianum is correctly associated with it, issued a biblical canon identical to that mentioned above,[11] or, if not, the list is at least a 6th-century compilation.[17] Likewise, Damasus' commissioning of the Latin Vulgate edition of the Bible, c. 383, was instrumental in the fixation of the canon in the West.[18] In c. 405, Pope Innocent I sent a list of the sacred books to a Gallic bishop, Exsuperius of Toulouse. Christian scholars assert that, when these bishops and councils spoke on the matter, however, they were not defining something new but instead \\"were ratifying what had already become the mind of the Church.\\"[14][19][20]\\r\\nThus, some claim that, from the 4th century, there existed unanimity in the West concerning the New Testament canon,[21] and that, by the 5th century, the Eastern Church, with a few exceptions, had come to accept the Book of Revelation and thus had come into harmony on the matter of the canon.[3][22] Nonetheless, full dogmatic articulations of the canon were not made until the Canon of Trent of 1546 for Roman Catholicism,[3] the Gallic Confession of Faith of 1559 for Calvinism, the Thirty-Nine Articles of 1563 for the Church of England, and the Synod of Jerusalem of 1672 for the Greek Orthodox.\\r\\nIn the one-hundred-year period extending roughly from 50 to 150, a number of documents began to circulate among the churches, including epistles, gospels, memoirs, apocalypses, homilies, and collections of teachings. While some of these documents were apostolic in origin, others drew upon the tradition the apostles and ministers of the word had utilized in their individual missions. Still others represented a summation of the teaching entrusted to a particular church center. Several of these writings sought to extend, interpret, and apply apostolic teaching to meet the needs of Christians in a given locality.\\r\\nBy the end of the 1st century, some letters of Paul were known to Clement of Rome (fl.?96), together with some form of the \\"words of Jesus\\"; but while Clement valued these highly, he did not regard them as \\"Scripture\\" (\\"graphe\\"), a term he reserved for the Septuagint. Metzger 1987 draws the following conclusion about Clement:\\r\\nClement... makes occasional reference to certain words of Jesus; though they are authoritative for him, he does not appear to enquire how their authenticity is ensured. In two of the three instances that he speaks of remembering 'the words' of Christ or of the Lord Jesus, it seems that he has a written record in mind, but he does not call it a 'gospel'. He knows several of Paul's epistles, and values them highly for their content; the same can be said of the Epistle to the Hebrews, with which he is well acquainted. Although these writings obviously possess for Clement considerable significance, he never refers to them as authoritative 'Scripture'.\\r\\nWithin the New Testament itself, there is reference to at least some of the works of Paul as Scripture. 2 Peter 3:16 says:\\r\\nHe [Paul] writes the same way in all his letters, speaking in them of these matters. His letters contain some things that are hard to understand, which ignorant and unstable people distort, as they do the other Scriptures, to their own destruction.[23]\\r\\nThe reference to, presumably the Septuagint, as the \\"other\\" Scripture denotes that the author of 2 Peter regarded, at least, the works of Paul that had been written by his time as Scripture. It is difficult to determine the date of composition; commentaries and reference books have placed 2 Peter in almost every decade from AD 60 to 160.[24]\\r\\nMarcion of Sinope, a bishop of Asia Minor who went to Rome and was later excommunicated for his views, was the first of record to propose a definitive, exclusive, unique list of Christian scriptures, compiled sometime between 130ÿ140 AD.[25] (Though Ignatius did address Christian scripture,[26] before Marcion, against the perceived heresies of the Judaizers and Docetists, he did not define a list of scriptures.) In his book Origin of the New Testament[27] Adolf von Harnack argued that Marcion viewed the church at this time as largely an Old Testament church (one that \\"follows the Testament of the Creator-God\\") without a firmly established New Testament canon, and that the church gradually formulated its New Testament canon in response to the challenge posed by Marcion.\\r\\nMarcion rejected the theology of the Old Testament entirely and regarded the God depicted there as an inferior Being. In the Antithesis, he claimed that the theology of the Old Testament was incompatible with the teaching of Jesus regarding God and morality. Marcion believed that Jesus had come to liberate mankind from the authority of the God of the Old Testament and to reveal the superior God of goodness and mercy whom he called the Father. Paul and Luke were the only Christian authors to find favour with Marcion, though his versions of these differed from those later accepted by mainstream Christianity (also termed Proto-orthodox Christianity).\\r\\nMarcion created a definite group of books which he regarded as fully authoritative, displacing all others. These comprised ten of the Pauline epistles (without the Pastorals) and Luke's Gospel. It is uncertain whether he edited these books, purging them of what did not accord with his views, or that his versions represented a separate textual tradition.[b]\\r\\nMarcion's gospel, called simply the Gospel of the Lord, differed from the Gospel of Luke by lacking any passages that connected Jesus with the Old Testament. He believed that the god of Israel, who gave the Torah to the Israelites, was an entirely different god from the Supreme God who sent Jesus and inspired the New Testament. Marcion termed his collection of Pauline epistles the Apostolikon. These also differed from the versions accepted by later Christian Orthodoxy.\\r\\nMarcion's list and theology were rejected as heretical by the early church; however, he forced other Christians to consider which texts were canonical and why. He spread his beliefs widely; they became known as Marcionism. In the introduction to his book \\"Early Christian Writings\\", Henry Wace stated:\\r\\nA modern divine... could not refuse to discuss the question raised by Marcion, whether there is such opposition between different parts of what he regards as the word of God, that all cannot come from the same author.[31]\\r\\nFerguson 2002 quotes Tertullian's De praescriptione haereticorum 30:\\r\\nSince Marcion separated the New Testament from the Old, he is necessarily subsequent to that which he separated, inasmuch as it was only in his power to separate what was previously united. Having been united previous to its separation, the fact of its subsequent separation proves the subsequence also of the man who effected the separation.\\r\\nNote 61 of page 308 adds:\\r\\n[Wolfram] Kinzig suggests that it was Marcion who usually called his Bible testamentum [Latin for testament].\\r\\nOther scholars propose that it was Melito of Sardis who originally coined the phrase Old Testament,[32] which is associated with Supersessionism.\\r\\nRobert M. Price argues that the evidence that the early church fathers, such as Clement, Ignatius, and Polycarp, knew of the Pauline epistles is unclear, and concludes that Marcion was the first person to collect Paul's writings to various churches and to treat ten Pauline letters, some of them Marcion's own compositions, together with an earlier version of Luke (not the Gospel of Luke as now known):\\r\\nBut the first collector of the Pauline Epistles had been Marcion. No one else we know of would be a good candidate, certainly not the essentially fictive Luke, Timothy, and Onesimus. And Marcion, as Burkitt and Bauer show, fills the bill perfectly.[33]\\r\\nIn the mid-2nd century, Justin Martyr (whose writings span the period from c. 145 to 163) mentions the \\"memoirs of the apostles\\", which Christians called \\"gospels\\" and which were regarded as on par with the Old Testament.[5][34][35] Scholars are divided on whether there is any evidence that Justin included the Gospel of John among the \\"memoirs of the apostles\\", or whether, on the contrary, he based his doctrine of the Logos on it.[36][37] Justin quotes the letters of Paul, 1 Peter, and Acts in his writings.[38]\\r\\nIn Justin's works, distinct references are found to Romans, 1 Corinthians, Galatians, Ephesians, Colossians, and 2 Thessalonians, and possible ones to Philippians, Titus, and 1 Timothy. In addition, he refers to an account from an unnamed source of the baptism of Jesus which differs from that provided by the synoptic gospels:\\r\\nWhen Jesus went down in the water, fire was kindled in the Jordan; and when he came up from the water, the Holy Spirit came upon him. The apostles of our Christ wrote this.[39]\\r\\nTatian was converted to Christianity by Justin Martyr on a visit to Rome around 150 and, after much instruction, returned to Syria in 172 to reform the church there. At some point (it is suggested c. 160) he composed a single harmonized \\"Gospel\\" by weaving the contents of the gospels of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John together along with events present in none of these texts. The narrative mainly follows the chronology of John. This is called the Diatessaron (\\"(Harmony) Through Four\\") and it became the official Gospel text of the Syraic church, centered in Edessa.\\r\\nIrenaeus of Lyons referred directly to a defined set of four gospels (the Tetramorph), c. 180.[6][40] In his central work, Adversus Haereses Irenaeus denounced various early Christian groups that used only one gospel, such as Marcionism which used only Marcion's version of Luke, or the Ebionites which seem to have used an Aramaic version of Matthew, as well as groups that used more than four gospels, such as the Valentinians (A.H. 1.11). Irenaeus declared that the four he espoused were the four \\"Pillars of the Church\\": \\"it is not possible that there can be either more or fewer than four\\" he stated, presenting as logic the analogy of the four corners of the earth and the four winds (3.11.8). His image, taken from Ezekiel 1, or Revelation 4:6ÿ10, of God's throne borne by four creatures with four faces\\"the four had the face of a man, and the face of a lion, on the right side: and the four had the face of an ox on the left side; they four also had the face of an eagle\\"equivalent to the \\"four-formed\\" gospel, is the origin of the conventional symbols of the Evangelists: lion (Mark), ox (Luke), eagle (John), man (Matthew). Irenaeus was ultimately successful in declaring that the four gospels collectively, and exclusively these four, contained the truth. By reading each gospel in light of the others, Irenaeus made of John a lens through which to read Matthew, Mark and Luke.\\r\\nBased on the arguments Irenaeus made in support of only four authentic gospels, some interpreters deduce that the fourfold Gospel must have still been a novelty in Irenaeus's time.[41] Against Heresies 3.11.7 acknowledges that many heterodox Christians use only one gospel while 3.11.9 acknowledges that some use more than four.[42] The success of Tatian's Diatessaron in about the same time period is \\"...a powerful indication that the fourfold Gospel contemporaneously sponsored by Irenaeus was not broadly, let alone universally, recognized.\\"[42]\\r\\nIrenaeus apparently quotes from 21 of the New Testament books and names the author he thought wrote the text.[43] He mentions the four gospels, Acts, the Pauline epistles with the exception of Hebrews and Philemon, as well as the first epistle of Peter, and the first and second epistles of John, and the book of Revelation.[c] Irenaeus argued that it was illogical to reject Acts of the Apostles but accept the Gospel of Luke, as both were from the same author;[44] in Against Heresies 3.12.12[45] he ridiculed those who think they are wiser than the Apostles because the Apostles were still under Jewish influence. He may also refer to Hebrews (Book 2, Chapter 30) and James (Book 4, Chapter 16) and maybe even 2 Peter (Book 5, Chapter 28) but does not cite Philemon, 3 John or Jude.[46][47]\\r\\nHe does think that the letter to the Corinthians, known now as 1 Clement, was of great worth but does not seem to believe that Clement of Rome was the one author (Book 3, Chapter 3, Verse 3) and seems to have the same lower status as Polycarp's Epistle (Book 3, Chapter 3, Verse 3). He does refer to a passage in the Shepherd of Hermas as scripture (Mandate 1 or First Commandment), but this has some consistency problems on his part. Hermas taught that Jesus was not himself a divine being, but a virtuous man who was subsequently filled with the Holy Spirit and adopted as the Son[48][49] (a doctrine called adoptionism). But Irenaeus's own work, including his citing of the Gospel of John (Jn. 1:1), indicates that he himself believed that Jesus was always God.\\r\\nIn the late 4th century Epiphanius of Salamis (died 402) Panarion 29 says the Nazarenes had rejected the Pauline epistles and Irenaeus Against Heresies 26.2 says the Ebionites rejected him. Acts 21:21 records a rumor that Paul aimed to subvert the Old Testament (against this rumor see Romans 3:8, 3:31). 2 Peter 3:16 says his letters have been abused by heretics who twist them around \\"as they do with the other scriptures.\\" In the 2nd and 3rd centuries Eusebius's Ecclesiastical History 6.38 says the Elchasai \\"made use of texts from every part of the Old Testament and the Gospels; it rejects the Apostle (Paul) entirely\\"; 4.29.5 says Tatian the Assyrian rejected Paul's Letters and Acts of the Apostles; 6.25 says Origen accepted 22 canonical books of the Hebrews plus Maccabees plus the four Gospels but Paul \\"did not so much as write to all the churches that he taught; and even to those to which he wrote he sent but a few lines.\\"[50]\\r\\nBetween 140 and 220, both internal and external forces caused Proto-orthodox Christianity to begin to systematize both its doctrines and its view of revelation. Much of the systemization came about as a defense against the diverse Early Christian viewpoints that competed with emerging Proto-Orthodoxy. The early years of this period witnessed the rise of several strong movements of faith later deemed heretical by the church in Rome: Marcionism, Gnosticism and Montanism.\\r\\nMarcion may have been the first to have a clearly defined list of New Testament books, though this question of who came first is still debated.[51] The compilation of this list could have been a challenge and incentive to emerging Proto-orthodoxy; if they wished to deny that Marcion's list was the true one, it was incumbent on them to define what the true one was. The expansion phase of the New Testament canon thus could have begun in response to Marcion's proposed limited canon.\\r\\nThe Muratorian fragment[52] is the earliest known example of a defined list of mostly New Testament books.[53] It survives, damaged and thus incomplete, as a bad Latin translation of an original, no longer extant, Greek text that is usually dated in the late 2nd century,[54][55][56][57][58][59][60][61] although a few scholars have preferred a 4th-century date.[62][63][64] This is an excerpt from Metzger's translation:[65]\\r\\nThe third book of the Gospel is that according to Luke... The fourth... is that of John... the acts of all the apostles... As for the Epistles of Paul... To the Corinthians first, to the Ephesians second, to the Philippians third, to the Colossians fourth, to the Galatians fifth, to the Thessalonians sixth, to the Romans seventh... once more to the Corinthians and to the Thessalonians... one to Philemon, one to Titus, and two to Timothy... to the Laodiceans, [and] another to the Alexandrians, [both] forged in Paul's name to [further] the heresy of Marcion... the epistle of Jude and two of the above-mentioned (or, bearing the name of) John... and [the book of] Wisdom... We receive only the apocalypses of John and Peter, though some of us are not willing that the latter be read in church. But Hermas wrote the Shepherd very recently... And therefore it ought indeed to be read; but it cannot be read publicly to the people in church.\\r\\nThis is evidence that, perhaps as early as 200, there existed a set of Christian writings somewhat similar to what is now the 27-book NT, which included four gospels and argued against objections to them.[9]\\r\\nClement of Alexandria (c.?150 ÿ c.?215) made use of an open canon. He seemed \\"practically unconcerned about canonicity. To him, inspiration is what mattered.\\"[66] In addition to books that did not make it into the final 27-book NT but which had local acceptance (Barnabas, Didache, I Clement, Revelation of Peter, the Shepherd, the Gospel according to the Hebrews), he also used the Gospel of the Egyptians, Preaching of Peter, Traditions of Matthias, Sibylline Oracles, and the Oral Gospel. He did, however, prefer the four church gospels to all others, although he supplemented them freely with apocryphal gospels. He was the first[citation needed] to treat non-Pauline letters of the apostles (other than II Peter) as scripture-he accepted I Peter, I and II John, and Jude as scripture.\\r\\nThere were those who rejected the Gospel of John (and possibly also Revelation and the Epistles of John) as either not apostolic or as written by the Gnostic Cerinthus or as not compatible with the Synoptic Gospels. Epiphanius of Salamis called these people the Alogi, because they rejected the Logos doctrine of John and because he claimed they were illogical. There may have also been a dispute over the doctrine of the Paraclete.[67][68] Gaius or Caius, presbyter of Rome (early 3rd century), was apparently associated with this movement.[69]\\r\\nEusebius, in his Church History (c. 330), mentioned the books of New Testament according to him:[70][71]\\r\\n1. [] it is proper to sum up the writings of the New Testament which have been already mentioned. First then must be put the holy quaternion of the Gospels; following them the Acts of the Apostles... the epistles of Paul... the epistle of John... the epistle of Peter... After them is to be placed, if it really seem proper, the Apocalypse of John, concerning which we shall give the different opinions at the proper time. These then belong among the accepted writings [Homologoumena].\\r\\n3. Among the disputed writings [Antilegomena], which are nevertheless recognized by many, are extant the so-called epistle of James and that of Jude, also the second epistle of Peter, and those that are called the second and third of John, whether they belong to the evangelist or to another person of the same name.\\r\\n4. Among the rejected [Kirsopp. Lake translation: \\"not genuine\\"] writings must be reckoned also the Acts of Paul, and the so-called Shepherd, and the Apocalypse of Peter, and in addition to these the extant epistle of Barnabas, and the so-called Teachings of the Apostles; and besides, as I said, the Apocalypse of John, if it seem proper, which some, as I said, reject, but which others class with the accepted books.\\r\\n5. And among these some have placed also the Gospel according to the Hebrews... And all these may be reckoned among the disputed books... such books as the Gospels of Peter, of Thomas, of Matthias, or of any others besides them, and the Acts of Andrew and John and the other apostles ... they clearly show themselves to be the fictions of heretics. Wherefore they are not to be placed even among the rejected writings, but are all of them to be cast aside as absurd and impious.\\r\\nThe Apocalypse of John, also called Revelation, is counted as both accepted (Kirsopp. Lake translation: \\"Recognized\\") and disputed, which has caused some confusion over what exactly Eusebius meant by doing so. The disputation perhaps attributed to Origen[72] (see also Pamphili & c.?330, 3.24.17ÿ18).[73] Pamphili & c.?330, 3.3.5 adds further detail on Paul: \\"Paul's fourteen epistles are well known and undisputed. It is not indeed right to overlook the fact that some have rejected the Epistle to the Hebrews, saying that it is disputed by the Church of Rome, on the ground that it was not written by Paul.\\" Pamphili & c.?330, 4.29.6 mentions the Diatessaron: \\"But their original founder, Tatian, formed a certain combination and collection of the Gospels, I know not how, to which he gave the title Diatessaron, and which is still in the hands of some. But they say that he ventured to paraphrase certain words of the apostle [Paul], in order to improve their style.\\"\\r\\nThe Codex Claromontanus ,[74] c. 303ÿ67,[75] a page found inserted into a 6th-century copy of the Epistles of Paul and Hebrews, has the Old Testament, including Tobit, Judith, Wisdom, Sirach, 1ÿ2,4 Maccabees, and the New Testament, plus Acts of Paul, Apocalypse of Peter, Barnabas, and Hermas, but missing Philippians, 1ÿ2 Thessalonians, and Hebrews.\\r\\nZahn and Harnack were of the opinion that the list had been drawn up originally in Greek at Alexandria or its neighborhood ~300 AD. According to Jlicher the list belongs to the 4th century and is probably of western origin.[citation needed]\\r\\nIn 331, Constantine I commissioned Eusebius to deliver fifty Bibles for the Church of Constantinople. Athanasius (Apol. Const. 4) recorded Alexandrian scribes around 340 preparing Bibles for Constans. Little else is known, though there is plenty of speculation. For example, it is speculated that this may have provided motivation for canon lists, and that Codex Vaticanus and Codex Sinaiticus may be examples of these Bibles. Together with the Peshitta and Codex Alexandrinus, these are the earliest extant Christian Bibles.[76]\\r\\nMcDonald & Sanders 2002, Appendix D-2, notes the following list of New Testament books from Cyril of Jerusalem (c. 350) from his Catechetical Lectures 4.36:\\r\\nGospels (4), Acts, James, 1ÿ2 Peter, 1ÿ3 John, Jude,[77] Paul's epistles (14), and Gospel of Thomas listed as pseudepigrapha.\\r\\nThe Council of Laodicea, c. 363, was one of the first councils that set out to judge which books were to be read aloud in churches. The decrees issued by the thirty or so clerics attending were called canons. Canon 59 decreed that only canonical books should be read, but no list was appended in the Latin and Syriac manuscripts recording the decrees. The list of canonical books, Canon 60, sometimes attributed to the Council of Laodicea is a later addition according to most scholars and has a 22-book OT and 26-book NT (excludes Revelation).[78][79]\\r\\nIn his Easter letter of 367,[80] Athanasius, Bishop of Alexandria, gave a list of exactly the same books as what would become the 27-book NT canon,[11] and he used the word \\"canonized\\" (kanonizomena) in regards to them.[81]\\r\\nThe Cheltenham List,[82][83] c. 365ÿ90, is a Latin list discovered by the German classical scholar Theodor Mommsen (published 1886) in a 10th-century manuscript (chiefly patristic) belonging to the library of Thomas Phillips at Cheltenham, England. The list probably originated in North Africa soon after the middle of the 4th century.\\r\\nIt has a 24-book Old Testament[84] and 24-book New Testament which provides syllable and line counts but omits Jude and James, and perhaps Hebrews, and seems to question the epistles of John and Peter beyond the first.\\r\\nMcDonald & Sanders 2002, Appendix D-2, writes the following list for Epiphanius of Salamis (c.?374ÿ77), from his Panarion 76.5:\\r\\nGospels (4), Paul's epistles (13), Acts, James, Peter, 1ÿ3 John, Jude, Rev, Wisdom, Sirach\\r\\nIn c. 380, the redactor of the Apostolic Constitutions attributed a canon to the Twelve Apostles themselves as the 85th of his list of such apostolic decrees:[85][86]\\r\\nCanon 85. Let the following books be esteemed venerable and holy by all of you, both clergy and laity. [A list of books of the Old Testament ...] And our sacred books, that is, of the New Testament, are the four Gospels, of Matthew, Mark, Luke, John; the fourteen Epistles of Paul; two Epistles of Peter; three of John; one of James; one of Jude; two Epistles of Clement; and the Constitutions dedicated to you, the bishops, by me, Clement, in eight books, which is not appropriate to make public before all, because of the mysteries contained in them; and the Acts of us, the Apostles.(From the Latin version.)\\r\\nIt is said that the Coptic translation and some Arabic version include Revelation.[85]\\r\\nBishop Amphilochius of Iconium, in his poem Iambics for Seleucus[87] written some time after 394, discusses debate over the inclusion of a number of books that should be received, and seems uncertain about the later Epistles of Peter and John, Jude, and Revelation.[88]\\r\\nPope Damasus's commissioning of the Latin Vulgate edition of the Bible to Jerome,[3] c. 383, was instrumental in the fixation of the canon in the West.[18] Pope Damasus I is often considered to be the father of the Catholic canon, since what is thought as his list corresponds to the current Catholic canon.[3] Purporting to date from a \\"Council of Rome\\" under Pope Damasus I in 382, the so-called \\"Damasian list\\" which some attributed to the Decretum Gelasianum[89] gives a list identical to what would be the Canon of Trent,[11] and, though the text may in fact not be Damasian, it is at least a valuable 6th century compilation.[90][91]\\r\\nThis list, given below, was purportedly endorsed by Pope Damasus I:\\r\\n[A list of books of the Old Testament ...], and in the New Testament: 4 books of Gospels, 1 book of Acts of the Apostles, 13 letters of the Apostle Paul, 1 of him to the Hebrews, 2 of Peter, 3 of John, 1 of James, 1 of Jude, and the Apocalypse of John.\\r\\nThe so-called Decretum Gelasianum de libris recipiendis et non recipiendis, is traditionally attributed to Pope Gelasius I, bishop of Rome 492ÿ496 AD. However, upon the whole it is probably of South Gallic origin (6th century), but several parts can be traced back to Pope Damasus and reflect Roman tradition. The 2nd part is a canon catalogue, and the 5th part is a catalogue of apocryphal writings which are to be rejected. The canon catalogue gives all 27 books of the Catholic New Testament.\\r\\nMcDonald & Sanders 2002, Appendix D-2, lists the following New Testament books according to Jerome, (c. 394), from his Epistle 53:\\r\\n\\"Lord's Four\\": Matt, Mark, Luke, John, Paul's Epistles (14), 1ÿ2 Peter, 1ÿ3 John, Jude, James, Acts, Rev.\\r\\nAugustine of Hippo declared that one is to \\"prefer those that are received by all Catholic Churches to those which some of them do not receive. Among those, again, which are not received by all, he will prefer such as have the sanction of the greater number and those of greater authority, to such as are held by the smaller number and those of less authority.\\" (On Christian Doctrines 2.12, chapter 8).[92]\\r\\nAugustine effectively forced his opinion on the Church by commanding three synods on canonicity: the Synod of Hippo in 393, the Synod of Carthage (397), and another in Carthage in 419 AD (M 237-8). Each of these reiterated the same Church law: \\"nothing shall be read in church under the name of the divine scriptures\\" except the Old Testament (including the Deuterocanonicals) and the 27 canonical books of the New Testament. It seems these decrees also declared by fiat that Epistle to the Hebrews was written by Paul, for a time ending all debate on the subject.\\r\\nThe first council that accepted the present canon of the books of the New Testament may have been the Synod of Hippo in North Africa (393). A brief summary of the acts was read at and accepted by the Synod of Carthage (397) and Council of Carthage (419).[13] These councils were convened under the authority of St. Augustine, who regarded the canon as already closed.[14][15][16] This North African canon reaffirmed at the Council of Trent of 1546.[3][4]\\r\\nIn c. 405, Pope Innocent I sent a list of the sacred books to a Gallic bishop, Exsuperius of Toulouse,[93] identical with that of Trent.[94][95][96] It states \\"fourteen\\" Epistles of Paul, but F.F. Bruce prefers \\"thirteen\\" excluding the Hebrews.[93] According to the Catholic Encyclopedia, by the turn of the 5th century, the Western Church under Pope Innocent I recognized a biblical canon including the four gospels of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John, which was previously established at a number of regional Synods, namely the Council of Rome (382), the Synod of Hippo (393), and two Councils of Carthage (397 and 419).[3]\\r\\nThe Eastern Churches had, in general, a weaker feeling than those in the West for the necessity of making a sharp delineation with regard to the canon. They were more conscious of the gradation of spiritual quality among the books that they accepted (e.g. the classification of Eusebius, see also Antilegomena) and were less often disposed to assert that the books which they rejected possessed no spiritual quality at all.[citation needed] Similarly, the New Testament canons of the Syriac, Armenian, Georgian, Egyptian Coptic and Ethiopian Churches all have minor differences.[97][page?needed] The Revelation of John is one of the most uncertain books; in the East, chiliasm and Montanism brought it under suspicion;[98] it was not translated into Georgian until the 10th century, and it has never been included in the official lectionary of the Eastern Orthodox Church, whether in Byzantine or modern times. However, its canonical status is recognized.[99]\\r\\nIn the 4th century, the Doctrine of Addai lists a 17-book NT canon using the Diatessaron and Acts and 15 Pauline epistles (including 3rd Corinthians). The Syriac Doctrine of Addai (c. 400) claims to record the oldest traditions of the Syrian church, and among these is the establishment of a canon: members of the church are to read only the Gospel (meaning the Diatessaron of Tatian), the Epistles of Paul (which are said to have been sent by Peter, from Rome), and the Book of Acts (which is said to have been sent by John the son of Zebedee, from Ephesus), and nothing else.\\r\\nFor centuries the Diatessaron, along with Acts and the Pauline Epistles (except Philemon), comprised the only accepted books in the Syrian churches, meaning that Tatian's stricter views, resulting in the rejection in 1 Timothy, did not win out. Moreover, after the pronouncements of the 4th century on the proper content of the Bible, Tatian was declared a heretic and in the early 4th century Bishop Theodoretus of Cyrrhus and Bishop Rabbula of Edessa (both in Syria) rooted out all copies they could find of the Diatessaron and replaced them with the four canonical Gospels (M 215). As a result, no early copies of the Diatessaron survivealthough a very early fragment suggests it would have been crucial evidence for the true state of the early Gospels (see IX).\\r\\nBy the 5th century, the Syrian Bible, called the Peshitta, was formalized, accepting Philemon, along with James, 1 Peter and 1 John, but excluding 2 John, 3 John, 2 Peter, Jude and Revelation. After the Council of Ephesus, the Church of the East became separated, and retained this canon of only 22-books (the Peshitta) up to the present day. The Syriac Orthodox Church uses this text as well (known in the West Syriac dialect as the Peshitto), but with the addition of the other books normally present in the New Testament canon.\\r\\nThe late-5th or early-6th century Peshitta of the Syrian Orthodox Church[100] includes a 22-book NT, excluding II Peter, II John, III John, Jude, and Revelation. The Lee Peshitta of 1823 follows the Protestant canon.\\r\\nMcDonald & Sanders 2002, lists the following Syrian catalogue of St. Catherine's, c. 400:\\r\\nGospels (4): Matt, Mark, Luke, John, Acts, Gal, Rom, Heb, Col, Eph, Phil, 1ÿ2 Thess, 1ÿ2 Tim, Titus, Phlm.\\r\\nThe Syriac Peshitta, used by all the various Syrian Churches, originally did not include 2 Peter, 2 John, 3 John, Jude and Revelation (and this canon of 22-books is the one cited by John Chrysostom (~347ÿ407) and Theodoret (393ÿ466) from the School of Antioch). It also includes Psalm 151 and Psalm 152ÿ155 and 2 Baruch. Western Syrians have added the remaining 5 books to their NT canons in modern times (such as the Lee Peshitta of 1823). Today, the official lectionaries followed by the Malankara Syrian Orthodox Church, with headquarters at Kottayam (India), and the Chaldean Syrian Church, also known as the Church of the East (Nestorian), with headquarters at Trichur (India), still present lessons from only the 22-books of the original Peshitta.[100][better?source?needed]\\r\\nThe Armenian Bible introduces one addition: a third letter to the Corinthians, also found in the Acts of Paul, which became canonized in the Armenian Church, but is not part of the Armenian Bible today. Revelation, however, was not accepted into the Armenian Bible until c. 1200, when Archbishop Nerses arranged an Armenian Synod at Constantinople to introduce the text.[101] Still, there were unsuccessful attempts even as late as 1290 to include in the Armenian canon several apocryphal books: Advice of the Mother of God to the Apostles, the Books of Criapos, and the ever-popular Epistle of Barnabas.\\r\\nThe Armenian Apostolic church at times has included the Testaments of the Twelve Patriarchs in its Old Testament and the Third Epistle to the Corinthians, but does not always list it with the other 27 canonical New Testament books.\\r\\nThe Coptic Bible (adopted by the Egyptian Church) includes the two Epistles of Clement, and the Ethiopic Bible includes books nowhere else found: the Sinodos (a collection of prayers and instructions supposedly written by Clement of Rome), the Octateuch (a book supposedly written by Peter to Clement of Rome), the Book of the Covenant (in two parts, the first details rules of church order, the second relates instructions from Jesus to the disciples given between the resurrection and the ascension), and the Didascalia (with more rules of church order, similar to the Apostolic Constitutions).\\r\\nThe New Testament of the Coptic Bible, adopted by the Egyptian Church, includes the two Epistles of Clement.[101] The canon of the Tewahedo Churches is somewhat looser than for other traditional Christian groups, and the order, naming, and chapter/verse division of some of the books is also slightly different.\\r\\nThe \\"broader\\" Ethiopian New Testament canon includes four books of \\"Sinodos\\" (church practices), two \\"Books of Covenant\\", \\"Ethiopic Clement\\", and \\"Ethiopic Didascalia\\" (Apostolic Church-Ordinances). However, these books have never been printed or widely studied. This \\"broader\\" canon is also sometimes said to include, with the Old Testament, an eight-part history of the Jews based on the writings of Flavius Josephus, and known as \\"Pseudo-Josephus\\" or \\"Joseph ben Gurion\\" (Yosf walda Koryon).[102][103]\\r\\nThe Encyclopedia of Theology says that the 27 books which make up the New Testament canon of Scripture are not based on a Scriptural list that authenticates them to be inspired, thus their legitimacy is considered impossible to be distinguished with certainty without appealing to another infallible source, such as the Magisterium of the Catholic Church which first assembled and authenticated this list at the Council of Rome.[104] Catholicism considers the Magisterium, i.e. the teaching authority, has equal position and linked together with Sacred Tradition and Sacred Scripture, each acts in its own way for the goodness of the Church.[105] Rejecting these, Protestant reformers focused on the doctrine of sola scriptura, i.e. the supreme authority of Scripture alone. Sola scriptura is one of the five solas, considered by some Protestant groups to be the theological pillars of the Protestant Reformation.[106]\\r\\nMartin Luther was troubled by four books, referred to as Luther's Antilegomena: Jude, James, Hebrews, and Revelation; and though he placed them in a secondary position relative to the rest, he did not exclude them. He did propose removing them from the canon,[107][108] echoing the consensus of several Catholics such as Cardinal Cajetan and Erasmus, and partially because they were perceived to go against certain Protestant doctrines such as sola gratia and sola fide, but this was not generally accepted among his followers. However, these books are ordered last in the German-language Luther Bible to this day.[109][110]\\r\\nAmong confessions of faith drawn up by Protestants, several identify by name the 27-books of the New Testament canon, including the French Confession of Faith (1559), the Belgic Confession (1561), and the Westminster Confession of Faith (1647) during the English Civil War. The Thirty-Nine Articles, issued by the Church of England in 1563, names the books of the Old Testament, but not the New Testament. None of the Confessional statements issued by any Lutheran church includes an explicit list of canonical books.\\r\\nMany Evangelical Christian groups (which have their origin in c. 1730 England) do not accept the theory that the Christian Bible was not known until various local and Ecumenical Councils, which they deem to be \\"Roman-dominated\\", made their official declarations.\\r\\nThese groups believe that the New Testament supports that Paul (2 Timothy 4:11ÿ13), Peter (2 Peter 3:15ÿ16), and ultimately John (Revelation 22:18ÿ19) finalized the canon of the New Testament. Some note that Peter, John, and Paul wrote 20 (or 21) of the 27-books of the NT and personally knew all the other NT writers. (Books not attributed to these three are: Matthew, Mark, Luke, Acts, James, and Jude. The authorship of Hebrews has long been disputed.)\\r\\nMany modern Protestants point to four \\"Criteria for Canonicity\\" to justify the books that have been included in the Old and New Testament, which are judged to have satisfied the following:\\r\\nThe basic factor for recognizing a book's canonicity for the New Testament was divine inspiration, and the chief test for this was apostolicity. The term apostolic as used for the test of canonicity does not necessarily mean apostolic authorship or derivation, but rather apostolic authority. Apostolic authority is never detached from the authority of the Lord. See Apostolic succession.\\r\\nIt is sometimes difficult to apply these criteria to all books in the accepted canon, however, and some point to books that Protestants hold as apocryphal which would fulfill these requirements. In practice, Protestants hold to the Jewish canon for the Old Testament and the Catholic canon for the New Testament.\\r\\nThe Council of Trent on April 8, 1546, approved the enforcement of the present Roman Catholic Bible Canon including the Deuterocanonical Books as an article of faith (the contents of the canon itself having already been reaffirmed unanimously), and the decision was confirmed by an anathema by vote (24 yea, 15 nay, 16 abstain).[111] This is said to be the same list as produced at the Council of Florence (Session 11, 4 February 1442),[112] Augustine's 397-419 Councils of Carthage,[4] and probably Damasus' 382 Council of Rome.[11][113] Because of its placement, the list was not considered binding for the Catholic Church, and in light of Martin Luther's demands, the Catholic Church examined the question of the Canon again at the Council of Trent, which reaffirmed the canon of previous councils and added the anathema against attempts to change the contents of the canon.\\r\\nVatican I on April 24, 1870 approved the additions to Mark (v. 16:9ÿ20), Luke (22:19bÿ20, 43ÿ44), and John (7:53ÿ8:11), which are not present in early manuscripts but are contained in the Vulgate edition.[114]\\r\\nPope Pius XI on June 2, 1927 decreed the Comma Johanneum was open to dispute.\\r\\nPope Pius XII on 3 September 1943 issued the encyclical Divino afflante Spiritu, which allowed translations based on texts other than the Latin Vulgate.\\r\\nThe Synod of Jerusalem in 1672 decreed the Greek Orthodox Canon which is similar as the one decided by the Council of Trent. They \\"call[ed] Sacred Scripture all those [books] which Cyril collected from the Synod of Laodicea, and enumerated, adding to Scripture those which he foolishly and ignorantly, or rather maliciously, called Apocrypha; specifically, [List of deuterocanonical books...].\\"\\r\\nBut it is to be noted that this was simply an affirmation of tradition, not a new canonization. As the Confession goes on to state, \\"ancient custom, or rather the Catholic Church, which has delivered to us as genuine the Sacred Gospels and the other Books of Scripture, has undoubtedly delivered these [deuterocanonical books] also as parts of Scripture.... And if, perhaps, it seems that not always have all of these been considered on the same level as the others, yet nevertheless these also have been counted and reckoned with the rest of Scripture, both by Synods and by many of the most ancient and eminent Theologians of the Catholic Church. All of these we also judge to be Canonical Books, and confess them to be Sacred Scripture...\\"[115]","input":"What is the canon of the new testament?"},{"output":"it perhaps derives from the Latin word norma, meaning \\"precept\\"","context":"Norma is a female name.

Soil liquefaction, fissures, landslides, and other ground failures caused major structural damage in several communities and much damage to property. Anchorage sustained great destruction or damage to many inadequately earthquake engineered houses, buildings, and infrastructure (paved streets, sidewalks, water and sewer mains, electrical systems, and other man-made equipment), particularly in the several landslide zones along Knik Arm. Two hundred miles southwest, some areas near Kodiak were permanently raised by 30 feet (9.1?m). Southeast of Anchorage, areas around the head of Turnagain Arm near Girdwood and Portage dropped as much as 8 feet (2.4?m), requiring reconstruction and fill to raise the Seward Highway above the new high tide mark.\\r\\nIn Prince William Sound, Port Valdez suffered a massive underwater landslide, resulting in the deaths of 30 people between the collapse of the Valdez city harbor and docks, and inside the ship that was docked there at the time. Nearby, a 27-foot (8.2?m) tsunami destroyed the village of Chenega, killing 23 of the 68 people who lived there; survivors out-ran the wave, climbing to high ground. Post-quake tsunamis severely affected Whittier, Seward, Kodiak, and other Alaskan communities, as well as people and property in British Columbia, Washington, Oregon, and California.[4] Tsunamis also caused damage in Hawaii and Japan. Evidence of motion directly related to the earthquake was also reported from Florida and Texas.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAt 5:36?p.m. Alaska Standard Time (3:36?a.m. March 28, 1964 UTC), a fault between the Pacific and North American plates ruptured near College Fjord in Prince William Sound. The epicenter of the earthquake was 12.4?mi (20?km) north of Prince William Sound, 78 miles (125?km) east of Anchorage and 40 miles (64?km) west of Valdez. The focus occurred at a depth of approximately 15.5?mi (25?km). Ocean floor shifts created large tsunamis (up to 220 feet (67 m) in height), which resulted in many of the deaths and much of the property damage.[5] Large rockslides were also caused, resulting in great property damage. Vertical displacement of up to 38 feet (11.5 m) occurred, affecting an area of 100,000 miles2 (250,000?km2) within Alaska.\\r\\nStudies of ground motion have led to a peak ground acceleration estimate of 0.14ÿ0.18 g.[6]\\r\\nThe Alaska earthquake was a subduction zone earthquake (megathrust earthquake), caused by an oceanic plate sinking under a continental plate. The fault responsible was the Aleutian Megathrust, a reverse fault caused by a compressional force. This caused much of the uneven ground which is the result of ground shifted to the opposite elevation.\\r\\nTwo types of tsunamis were produced by this subduction zone earthquake. There was a tectonic tsunami produced in addition to about 20 smaller and local tsunamis. These smaller tsunamis were produced by submarine and subaerial landslides and were responsible for the majority of the tsunami damage. Tsunami waves were noted in over 20 countries, including: Peru, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, Japan, Mexico and Antarctica. The largest tsunami wave was recorded in Shoup Bay, Alaska, with a height of about 220?ft (67?m).[3] Tremors were detected in water wells in Australia.[7]\\r\\nAs a result of the earthquake, 139 people are believed to have died:[3] Fifteen died as a result of the earthquake itself, 106 died from the subsequent tsunami in Alaska,[8] 5 died from the tsunami in Oregon, and 13 died from the tsunami in California. The quake was a reported XI on the modified Mercalli Intensity scale \\"indicating major structural damage, and ground fissures and failures\\".[9] Property damage was estimated at about $311 million[3] ($2.32?billion in current U.S. dollars). It is likely that the toll would have been much higher had the quake not occurred after 5 pm on Good Friday.[7]\\r\\nMost damage occurred in Anchorage, 75?mi (120?km) northwest of the epicenter. Anchorage was not hit by tsunamis, but downtown Anchorage was heavily damaged, and parts of the city built on sandy bluffs overlying \\"Bootlegger Cove clay\\" near Cook Inlet, most notably the Turnagain neighborhood, suffered landslide damage. The neighborhood lost 75 houses in the landslide, and the destroyed area has since been turned into Earthquake Park. The Government Hill school suffered from the Government Hill landslide, leaving it in two jagged, broken pieces. Land overlooking the Ship Creek valley near the Alaska Railroad yards also slid, destroying many acres of buildings and city blocks in downtown Anchorage. Most other areas of the city were only moderately damaged. The 60-foot (18 m) concrete control tower at Anchorage International Airport was not engineered to withstand earthquake activity and collapsed, killing William George Taylor, the Federal Aviation Agency air traffic controller on duty in the tower cab at the time the earthquake began.[10]\\r\\nOne house on W. 10th Avenue suffered peripheral damage, but only one block away the recently completed (and still unoccupied) Four Seasons Building on Ninth Avenue collapsed completely, with the concrete elevator shafts sticking up out of the rubble like a seesaw.\\r\\nThe hamlets of Girdwood and Portage, located 30 and 40?mi (60?km) southeast of central Anchorage on the Turnagain Arm, were destroyed by subsidence and subsequent tidal action. Girdwood was relocated inland and Portage was abandoned. About 20 miles (32?km) of the Seward Highway sank below the high-water mark of Turnagain Arm; the highway and its bridges were raised and rebuilt in 1964ÿ66.\\r\\nMost coastal towns in the Prince William Sound, Kenai Peninsula, and Kodiak Island areas, especially the major ports of Seward, Whittier and Kodiak were heavily damaged by a combination of seismic activity, subsidence, post-quake tsunamis and/or earthquake-caused fires. Valdez was not totally destroyed, but after three years, the town relocated to higher ground 7?km (4?mi) west of its original site. Some Alaska Native villages, including Chenega and Afognak, were destroyed or damaged. The earthquake caused the Cold-War era ballistic missile detection radar of Clear Air Force Station to go offline for six minutes, the only unscheduled interruption in its operational history. Near Cordova, the Million Dollar Bridge crossing the Copper River also collapsed. The community of Girdwood was also confined to the southern side of the Seward Highway when water rushed into Turnagain Arm and flooded or destroyed any buildings left standing to the north of the highway. Interestingly, only the ground immediately along the highway and that on the north side of the road dropped, prompting geologists to speculate that Girdwood may rest upon an ancient cliff face, now covered by countless thousands of years of sediment and glacial deposits.[citation needed]\\r\\nA 4.5?ft (1.4 m) wave reached Prince Rupert, British Columbia, just south of the Alaska Panhandle, about three hours after the earthquake. The tsunami then reached Tofino, on the exposed west coast of Vancouver Island, and traveled up a fjord to hit Port Alberni twice, washing away 55 homes and damaging 375 others. The towns of Hot Springs Cove, Zeballos, and Amai also saw damage.[11] The damage in British Columbia was estimated at $10 million Canadian (or $78.3?million in today's Canadian dollars, or $58.3?million in today's U.S. dollars).\\r\\nTwelve people were killed by the tsunami in or near Crescent City, California, while four children were killed on the Oregon coast at Beverly Beach State Park.[12] Other coastal towns in the U.S. Pacific Northwest and Hawaii were damaged. Minor damage to boats occurred as far south as Los Angeles.[13] Effects of the earthquake were even noted as far east as Texas. Tide gauges in Freeport recorded waves similar to seismic surface waves.[14] In the Florida Everglades, an artesian aquifer located near Lake Chekika saw its water flow rate double from 3 million gallons per day to 6 million gallons per day, 60 to 90 minutes after the first shock of the earthquake.[15]\\r\\nThere were hundreds of aftershocks in the first weeks following the main shock. In the first day alone, eleven major aftershocks were recorded with a magnitude greater than 6.0. Nine more struck over the next three weeks. In all, thousands of aftershocks occurred in the months following the quake, and smaller aftershocks continued to strike the region for more than a year.[13]\\r\\nAlaska had never experienced a major disaster in a highly populated area before, and had very limited resources for dealing with the effects of such an event. The military, which has a large active presence in Alaska, stepped in to assist within moments of the end of the quake. The Army rapidly re-established communications with the lower 48 states, deployed troops to assist the citizens of Anchorage, and dispatched a convoy to Valdez.[16] On the advice of military and civilian leaders, President Johnson declared all Alaska a major disaster area the day after the quake. The Navy and Coast Guard deployed ships to isolated coastal communities to assist with immediate needs. Bad weather and poor visibility hampered efforts at air rescue and observation efforts the day after the quake, but on Sunday the 29th the situation improved and rescue helicopters and observation aircraft were deployed.[16] A military airlift immediately began shipping relief supplies to Alaska, eventually delivering 2,570,000 pounds (1,170,000?kg) of food and other supplies.[17]\\r\\nIn the longer term, the US Army Corps of Engineers led the effort to rebuild roads, clear debris, and establish new townsites for communities that had been completely destroyed, at a cost of $110 million.[17] The West Coast and Alaska Tsunami Warning Center was formed as a direct response to the disaster. Federal disaster relief funds paid for reconstruction as well as financially supporting the devastated infrastructure of Alaska's government, spending hundreds of millions of dollars that helped keep Alaska financially solvent until the discovery of massive oil deposits at Prudhoe Bay. At the order of the Defense Department, the Alaska National Guard founded the Alaska Division of Emergency Services to respond to any future disasters.[16]","input":"What was the magnitude of the 1964 alaska earthquake?"},{"output":"Divine Comedy","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nDurante degli Alighieri (Italian:?[du?rante de?? ali?j??ri]), commonly known by his short name Dante Alighieri or simply as Dante (Italian:?[?dante]; English: /?d?nte?/, UK also /?d?nti, -te?/; c.?1265 ÿ 1321), was a major Italian poet of the Late Middle Ages. His Divine Comedy, originally called Comeda (modern Italian: Commedia) and later christened Divina by Giovanni Boccaccio, is widely considered the most important poem of the Middle Ages and the greatest literary work in the Italian language.[1][2]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the late Middle Ages, most poetry was written in Latin, accessible only to the most educated readers. In De vulgari eloquentia (On Eloquence in the Vernacular), however, Dante defended the use of the vernacular in literature. He would even write in the Tuscan dialect for works such as The New Life (1295) and the Divine Comedy; this highly unorthodox choice set a precedent that important later Italian writers such as Petrarch and Boccaccio would follow. \\r\\n\\r\\nDante was instrumental in establishing the literature of Italy, and his depictions of Hell, Purgatory and Heaven provided inspiration for the larger body of Western art.[3][4] He is cited as an influence on John Milton, Geoffrey Chaucer and Alfred Tennyson, among many others. In addition, the first use of the interlocking three-line rhyme scheme, or the terza rima, is attributed to him.  In Italy, he is often referred to as il Sommo Poeta (\\"the Supreme Poet\\") and il Poeta; he, Petrarch, and Boccaccio are also called \\"the three fountains\\" or \\"the three crowns\\".\\r\\n\\r\\nDante was born in Florence, Republic of Florence, present-day Italy. The exact date of his birth is unknown, although it is generally believed to be around 1265. This can be deduced from autobiographic allusions in the Divine Comedy. Its first section, the Inferno, begins, \\"Nel mezzo del cammin di nostra vita\\" (\\"Midway upon the journey of our life\\"), implying that Dante was around 35 years old, since the average lifespan according to the Bible (Psalm 89:10, Vulgate) is 70 years; and since his imaginary travel to the netherworld took place in 1300, he was most probably born around 1265. Some verses of the Paradiso section of the Divine Comedy also provide a possible clue that he was born under the sign of Gemini: \\"As I revolved with the eternal twins, I saw revealed, from hills to river outlets, the threshing-floor that makes us so ferocious\\" (XXII?151ÿ154). In 1265, the sun was in Gemini between approximately May 11 and June 11 (Julian calendar).[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nGiovanni Boccaccio described Dante's appearance and demeanor as follows: \\"the poet was of middle height, and in his later years he walked somewhat bent over, with a grave and gentle gait. He was clad always in most seemly attire, such as befitted his ripe years. His face was long, his nose aquiline, and his eyes big rather than small. His jaws were large, and his lower lip protruded. He had a brown complexion, his hair and beard were thick, black, and curly, and his countenance was always melancholy and thoughtful.\\"[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nDante claimed that his family descended from the ancient Romans (Inferno, XV, 76), but the earliest relative he could mention by name was Cacciaguida degli Elisei (Paradiso, XV, 135), born no earlier than about 1100. Dante's father, Alighiero[7] or Alighiero di Bellincione, was a White Guelph who suffered no reprisals after the Ghibellines won the Battle of Montaperti in the middle of the 13th?century. This suggests that Alighiero or his family may have enjoyed some protective prestige and status, although some suggest that the politically inactive Alighiero was of such low standing that he was not considered worth exiling.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nDante's family was loyal to the Guelphs, a political alliance that supported the Papacy and which was involved in complex opposition to the Ghibellines, who were backed by the Holy Roman Emperor. The poet's mother was Bella, likely a member of the Abati family.[7] She died when Dante was not yet ten years old, and Alighiero soon married again, to Lapa di Chiarissimo Cialuffi. It is uncertain whether he really married her, since widowers were socially limited in such matters, but this woman definitely bore him two children, Dante's half-brother Francesco and half-sister Tana (Gaetana). When Dante was 12, he was promised in marriage to Gemma di Manetto Donati, daughter of Manetto Donati, member of the powerful Donati family.[7] Contracting marriages at this early age was quite common and involved a formal ceremony, including contracts signed before a notary. But by this time Dante had fallen in love with another, Beatrice Portinari (known also as Bice), whom he first met when he was only nine. Years after his marriage to Gemma he claims to have met Beatrice again; he wrote several sonnets to Beatrice but never mentioned Gemma in any of his poems. The exact date of his marriage is not known: the only certain information is that, before his exile in 1301, he had three children (Pietro, Jacopo and Antonia).[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nDante fought with the Guelph cavalry at the Battle of Campaldino (June 11, 1289).[9] This victory brought about a reformation of the Florentine constitution. To take any part in public life, one had to enroll in one of the city's many commercial or artisan guilds, so Dante entered the Physicians' and Apothecaries' Guild. In the following years, his name is occasionally recorded as speaking or voting in the various councils of the republic. A substantial portion of minutes from such meetings in the years 1298ÿ1300 was lost, however, so the true extent of Dante's participation in the city's councils is uncertain.\\r\\n\\r\\nGemma bore Dante several children. Although several others subsequently claimed to be his offspring, it is likely that only Jacopo, Pietro, Giovanni, and Antonia were his actual children. Antonia later became a nun, taking the name Sister Beatrice.\\r\\n\\r\\nNot much is known about Dante's education; he presumably studied at home or in a chapter school attached to a church or monastery in Florence. It is known that he studied Tuscan poetry and that he admired the compositions of the Bolognese poet Guido Guinizelliwhom in Purgatorio XXVI he characterized as his \\"father\\"at a time when the Sicilian school (Scuola poetica Siciliana), a cultural group from Sicily, was becoming known in Tuscany. His interests brought him to discover the Proven?al poetry of the troubadours, such as Arnaut Daniel, and the Latin writers of classical antiquity, including Cicero, Ovid and especially Virgil.[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nDante said he first met Beatrice Portinari, daughter of Folco Portinari, at age nine, and claimed to have fallen in love with her \\"at first sight\\", apparently without even talking with her.[11] He saw her frequently after age 18, often exchanging greetings in the street, but never knew her well. In effect, he set an example of so-called courtly love, a phenomenon developed in French and Proven?al poetry of prior centuries. Dante's experience of such love was typical, but his expression of it was unique. It was in the name of this love that Dante left his imprint on the dolce stil novo (sweet new style, a term which Dante himself coined), and he would join other contemporary poets and writers in exploring never-before-emphasized aspects of love (Amore). Love for Beatrice (as Petrarch would show for Laura somewhat differently) would be his reason for poetry and for living, together with political passions. In many of his poems, she is depicted as semi-divine, watching over him constantly and providing spiritual instruction, sometimes harshly. When Beatrice died in 1290, Dante sought refuge in Latin literature.[12] The Convivio chronicles his having read Boethius's De consolatione philosophiae and Cicero's De Amicitia. He then dedicated himself to philosophical studies at religious schools like the Dominican one in Santa Maria Novella. He took part in the disputes that the two principal mendicant orders (Franciscan and Dominican) publicly or indirectly held in Florence, the former explaining the doctrines of the mystics and of St. Bonaventure, the latter expounding on the theories of St. Thomas Aquinas.[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nAt 18, Dante met Guido Cavalcanti, Lapo Gianni, Cino da Pistoia and soon after Brunetto Latini; together they became the leaders of the dolce stil novo. Brunetto later received special mention in the Divine Comedy (Inferno, XV, 28) for what he had taught Dante: Nor speaking less on that account I go With Ser Brunetto, and I ask who are his most known and most eminent companions.[14] Some fifty poetical commentaries by Dante are known (the so-called Rime, rhymes), others being included in the later Vita Nuova and Convivio. Other studies are reported, or deduced from Vita Nuova or the Comedy, regarding painting and music.\\r\\n\\r\\nDante, like most Florentines of his day, was embroiled in the GuelphÿGhibelline conflict. He fought in the Battle of Campaldino (June 11, 1289), with the Florentine Guelphs against Arezzo Ghibellines;[9][15] then in 1294 he was among the escorts of Charles Martel of Anjou (grandson of Charles?I of Anjou) while he was in Florence. To further his political career, he became a pharmacist. He did not intend to practice as one, but a law issued in 1295 required nobles aspiring to public office to be enrolled in one of the Corporazioni delle Arti e dei Mestieri, so Dante obtained admission to the Apothecaries' Guild. This profession was not inappropriate since at that time books were sold from apothecaries' shops. As a politician, he accomplished little but held various offices over some years in a city rife with political unrest.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter defeating the Ghibellines, the Guelphs divided into two factions: the White Guelphs (Guelfi Bianchi)Dante's party, led by Vieri dei Cerchiand the Black Guelphs (Guelfi Neri), led by Corso Donati. Although the split was along family lines at first, ideological differences arose based on opposing views of the papal role in Florentine affairs, with the Blacks supporting the Pope and the Whites wanting more freedom from Rome. The Whites took power first and expelled the Blacks. In response, Pope Boniface VIII planned a military occupation of Florence. In 1301, Charles of Valois, brother of King Philip IV of France, was expected to visit Florence because the Pope had appointed him peacemaker for Tuscany. But the city's government had treated the Pope's ambassadors badly a few weeks before, seeking independence from papal influence. It was believed that Charles had received other unofficial instructions, so the council sent a delegation to Rome to ascertain the Pope's intentions. Dante was one of the delegates.\\r\\n\\r\\nPope Boniface quickly dismissed the other delegates and asked Dante alone to remain in Rome. At the same time (November 1, 1301), Charles of Valois entered Florence with the Black Guelphs, who in the next six days destroyed much of the city and killed many of their enemies. A new Black Guelph government was installed, and Cante dei Gabrielli da Gubbio was appointed podest of the city. In March 1302, Dante, a White Guelph by affiliation, along with the Gherardini family, was condemned to exile for two years and ordered to pay a large fine.[16] Dante was accused of corruption and financial wrongdoing by the Black Guelphs for the time that Dante was serving as city prior (Florence's highest position) for two months in 1300.[17] The poet was still in Rome in 1302 where the Pope, who had backed the Black Guelphs, had \\"suggested\\" that Dante stay. Florence under the Black Guelphs therefore considered Dante an absconder.[18] Dante did not pay the fine, in part because he believed he was not guilty and in part because all his assets in Florence had been seized by the Black Guelphs. He was condemned to perpetual exile; if he returned to Florence without paying the fine, he could have been burned at the stake. (In June 2008, nearly seven centuries after his death, the city council of Florence passed a motion rescinding Dante's sentence.)[19]\\r\\n\\r\\nHe took part in several attempts by the White Guelphs to regain power, but these failed due to treachery. Dante, bitter at the treatment he received from his enemies, also grew disgusted with the infighting and ineffectiveness of his erstwhile allies and vowed to become a party of one. He went to Verona as a guest of Bartolomeo I della Scala, then moved to Sarzana in Liguria. Later he is supposed to have lived in Lucca with a woman called Gentucca, who made his stay comfortable (and was later gratefully mentioned in Purgatorio, XXIV, 37). Some speculative sources claim he visited Paris between 1308 and 1310, and other sources even less trustworthy took him to Oxford: these claims, first occurring in Boccaccio's book on Dante several decades after his death, seem inspired by readers who were impressed with the poet's wide learning and erudition. Evidently, Dante's command of philosophy and his literary interests deepened in exile and when he was no longer busy with the day-to-day business of Florentine domestic politics, and this is evidenced in his prose writings in this period, but there is no real evidence that he ever left Italy. Dante's Immensa Dei dilectione testante to Henry VII of Luxembourg confirms his residence \\"beneath the springs of Arno, near Tuscany\\" in March 1311.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1310, Holy Roman Emperor Henry VII of Luxembourg marched into Italy at the head of 5,000 troops. Dante saw in him a new Charlemagne who would restore the office of the Holy Roman Emperor to its former glory and also retake Florence from the Black Guelphs. He wrote to Henry and several Italian princes, demanding that they destroy the Black Guelphs. Mixing religion and private concerns in his writings, he invoked the worst anger of God against his city and suggested several particular targets that were also his personal enemies. It was during this time that he wrote De Monarchia, proposing a universal monarchy under Henry VII.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt some point during his exile, he conceived of the Comedy, but the date is uncertain. The work is much more assured and on a larger scale than anything he had produced in Florence; it is likely he would have undertaken such a work only after he realized his political ambitions, which had been central to him up to his banishment, had been halted for some time, possibly forever. It is also noticeable that Beatrice has returned to his imagination with renewed force and with a wider meaning than in the Vita Nuova; in Convivio (written c. 1304ÿ07) he had declared that the memory of this youthful romance belonged to the past.\\r\\n\\r\\nAn early outside indication that the poem was underway is a notice by Francesco da Barberino, tucked into his Documenti d'Amore (Lessons of Love), written probably in 1314 or early 1315. Speaking of Virgil, Francesco notes in appreciative words that Dante followed the Roman classic in a poem called \\"Comedy\\" and that the setting of this poem (or part of it) was the underworld; i.e., hell.[20] The brief note gives no incontestable indication that he himself had seen or read even the Inferno or that this part had been published at the time, but it indicates composition was well underway and that the sketching of the poem might have begun some years before. (It has been suggested that a knowledge of Dante's work also underlies some of the illuminations in Francesco da Barberino's earlier Officiolum [c. 1305ÿ08], a manuscript that came to light only in 2003.[21]) We know that the Inferno had been published by 1317; this is established by quoted lines interspersed in the margins of contemporary dated records from Bologna, but there is no certainty as to whether the three parts of the poem were each published in full or, rather, a few cantos at a time. Paradiso seems to have been published posthumously.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Florence, Baldo d'Aguglione pardoned most of the White Guelphs in exile and allowed them to return. However, Dante had gone too far in his violent letters to Arrigo (Henry VII) and his sentence was not revoked.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1312 Henry assaulted Florence and defeated the Black Guelphs, but there is no evidence that Dante was involved. Some say he refused to participate in the assault on his city by a foreigner; others suggest that he had become unpopular with the White Guelphs, too, and that any trace of his passage had carefully been removed. Henry VII died (from a fever) in 1313, and with him any hope for Dante to see Florence again. He returned to Verona, where Cangrande I della Scala allowed him to live in certain security and, presumably, in a fair degree of prosperity. Cangrande was admitted to Dante's Paradise (Paradiso, XVII, 76).\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the period of his exile Dante corresponded with Dominican theologian Fr. Nicholas Brunacci OP [1240ÿ1322] who had been a student of Thomas Aquinas at the Santa Sabina studium in Rome, and later at Paris.[22][23] and of Albert the Great at the Cologne studium.[24] Brunacci became lector at the Santa Sabina studium, forerunner of the Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas, and later served in the papal curia.[25]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1315, Florence was forced by Uguccione della Faggiuola (the military officer controlling the town) to grant an amnesty to those in exile, including Dante. But for this, Florence required public penance in addition to a heavy fine. Dante refused, preferring to remain in exile. When Uguccione defeated Florence, Dante's death sentence was commuted to house arrest on condition that he go to Florence to swear he would never enter the town again. He refused to go, and his death sentence was confirmed and extended to his sons. He still hoped late in life that he might be invited back to Florence on honorable terms. For Dante, exile was nearly a form of death, stripping him of much of his identity and his heritage. He addressed the pain of exile in Paradiso, XVII (55ÿ60), where Cacciaguida, his great-great-grandfather, warns him what to expect:\\r\\n\\r\\n... Tu lascerai ogne cosa diletta\\r\\npi caramente; e questo  quello strale\\r\\nche l'arco de lo essilio pria saetta.\\r\\nTu proverai s come sa di sale\\r\\nlo pane altrui, e come  duro calle\\r\\nlo scendere e 'l salir per l'altrui scale ...\\r\\n\\r\\n... You shall leave everything you love most:\\r\\nthis is the arrow that the bow of exile\\r\\nshoots first. You are to know the bitter taste\\r\\nof others' bread, how salty it is, and know\\r\\nhow hard a path it is for one who goes\\r\\nascending and descending others' stairs ...\\r\\n\\r\\nAs for the hope of returning to Florence, he describes it as if he had already accepted its impossibility (in Paradiso, XXV, 1ÿ9):\\r\\n\\r\\nSe mai continga che 'l poema sacro\\r\\nal quale ha posto mano e cielo e terra,\\r\\ns che m'ha fatto per molti anni macro,\\r\\nvinca la crudelt che fuor mi serra\\r\\ndel bello ovile ov'io dormi' agnello,\\r\\nnimico ai lupi che li danno guerra;\\r\\ncon altra voce omai, con altro vello\\r\\nritorner poeta, e in sul fonte\\r\\ndel mio battesmo prender 'l cappello ...\\r\\n\\r\\nIf it ever comes to pass that the sacred poem\\r\\nto which both heaven and earth have set their hand\\r\\nso as to have made me lean for many years\\r\\nshould overcome the cruelty that bars me\\r\\nfrom the fair sheepfold where I slept as a lamb,\\r\\nan enemy to the wolves that make war on it,\\r\\nwith another voice now and other fleece\\r\\nI shall return a poet and at the font\\r\\nof my baptism take the laurel crown ...\\r\\n\\r\\nAlighieri accepted Prince Guido Novello da Polenta's invitation to Ravenna in 1318. He finished Paradiso and died in 1321 (aged 56) while returning to Ravenna from a diplomatic mission to Venice, possibly of malaria contracted there. He was buried in Ravenna at the Church of San Pier Maggiore (later called San Francesco). Bernardo Bembo, praetor of Venice, erected a tomb for him in 1483.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the grave, some verses of Bernardo Canaccio, a friend of Dante, dedicated to Florence:\\r\\n\\r\\nparvi Florentia mater amoris\\r\\n\\r\\nFlorence, mother of little love\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first formal biography of Dante was the Vita di Dante (also known as Trattatello in laude di Dante), written after 1348 by Giovanni Boccaccio.[26] Although several statements and episodes of it have been deemed unreliable on the basis of modern research, an earlier account of Dante's life and works had been included in the Nuova Cronica of the Florentine chronicler Giovanni Villani.[27]\\r\\n\\r\\nFlorence eventually came to regret Dante's exile, and the city made repeated requests for the return of his remains. The custodians of the body in Ravenna refused, at one point going so far as to conceal the bones in a false wall of the monastery. Nonetheless, a tomb was built for him in Florence in 1829, in the Basilica of Santa Croce. That tomb has been empty ever since, with Dante's body remaining in Ravenna, far from the land he had loved so dearly. The front of his tomb in Florence reads Onorate l'altissimo poetawhich roughly translates as \\"Honor the most exalted poet\\". The phrase is a quote from the fourth canto of the Inferno, depicting Virgil's welcome as he returns among the great ancient poets spending eternity in limbo. The ensuing line, L'ombra sua torna, ch'era dipartita (\\"his spirit, which had left us, returns\\"), is poignantly absent from the empty tomb.\\r\\n\\r\\nItaly's first dreadnought battleship was completed in 1913 and named Dante Alighieri in honor of him.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn April 30, 1921, in honor of the 600th anniversary of Dante's death, Pope Benedict XV promulgated an encyclical named In praeclara summorum, calling him one \\"of the many celebrated geniuses of whom the Catholic faith can boast\\" and the \\"pride and glory of humanity\\".[28]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2007, a reconstruction of Dante's face was undertaken in a collaborative project. Artists from Pisa University and engineers at the University of Bologna at Forl constructed the model, portraying Dante's features as somewhat different from what was once thought.[29][30]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2008, the Municipality of Florence officially apologized for expelling Dante 700 years earlier.[31][32][33][34]\\r\\n\\r\\nA celebration was held in 2015 for the 750th anniversary of his birth.[35][36]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Divine Comedy describes Dante's journey through Hell (Inferno), Purgatory (Purgatorio), and Paradise (Paradiso); he is first guided by the Roman poet Virgil and then by Beatrice, the subject of his love (and of another of his works, La Vita Nuova). While the vision of Hell, the Inferno, is vivid for most modern readers, the theological niceties presented in the other books require a certain amount of patience and knowledge to appreciate. Purgatorio is arguably the most lyrical of the three, referencing more contemporary poets and artists than Inferno; Paradiso is the most heavily theological, and the one in which, many scholars have argued, the Divine Comedy's most beautiful and mystic passages appear (e.g., when Dante looks into the face of God: \\"all'alta fantasia qui manc possa\\"\\"at this high moment, ability failed my capacity to describe,\\" Paradiso, XXXIII, 142).\\r\\n\\r\\nWith its seriousness of purpose, its literary stature and the rangeboth stylistic and thematicof its content, the Comedy soon became a cornerstone in the evolution of Italian as an established literary language. Dante was more aware than most early Italian writers of the variety of Italian dialects and of the need to create a literature and a unified literary language beyond the limits of Latin writing at the time; in that sense, he is a forerunner of the Renaissance, with its effort to create vernacular literature in competition with earlier classical writers. Dante's in-depth knowledge (within the limits of his time) of Roman antiquity, and his evident admiration for some aspects of pagan Rome, also point forward to the 15th century. Ironically, while he was widely honored in the centuries after his death, the Comedy slipped out of fashion among men of letters: too medieval, too rough and tragic, and not stylistically refined in the respects that the high and late Renaissance came to demand of literature.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe wrote the Comedy in a language he called \\"Italian\\", in some sense an amalgamated literary language mostly based on the regional dialect of Tuscany, but with some elements of Latin and other regional dialects.[37] He deliberately aimed to reach a readership throughout Italy including laymen, clergymen and other poets. By creating a poem of epic structure and philosophic purpose, he established that the Italian language was suitable for the highest sort of expression. In French, Italian is sometimes nicknamed la langue de Dante. Publishing in the vernacular language marked Dante as one of the first in Roman Catholic Western Europe (among others such as Geoffrey Chaucer and Giovanni Boccaccio) to break free from standards of publishing in only Latin (the language of liturgy, history and scholarship in general, but often also of lyric poetry). This break set a precedent and allowed more literature to be published for a wider audience, setting the stage for greater levels of literacy in the future. However, unlike Boccaccio, Milton or Ariosto, Dante did not really become an author read all over Europe until the Romantic era. To the Romantics, Dante, like Homer and Shakespeare, was a prime example of the \\"original genius\\" who sets his own rules, creates persons of overpowering stature and depth, and goes far beyond any imitation of the patterns of earlier masters; and who, in turn, cannot truly be imitated. Throughout the 19th century, Dante's reputation grew and solidified; and by 1865, the 600th anniversary of his birth, he had become established as one of the greatest literary icons of the Western world.\\r\\n\\r\\nNew readers often wonder how such a serious work may be called a \\"comedy\\". In the classical sense the word comedy refers to works which reflect belief in an ordered universe, in which events tend toward not only a happy or amusing ending but one influenced by a Providential will that orders all things to an ultimate good. By this meaning of the word, as Dante himself wrote in a letter to Cangrande I della Scala, the progression of the pilgrimage from Hell to Paradise is the paradigmatic expression of comedy, since the work begins with the pilgrim's moral confusion and ends with the vision of God.\\r\\n\\r\\nDante's other works include Convivio (\\"The Banquet\\"),[38] a collection of his longest poems with an (unfinished) allegorical commentary; De Monarchia,[39] a summary treatise of political philosophy in Latin which was condemned and burned after Dante's death[40][41] by the Papal Legate Bertrando del Poggetto, which argues for the necessity of a universal or global monarchy in order to establish universal peace in this life, and this monarchy's relationship to the Roman Catholic Church as guide to eternal peace; De vulgari eloquentia (\\"On the Eloquence of Vernacular\\"),[42] on vernacular literature, partly inspired by the Razos de trobar of Raimon Vidal de Bezaudun; and La Vita Nuova (\\"The New Life\\"),[43] the story of his love for Beatrice Portinari, who also served as the ultimate symbol of salvation in the Comedy. The Vita Nuova contains many of Dante's love poems in Tuscan, which was not unprecedented; the vernacular had been regularly used for lyric works before, during all the thirteenth century. However, Dante's commentary on his own work is also in the vernacularboth in the Vita Nuova and in the Convivioinstead of the Latin that was almost universally used. References to Divina Commedia are in the format (book, canto, verse), e.g., (Inferno, XV, 76).","input":"What was the most celebrated literary work of the middle ages?"},{"output":"Davy Jones","context":"50 cannons:\\r\\nThe Flying Dutchman, or simply referred to as the Dutchman, is a fictional ship in Disney's Pirates of the Caribbean. The ship made its first appearance in Dead Man's Chest under the command of the fictional captain, Davy Jones. The story and attributes of the ship were inspired by the actual Flying Dutchman of nautical lore.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAs explained in the movie, the character of Davy Jones was given the Flying Dutchman by Calypso, his lover, to ferry souls lost at sea to the afterlife.[1] When she neglected to meet him after his first ten years of duty, he was both heartbroken and enraged.[2] He abandoned his duties and chose to wander the seas, doing as he pleased. This violation of his duty placed a curse on Jones and his crew, slowly transforming them into monsters. Apparently, the Dutchman is also believed to be nautical lore in the Pirates universe, as character James Norrington mockingly remarks, \\"[Davy Jones]...captain of the Flying Dutchman?.\\" The fictional Dutchman is also known as a fearful ship to those who are superstitious, and able to destroy any vessel (using the Kraken).\\r\\nIn Dead Man's Chest, the Dutchman makes its first appearance when it rises from the sea to claim its victims' souls following a Kraken attack (instigated by Davy Jones). The Dutchman, able to sail on the sea and underwater, emits terror and potency to those unfortunate enough to cross its path. Davy Jones captures from the ship wreckage and demands that Jack Sparrow settle his overdue debt. Sparrow bargains for his life, and Jones finally agrees to accept 100 souls in exchange for Sparrow's, keeping Turner as \\"a good faith payment\\".\\r\\nWill is reunited with his father, \\"Bootstrap Bill\\" Turner, who is an indentured sailor aboard the Flying Dutchman. Shipboard life is harsh, and the crew is often whipped by the cruel boatswain, Jimmy Legs. Will is also flogged, although it is his father who delivers the lash to spare his son from the boatswain's sadistic hand. With his father's help, Will escapes the Dutchman, but when the ship he reaches is attacked by the Kraken, he sneaks back aboard as a stowaway, making his way to Isla Cruces where Jones' heart is buried in the Dead Man's Chest. Will finds Elizabeth and Sparrow on Isla Cruces. The three escape the island on the Black Pearl, pursued by the Dutchman (who loses the Pearl in less than a minute). Jones unleashes the Kraken, which attacks the Pearl and drags Sparrow to Davy Jones' Locker.\\r\\nIn At World's End, Captain Davy Jones now serves Lord Cutler Beckett, who possesses Jones' heart and forcibly controls him and the Flying Dutchman, which is first seen rising from the sea, mercilessly destroying pirate ships with its powerful cannons. This irritates Lord Beckett who wants survivors to interrogate. So to ensure Jones does as he is ordered to, Beckett places Admiral James Norrington and a squad of East India Trading company marines and the Dead Man's chest placed on board as well to remind Jones he is under their control. The Dutchman accompanies Beckett's flagship, Endeavour in its mission to eradicate piracy. When the Dutchman attacks Sao Feng's ship, the Empress, it takes its crew captive (Elizabeth Swan captain by the dying Sao Feng). Elizabeth and her crew escape the Dutchman with Admiral Norrington's help, although he is killed by a deranged Bootstrap Bill Turner. Jones and his crew attempt a mutiny against the East India Trading Company marines stationed on board, but Mr. Mercer, Beckett's henchman, proclaims the ship is under his command, temporarily subduing the uprising.\\r\\nThe Dutchman leads the East India Trading Company armada in battle against the Brethren Court. The Dutchman and the Black Pearl engage in battle while entering a monstrous maelstrom (caused by Calypso, Jones' lover). Jones is killed when, aided by Sparrow, the mortally wounded Will Turner stabs Jones' heart, and Jones falls off board into the maelstrom. The Dutchman is also sucked into the maelstrom as Swann and Sparrow escape. The Dutchman 's crew carve out the now-dead Will Turner's heart (as whoever kills the Dutchman's captain must replace him) and place it in the Dead Man's Chest. The Dutchman re-emerges from the maelstrom with Captain Will Turner at the helm. Joining forces with the Pearl, the two ships face off against the Endeavour. Stunned by this unexpected alliance, Beckett is unable to respond, and his crew abandons ship just as the Endeavour is being destroyed and Beckett is killed.\\r\\nThe Dutchman 's crew revert to human form and the ship reverts to its original form as well, and Will and Elizabeth meet on an island and consummate their marriage. Will departs at sunset to fulfill his destiny as the Dutchman's captain, leaving his disembodied heart in Elizabeth's care. Will frees Bootstrap Bill from his servitude, but Bootstrap decides to remain with his son as part of his new crew. Following the end credits: ten years later, the Dutchman reappears upon the horizon amid a green flash as Elizabeth and her son await its arrival. And as sun sets, he is seen with the ship.\\r\\nIn Dead Men Tell No Tales, the Dutchman returns when a young Henry Turner boards it underwater by weighing himself down with rocks. The ship surfaces and Will confronts his son, who reveals his plan to retrieve the Trident of Poseidon, which can break the curse binding him to the Dutchman. Will dismisses Henry's idea and tells his son to move on and not follow in his footsteps. Nine years later, Henry destroys the Trident, which breaks all curses and frees Will from the Dutchman. Will comes ashore and reunites with Henry and Elizabeth, permanently. However, a post-credits scene reveals that the Dutchman's original captain, Davy Jones, lives again.[3]\\r\\nThe look of the fictional ship was inspired by the seventeenth century Dutch \\"fluyt\\" vessels and the Vasa, a real-life Swedish warship which sank in 1628.[4] However, the ship itself resembles a sailfish. The Flying Dutchman has five staysails making it easier to sail against the wind than running before the wind. The ship is more organic plant matter than timber and sail, heavily encrusted with marine life that reflects its strong ties to the sea. This may be the result of the fictitious Dutchman often being submerged. Also, it is apparently a result of the curse that turned the crew into monsters as when broken with Davy Jones' death, the ship itself loses all of the marine life attached to it and reverts to its original form like its crew does.\\r\\nThe fictional Flying Dutchman is very heavily armed with port and starboard guns. It carries 46 broadside guns, 23 on each side; 18 twenty-four pound cannons are located on the main deck, 20 thirty-six pounders on the gun deck, and 8 three-pounders on the upper deck: 4 on the quarter-deck and 4 on the forecastle.[5][6][7] The gunports on the gun deck are in the shape of demon faces, each one with a unique facial expression, with the ports appearing at the mouths. Its full broadside contains 23 cannonballs, called shot, and weighs 588?lbs. (266.712?kg). On the bow however, she mounts a pair of bow chasers, each in the form of a triple-barreled demi-culverin, giving her an incredible range during a chase. Both triple guns fire nine-pound cannonballs. Each separate barrel fires individually, but the trio rotates to present a fresh barrel to fire again in the style of a Gatling gun. The empty barrel can then be reloaded for its next turn. This enables the Flying Dutchman to continually fire at ships it is pursuing. When not in use, the bow chasers are concealed behind two doors carved in the shape of an angry demon's maw.\\r\\nHer low freeboard allows for such heavy cannons because they're lower to the waterline. The crew also keep the lower gun ports closed unless going on the attack as would be found with most armed vessels of the 17th and 18th centuries. Being that the ship is called the flying \\"Dutchman,\\" and based on historical ships, it can be presumed that her origin lies with the Dutch Republic of the late 16th to early 17th century. This would make sense since, at the time, the Dutch possessed the fastest and strongest warships in the world, rivaled only by English warships. Dutch warships were also relatively small to medium-sized and shallow on the draft to defend the Netherlands' shallow coastal waters. Heavily armed, their galleons frequently carried both 24- and 36-pounder cannons to be utilized in their favored tactic of close quarters ship combat (typically within pistol shot range) that focused on shattering the hulls of their enemies. This is clearly shown to be the preferred tactic of the Dutchman's crew in At World's End as they attack the pirate fleet where they employ rapid surprise attacks featuring powerful broadsides in close range to sink the opposing ships. It has been noted in the Complete Visual Guide that the ship was a gift by Calypso, which Davy Jones had captained for a century prior to the events of the films which are set around 1740. This would place the Flying Dutchman right in the prime of the Dutch Republic's high watermark for their global naval supremacy - clear evidence for her highly powerful armament.\\r\\nIn addition to her overwhelming firepower, the Flying Dutchman also has the Kraken Hammer, a massive hammer in the form of a capstan to summon the mighty Kraken. The Kraken can also be summoned by the Black Spot. Any member of Davy Jones' crew can deliver the mark to a victim, but only Jones can remove it.\\r\\nThe Flying Dutchman is supposedly the \\"fastest ship\\" in the Caribbean, however the only ship that can surpass the Dutchman for speed is the Black Pearl.\\r\\nSimilarly, because Jones abandoned his soul-ferrying duty, he and the crew bear a curse that gradually mutates them into anthropomorphic amalgamations of Sea creatures. In the Dead Man's Chest DVD commentary, writers Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio mention that the crew actually become less and less human until they are literally absorbed into the Flying Dutchman (Davy Jones knows this, but fails to inform new recruits). One character, Wyvern, is so transformed that he is now integrated into the ship's hull. The crew has little or no human flesh remaining on them, although newer members, like Bootstrap Bill, are only partially encrusted with sea life.\\r\\nNearly all the crew members' time in servitude is spent toiling on board the ship. For amusement, the crew play a game called Liar's Dice, in which they gamble years of service. In one scene of Dead Man's Chest, the crew works on well into the night, and even in the rain, while Davy Jones plays on with his pipe organ. When Will is wrongly blamed for causing a work disruption, the boatswain proclaims that he is to be punished with a whip. In a later scene, the crew is excited when Jones commands the ship to submerge, and others continue on their duties unhampered. However, it is likely that, as Will is now captain, things have changed on board the ship, and after he becomes captain, the crew are all returned to human form, and Will grants them voluntary leave from the ship. Only his father, Bootstrap Bill, appears to remain on as crew.","input":"Who was the captain of the flying dutchman?"},{"output":"Orthodox Christianity","context":"","input":"What type of christianity did the byzantine empire or byzantium create?"},{"output":"between 1590 and 1592","context":"","input":"When was the taming of the shrew written?"},{"output":"79 AD","context":"Mount Vesuvius, a volcano in modern-day Italy, erupted in 79 AD in one of the most catastrophic volcanic eruptions in European history. Historians have learned about the eruption from the eyewitness account of Pliny the Younger, a Roman administrator and poet.[1] The event is the namesake for the Vesuvian type of volcanic eruption.\\r\\nMount Vesuvius spewed forth a deadly cloud of tephra and gases to a height of 33 kilometres (21?mi), ejecting molten rock, pulverized pumice and hot ash at the rate of 1.5 million tons per second, ultimately releasing 100,000 times the thermal energy of the Hiroshima-Nagasaki bombings.[2] Several Roman settlements were obliterated and buried underneath massive pyroclastic surges and ashfall deposits, the best known being Pompeii and Herculaneum.[1][2]\\r\\nThe total inhabitants of the cities were 16,000ÿ20,000; the remains of about 1,500 people have been found at Pompeii and Herculaneum, but the overall death toll is still unknown.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe AD 79 eruption was preceded by a powerful earthquake seventeen years before on February 5, AD 62, which caused widespread destruction around the Bay of Naples, and particularly to Pompeii.[3] Some of the damage had still not been repaired when the volcano erupted.[4] The deaths of 600 sheep from \\"tainted air\\" in the vicinity of Pompeii, reported by Seneca the Younger, leads vulcanologist Haraldur Sigurdsson to compare them to similar deaths of sheep in Iceland from pools of volcanic carbon dioxide and to speculate that the earthquake of AD 62 was related to new activity by Mount Vesuvius.[5]\\r\\nAnother smaller earthquake took place in AD 64; it was recorded by Suetonius in his biography of Nero,[6] and by Tacitus in Annales because it took place while Nero was in Naples performing for the first time in a public theatre.[7] Suetonius recorded that the emperor continued singing through the earthquake until he had finished his song, while Tacitus wrote that the theatre collapsed shortly after being evacuated.\\r\\nThe Romans grew accustomed to minor earth tremors in the region; the writer Pliny the Younger wrote that they \\"were not particularly alarming because they are frequent in Campania\\". Small earthquakes started taking place on 20 August 79,[4] becoming more frequent over the next four days, but the warnings were not recognized.[8]\\r\\nReconstructions of the eruption and its effects vary considerably in the details but have the same overall features. The eruption lasted for two days. The morning of the first day, August 22, was perceived as normal by the only eyewitness to leave a surviving document, Pliny the Younger, who at that point was staying at Misenum, on the other side of the Bay of Naples about 30 kilometres (19?mi) from the volcano, which may have prevented him from noticing the early signs of the eruption. He was not to have any opportunity, during the next two days, to talk to people who had witnessed the eruption from Pompeii or Herculaneum (indeed he never mentions Pompeii in his letter), so he would not have noticed early, smaller fissures and releases of ash and smoke on the mountain, if such had occurred earlier in the morning. Around 1:00 P.M., Mount Vesuvius violently erupted, spewing up a high-altitude column from which ash and pumice began to fall, blanketing the area. Rescues and escapes occurred during this time. At some time in the night or early the next day, August 23, pyroclastic flows in the close vicinity of the volcano began. Lights seen on the mountain were interpreted as fires. People as far away as Misenum fled for their lives. The flows were rapid-moving, dense, and very hot, knocking down wholly or partly all structures in their path, incinerating or suffocating all population remaining there and altering the landscape, including the coastline. These were accompanied by additional light tremors and a mild tsunami in the Bay of Naples. By evening of the second day, the eruption was over, leaving only haze in the atmosphere through which the sun shone weakly.\\r\\nPliny the Younger wrote an account of the eruption:\\r\\nBroad sheets of flame were lighting up many parts of Vesuvius; their light and brightness were the more vivid for the darkness of the night... it was daylight now elsewhere in the world, but there the darkness was darker and thicker than any night.[9]\\r\\nAccording to a stratigraphic study (a study of the layers of ash) by Sigurdsson, Cashdollar, and Sparks, published in 1982, and now a standard reference, the eruption of Vesuvius of AD 79 unfolded in two phases:[10] a Plinian eruption that lasted eighteen to twenty hours and produced a fall of pumice and ash southward of the volcano that accumulated up to depths of 2.8 metres (9?ft 2?in) at Pompeii, followed by a pyroclastic surge or nue ardente in the second Pelan phase that reached as far as Misenum but was concentrated to the west and northwest. Two pyroclastic surges engulfed Pompeii, burning and asphyxiating the stragglers who had remained behind. Oplontis and Herculaneum received the brunt of the surges and were buried in fine ash, pumice, lava fragments and pyroclastic deposits.\\r\\nIn an article published in 2002, Sigurdsson and Casey elaborate on the stratigraphic evidence based on excavations and surveys up until then. In this interpretation, the quasi-initial explosion (not quite initial) produced a column of ash and pumice ranging between 15 kilometres (49,000?ft) and 30 kilometres (98,000?ft) high, which, due to northwest winds, rained on Pompeii to the southeast but not on Herculaneum upwind. The eruption is viewed as primarily phreatomagmatic; that is, the chief energy supporting the column came from the escape of steam generated by the magma, created from seawater seeping over time into the deep-seated faults of the region, that came into interaction with magma and heat.\\r\\nSubsequently, the cloud collapsed as the gases densified and lost their capability to support their solid contents, releasing it as a pyroclastic surge, which first reached Herculaneum, not Pompeii. Additional explosions reinstituted the column. The eruption alternated between Vesuvian and Pelan six times. Surges 4 and 5 are believed by the authors to have destroyed and buried Pompeii.[11] Surges are identified in the deposits by dune and cross-bedding formations, which are not produced by fallout.\\r\\nThe authors suggest that the first ash falls are to be interpreted as early-morning, low-volume explosions not seen from Misenum, causing Rectina to send her messenger on a ride of several hours around the Bay of Naples, then passable, providing an answer to the paradox of how the messenger might miraculously appear at Pliny's villa so shortly after a distant eruption that would have prevented him.\\r\\nA 2006 study by Zanella, Gurioli, Pareschi, and Lanza used the magnetic characteristics of over 200?samples of lithic, roof-tile, and plaster fragments collected from pyroclastic deposits in and around Pompeii to estimate the equilibrium temperatures of the deposits.[12] The deposits were placed by pyroclastic density currents (PDCs) resulting from the collapses of the Plinian column. The authors argue that fragments over 2ÿ5?cm (0.8ÿ2?in) were not in the current long enough to acquire its temperature, which would have been much higher, and therefore they distinguish between the depositional temperatures, which they estimated, and the emplacement temperatures, which in some cases based on the cooling characteristics of some types and fragment sizes of rocks they believed they also could estimate. Final figures are considered to be those of the rocks in the current just before deposition.[13]\\r\\nAll crustal rock contains some iron or iron compounds, rendering it ferromagnetic, as do Roman roof tiles and plaster. These materials may acquire a residual field from a number of sources. When individual molecules, which are magnetic dipoles, are held in alignment by being bound in a crystalline structure, the small fields reinforce each other to form the rock's residual field.[14] Heating the material adds internal energy to it. At the Curie temperature, the vibration of the molecules is sufficient to disrupt the alignment; the material loses its residual magnetism and assumes whatever magnetic field might be applied to it only for the duration of the application. The authors term this phenomenon unblocking. Residual magnetism is considered to \\"block out\\" non-residual fields.\\r\\nA rock is a mixture of minerals, each with its own Curie temperature; the authors therefore looked for a spectrum of temperatures rather than a single temperature. In the ideal sample, the PDC did not raise the temperature of the fragment beyond the highest blocking temperature. Some constituent material retained the magnetism imposed by the Earth's field when the item was formed. The temperature was raised above the lowest blocking temperature and therefore some minerals on recooling acquired the magnetism of the Earth as it was in AD 79. The overall field of the sample was the vector sum of the fields of the high-blocking material and the low-blocking material.\\r\\nThis type of sample made possible estimation of the low unblocking temperature. Using special equipment that measured field direction and strength at various temperatures, the experimenters raised the temperature of the sample in increments of 40?C (70?F) from 100?C (210?F) until it reached the low unblocking temperature.[15] Deprived of one of its components, the overall field changed direction. A plot of direction at each increment identified the increment at which the sample's resultant magnetism had formed.[16] That was considered to be the equilibrium temperature of the deposit. Considering the data for all the deposits of the surge arrived at a surge deposit estimate. The authors discovered that the city, Pompeii, was a relatively cool spot within a much hotter field, which they attributed to interaction of the surge with the \\"fabric\\" of the city.[17]\\r\\nThe investigators reconstruct the sequence of volcanic events as follows. On the first day of the eruption a fall of white pumice containing clastic fragments of up to 3 centimetres (1?in) fell for several hours.[18] It heated the roof tiles to 120ÿ140?C (250ÿ280?F).[19] This period would have been the last opportunity to escape. Subsequently, a second column deposited a grey pumice with clastics up to 10?cm (4?in), temperature unsampled, but presumed to be higher, for 18 hours. These two falls were the Plinian phase. The collapse of the edges of these clouds generated the first dilute PDCs, which must have been devastating to Herculaneum, but did not enter Pompeii.\\r\\nEarly in the morning of the second day the grey cloud began to collapse to a greater degree. Two major surges struck and destroyed Pompeii. Herculaneum and all its population no longer existed. The emplacement temperature range of the first surge was 180ÿ220?C (360ÿ430?F), minimum temperatures; of the second, 220ÿ260?C (430ÿ500?F). The depositional temperature of the first was 140ÿ300?C (280ÿ570?F). Upstream and downstream of the flow it was 300ÿ360?C (570ÿ680?F).[20]\\r\\nThe variable temperature of the first surge was due to interaction with the buildings. Any population remaining in structural refuges could not have escaped, as the city was surrounded by gases of incinerating temperatures. The lowest temperatures were in rooms under collapsed roofs. These were as low as 100?C (210?F), the boiling point of water.[21] The authors suggest that elements of the bottom of the flow were decoupled from the main flow by topographic irregularities and were made cooler by the introduction of ambient turbulent air. In the second surge the irregularities were gone and the city was as hot as the surrounding environment.\\r\\nDuring the last surge, which was very dilute, one meter more of deposits fell over the region.[22]\\r\\nThe only surviving eyewitness account of the event consists of two letters by Pliny the Younger, who was 17 at the time of the eruption,[23] to the historian, Tacitus.[24] Observing the first volcanic activity from Misenum across the Bay of Naples from the volcano, approximately 35 kilometres (22?mi), the elder Pliny launched a rescue fleet and went himself to the rescue of a personal friend. His nephew declined to join the party. One of the nephew's letters relates what he could discover from witnesses of his uncle's experiences.[25] In a second letter the younger Pliny details his own observations after the departure of his uncle.[26]\\r\\nThe two men saw an extraordinarily dense cloud rising rapidly above the mountain:[25]\\r\\nI cannot give you a more exact description of its appearance than by comparing to a pine tree; for it shot up to a great height in the form of a tall trunk, which spread out at the top as though into branches. [...] Occasionally it was brighter, occasionally darker and spotted, as it was either more or less filled with earth and cinders.\\r\\nThese events and a request by messenger for an evacuation by sea prompted the elder Pliny to order rescue operations in which he sailed away to participate. His nephew attempted to resume a normal life, continuing to study, and bathing, but that night a tremor awoke him and his mother, prompting them to abandon the house for the courtyard. At another tremor near dawn the population abandoned the village. After still a third \\"the sea seemed to roll back upon itself, and to be driven from its banks\\", which is evidence for a tsunami. There is, however, no evidence of extensive damage from wave action.\\r\\nThe early light was obscured by a black cloud through which shone flashes, which Pliny likens to sheet lightning, but more extensive. The cloud obscured Point Misenum near at hand and the island of Capraia (Capri) across the bay. Fearing for their lives the population began to call to each other and move back from the coast along the road. Pliny's mother requested him to abandon her and save his own life, as she was too corpulent and aged to go further, but seizing her hand he led her away as best he could. A rain of ash fell. Pliny found it necessary to shake off the ash periodically to avoid being buried. Later that same day the ash stopped falling and the sun shone weakly through the cloud, encouraging Pliny and his mother to return to their home and wait for news of Pliny the Elder. The letter compares the ash to a blanket of snow. Evidently the earthquake and tsunami damage at that location were not severe enough to prevent continued use of the home.\\r\\nPliny's uncle Pliny the Elder was in command of the Roman fleet at Misenum, and had meanwhile decided to investigate the phenomenon at close hand in a light vessel. As the ship was preparing to leave the area, a messenger came from his friend Rectina (wife of Tascius) living on the coast near the foot of the volcano, explaining that her party could only get away by sea and asking for rescue.[27] Pliny ordered the immediate launching of the fleet galleys to the evacuation of the coast. He continued in his light ship to the rescue of Rectina's party.[27]\\r\\nHe set off across the bay but in the shallows on the other side encountered thick showers of hot cinders, lumps of pumice, and pieces of rock. Advised by the helmsman to turn back he stated \\"Fortune favors the brave\\" and ordered him to continue on to Stabiae (about 4.5?km or 2.8?mi from Pompeii), where Pomponianus was.[27] Pomponianus had already loaded a ship with possessions and was preparing to leave, but the same onshore wind that brought Pliny's ship to the location had prevented anyone from leaving.[27]\\r\\nPliny and his party saw flames coming from several parts of the mountain, which Pliny and his friends attributed to burning villages. After staying overnight, the party was driven from the building by an accumulation of material which threatened to block all egress.[27] They woke Pliny, who had been napping and emitting loud snoring. They elected to take to the fields with pillows tied to their heads to protect them from rockfall. They approached the beach again but the wind had not changed. Pliny sat down on a sail that had been spread for him and could not rise even with assistance when his friends departed, escaping ultimately by land.[28] Very likely, he had collapsed and died, which is the most popular explanation of why his friends abandoned him, although Suetonius offers an alternative story of his ordering a slave to kill him to avoid the pain of incineration. How the slave would have escaped to tell the tale remains a mystery. There is no mention of such an event in his nephew's letters.\\r\\nIn the first letter to Tacitus his nephew suggested that his death was due to the reaction of his weak lungs to a cloud of poisonous, sulphurous gas that wafted over the group.[27] However, Stabiae was 16?km (9.9?mi) from the vent (roughly where the modern town of Castellammare di Stabia is situated) and his companions were apparently unaffected by the fumes, and so it is more likely that the corpulent Pliny died from some other cause, such as a stroke or heart attack.[29] An asthmatic attack is also not out of the question. His body was found with no apparent injuries on the next day, after dispersal of the plume.\\r\\nAlong with Pliny the Elder, the only other noble casualties of the eruption to be known by name were Agrippa (a son of the Jewish princess Drusilla and the procurator Antonius Felix) and his wife.[30]\\r\\nBy 2003 around 1,044?casts made from impressions of bodies in the ash deposits had been recovered in and around Pompeii, with the scattered bones of another 100.[31] The remains of about 332 bodies have been found at Herculaneum (300 in arched vaults discovered in 1980).[32] What percentage these numbers are of the total dead or the percentage of the dead to the total number at risk remain completely unknown.\\r\\nThirty-eight percent of the 1044 were found in the ash fall deposits, the majority inside buildings. These are thought to have been killed mainly by roof collapses, with the smaller number of victims found outside buildings probably killed by falling roof slates or by larger rocks thrown out by the volcano. This differs from modern experience, since over the last four hundred years only around 4% of victims have been killed by ash falls during explosive eruptions. The remaining 62% of remains found at Pompeii were in the pyroclastic surge deposits,[31] and thus were probably killed by them. It was initially believed that due to the state of the bodies found at Pompeii and the outline of clothes on the bodies it was unlikely that high temperatures were a significant cause. But in 2010, studies indicated that during the fourth pyroclastic surge ÿ the first surge to reach Pompeii ÿ temperatures reached 300?C (572?F). Volcanologist Giuseppe Mastrolorenzo, who led the study noted that \\"(It was) enough to kill hundreds of people in a fraction of a second\\". In reference as to why the bodies were frozen in suspended action, \\"The contorted postures are not the effects of a long agony, but of the cadaveric spasm, a consequence of heat shock on corpses.\\"[33]\\r\\nHerculaneum, which was much closer to the crater, was saved from tephra falls by the wind direction, but was buried under 23 metres (75?ft) of material deposited by pyroclastic surges. It is likely that most, or all, of the known victims in this town were killed by the surges, particularly given evidence of high temperatures found on the skeletons of the victims found in the arched vaults, and the existence of carbonised wood in many of the buildings.\\r\\nThese people were all caught on the former seashore by the first surge and died of thermal shock but not of carbonization, although some were partly carbonized by later and hotter surges. The arched vaults were most likely boathouses, as the crossbeams in the overhead were probably for the suspension of boats. No boats have been found, indicating they may have been used for the earlier escape of some of the population. The rest were concentrated in the chambers at a density of as high as 3 persons per square meter. As only 85 metres (279?ft) of the coast have been excavated, the casualties waiting to be excavated may well be as high as the thousands.[34]\\r\\nThe year of the eruption is pinned to AD 79 by references in contemporary Roman writers, a number of them apart from Pliny the Younger, and has never been seriously questioned. It is determined by the well-known events of the reign of Titus. Vespasian died that year. When Titus visited Pompeii to give orders for the relief of the displaced population, he was the sole ruler. In the year after the eruption, AD 80, he faced another disaster, a great fire at Rome.\\r\\nThe time of year is stated once in one historical document, the first letter of Pliny the Younger to Tacitus,[25] where it appears as \\"nonum kal. Septembres\\". This seems to be an abbreviation of a standard date, to be interpreted as \\"the ninth day before the Kalends of September\\", which in the Julian calendar, in general use by then, would have been eight days before September 1, that is August 24 (the Romans counted September 1 as one of the nine).\\r\\nAugust 24 is not necessarily the date given by Pliny. It represents an editorial collusion to use the manuscript text of Pliny's letters in the Medicean Laurentian Library, which also appears in the edition printed by Aldus Manutius (1508) and in all recensions since then, even though the numerous other Pliny manuscripts, as well as the works of other authors, offer many alternative dates.[35] Unfortunately, the portion of Tacitus' Histories in which he most likely made specific use of the letter ÿ requested for that purpose from his friend Pliny ÿ and where he would have mentioned the date, does not survive; although Tacitus would have made use of Pliny's letter, the textual traditions of the two works, with their likely references to the date, would have been completely separate and not contaminated by each other. Since the textual tradition of any of Tacitus' works through the Middle Ages, up to the first printed editions, is much slimmer than that of Pliny's letters,[36] and rests directly on relatively early textual witnesses (although the direct parent codices of these have been lost) the risk of multiple scribal errors and variants of the date creeping in would have been much smaller for this lost Tacitus text.\\r\\nArchaeological dissent from this view began with the work of Carlo Maria Rosini in 1797, to be followed by a succession of archaeologists putting forward evidence to the contrary, though mainstream scholarly opinion has long been in favour of August 24.[citation needed] Discussion on the subject has increased somewhat in recent years. Some of the archaeological evidence from Pompeii does suggest that the town may likely have been buried about two or three months later. For example, people interred in the ashes appear to be wearing warmer clothing than the light summer clothes that would be expected in August. The fresh fruit, olives, and vegetables in the shops are typical of October, and conversely the summer fruit that would have been typical of August was already being sold in dried, or conserved form. Wine fermenting jars had been sealed over, and this would have happened around the end of October. The coins found in the purse of a woman buried in the ash include a commemorative coin that should have been minted at the end of September.[37]\\r\\nA 2007 study by Rolandi, De Lascio, and Stefani of 20 years of data concerning wind direction at meteorological stations in Rome and Brindisi established wind patterns in the Vesuvius area above 14 kilometres (46,000?ft) with more precision than was previously known.[38] From June through August the winds blow strongly from the west, for the rest of the time, from the east. This fact was known, but the easterly winds of the eruption were considered anomalous in August, caused (conjecturally) by the weak and shifting winds of the transition. The authors argued that the winds of 79 produced long depositional patterns and therefore would not have been this weak, and that the transition occurs in September, not August (their reference data, though, is from modern weather observations and might not match the patterns of those same months in antiquity with precision). The authors therefore reject the August date as being inconsistent with the patterns of nature.\\r\\nThe rejection is not of Pliny's eyewitness account or of Pliny's date, as transmitted in the text read in modern times. The rejection focuses on manuscript variants looking for possible sources of copyist alteration of Pliny's date. In some ancient and medieval manuscripts of other authors, the month has been omitted. If some original had no month, then the copyists may have felt obliged to provide one, but chose wrongly. Rolandi et al. suggest an original date of a.d. IX kal dec (November 23) or a.d. ix kal nov (October 24) more in line with the evidence of weather observations and wind patterns. The question remains an open one, and different reliable scholarly sources (modern secondary sources and discussions) continue to propose different dates.[citation needed]","input":"When did the eruption of mount vesuvius occur?"},{"output":"four flats","context":"F minor is a minor scale based on F, consisting of the pitches F, G, A?, B?, C, D?, and E?.

It is typically produced from cells found in mucous glands, although it may also originate from mixed glands, which contain both serous and mucous cells. It is a viscous colloid containing inorganic salts, antiseptic enzymes (such as lysozymes), immunoglobulins, and glycoproteins such as lactoferrin[1] and mucins, which are produced by goblet cells in the mucous membranes and submucosal glands. Mucus serves to protect epithelial cells (that line the tubes) in the respiratory, gastrointestinal, urogenital, visual, and auditory systems; the epidermis in amphibians; and the gills in fish, against infectious agents such as fungi, bacteria and viruses. The average human nose produces about a liter of mucus per day.[2] Most of the mucus produced is in the gastrointestinal tract.\\r\\nBony fish, hagfish, snails, slugs, and some other invertebrates also produce external mucus. In addition to serving a protective function against infectious agents, such mucus provides protection against toxins produced by predators, can facilitate movement and may play a role in communication.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the human respiratory system, mucus, also known as airway surface liquid (ASL), aids in the protection of the lungs by trapping foreign particles that enter them, in particular, through the nose, during normal breathing.[3] Further distinction exists between the superficial and cell-lining layers of ASL, which are known as mucus layer (ML) and pericilliary liquid layer (PCL), respectively.[4] \\"Phlegm\\" is a specialized term for mucus that is restricted to the respiratory tract, whereas the term \\"nasal mucus\\" describes secretions of the nasal passages.\\r\\nNasal mucus is produced by the nasal mucosa; and mucus lining the airways (trachea, bronchus, bronchioles) is produced by specialized airway epithelial cells (goblet cells) and submucosal glands. Small particles such as dust, particulate pollutants, and allergens, as well as infectious agents and bacteria are caught in the viscous nasal or airway mucus and prevented from entering the system. This event along with the continual movement of the respiratory mucus layer toward the oropharynx, helps prevent foreign objects from entering the lungs during breathing. This explains why coughing often occurs in those who smoke cigarettes. The body's natural reaction is to increase mucus production. In addition, mucus aids in moisturizing the inhaled air and prevents tissues such as the nasal and airway epithelia from drying out.[5] Nasal and airway mucus is produced continuously, with most of it swallowed subconsciously, even when it is dried.[6]\\r\\nIncreased mucus production in the respiratory tract is a symptom of many common illnesses, such as the common cold and influenza. Hypersecretion of mucus can occur in inflammatory respiratory diseases such as respiratory allergies, asthma, and chronic bronchitis.[5] The presence of mucus in the nose and throat is normal, but increased quantities can impede comfortable breathing and must be cleared by blowing the nose or expectorating phlegm from the throat.\\r\\nIn general, nasal mucus is clear and thin, serving to filter air during inhalation. During times of infection, mucus can change color to yellow or green either as a result of trapped bacteria[7] or due to the body's reaction to viral infection.[8] The green color of mucus comes from the heme group in the iron-containing enzyme myeloperoxidase secreted by white blood cells as a cytotoxic defense during a respiratory burst.\\r\\nIn the case of bacterial infection, the bacterium becomes trapped in already-clogged sinuses, breeding in the moist, nutrient-rich environment. Sinusitis is an uncomfortable condition which may include congestion of mucus. A bacterial infection in sinusitis will cause discolored mucus and would respond to antibiotic treatment; viral infections typically resolve without treatment.[9] Almost all sinusitis infections are viral and antibiotics are ineffective and not recommended for treating typical cases.[10]\\r\\nIn the case of a viral infection such as cold or flu, the first stage and also the last stage of the infection cause the production of a clear, thin mucus in the nose or back of the throat. As the body begins to react to the virus (generally one to three days), mucus thickens and may turn yellow or green. Viral infections cannot be treated with antibiotics, and are a major avenue for their misuse. Treatment is generally symptom-based; often it is sufficient to allow the immune system to fight off the virus over time.[11]\\r\\nIncreased mucus production in the upper respiratory tract is a symptom of many common ailments, such as the common cold. Nasal mucus may be removed by blowing the nose or by using nasal irrigation. Excess nasal mucus, as with a cold or allergies, due to vascular engorgement associated with vasodilation and increased capillary permeability caused by histamines,[12] may be treated cautiously with decongestant medications. Thickening of mucus as a \\"rebound\\" effect following overuse of decongestants may produce nasal or sinus drainage problems and circumstances that promote infection.\\r\\nDuring cold, dry seasons, the mucus lining nasal passages tends to dry out, meaning that mucous membranes must work harder, producing more mucus to keep the cavity lined. As a result, the nasal cavity can fill up with mucus. At the same time, when air is exhaled, water vapor in breath condenses as the warm air meets the colder outside temperature near the nostrils. This causes an excess amount of water to build up inside nasal cavities. In these cases, the excess fluid usually spills out externally through the nostrils.[13]\\r\\nExcess mucus production in the bronchi and bronchioles, as may occur in asthma, bronchitis or influenza, results from chronic airway inflammation, and hence may be treated with anti-inflammatory medications. Impaired mucociliary clearance due to conditions such as primary ciliary dyskinesia may also result in its accumulation in the bronchi.[4] The dysregulation of mucus homesotasis is the fundamental characteristic of cystic fibrosis, an inherited disease caused by mutations in the CFTR gene, which encodes a chloride channel. This defect leads to the altered electrolyte composition of mucus, which triggers its hyperabsorption and dehydration. Such low-volume, viscous, acidic mucus causes has a reduced antimicrobial function, which facilitates bacterial colonisation.[14] The thinning of the mucus layer ultimately affects the PCL, which becomes dehydrated, compromising ciliary function and impairing mucociliary clearance.[4][14]\\r\\nIn the human digestive system, mucus is used as a lubricant for materials that must pass over membranes, e.g., food passing down the esophagus. Mucus is extremely important in the intestinal tract. It forms an essential layer in the colon and in the small intestine that helps reduce intestinal inflammation by decreasing bacterial interaction with intestinal epithelial cells.[15] A layer of mucus along the inner walls of the stomach is vital to protect the cell linings of that organ from the highly acidic environment within it.[scientific 1] Mucus is not digested in the intestinal tract. Mucus is also secreted from glands within the rectum due to stimulation of the mucous membrane within.[citation needed]\\r\\nMucus is able to absorb water or dehydrate through pH variations. The swelling capacity of mucus stems from the bottlebrush structure of mucin within which hydrophilic segments provide a large surface area for water absorption. Moreover, the tunability of swelling effect is controlled by polyelectrolyte effect.\\r\\nPolymers with charged molecules are called polyelectrolytes. Mucins, a kind of polyelectrolyte proteoglycans, are the main component of mucus, which provides the polyelectrolyte effect in mucus.[16] The process of inducing this effect comprises two steps: attraction of counter-ions and water compensation. When exposed in physiological ionic solution, the charged groups in the polyelectrolytes attract counter-ions with opposite charges, thereby leading to a solute concentration gradient. An osmotic pressure is introduced to equalize the concentration of solute throughout the system by driving water to flow from the low concentration areas to the high concentration areas. In short, the influx and outflux of water within mucus, managed by the polyelectrolyte effect, contribute to mucus' tunable swelling capacity.[17]\\r\\nThe ionic charges of mucin are mainly provided by acidic amino acids including aspartic acids (pKa=3.9) and glutamic acids (pKa=4.2). The charges of acidic amino acids will change with environmental pH value due to acid dissociation and association. Aspartic acid, for example, has a negative side chain when the pH value is above 3.9, while a neutrally charged side chain will be introduced as pH value drops below 3.9. Thus, the number of negative charges in mucus is influenced by the pH value of surrounding environment. That is, the polyelectrolyte effect of mucus is largely affected by the pH value of solution due to the charge variation of acidic amino acid residues on the mucin backbone. For instance, the charged residue on mucin is protonated at a normal pH value of the stomach, approximately pH 2. In this case, there is scarcely polyelectrolyte effect, thereby causing compact mucus with little swelling capacity. However, a kind of bacteria, Helicobacter pylori, is prone to producing base to elevate the pH value in stomach, leading to the deprotonation of aspartic acids and glutamic acids, i.e., from neutral to negative-charged. The negative charges in the mucus greatly increase, thus inducing the polyeletrolyte effect and the swelling of the mucus. This swelling effect increases the pore size of the mucus and decreases mucus' viscosity, which allows bacteria to penetrate and migrate into the mucus and cause disease.[18]\\r\\nThe high selective permeability of mucus plays a crucial role in the healthy state of human beings by limiting the penetration of molecules, nutrients, pathogens, and drugs. The charge distribution within mucus serves as a charge selective diffusion barrier, thus significantly affecting the transportation of agents. Among particles with various surface zeta potentials, cationic particles tend to have a low depth of penetration, neutral ones possess medium penetration, and anionic ones have the largest penetration depth. Furthermore, the effect of charge selectivity changes when the status of the mucus varies, i.e., native mucus has a threefold higher potential to limit agent penetration than purified mucus.[19]","input":"What role does mucus play in the respiratory system?"},{"output":"Bob Dylan","context":"The Traveling Wilburys (sometimes shortened to the Wilburys) were a British-American supergroup consisting of Bob Dylan, George Harrison, Jeff Lynne, Roy Orbison, and Tom Petty. The band recorded two albums, the first in 1988 and the second in 1990, though Orbison died before the second was recorded.\\r\\nThe project's work received much anticipation given the diverse nature of the singer-songwriters. Their debut album Traveling Wilburys Vol. 1 proved an enduring critical success, in 1989 and 1990 winning accolades such as a Grammy for Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nGeorge Harrison first mentioned the Traveling Wilburys publicly during a radio interview with Bob Coburn on the show Rockline in February 1988.[2] When asked how he planned to follow up the success of his Cloud Nine album, Harrison replied: \\"What I'd really like to do next is ... to do an album with me and some of my mates ... It's this new group I got [in mind]: it's called the Traveling Wilburys, I'd like to do an album with them and then later we can all do our own albums again.\\"[3][nb 1] According to Jeff Lynne, who co-produced Cloud Nine, Harrison introduced the idea of the two of them starting a band together around two months into the sessions for his album,[5] which began in early January 1987.[6] When discussing who the other members might be, Harrison chose Bob Dylan and Lynne opted for Roy Orbison.[5][7] The term \\"Wilbury\\" also originated during the Cloud Nine sessions. Referring to recording errors created by faulty equipment, Harrison jokingly remarked to Lynne, \\"We'll bury 'em in the mix.\\"[8] Thereafter, they used the term for any small error in performance. Harrison first suggested \\"the Trembling Wilburys\\" as the group's name; at Lynne's suggestion, they amended it to \\"Traveling Wilburys\\".[2]\\r\\nDuring his Rockline interview, Harrison voiced his support for Dylan,[9] at a time when the latter was experiencing an artistic and commercial low point in his career.[10] Harrison and Lynne became friends with Tom Petty in October 1987, when Petty and his band, the Heartbreakers, toured Europe as Dylan's backing group.[11][12] The friendship continued in Los Angeles later that year. There, Harrison struck up a musical rapport with Petty based on their shared love of 1950s rock 'n' roll,[13] and Lynne began collaborating with Petty on what became the latter's debut solo album, Full Moon Fever,[14] and writing songs with Orbison, Lynne's longtime musical hero,[15] for his comeback album, Mystery Girl.[16][17] According to Petty, Harrison's dream for the Wilburys was to handpick the participants and create \\"the perfect little band\\", but the criteria for inclusion was governed most by \\"who you could hang out with\\".[18] The five musicians also bonded over a shared appreciation of the English comedy troupe Monty Python.[19] Harrison, who had worked with the members of Monty Python on various productions by his company HandMade Films since the late 1970s, particularly appreciated Orbison's gift for impersonation and his ability to recite entire sketches by the troupe.[20][21]\\r\\nThe band came together in April 1988,[22] when Harrison was in Los Angeles to oversee the filming of his HandMade production Checking Out.[23] At that time, Warner Bros. Records asked Harrison for a new song to serve as the B-side for the European release of his third single from Cloud Nine, \\"This Is Love\\".[24] During a meal with Lynne and Orbison, Harrison asked Lynne to help him record the track and invited Orbison to attend the session,[25] which he then arranged to take place at Dylan's garage studio in Malibu[4] since no professional studios were available at such short notice.[9] Petty's involvement came about when Harrison went to retrieve his guitar from Petty's house and invited him to attend also.[26][27]\\r\\nWorking on a song that Harrison had recently started writing, the ensemble completed the track, which they titled \\"Handle with Care\\" after a label on a box in Dylan's garage.[4] When Harrison presented the recording to Warner Bros., the executives insisted that the song was too good to be used as \\"filler\\" on a European single. In Petty's recollection, Harrison and Lynne then decided to realise their idea of forming a Wilburys band, and first invited him to join before phoning Dylan, who also agreed to join.[28] That night, Harrison, Lynne and Petty drove to Anaheim to see Orbison perform at the Celebrity Theatre and recruited him for the group shortly before he went on stage. In Petty's description, Orbison performed an \\"unbelievable show\\", during which \\"we'd punch each other and go, 'He's in our band, too.' ... We were all so excited.\\"[28]\\r\\nThe band members decided to create a full album together, Traveling Wilburys Vol. 1. Video footage of the creative process was partly shot by British photographer NJ Latham and later edited by Harrison. The album was recorded primarily over a ten-day period in May 1988[30] to allow for Dylan's limited availability as he prepared for his upcoming US tour.[31][32] These sessions were held in the house of Eurythmics member Dave Stewart, in Los Angeles.[33] The five band members sat in a circle playing acoustic guitars in Stewart's kitchen;[34] once each song's basic track had been written and recorded there (with accompaniment from a drum machine), the group recorded their vocals in another room, usually after dinner each night.[35][36] Petty recalled that, as a friend but also an avowed fan of Dylan's, Harrison felt the need to clear the air on the first day by saying to him: \\"We know that you're Bob Dylan and everything, but we're going to just treat you and talk to you like we would anybody else.\\" Dylan replied: \\"Well, great. Believe it or not, I'm in awe of you guys, and it's the same for me.\\"[37] While most of the songs had a primary composer,[38] all of the band members were creative equals.[31] Petty later described Harrison as the Wilburys' \\"leader and manager\\",[39] and credited him with being a bandleader and producer that had a natural instinct for bringing out the best in people and keeping a recording session productive.[40][nb 2] As the group's producers, Harrison and Lynne directed the sessions, with Harrison often auditioning each member to decide who should sing a particular lead vocal part.[43][44] The two producers then flew back to England; Lynne recalls that, throughout the flight, he and Harrison enthused about how to turn the sparse, acoustic-based tracks into completed recordings.[45] Overdubs and further recording took place at Harrison's studio, FPSHOT,[28] with \\"Sideburys\\" Jim Keltner (drums), Jim Horn (saxophones) and Ray Cooper (percussion).[22] Harrison described the band's sound as \\"skiffle for the 1990s\\".[46]\\r\\nThe album was released on 18 October 1988.[47] Distributed by Warner Bros., it appeared on the new Wilbury record label rather than on Harrison's Dark Horse label, in the interests of maintaining the group identity.[42] Over the months following the end of recording in the summer, contractual issues had been successfully negotiated between Warner's and the record companies representing Dylan, Petty, Lynne and Orbison. As was the case in 1971 when EMI prepared Harrison's multi-artist live album from the Concert for Bangladesh for release, Columbia, Dylan's label, presented the main stumbling block.[22][nb 3] In the album credits, the \\"Wilburys\\" joke was extended further, with the band members listed under various pseudonyms and pretending to be half-brothers ÿ sons of a fictional Charles Truscott Wilbury, Sr.[48][49] During promotion for the album, Orbison played along with the mock history, saying: \\"Some people say Daddy was a cad and a bounder, but I remember him as a Baptist minister.\\"[50][30]\\r\\nVol. 1 was a critical and commercial success, and revitalised the careers of Dylan, Orbison and Petty.[51] As Harrison had intended, the album defied contemporary musical trends such as hip hop, acid house and synthesised pop; author Alan Clayson likens its release to \\"a Viking longship docking in a hovercraft terminal\\".[52][nb 4] The album produced two successful singles and went on to achieve triple-platinum certification for sales in the United States. It was nominated for several awards and won the 1990 Grammy Award for Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group. Liner notes on the album cover were written by Monty Python's Michael Palin under a pseudonym.[30] Palin's essay was based on an idea by Derek Taylor,[49] who wrote an extensive fictional history of the Wilburys family that otherwise went unused.[39] Harrison planned a feature film about the band, to be produced by HandMade and directed by David Leland, but contractual problems ended the project.[54]\\r\\nRoy Orbison died of a heart attack on 6 December 1988.[55] In tribute to him, the music video for the band's second single, \\"End of the Line\\", shows Orbison's guitar rocking in a chair as the rest of the group play, along with a photo of him in the background.[56] Although there was speculation in the press that Del Shannon or Roger McGuinn might join the Wilburys, the remaining members never considered replacing Orbison.[39][57][nb 5] Lynne later said: \\"We'd become this unit, we were all good pals  We always knew we were going to do another one, and now it's just the four of us.\\"[57]\\r\\nIn March 1990, Harrison, Lynne, Petty and Dylan reunited to work on a second Wilburys album, which they intentionally misnumbered Traveling Wilburys Vol. 3.[58] It was preceded by a non-album single, a cover of \\"Nobody's Child\\",[49] which the band recorded for Olivia Harrison's Romanian Angel Appeal charity project.[58][59] The duration of the main album sessions was again dictated by Dylan's touring schedule and limited availability. Having asked Dylan to record a lead vocal for all the songs before his departure, Harrison was then loath to replace many of the parts, resulting in a greater prominence for Dylan as a lead singer.[58] Although he ceded his own role as a lead vocalist to Dylan and to Petty,[60] Harrison took over more of the production and contributed more prominently as a lead guitarist than before.[61] Petty described the album as \\"a little more rough and ready, a bit more raucous\\" than Vol. 1,[62] while Dylan said the new songs were more developed as compositions relative to the \\"scraped up from jam tapes\\" approach to the band's debut.[58]\\r\\nVol. 3 was released on 29 October 1990.[63] It was dedicated to Orbison, as \\"Lefty Wilbury\\", the pseudonym that Orbison had used in 1988 in honour of his hero Lefty Frizzell.[64] The album met with less success than the previous one. According to Warner Bros. head Mo Ostin, the choice of album title came about through \\"George being George\\";[8] apparently Harrison was making a wry reference to the appearance of a bootleg that served as a sort of Volume 2.[65] The album's liner notes were written by Eric Idle, another Python member, who again adopted a pseudonym. For the band's final single, \\"Wilbury Twist\\", they filmed a video in which Idle, John Candy and other comedic actors attempt to master the song's eponymous dance style. The clip was filmed in Los Angeles and completed on 28 February 1991.[66][nb 6]\\r\\nAccording to Jim Keltner, the Wilburys' drummer, the decision on the group's future after Vol. 3 lay with Harrison. Keltner said that from his conversations with Lynne, Petty and Dylan, they were all keen to reunite, whereas Harrison wavered in his enthusiasm.[68] While Harrison was against the idea of touring, Petty recalled: \\"I kept getting down on my knees in front of George, saying, 'Please, it's so much money!\\"[68]\\r\\nAfter his 1991 tour of Japan ÿ?his first series of concerts since 1974 ÿ Harrison spoke of a possible Traveling Wilburys tour:\\r\\nThat would be something I'd like to experience. I've always played around in my own mind what a Wilburys tour could be. Would each person do a solo set and then do Wilburys at the end, or would we all go right on from beginning to end and make everything Wilburys? It's an intriguing thought. We could have a great band up there and the four of us could play acoustic if we wanted to. We could all sing \\"Blowin' in the Wind\\" and Bob could sing \\"Something\\". Or we could just sing our individual songs and make them Wilbury tunes, as if we'd recorded them that way. Whatever it was, we could do it.\\r\\nThe Wilburys tour never came about. Petty said about the Wilburys touring:\\r\\nI think it would work, if we wanted to do it. I don't think we ever considered it, really. There were a lot of nights when the conversation would roll around to that. But I don't think anybody ever took it seriously. I think it would ruin it in a way. Then you're obligated to be responsible and it's not in the character of that group. It would make it very formal and that would be the wrong spirit.\\r\\nIn the Rolling Stone Press book The New Rolling Stone Encyclopedia of Rock & Roll, the Traveling Wilburys are described as \\"the ultimate supergroup\\", with a line-up that represented four eras of rock music history and included \\"three indisputable gods\\" in Dylan, Harrison and Orbison. The editors also recognise the band as \\"the antithesis of a supergroup\\", however, due to the musicians' adoption of fraternal alter egos and the humour inherent in the project.[70] AllMusic managing editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine has similarly written: \\"It's impossible to picture a supergroup with a stronger pedigree than that (all that's missing is a Rolling Stone), but in another sense it's hard to call the Wilburys a true supergroup, since they arrived nearly two decades after the all-star craze of the '70s peaked, and they never had the self-important air of nearly all the other supergroups. That, of course, was the key to their charm \\"[51] Speaking to music journalist Paul Zollo in 2004, Petty agreed that humour and self-effacement had been key factors in the Wilburys' success, adding: \\"We wanted to make something good in a world that seemed to get uglier and uglier and meaner and meaner  And I'm really proud that I was part of it. Because I do think that it brought a little sunshine into the world.\\"[71]\\r\\nHarrison said the project was an opportunity to \\"put a finger up to the rules\\" by challenging the norms associated with the music industry.[19] Discussing the Wilburys in Peter Bogdanovich's 2007 documentary Runnin' Down a Dream, Petty said that one of the strengths behind the concept was that it was free of any intervention from record company, management or marketing concerns, and instead developed naturally from a spirit of co-operation and mutual admiration among five established artists.[35] Author Simon Leng recognises the venture as primarily a channel through which Harrison and Dylan could escape the restrictions of their serious media images, but also, in its guise as a \\"phantom band\\", a development by Harrison of the Rutles' satirical approach to the Beatles' legacy, in this case by \\"de-mythologizing\\" rock history.[72]\\r\\nInspired by the Traveling Wilburys' success and particularly its benefit to Petty and Orbison as artists, Warner's executive and staff producer Lenny Waronker encouraged American guitarist Ry Cooder to form the band Little Village.[73] The group, comprising Cooder, Keltner, John Hiatt and Nick Lowe, released a self-titled album in 1992.[74] Greg Kot of the Chicago Tribune described the Notting Hillbillies' Missing ... Presumed Having a Good Time as a Traveling Wilburys-type side project for Mark Knopfler of Dire Straits.[75] Writing in New York magazine in late 1990, Elizabeth Wurtzel cited the Notting Hillbillies' album and the self-titled debut by Hindu Love Gods (a band consisting of Warren Zevon and members of R.E.M.) as examples of a trend whereby, following the Wilburys' Vol. 1, \\"more and more albums seem to be the rock-and-roll equivalents of bowling night.\\"[76]\\r\\nWriting in The Encyclopedia of Popular Music, Colin Larkin cites the Wilburys' contemporary skiffle as evidence of Lonnie Donegan's continued influence on popular music long after the early 1960s.[77] In his book Lonnie Donegan and the Birth of British Rock & Roll, Patrick Humphries describes the Wilburys as \\"a makeshift quintet whose roots were firmly and joyously planted in low-key, low-tech skiffle music\\". He credits the band with inspiring a brief revival of Donegan's \\"DIY skiffle\\", which included Knopfler's Notting Hillbillies.[78]\\r\\nIn the late 1990s and early 2000s, the two Traveling Wilburys albums had limited availability and were out of print in most areas. Harrison, as primary holder of the rights, did not reissue them before his death. In June 2007, the two albums were reissued as The Traveling Wilburys Collection, a box set including both albums on CD (with bonus tracks) and a DVD featuring a 25-minute documentary titled The True History of the Traveling Wilburys and a collection of music videos. The box set was released in three editions; the standard edition, with both CDs and DVD in a double Digipak package and a 16-page booklet; a \\"deluxe\\" boxed edition with the CDs and DVD and an extensive 40-page booklet, artist postcards, and photographs; or a \\"deluxe\\" boxed edition on vinyl. This version omits the DVD, but adds a 12-inch vinyl disc with rare versions of the songs. The release debuted at number 1 in the UK[80] and Australia,[81] and in other countries.[82] On the US Billboard 200 it reached number 9. The collection sold 500,000 copies worldwide during the first three weeks and remained in the UK top 5 for seven weeks after its release.\\r\\nIn November 2009, Genesis Publications, a company with which Harrison had been associated since the late 1970s,[83] announced the release of a limited edition fine-bound book titled The Traveling Wilburys.[84] Compiled by Olivia Harrison,[85] the book includes rare photographs, recording notes, handwritten lyrics, sketches,[19][86] and first-hand commentary on the band's history, together with a foreword by Lynne.[84] Petty, Lynne, Olivia Harrison, Barbara Orbison, Keltner and Idle were among those who attended the US launch at a Beverly Hills bookshop in March 2010.[87] In an interview to publicise the book, Lynne expressed his sadness at the deaths of Harrison and Orbison, and reflected: \\"The Wilburys was such a wonderful band, such a marvellous thing to be part of. They were the best people I could ever wish to work with. Every day was like, 'Wow!' ... it was fun from day one.\\"[85]\\r\\nJim Keltner, the session drummer and percussionist, was not listed as a Wilbury on either album.

Overdubs to the bonus tracks \\"Maxine\\" and \\"Like a Ship\\" also credited as \\"Ayrton Wilbury\\", a pseudonym for Dhani Harrison. The name Ayrton was used in honour of F1 racer Ayrton Senna.[88] Jim Horn played saxophone on both albums.

Harrison appeared as Nelson Wilbury on Warner Bros. Records' 1988 holiday promo album Winter Warnerland (which also included Paul Reubens as \\"Pee Wee Wilbury\\"). In his capacity as producer, Harrison credited himself as \\"Spike and Nelson Wilbury\\" on his 1992 live album Live in Japan. The same year, the Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers single \\"Christmas All Over Again\\" contained a greeting that read \\"Merry Christmas from Nelson and Pee Wee Wilbury.\\"","input":"Who are the original members of the traveling wilburys?"},{"output":"Kannada","context":"Between 1100 CE and 1400 CE Kannada script and Telugu script separated from Old-Kannada script (Halegannada script) or Kadamba script or Bhattiprolu script.

The Bionic Woman series features Jaime Sommers, who takes on special high-risk government missions using her superhuman bionic powers. The Bionic Woman series is a spin-off from the 1970s The Six Million Dollar Man television science fiction action series.\\r\\nWagner stars as professional tennis player Jaime Sommers, who becomes critically injured during a skydiving accident. Jaime's life is saved by Oscar Goldman (Richard Anderson) and Dr. Rudy Wells (Martin E. Brooks) with bionic surgical implants similar to those of The Six Million Dollar Man Steve Austin (Lee Majors). Through the use of cybernetic implants, known as bionics, Jaime is gifted with an amplified bionic ear which allows her to hear at low volumes and at different frequencies from most humans and over uncommonly long distances. She also has extraordinary strength in her bionic right arm and in both legs that enables her to run at speeds exceeding 60 miles per hour.[1] She is then assigned to spy missions of her own as an occasional agent of the Office of Scientific Information, while under the employment cover as a school teacher of middle school students.[2]\\r\\nThe series proved highly popular worldwide, gaining high ratings in the US and particularly so in the UK (where it became the only science fiction programme to achieve the No.1 position in the ratings during the 20th century). The series ran for three seasons, from 1976 to 1978, first on the ABC network and then the NBC network for its final season. Years after its cancelation, three spin-off TV movies were produced between 1987 and 1994. Reruns of the show aired on Sci-Fi Channel from 1997 to 2001. A remake of the series was produced in 2007.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe character of Jaime Sommers first appears in a two-part episode of The Six Million Dollar Man in 1975 titled \\"The Bionic Woman\\". In the first episode, Steve travels to his old hometown of Ojai, California, to buy a ranch that is for sale and to visit his mother and stepfather. During his visit, he rekindles his old relationship with Jaime Sommers, now one of America's top tennis players. Their relationship progresses rapidly to the point where Steve proposes marriage.\\r\\nDuring an outing, Steve and Jaime take part in skydiving. Jaime's parachute malfunctions and she plummets to the ground, falling through tree branches, hitting the ground and suffering traumatic injuries to her head, legs, and right arm. Steve then makes an emotional plea to his boss, Oscar Goldman, to save Jaime's life by implementing bionics, even going so far as to commit Jaime to becoming an operative of the Office of Scientific Intelligence (OSI). Goldman agrees to assign Dr. Rudy Wells (played at this point in the series by Alan Oppenheimer) and the bionics team to rebuild her.\\r\\nJaime's body is reconstructed with parts similar to Steve's, but the actual cost of rebuilding her is not revealed. It is said humorously in dialogue to be less than the $6 million it cost to rebuild Austin because the replacement parts for her were \\"smaller\\" (though in Germany the show was called Die Sieben Millionen Dollar Frau, which translates as The Seven Million Dollar Woman). Like Steve before her, Jaime is given two bionic legs, capable of propelling her at speeds exceeding 60?mph (having been clocked at more than 62?mph in \\"Doomsday Is Tomorrow\\" and outpacing a race car going 100?mph in \\"Winning is Everything\\") and jumping to and from great heights, and her right arm is replaced by a lifelike prosthetic capable of bending steel or throwing objects great distances. Whereas Austin received a bionic eye, the inner mechanism of Jaime's right ear is replaced by a bionic device that gives her amplified hearing such that she can detect most sounds regardless of volume or frequency. These bionic implants cannot be distinguished from natural body parts, except on occasions where they sustain damage and the mechanisms beneath the skin become exposed, as seen in Part 2 of the episode \\"Doomsday Is Tomorrow\\", when Jaime sustained damage to her right leg. Jaime discovers on vacation in the Bahamas her artificial bionic skin cannot suntan with exposure to sunlight.\\r\\nAfter Jaime recovers from her operation, Steve tries to break his agreement with Oscar that she will serve as an agent for OSI. Jaime agrees to undertake a mission for Oscar despite Steve's concerns. During the mission her bionics malfunction, and she experiences severe and crippling headaches. Dr. Wells determines that Jaime's body is rejecting her bionic implants and a massive cerebral clot is causing her headaches and malfunctions. Soon after, she goes berserk and forces her way out of the hospital. Steve pursues and catches her, and she collapses in his arms. Soon after, Jaime dies on the operating table when her body shuts down.\\r\\nThe character was so popular that ABC asked the writers to find a way to bring her back. In the first episode of the next season, it is revealed that Jaime had not died after all, but Steve was not told. He soon discovers the truth when he is hospitalized after suffering severe damage to his bionic legs; he sees Jaime before slipping into a coma.\\r\\nAs Steve later learns, Wells' assistant, Dr. Michael Marchetti, had urged Rudy (now played by Martin E. Brooks) to try his newly developed cryogenic techniques to keep Jaime in suspended animation until the cerebral clot could be safely removed, after which she was successfully revived. A side effect of the procedure causes Jaime to develop retrograde amnesia, preventing her from recalling previous events including her relationship with Steve. Any attempt to remember causes her headaches and pain. Steve reluctantly lets her go on to live her own life as an agent for the OSI, although the pair would frequently work together on missions and establish a new friendship.\\r\\nJaime, now retired as a tennis player, takes a job as a schoolteacher at an Air Force base in Ojai, California. She lives in an apartment over a barn located on the ranch owned by Steve's mother and stepfather, both of whom are aware of their bionic implants and their lives as secret agents. Season three opened with the two-part episode \\"The Bionic Dog\\", in which Jaime discovers Max (short for Maximillion), a German Shepherd dog that has been given a bionic jaw and legs who could run at speeds of up to 90?mph. His bionics pre-date Steve's and Jamie's, as he was a lab animal used to test early bionic prosthetics. He was named \\"Maximillion\\" because his bionics cost \\"a million\\" dollars. When he was introduced, he experienced symptoms suggesting bionic rejection and was due to be put to sleep. Jaime discovered the condition was psychological, stemming from a traumatic lab fire that injured him when he was a puppy. With Jaime's help, Max was cured and went to live with her, proving himself to be of considerable help in some of her adventures. The original intent was to create a spin-off series featuring The Bionic Dog,[3] and at the end of the two-part episode that introduced him, it was implied Max would stay with Jaime's forest ranger friend Roger Grette in the Sierra Mountains and Jaime would visit occasionally. However, the network rejected the proposed spin-off series and Max stayed with Jaime instead, making several appearances throughout the third season of The Bionic Woman.\\r\\nTo maintain the show's plausibility, creator/executive producer Kenneth Johnson set very specific limits on Jaime Sommers's abilities. He elaborated, \\"When youre dealing with the area of fantasy, if you say, Well, theyre bionic so they can do whatever they want, then it gets out of hand, so youve got to have really, really tight rules. [Steve and Jaime] can jump up two stories but not three. They can jump down three stories but not four. Jaime cant turn over a truck but she can turn over a car.\\"[4] These limits were occasionally incorporated into episodes, such as \\"Kill Oscar Part 1\\" in which Jaime is forced to make a jump that's too far down for her bionic legs, causing massive damage to them and nearly causing her death as a result.\\r\\nThe series premiered on ABC in January 1976, as a mid-season replacement for the sitcoms When Things Were Rotten and That's My Mama.[5] With thirteen episodes airing from January 1976 to May 1976, it became the fifth most-watched television show of the whole 1975ÿ76 season ÿ despite only running for half the season ÿ ranking behind Maude, Laverne & Shirley, Rich Man, Poor Man, and All In The Family, and slightly ahead of The Six Million Dollar Man. Season two ran from September 1976 to May 1977 with 22 episodes and finished with good ratings (#14 overall ÿ slightly behind The Six Million Dollar Man). Season two also had its most notable episodes, \\"Kill Oscar\\" where Jaime fights the fembots, and \\"Deadly Ringer\\", which would win Wagner an Emmy Award. Although the show performed well during season two, ABC elected not to renew the series, feeling it was no longer attracting the kind of demographics that ABC wanted (ABC head Fred Silverman was notorious for his focus on demographics).[6] NBC picked up the show for a third (and final) season. Season three ran from September 1977 to May 1978 with 22 episodes and would see a new character, Chris Williams (Christopher Stone), as a recurring love-interest for Jaime. This was due in part to the change of networks, which prevented any more crossovers by Jaime's former love-interest, Steve Austin; however, in a situation still considered unique; Anderson and Brooks continued to play their roles in both series, despite the network differential.\\r\\nThe series proved popular worldwide, particularly so in the United Kingdom, where it was shown on the ITV network and achieved unusually high audience figures for a science fiction show. The first episode of the series (\\"Welcome Home Jaime\\") was shown on 1 July 1976 and was the No.1 most watched programme of the week.[7] It was watched in 7 million homes, giving it an average of 14 million viewers. Two weeks later, the show's third episode (Angel of Mercy) also became the No.1 most-watched programme of the week. Its success continued with a further 10 episodes scoring in the top 20 during 1976 (in contrast, The Six Million Dollar Man never once entered the top 10 rating during its five seasons, though this was most likely due to the fact that the show was never broadcast across all ITV stations in the UK at the same time).[7] The second season also proved popular, with seven episodes finishing in the weekly top 20, the highest of these being the episode The Vega Influence on 12 May 1977, which reached No.8 with 14.8 million viewers.[7] The third season was not broadcast simultaneously across all ITV stations in the UK, however, and therefore no episodes reached the weekly Top 20.\\r\\nThe most notable of the frequent crossovers between the two shows included a two-part episode in which Steve and Jaime square off against Austin's sometimes-friend/sometimes-enemy Bigfoot and a three-part story arc entitled \\"Kill Oscar\\" that aired the first and third parts as Bionic Woman episodes and the second part as an episode of The Six Million Dollar Man. The close connection between The Six Million Dollar Man and The Bionic Woman was highlighted by the fact that Richard Anderson and Martin E. Brooks played their same characters on two different television shows (eventually) running concurrently on two different networks.\\r\\nOn her own, Jaime's enemies include the Fembots, a line of powerful robots that she fights twice in the series over several episodes. She also thwarts the plan of an aging nuclear scientist named Elijah Cooper to destroy all life on Earth using a doomsday device in \\"Doomsday Is Tomorrow\\". Jaime's missions frequently involved undercover work in which she takes on a secret identity, such as a nun, a police officer, a college student, an air-steward, a singer, and a professional wrestler. Her tennis background also came into play occasionally, and she was also from time to time seen having adventures with some of her students in Ojai.\\r\\nAs with spy shows at this time, Jaime was frequently kidnapped (more often than not with the use of chloroform or a drugged drink) and placed in dangerous situations from which she would need her bionic abilities to escape. Typically, she would be bound or handcuffed to a bomb from which she could escape with ease once she woke up. However, on one occasion she was handcuffed to a friend, so she could not use her bionic strength to escape as this would pull off the friend's hand.\\r\\nJaime dealt with a number of bizarre cases, such as a villain who operates a hair salon using a \\"truth serum\\" shampoo to extract information from OSI agents. In another episode, a convict named Lisa Galloway (also portrayed by Lindsay Wagner) is given plastic surgery and tries to replace Jaime. In a later episode, Lisa ingests a paste-like substance called Adrenalizine that gives her temporary super-strength, allowing her to fully replace Jaime at OSI while the real Jaime is imprisoned and led to question her own identity. Lisa, however, did not know of Jaime's bionic implants and believed her powers to have come from the Adrenalizine. After Jaime's eventual escape, Dr. Wells discovers that the Adrenalizine was breaking down and becoming toxic to Lisa's health. Further complicating the issue was Lisa's increasing belief that she was in fact, the real Jaime.\\r\\nDuring the series, it is shown that Jaime's enhanced abilities have their limitations. In one of the \\"Kill Oscar\\" chapters, Jaime jumps from the window of a particularly tall building while trying to escape the Fembots. However, due to the height from which she jumped, her legs explode upon landing, nearly killing her. Extreme cold is shown to inhibit her bionic implants, causing them to freeze up and malfunction (a scenario also common with Steve Austin). However, her right ear, as it is encased in her body, is typically not subject to these negative effects.\\r\\nWhile Steve Austin occasionally (particularly in early episodes) employed violence in order to complete missions, Jaime's approach tended to be less-violent and as such she was rarely shown directly using her bionic strength against a human opponent (and even when she did, never with deadly force).\\r\\nIn the last episode (\\"On the Run\\"), Jaime is called \\"Robot Lady\\" by a little girl who has learned about her bionics. Like Steve Austin in the original book Cyborg, she has to come to terms with the fact that she is not quite human. After three years with too many assignments to allow her time to herself, she resigns. However, the people in charge decide that she cannot just be allowed to leave and want to put her into a safe community where they can keep their eye on her. She goes on the run but later realises that she is still the same woman, despite her mechanical parts and goes back to work for the OSI, but with fewer missions and more time to herself. The final episode was acknowledged to have been inspired by The Prisoner as Jaime is similarly being pursued by entities concerned about the secret information she possesses.\\r\\nDespite being on different networks, both The Bionic Woman and The Six Million Dollar Man were simultaneously cancelled in the spring of 1978. Unlike The Six Million Dollar Man, which ended with a standard episode, \\"On the Run\\" was written and filmed as a resolution to the series.\\r\\nThree made-for-TV movies were produced that expanded the \\"bionic family\\" and explored a rekindled love between Jaime and Steve.\\r\\nIn the first reunion, The Return of the Six Million Dollar Man and the Bionic Woman (1987), Jaime and Steve are reunited after nearly ten years of living separate lives. Jaime's memory is fully restored (according to Oscar, Jaime was involved in an explosion at the American Embassy in Budapest and \\"she remembered everything\\" after she recovered from her concussion) and she tries to reconcile her feelings for Steve while at the same time helping train Steve's son Michael in the use of his own recently acquired updated bionics. Jaime challenges Michael to a friendly race. He overtakes her and she makes the comment that she feels like an \\"obsolete model\\". Michael is kidnapped by Fortress. Steve and Jamie along with the Air Force infiltrate the abandoned glass factory to \\"rescue\\" Michael.\\r\\nThe second film, Bionic Showdown: The Six Million Dollar Man and the Bionic Woman, (1989) introduced Sandra Bullock as paraplegic Kate Mason who becomes a next-generation bionic woman and Sommers again helps train the neophyte cyborg.\\r\\nIn the final reunion film, Bionic Ever After? (1994), a computer virus corrupts Jaime's bionic systems. Dr. Wells informs Steve that \\"she may never be bionic again,\\" but Steve's main regard is he wants her alive above all else. She undergoes a major upgrade, which not only increases the power of her bionics but gives her night vision. Finally, after so many years of waiting around, the bionic couple say their \\"I Do's\\".\\r\\nJerry Fielding composed the series' first opening theme. Beginning in season two, Fielding's theme was phased out and replaced by another piece of music by Joe Harnell which had previously been used for the closing credits.[clarification needed]\\r\\nIn the UK, Universal released three single-disc volumes of selected episodes of The Bionic Woman in 2001/02. Each volume contained three episodes. Universal then released the first two full seasons of The Bionic Woman on DVD in the UK and Australia in 2005/06. There were no special features on any of the sets. Season three was eventually released in the UK by Fabulous Films in December 2012, along with repackaged versions of the first two seasons and a complete 18-disc boxed set of all three seasons.[8][9][10][11] These versions contained various special features as found on the Region 1 sets (see below), though the season three release also contains all three of the Bionic reunion movies from the 1980s and 1990s.\\r\\nIn Germany, Koch Media has released all three seasons on DVD under the name Die Sieben Millionen Dollar Frau (The Seven Million Dollar Woman), though these sets do not contain special features.\\r\\nPlans for a North American DVD release were first announced in 2004 by Universal Home Video. Those plans were made public via a listing in a TV-DVD release guide sent to retailers,[12] a mention in an otherwise unrelated studio press release,[13] and as a trailer included on a DVD given away through retail chain Best Buy.[14] However, that release never happened due to rights issues which prevented both The Bionic Woman and The Six Million Dollar Man from being released on DVD in North America at that time.[15]\\r\\nIn April 2010, creator Kenneth Johnson said that the rights issues had been solved and he was taping interviews for the DVD. On July 15, 2010, Universal Studios Home Entertainment announced the release of the first season on DVD in North America, which took place on October 19, 2010.[16] Season Two was released on May 17, 2011.[17] On October 4, 2011, Universal released The Bionic Woman: The Complete Third & Final Season on Region 1 DVD.[18]\\r\\nOn October 13, 2015, Universal released The Bionic Woman- The Complete Series on DVD in Region 1.[19]\\r\\nTwo novels adapting various episodes were published to coincide with the series: Welcome Home, Jaime and Extracurricular Activities, both by Eileen Lottman. The UK editions of these two books were credited to \\"Maud Willis\\" and were retitled Double Identity and A Question of Life, respectively. Although the closing credits of every episode says the series was based upon Martin Caidin's 1972 novel, Cyborg, this only refers to the bionics concept, the characters of Rudy Wells and Oscar Goldman, and the occasional appearance by Steve Austin; Jaime Sommers does not appear in any of Caidin's novels.\\r\\nA short-lived comic book series by Charlton Comics that lasted five issues was published in the US in 1976ÿ77. UK comic Look-In ran a colour comic strip between 1976 and 1979, written by Angus P. Allan and drawn by artists including John Bolton and Arthur Ranson. The character was also to have appeared in a 1996 comic miniseries entitled Bionix by Maximum Press. Although the magazine was advertised in comic book trade publications, it was ultimately never published.[21]\\r\\nThe French comic Tl-Junior published strips based on the popular TV series. This included their own versions of The Six Million Dollar Man and the Bionic Woman which was renamed Super Jaimie.\\r\\nIn March 2012, Dynamite Entertainment launched a new The Bionic Woman comic book title, based upon the revised continuity established in the Kevin Smith-written The Bionic Man comic (a reimagining of The Six Million Dollar Man), in which the character of Jaime Sommers was reintroduced.[22] A crossover mini-series, The Bionic Man vs. The Bionic Woman, was launched in January 2013. Unlike the Bionic Man title, which (depending on the artist) occasionally renders Steve Austin in the likeness of actor Lee Majors, the Dynamite version of Jaime Sommers generally is not rendered in the likeness of Lindsay Wagner. In late 2013, Dynamite ended both series and in the spring of 2014 launched The Six Million Dollar Man Season 6, a more faithful adaptation of the original Six Million Dollar Man TV series. Jaime Sommers, based on the Wagner interpretation, was reintroduced in issue 3 and in June 2014 Dynamite announced it will publish The Bionic Woman Season 4, a continuation of the TV series, beginning in the fall of 2014.\\r\\nLike its parent program The Bionic Woman spawned its own line of toys. Kenner produced a 12-inch doll of the character, with similar features to the Steve Austin version (bionic modules and removable bionic limbs), except instead of a bionic eye the doll's head would click when turned, simulating the sound of Jaime's bionic ear. Accessories for the doll released by Kenner included additional fashions, and a Bionic Beauty Salon playset.\\r\\nA metal lunchbox for children was available, as was a vinyl story record produced by Wonderland Records. Kenner produced a series of stickers and temporary tattoos featuring Jaime Sommers individually and with Steve Austin.\\r\\nA board game based on The Bionic Woman series was also created. It was sold by Parker Brothers in the US, and was a 2ÿ4 player game suited for children between 7 and 12 years of age.\\r\\nIn July 2016, prior to Comic-Con International, the New York Times ran a story about Dynamite Entertainment. In it, best-selling author Andy Mangels was revealed to be writing a prestigious new intercompany crossover mini-series for the company, in conjunction with DC Comics: Wonder Woman '77 Meets The Bionic Woman, bringing together the Lynda Carter television character with Lindsay Wagner's fellow 1970s television super-heroine. The series was released in December 2016.[23][24]\\r\\nIn August 2002 it was announced that the show was to be remade by producers Jennifer and Suzanne Todd (\\"Team Todd\\") for the USA Network; media reports suggested that Jennifer Aniston was being considered for the title role. After the initial press release was issued, the show never made it out of pre-production and no other announcements were made as to the show's fate.\\r\\nOn October 9, 2006, NBC Universal announced that it was bringing the project back,[25] with new producers and a reworking of the concept. The project's one-hour pilot was given an official greenlight by NBC on January 3, 2007.[26] On February 13, 2007 it was announced that English actress Michelle Ryan (affecting an American accent) had been cast in the title role for this pilot, and that Katee Sackhoff would play Sarah Corvus, the bionic woman's nemesis.[27] The series was subsequently picked up by NBC and debuted on September 26, 2007. Eight more episodes were produced and aired before the Writers Guild of America strike forced a halt to production. As of March 2008, NBC had not yet announced whether the show would be renewed, allowed to complete its original order of 13 episodes, or cancelled outright, although series developer and producer David Eick told the official website of the Sci-Fi Channel (now known as Syfy) on March 18, 2008, that the series had been cancelled.[28] Lindsay Wagner, the original Bionic Woman, was not involved in the new series. Wagner said, \\"On a technical level, it was very good, but I don't think they understood the show. It was steeped in that old-school thinking. It was like a lot of things today, angry and dark.[29]","input":"What was the bionic woman's real name?"},{"output":"Beluga caviar","context":"Beluga caviar is caviar consisting of the roe (or eggs) of the beluga sturgeon Huso huso. It is found primarily in the Caspian Sea, the worlds largest salt-water lake, which is bordered by Iran and the CIS countries of Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Russia, and Turkmenistan. It can also be found in the Black Sea basin and occasionally in the Adriatic Sea. Beluga caviar is the most expensive type of caviar,[1] with market prices, at the beginning of the millennium, ranging from $7,000 to $10,000/kg ($3,200 to $4,500/lb).[2][3]\\r\\nThe Beluga sturgeon is currently considered to be critically endangered, causing the United States Fish and Wildlife Service to ban in 2005 the importation of Beluga caviar which originated in the Caspian Sea and Black Sea basin. In 2006, the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) suspended all trade made with the traditional caviar-producing regions of the Caspian and Black Seas (Beluga, Ossetra and Sevruga), (Azerbaijan, Bulgaria, China, Iran, Kazakhstan, Romania, Russia, Serbia and Montenegro, Turkmenistan, and Ukraine) due to the producing countries' failure to apply international regulations and recommendations.[4] Caviar from Iran is exempted from the ban. Iran is considered by CITES to practice effective conservation and policing of its fisheries.[5] In January 2007, this ban was partly lifted, allowing the sale of 96 tons of caviar, 15 percent below the official 2005 level.[6] CITES maintained the 2007 quotas for 2008, drawing criticism for doing little to protect the declining sturgeon population.[7]\\r\\nThe Beluga sturgeon can take up to 20 years to reach maturity. The fish harvested for caviar are often nearly 900?kg (2,000?lb). The eggs themselves are the largest of the commonly used roes, and range in color from dark gray (almost black) to light gray, with the lighter colors coming from older fish, and being the most valued. A pearly white variety, called Almas (Persian for diamond), taken from a centennial female sturgeon,[citation needed] is the rarest type of Beluga available, with an extremely small production and prices reaching almost S25,000 ($35,300) per kilogram.[8]\\r\\nAny additions by producers diminish the value of the roe, and the caviar usually reaches the market without any additions or processing whatsoever.\\r\\nAs with most caviars, Beluga is usually handled with a caviar spoon made of mother of pearl, bone, or other non-metallic material, as metal utensils tend to impart an unwelcome metallic taste to the delicate and expensive roe.[9] Beluga caviar is usually served by itself on toast, unlike other less expensive caviars that can be served in a variety of ways, including hollowed and cooked new potatoes, on a blini, or garnished with sour cream, crme fra?che, minced onion or minced hard boiled egg whites.

The show premiered on CBS on September 24, 2007.[3] The series' tenth season premiered on September 19, 2016.[4] In March 2017, the series was renewed for two additional seasons, bringing its total to twelve, and running through the 2018ÿ19 television season. The eleventh season is set to premiere on September 25, 2017.[5]\\r\\nThe show is primarily centered on five characters living in Pasadena, California: Leonard Hofstadter and Sheldon Cooper, both physicists at Caltech, who share an apartment; Penny, a waitress and aspiring actress who later becomes a pharmaceutical representative and who lives across the hall; and Leonard and Sheldon's similarly geeky and socially awkward friends and co-workers, aerospace engineer Howard Wolowitz and astrophysicist Raj Koothrappali. The geekiness and intellect of the four men are contrasted for comic effect with Penny's social skills and common sense.[6][7]\\r\\nOver time, supporting characters have been promoted to starring roles: Leslie Winkle, a physicist who dated Leonard and Howard; neuroscientist Amy Farrah Fowler, who joins the group after being matched to Sheldon on a dating website (and later becomes Sheldon's girlfriend); Bernadette Rostenkowski, Howard's wife (previously his girlfriend), a microbiologist and former part-time waitress alongside Penny; Stuart Bloom, the cash-strapped owner of the comic book store the characters often visit; and Emily Sweeney, a dermatologist who dated Raj.\\r\\nThe structure of the original, unaired pilot, developed for the 2006ÿ07 television season, was substantially different from the series' current form. The only characters retained in both pilots were Leonard (Johnny Galecki) and Sheldon (Jim Parsons), who are named after Sheldon Leonard, a longtime figure in episodic television as producer, director and actor. Althea (Vernee Watson) was a character featured in both pilots and the first series episode.[8] Two female leads were Canadian actress Amanda Walsh as Katie, \\"a street-hardened, tough-as-nails woman with a vulnerable interior,\\"[9][10] and Iris Bahr as Gilda, a scientist colleague and friend of the male characters. Sheldon and Leonard meet Katie after she breaks up with a boyfriend and they invite her to share their apartment. Gilda is threatened by Katie's presence. Test audiences reacted negatively to Katie, but they liked Sheldon and Leonard. The original pilot used Thomas Dolby's hit \\"She Blinded Me with Science\\" as its theme song.\\r\\nAlthough the show was not picked up, its creators were given an opportunity to retool it and produce a second pilot. They brought in the remaining cast and retooled the show to its final format. Katie was replaced by Penny (Kaley Cuoco). The original unaired pilot never has officially been released, but it has circulated on the Internet. On the evolution of the show, Chuck Lorre said, \\"We did the 'Big Bang Pilot' about two and a half years ago, and it sucked ... but there were two remarkable things that worked perfectly, and that was Johnny and Jim. We rewrote the thing entirely and then we were blessed with Kaley and Simon and Kunal.\\" As to whether the world will ever see the original pilot on a future DVD release, Lorre said, \\"Wow, that would be something. We will see. Show your failures...\\"[11]\\r\\nThe first and second pilots of The Big Bang Theory were directed by James Burrows, who did not continue with the show. The reworked second pilot led to a 13-episode order by CBS on May 14, 2007.[12] Prior to its airing on CBS, the pilot episode was distributed on iTunes free of charge. The show premiered on September 24, 2007, and was picked up for a full 22-episode season on October 19, 2007.[13] The show is filmed in front of a live audience,[14] and is produced by Warner Bros. Television and Chuck Lorre Productions.[15] Production was halted on November 6, 2007, due to the Writers Guild of America strike. Nearly three months later, on February 4, 2008, the series was temporarily replaced by a short-lived sitcom, Welcome to the Captain. The series returned on March 17, 2008, in an earlier time slot[16] and ultimately only 17 episodes were produced for the first season.[17][18]\\r\\nAfter the strike ended, the show was picked up for a second season, airing in the 2008ÿ2009 season, premiering in the same time slot on September 22, 2008.[19] With increasing ratings, the show received a two-year renewal through the 2010ÿ11 season in 2009.[20][21] In 2011, the show was picked up for three more seasons.[22] In March 2014, the show was renewed again for three more years through the 2016ÿ17 season. This marks the second time the series has gained a three-year renewal.[23] In March 2017, the series was renewed for two additional seasons, bringing its total to 12, and running through the 2018ÿ19 television season.[24]\\r\\nDavid Saltzberg, a professor of physics and astronomy at the University of California, Los Angeles, checks scripts and provides dialogue, mathematics equations, and diagrams used as props.[6] According to executive producer/co-creator Bill Prady, \\"We're working on giving Sheldon an actual problem that he's going to be working on throughout the [first] season so there's actual progress to the boards ... . We worked hard to get all the science right.\\"[7]\\r\\nSeveral of the actors in The Big Bang Theory previously worked together on the sitcom Roseanne, including Johnny Galecki, Sara Gilbert, Laurie Metcalf (who plays Sheldon's mother, Mary Cooper), and Meagen Fay (who plays Bernadette's mother). Additionally, Lorre was a writer on the series for several seasons.\\r\\nThe Canadian alternative rock band Barenaked Ladies wrote and recorded the show's theme song, which describes the history and formation of the universe and the Earth. Co-lead singer Ed Robertson was asked by Lorre and Prady to write a theme song for the show after the producers attended one of the band's concerts in Los Angeles. By coincidence, Robertson had recently read Simon Singh's book Big Bang,[25][26] and at the concert improvised a freestyle rap about the origins of the universe.[citation needed] Lorre and Prady phoned him shortly thereafter and asked him to write the theme song. Having been asked to write songs for other films and shows, but ending up being rejected because of producer's favor of other artist's song, Robertson agreed to write the theme only after learning that Lorre and Prady had not asked anyone else.[citation needed]\\r\\nOn October 9, 2007, a full-length (1 minute and 45 seconds) version of the song was released commercially.[27] Although some sources identify the song title as \\"History of Everything,\\"[28] the cover art for the single identifies the title as \\"Big Bang Theory Theme.\\" A music video also was released via special features on The Complete Fourth Season DVD and Blu-ray set.[29][30] The theme was included on the band's greatest hits album, Hits from Yesterday & the Day Before, released on September 27, 2011.[31] In September 2015, TMZ uncovered court documents showing that Steven Page sued former bandmate Robertson over the song, alleging that he was promised 20% of the proceeds, but that Robertson has kept that money entirely for himself.[32]\\r\\nFor the first three seasons, Galecki, Parsons, and Cuoco, the three main stars of the show, received at most $60,000 per episode. The salary for the three went up to $200,000 per episode for the fourth season. Their per-episode pay went up an additional $50,000 in each of the following three seasons, culminating in $350,000 per episode in the seventh season.[33][34] In September 2013, Bialik and Rauch renegotiated the contracts they held since they were introduced to the series in 2010. On their old contracts, each was making $20,000ÿ$30,000 per episode, while the new contracts doubled that, beginning at $60,000 per episode, increasing steadily to $100,000 per episode by the end of the contract, as well as adding another year for both.[35]\\r\\nBy season seven, Galecki, Parsons, and Cuoco were also receiving 0.25% of the series' back-end money. Before production began on the eighth season, the three plus Helberg and Nayyar, looked to renegotiate new contracts, with Galecki, Parsons, and Cuoco seeking around $1 million per episode, as well as more back-end money.[36] Contracts were signed in the beginning of August 2014, giving the three principal actors an estimated $1 million per episode for three years, with the possibility to extend for a fourth year. The deals also include larger pieces of the show, signing bonuses, production deals, and advances towards the back-end.[37] Helberg and Nayyar were also able to renegotiate their contracts, giving them a per-episode pay in the \\"mid-six-figure range\\", up from around $100,000 per episode they each received in years prior. The duo, who were looking to have salary parity with Parsons, Galecki, and Cuoco, signed their contracts after the studio and producers threatened to write the characters out of the series if a deal could not be reached before the start of production on season eight.[38] By season 10, Helberg and Nayyar reached the $1 million per episode parity with Parsons, Galecki, and Cuoco, due to a clause in their deals signed in 2014.[39]\\r\\nIn March 2017, the main cast members (Galecki, Parsons, Cuoco, Helberg, and Nayyar) took a 10% pay cut to allow Bialik and Rauch an increase in their earnings.[40] This put Galecki, Parsons, Cuoco, Helberg and Nayyar at $900,000 per episode, with Parsons, Galecki, and Helberg also receiving overall deals with Warner Bros. Television.[24] By the end of April, Bialik and Rauch had signed deals to earn $500,000 per episode, each, with the deals also including a separate development component for both actors. The deal was an increase from the $175,000 - $200,000 the duo had been making per episode.[41]\\r\\nThese actors are credited in all episodes of the series:\\r\\nThese actors were first credited as guest stars and later promoted to main cast:\\r\\nAs the theme of the show revolves around science, many distinguished and high-profile scientists have appeared as guest stars on the show. Famous astrophysicist and Nobel laureate George Smoot had a cameo appearance in the second season.[56] Theoretical physicist Brian Greene also appeared on the show in the fourth season. Astrophysicist, science populizer, and physics outreach specialist Neil deGrasse Tyson also appeared in the fourth season.\\r\\nCosmologist Stephen Hawking made a short guest appearance in the fifth season episode;[57] in the eighth season, Hawking video conferences with Sheldon and Leonard, and makes another appearance in the 200th episode. In the fifth and sixth seasons, NASA astronaut Michael J. Massimino played himself multiple times in the role of Howard's fellow astronaut. Bill Nye appeared in the seventh season, and Elon Musk made an appearance in the ninth season.\\r\\nMuch of the series focuses on science, particularly physics. The four main male characters are employed at Caltech and have science-related occupations, as do Bernadette and Amy. The characters frequently banter about scientific theories or news (notably around the start of the show), and make science-related jokes.\\r\\nScience has also interfered with the characters' romantic lives. Leslie breaks up with Leonard when he sides with Sheldon in his support for string theory rather than loop quantum gravity.[70] When Leonard joins Sheldon, Raj, and Howard on a three-month Arctic research trip, it separates Leonard and Penny at a time their relationship is budding. When Bernadette takes an interest in Leonard's work, it makes both Penny and Howard envious and results in Howard confronting Leonard, and Penny asking Sheldon to teach her physics.[71] Sheldon and Amy also briefly end their relationship after an argument over which of their fields is superior.[72]\\r\\nDavid Saltzberg, who has a PhD in physics, has served as the science consultant for the show for six seasons and attends every taping.[73] While Saltzberg knows physics, he sometimes needs assistance from Mayim Bialik, who has a PhD in neuroscience.[74] Saltzberg sees early versions of scripts which need scientific information added to them, and he also points out where the writers, despite their knowledge of science, have made a mistake. He is usually not needed during a taping unless a lot of science, and especially the whiteboard, is involved.[74]\\r\\nThe four main male characters are all avid science fiction, fantasy, and comic book fans and memorabilia collectors.\\r\\nStar Trek in particular is frequently referenced and Sheldon identifies strongly with the character of Spock, so much so that when he is given a used napkin signed by Leonard Nimoy as a Christmas gift from Penny he is overwhelmed with excitement and gratitude (\\"I possess the DNA of Leonard Nimoy?!\\").[75] Star Trek: The Original Series cast member George Takei has made a cameo, and Leonard Nimoy made a cameo as the voice of Sheldon's vintage Mr. Spock action figure (both cameos were in dream sequences). Star Trek: The Next Generation cast members Brent Spiner and LeVar Burton have had cameos as themselves,[76][77] while Wil Wheaton has a recurring role as a fictionalized version of himself.\\r\\nThey are also fans of Star Wars, Battlestar Galactica, and Doctor Who. In the episode \\"The Ornithophobia Diffusion\\", when there is a delay in watching Star Wars on Blu-ray, Howard complains, \\"If we don't start soon, George Lucas is going to change it again\\" (referring to Lucas' controversial alterations to the films) and in \\"The Hot Troll Deviation\\", Katee Sackhoff of Battlestar Galactica appeared as Howard's fantasy dream girl. The characters have different tastes in franchises with Sheldon praising Firefly but disapproving of Leonard's enjoyment of Babylon 5.[78][n 1] With regard to fantasy, the four make frequent references to The Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter novels and movies. Additionally, Howard can speak Sindarin, one of the two Elvish languages from The Lord of the Rings.\\r\\nWednesday night is the group's designated \\"comic book night\\"[79] because that is the day of the week when new comic books are released. The comic book store is run by fellow geek and recurring character Stuart. On a number of occasions, the group members have dressed up as pop culture characters, including The Flash, Aquaman, Frodo Baggins, Superman, Batman, Spock, The Doctor, Green Lantern, and Thor.[80] As a consequence of losing a bet to Stuart and Wil Wheaton, the group members are forced to visit the comic book store dressed as Catwoman, Wonder Woman, Batgirl, and Supergirl.[81] DC Comics announced that, to promote its comics, the company will sponsor Sheldon wearing Green Lantern T-shirts.[82]\\r\\nVarious games have been featured, as well as referenced, on the series (e.g. World of Warcraft, Halo, Mario, etc.), including fictional games like Mystic Warlords of Ka'a (which became a reality in 2011)[83] and Rock-paper-scissors-lizard-Spock.\\r\\nOne of the recurring plot lines is the relationship between Leonard and Penny. Leonard becomes attracted to Penny in the pilot episode and his need to do favors for her is a frequent point of humor in the first season. Their first long term relationship begins when Leonard returns from a three-month expedition to the North Pole in the season 3 premiere. However, when Leonard tells Penny that he loves her, she realizes she cannot say it back. Both Leonard and Penny go on to date other people; most notably with Leonard dating Raj's sister Priya for much of season 4. This relationship is jeopardized when Leonard comes to falsely believe that Raj has slept with Penny, and ultimately ends when Priya sleeps with a former boyfriend in \\"The Good Guy Fluctuation\\".\\r\\nPenny, who admits to missing Leonard in \\"The Roommate Transmogrification\\", accepts his request to renew their relationship in \\"The Beta Test Initiation\\". After Penny suggests having sex in \\"The Launch Acceleration\\", Leonard breaks the mood by proposing to her. Penny says \\"no\\" but does not break up with him. She stops a proposal a second time in \\"The Tangible Affection Proof\\". In the sixth-season episode, \\"The 43 Peculiarity\\", Penny finally tells Leonard that she loves him. Although they both feel jealousy when the other receives significant attention from the opposite sex, Penny is secure enough in their relationship to send him off on an exciting four-month expedition without worrying in \\"The Bon Voyage Reaction\\". After Leonard returns, their relationship blossoms over the seventh season. In the penultimate episode \\"The Gorilla Dissolution\\", Penny admits that they should marry and when Leonard realizes that she is serious, he proposes with a ring that he had been saving for years. Leonard and Penny decide to elope to Las Vegas in the season 8 finale, but beforehand, wanting no secrets, Leonard admits to kissing another woman, Mandy Chow (Melissa Tang) while on an expedition on the North Sea. Despite this, Leonard and Penny finally elope in the season 9 premiere.\\r\\nIn the third-season finale, Raj and Howard search for a woman compatible with Sheldon and discover neurobiologist Amy Farrah Fowler. Like him, she has a history of social ineptitude and participates in online dating only to fulfill an agreement with her mother. This spawns a storyline in which Sheldon and Amy communicate daily while insisting to Leonard and Penny that they are not romantically involved. In \\"The Agreement Dissection\\", Sheldon and Amy talk in her apartment after a night of dancing and she kisses him on the lips. Instead of getting annoyed, Sheldon says \\"fascinating\\" and later asks Amy to be his girlfriend in \\"The Flaming Spittoon Acquisition\\". The same night he draws up \\"The Relationship Agreement\\" to verify the ground rules of him as her boyfriend and vice versa (similar to his \\"Roommate Agreement\\" with Leonard). Amy agrees but later regrets not having had a lawyer read through it.\\r\\nIn the episode \\"The Launch Acceleration\\", Amy tries to use her \\"neurobiology bag of tricks\\" to increase the attraction between herself and Sheldon. In the final fifth-season episode \\"The Countdown Reflection\\", Sheldon takes Amy's hand as Howard is launched into space. In the sixth season first episode \\"The Date Night Variable\\", after a dinner in which Sheldon fails to live up to this expectation, Amy gives Sheldon an ultimatum that their relationship is over unless he tells her something from his heart. Amy accepts Sheldon's romantic speech even after learning that it is a line from the first Spider-Man movie. In \\"The Cooper/Kripke Inversion\\" Sheldon states that he has been working on his discomfort about physical contact and admits that \\"it's a possibility\\" that he could one day have sex with Amy. Amy is revealed to have similar feelings in \\"The Love Spell Potential\\". Sheldon explains that he never thought about intimacy with anyone before Amy.[84]\\r\\n\\"The Locomotive Manipulation\\" is the first episode in which Sheldon initiates a kiss with Amy. Although initially done in a fit of sarcasm, he discovers that he enjoys the feeling. Consequently, Sheldon slowly starts to open up over the rest of the season, and starts a more intimate relationship with Amy. However, in the season finale, Sheldon leaves temporarily to cope with several changes and Amy becomes distraught. However, in \\"The Prom Equivalency\\" he hides in his room to avoid going to a mock prom reenactment with her. In the resulting stand-off, Amy is about to confess that she loves Sheldon, but he surprises her by saying that he loves her too. This prompts Amy to have a panic attack.\\r\\nIn the season eight finale, Sheldon and Amy get into a fight about commitment on their 5-year anniversary. Amy tells Sheldon that she needs to think about the future of their relationship, unaware that Sheldon was about to propose to her. Season nine sees Sheldon harassing Amy about making up her mind until she breaks up with him. Both struggle with singlehood and trying to be friends for the next few weeks until they reunite in episode ten and have sex for the first time on Amy's birthday.\\r\\nIn scenes set at Howard's home, he interacts with his rarely-seen mother (voiced by Carol Ann Susi until her death) by shouting from room to room in the house. She similarly interacts with other characters in this manner.[85] She reflects the Jewish mother stereotype in some ways, such as being overly controlling of Howard's adult life and sometimes trying to make him feel guilty about causing her trouble. She is dependent on Howard, as she requires him to help her with her wig and makeup in the morning. Howard in turn is attached to his mother to the point where she still cuts his meat for him, takes him to the dentist, does his laundry and \\"grounds\\" him when he returns home after briefly moving out.[86] Until Howard's marriage to Bernadette in the fifth-season finale, Howard's former living situation led Leonard's psychiatrist mother to speculate that he may suffer from some type of pathology,[87] and Sheldon to refer to their relationship as Oedipal.[88] In season 8, Howard's mother dies in her sleep while in Florida, which devastates Howard and Stuart, who briefly lived with Mrs. Wolowitz.\\r\\nLike most shows created by Chuck Lorre, The Big Bang Theory ends by showing a vanity card written by Lorre after the credits, followed by the Warner Bros. Television closing logo. These cards are archived on Lorre's website.[89]\\r\\nThrough the use of his vanity cards at the end of episodes, Lorre alleged that the program had been plagiarized by a show produced and aired in Belarus. Officially titled ׿ѿҿ (The Theorists), the show features \\"clones\\" of the main characters, a similar opening sequence, and what appears to be a very close Russian translation of the scripts.[90] Lorre expressed annoyance and described his inquiry with the Warner Bros. legal department about options. The television production company and station's close relationship with the Belarus government was cited as the reason that any attempt to claim copyright infringement would be in vain because the company copying the episodes is operated by the government.[91]\\r\\nHowever, no legal action was required to end production of the other show: as soon as it became known that the show was unlicensed, the actors quit and the producers cancelled it.[92] Dmitriy Tankovich (who plays Leonard's counterpart, \\"Seva\\") said in an interview, \\"I'm upset. At first, the actors were told all legal issues were resolved. We didn't know it wasn't the case, so when the creators of The Big Bang Theory started talking about the show, I was embarrassed. I can't understand why our people first do, and then think. I consider this to be the rock bottom of my career. And I don't want to take part in a stolen show\\".[93]\\r\\nInitial reception for the series was mixed. The review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes reported a 55% approval rating for the first season based on reviews from 22 critics, with an average rating of 5.18/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \\"The Big Bang Theory brings a new class of character to mainstream television, but much of the comedy feels formulaic and stiff.\\"[94] On Metacritic, the season holds a score of 57 out of 100, based on reviews from 23 critics, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\".[95] Later seasons received more acclaim and in 2013, TV Guide ranked the series #52 on its list of the 60 Best Series of All Time.[96]\\r\\nThe Big Bang Theory started off slowly in the ratings, failing to make the top 50 in its first season (ranking 68th), and ranking 40th in its second season. When the third season premiered on September 21, 2009, however, The Big Bang Theory ranked as CBS's highest-rated show of that evening in the adults 18ÿ49 demographic (4.6/10) along with a then-series-high 12.83?million viewers.[97] After the first three seasons aired at different times on Monday nights, CBS moved the show to Thursdays at 8:00 ET for the 2010ÿ2011 schedule, to be in direct competition with NBC's Comedy Block and Fox's American Idol (then the longest reigning leading primetime show on U.S. television from 2004 to 2011).[98] During its fourth season, it became television's highest rated comedy, just barely beating out eight-year champ Two and a Half Men. However, in the age 18ÿ49 demographic (the show's target age range), it was the second highest rated comedy, behind ABC's Modern Family. The fifth season opened with viewing figures of over 14 million.[99]\\r\\nThe sixth season boasts some of the highest-rated episodes for the show so far, with a then-new series high set with \\"The Bakersfield Expedition\\", with 20 million viewers,[100] a first for the series, which along with NCIS, made CBS the first network to have two scripted series reach that large an audience in the same week since 2007. In the sixth season, the show became the highest rated and viewed scripted show in the 18ÿ49 demographic, trailing only the live regular NBC Sunday Night Football coverage,[101][102] and was third in total viewers, trailing NCIS and Sunday Night Football.[103] Season seven of the series opened strong, continuing the success gained in season six, with the second episode of the premiere, \\"The Deception Verification\\", setting the new series high in viewers with 20.44 million.[104][105]\\r\\nShowrunner Steve Molaro, who took over from Bill Prady with the sixth season, credits some of the show's success to the sitcom's exposure in off-network syndication, particularly on TBS, while Michael Schneider of TV Guide attributes it to the timeslot move two seasons earlier. Chuck Lorre and CBS Entertainment president Nina Tassler also credit the success to the influence of Molaro, in particular the deepening exploration of the firmly established regular characters and their interpersonal relationships, such as the on-again, off-again relationship between Leonard and Penny.[106] Throughout much of the 2012ÿ13 season, The Big Bang Theory placed first in all of syndication ratings, receiving formidable competition from only Judge Judy and Wheel of Fortune (first-run syndication programs). By the end of the 2012ÿ13 television season, The Big Bang Theory had dethroned Judge Judy as the ratings leader in all of syndicated programming with 7.1, Judy descending to second place for that season with a 7.0.[107] The Big Bang Theory did not place first in syndication ratings for the 2013ÿ14 television season, beaten out by Judge Judy.[108]\\r\\nThe show made its United Kingdom debut on Channel 4 on February 14, 2008. The show was also shown as a 'first-look' on Channel 4's digital offshoot E4 prior to the main channel's airing. While the show's ratings were not deemed strong enough for the main channel, they were considered the opposite for E4. For each following season, all episodes were shown first-run on E4, with episodes only aired on the main channel in a repeat capacity, usually on a weekend morning. From the third season, the show aired in two parts, being split so that it could air new episodes for longer throughout the year. This was due to rising ratings. The first part began airing on December 17, 2009 at 9:00?p.m. while the second part, containing the remaining eleven episodes, began airing in the same time period from May 6, 2010. The first half of the fourth season began airing on November 4, 2010, at 9:00?p.m., drawing 877,000 viewers, with a further 256,000 watching on the E4+1 hour service. This gave the show an overall total of 1.13 million viewers, making it E4's most watched programme for that week. The increased ratings continued over subsequent weeks.[138]\\r\\nThe fourth season's second half began on June 30, 2011. Season 5 began airing on November 3, 2011 at 8:00?p.m. as part of E4's Comedy Thursdays, acting as a lead-in to the channel's newest comedy, Perfect Couples. Episode 19, the highest-viewed episode of the season, attracted 1.4?million viewers.[139] Season 6 premiered on November 15, 2012, with 1.89 million viewers and a further 469,000 on the time shift channel, bringing the total to 2.31 million, E4's highest viewing ratings of 2012, and the highest the channel had received since June 2011. The sixth season returned in mid 2013 to finish airing the remaining episodes.[140] Season 7 premiered on E4 on October 31, 2013 at 8:30pm and hit multiple ratings records this season. The second half of season seven aired in mid 2014.[141] The eighth season premiered on E4 on October 23, 2014 at 8:30?p.m.[142] During its eighth season, The Big Bang Theory shared its 8:30?p.m. time period with fellow CBS comedy, 2 Broke Girls. Following the airing of the first eight episodes of that show's fourth season, The Big Bang Theory returned to finish airing its eighth season on March 19, 2015.[143]\\r\\nNetflix UK & Ireland announced on February 13, 2016 that seasons 1ÿ8 would be available to stream from February 15, 2016.[144]\\r\\nThe Big Bang Theory started off quietly in Canada, but managed to garner major success in later seasons. The Big Bang Theory is telecast throughout Canada via the CTV Television Network in simultaneous substitution with cross-border CBS affiliates. Now immensely popular in Canada, The Big Bang Theory is also rerun daily on the Canadian cable channel The Comedy Network.\\r\\nThe season 4 premiere garnered an estimated 3.1 million viewers across Canada. This is the largest audience for a sitcom since the series finale of Friends (12.4 million viewers). The Big Bang Theory has pulled ahead and has now become the most-watched entertainment television show in Canada.[145]\\r\\nThe Big Bang Theory premiered in the United States on September 24, 2007 on CBS. The series debuted in Canada on CTV in September 2007.[146] On February 14, 2008, the series debuted in the United Kingdom on channels E4 and Channel 4.[147] In Australia the first seven seasons of the series began airing on the Seven Network and 7mate from October 2015 and also gained the rights to season 8 in 2016, though the Nine Network has rights to air seasons nine & ten.[148][149]\\r\\nIn May 2010, it was reported that the show had been picked up for syndication, mainly among Fox's owned and operated stations and other local stations, with Warner Bros. Television's sister cable network TBS holding the show's cable syndication rights. Broadcast of old shows began airing in September 2011. TBS now airs the series in primetime on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays, with evening broadcasts on Saturdays (TBS's local sister station in Atlanta also holds local weeknight rights to the series).[150] Although details of the syndication deal have not been revealed, it was reported the deal \\"set a record price for a cable off-network sitcom purchase\\".[151] CTV holds national broadcast syndication rights in Canada, while sister cable network The Comedy Network holds cable rights.\\r\\nWarner Bros. Television controls the online rights for the show.[152][153] Full episodes are available at tv.com, while short clips and recently aired full episodes are available on cbs.com.[154] In Canada, recent episode(s) and pictures are available on CTV.ca.[155] After the show has aired in New Zealand the shows are available in full online at TVNZ's on demand web service.\\r\\nThe first and second seasons were only available on DVD upon their time of release in 2008[183] and 2009.[184] Starting with the release of the third season in 2010[185] and continuing every year with every new season, a Blu-ray disc set has also been released in conjunction with the DVD. In 2012, Warner Bros. released the first two seasons on Blu-ray,[186] marking the first time that all episodes were available on the Blu-ray disc format.\\r\\nIn August 2009, the sitcom won the best comedy series TCA award and Jim Parsons (Sheldon) won the award for individual achievement in comedy.[187] In 2010, the show won the People's Choice Award for Favorite Comedy, while Parsons won a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series.[188] On January 16, 2011, Parsons was awarded a Golden Globe for Best Performance by an Actor in a Television Series?ÿ Comedy or Musical, an award that was presented by co-star Kaley Cuoco. On September 18, 2011, Parsons was again awarded an Emmy for Best Actor in a Comedy Series. On January 9, 2013, the show won People's Choice Award for Favorite Comedy for a second time. August 25, 2014, Jim Parsons was awarded an Emmy for Best Actor in a Comedy Series.[189] The Big Bang Theory also won the 2016 People's Choice Awards for under Favorite TV Show and Favorite Network TV Comedy with Jim Parsons winning Favorite Comedic TV Actor.[190] On January 20, 2016, The Big Bang Theory also won the International category at the UK's National Television Awards.[191]\\r\\nOn March 16, 2014, a Lego Ideas project[192] portraying the living room scene in Lego style with the main cast as minifigures reached 10,000 supporters on the platform, which qualified it to be considered as an official set by the Lego Ideas review board. On November 7, 2014, Lego Ideas approved the design and began refining it. The set was released in August 2015, with an exclusive pre-sale taking place at the San Diego Comic-Con International.[citation needed]\\r\\nIn November 2016, it was reported that CBS was in negotiations to create a spin-off of The Big Bang Theory centered on Sheldon as a young boy. The prequel series, described as \\"a Malcolm in the Middle-esque single-camera family comedy\\" would be executive produced by Lorre and Molaro, with Prady expected to be involved in some capacity, and intended to air in the 2017ÿ18 season alongside The Big Bang Theory.[193][194] The initial idea for the series came from Parsons, who passed it along to The Big Bang Theory producers.[195] In early March 2017, Iain Armitage was cast as the younger Sheldon, as well as Zoe Perry as his mother, Mary Cooper. Perry is the real-life daughter of Laurie Metcalf, who portrays Mary Cooper on The Big Bang Theory.[195]\\r\\nOn March 13, 2017, CBS ordered the spin-off Young Sheldon series. Jon Favreau will direct and executive produce the pilot. Created by Lorre and Molaro, the series follows 9-year-old Sheldon Cooper as he attends high school in East Texas. Alongside Armitage as 9-year-old Sheldon Cooper and Perry as Mary Cooper, Lance Barber stars as George Cooper, Sheldon's father; Raegan Revord stars as Missy Cooper, Sheldon's twin sister; and Montana Jordan as George Cooper, Sheldon's older brother. Jim Parsons reprises his role as adult Sheldon Cooper, as narrator for the series. Parsons, Lorre, Molaro and Todd Spiewak will also serve as executive producers on the series, for Chuck Lorre Productions, Inc. in association with Warner Bros. Television.[196] It is scheduled to begin airing on November 2, 2017, after The Big Bang Theory.

The entire reserve encompasses 511?km2 (197?sq?mi) of land and ocean. It is characterized by rugged coasts and lush temperate rainforests. The reserve is open from mid-March until mid-October. It was created in 1970 as the first national park reserve, and remains the oldest, having yet to fulfill its promise of becoming a national park after more than 45 years. The reserve was opened in 1971 in a ceremony attended by Princess Anne of England, who was presented with a driftwood abstract sculpture by Jean Chretien, the minister responsible for Parks Canada. The sculpture was the work of local artist Godfrey Stephens.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThis park reserve is home to mammalian species of raccoon, black-tailed deer, cougar, wolf, black bear, marten, and mink.\\r\\nVisitors are often thrilled by views of various marine animals such as seals, porpoises, sea lions, and many species of whales that are frequent at this shoreline.\\r\\nThe park encompasses a thin strip of land located on the south-west coast Irel Island. To the east of the park lies the Vancouver Island Ranges of the Insular Mountains and to the west is the Pacific Ocean.\\r\\nDuring fall and winter, the area is continually subjected to moist air masses from the Pacific Ocean. The presence of the mountain ranges causes the air masses to rise and deposit large quantities of precipitation, a phenomenon known as orographic precipitation. The area averages over 3,000?mm (118?in) of precipitation per year, a key factor in producing temperate rainforests. During the drier summer months the area is sometimes covered in fog.\\r\\nLong Beach is the most visited and most accessible of the three regions. It is made up of the coastal region from Tofino to Ucluelet.\\r\\nThe primary feature in this area is Long Beach itself. The area also contains the Green Point campground, which has 94 campsites for both tents and small trailers. There are also numerous trails in this region, running through bogs and temperate rainforest areas.\\r\\nOther structures in the area include a ranger station, British Columbia Highway 4, and Wickaninnish Interpretive Centre. This centre is the main educational centre in the area and contains exhibits about local wildlife, plants, native culture, and history. The centre also includes a theatre, restaurant, gift shop, and information desk.\\r\\nLong Beach, 2004\\r\\nPacific Rim National Park Reserve\\r\\nPacific Rim National Park Reserve\\r\\nPacific Rim National Park Reserve\\r\\nThe Broken Group Islands region is made up of over one hundred small islands and islets in Barkley Sound. The largest forested islands are Effingham, Turret, Turtle, Dodd, Jacques, Nettle and Gibraltar Island. The area is accessible only by boat, and is popular with kayakers. There are seven camping areas scattered on the islands. Campers should be aware that there is no fresh water available in the Broken Group Islands, so any water needed will have to be brought in.\\r\\nThe West Coast Trail is a 75?km (47?mi) trail along the west-coast of Vancouver Island from Port Renfrew to Bamfield. The trail was built to aid in the rescue of shipwrecked sailors. Construction on the trail started in 1907 and by 1910 the \\"Lifesaving Trail\\" was complete. The trail was abandoned in the 1950s. By 1970, the trail was transformed into The West Coast Trail, a challenging trail that takes visitors along rocky beaches, through rainforest, and across sometimes rough and muddy terrain. The trail has been improved greatly over the years and can be traversed in 5ÿ7 days.","input":"Where is the pacific rim national park located?"},{"output":"liability insurance","context":"Vehicle insurance, in the United States and elsewhere, is designed to cover risk of financial liability or the loss of a motor vehicle the owner may face if their vehicle is involved in a collision resulting in property or physical damages. Most states require a motor vehicle owner to carry some minimum level of liability insurance. States that do not require the vehicle owner to carry car insurance include Virginia, where an uninsured motor vehicle fee may be paid to the state; New Hampshire, and Mississippi which offers vehicle owners the option to post cash bonds (see below).  The privileges and immunities clause of Article IV of the U.S. Constitution protects the rights of citizens in each respective state when traveling to another.  A motor vehicle owner typically pays insurers a monthly fee, often called an insurance premium.  The insurance premium a motor vehicle owner pays is usually determined by a variety of factors including the type of covered vehicle, the age and gender of any covered drivers, their driving history, and the location where the vehicle is primarily driven and stored. Credit scores are also taken into consideration. Most insurance companies offer premium discounts based on these factors.\\r\\n\\r\\nInsurance companies provide a motor vehicle owner with an insurance card for the particular coverage term which is to be kept in the vehicle in the event of a traffic collision as proof of insurance.  Recently, states have started passing laws that electronic versions of proof of insurance can now be accepted by the authorities.\\r\\n\\r\\nConsumers may be protected by different levels of coverage depending on which insurance policy they purchase. Coverage is sometimes seen as 20/40/15 or 100/300/100.  The first two numbers seen are for medical coverage.  In the 100/300 example, the policy will pay $100,000 per person up to $300,000 total for all people.  The last number covers property damage.  This property damage can cover the other person's vehicle or anything that you hit and damage as a result of the accident. In some states you must purchase Personal Injury Protection which covers medical bills, time lost at work, and many other things.  You can also purchase insurance if the other driver does not have insurance or is under insured.  Most if not all states require drivers to carry  mandatory liability insurance coverage to ensure that their drivers can cover the cost of damage to other people or property in the event of an accident. Some states, such as Wisconsin, have more flexible \\"proof of financial responsibility\\" requirements.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the United States in 2017, the largest private passenger vehicle insurance providers in terms of market share were State Farm (18.1%), GEICO (12.8%), Progressive Corporation (9.8%), Allstate (9.3%), and USAA (5.7%).[2] Insurance is secured either by working with an independent insurance agent or with an insurance broker who is authorized to sell insurance policies. Some can represent from several agencies, or a growing number of online brokers who provide policy purchases through online sites.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nLiability coverage, sometimes known as Casualty insurance, is offered for bodily injury (BI) or property damage (PD) for which the insured driver is deemed responsible. The amount of coverage provided (a fixed dollar amount) will vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Whatever the minimum, the insured can usually increase the coverage (prior to a loss) for an additional charge.\\r\\n\\r\\nAn example of property damage is where an insured driver (or 1st party) drives into a telephone pole and damages the pole; liability coverage pays for the damage to the pole. In this example, the drivers insured may also become liable for other expenses related to damaging the telephone pole, such as loss of service claims (by the telephone company), depending on the jurisdiction. An example of bodily injury is where an insured driver causes bodily harm to a third party and the insured driver is deemed responsible for the injuries. However, in some jurisdictions, the third party would first exhaust coverage for accident benefits through their own insurer (assuming they have one) and/or would have to meet a legal definition of severe impairment to have the right to claim (or sue) under the insured driver's (or first party's) policy. If the third party sues the insured driver, liability coverage also covers court costs and damages that the insured driver may be deemed responsible for.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn some states, such as New Jersey, it is illegal to operate (or knowingly allow another to operate) a motor vehicle that does not have liability insurance coverage. If an accident occurs in a state that requires liability coverage, both parties are usually required to bring and/or submit copies of insurance cards to court as proof of liability coverage.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn some jurisdictions: Liability coverage is available either as a combined single limit policy, or as a split limit policy:\\r\\n\\r\\nA combined single limit combines property damage liability coverage and bodily injury coverage under one single combined limit. For example, an insured driver with a combined single liability limit strikes another vehicle and injures the driver and the passenger. Payments for the damages to the other driver's car, as well as payments for injury claims for the driver and passenger, would be paid out under this same coverage.\\r\\n\\r\\nA split limit liability coverage policy splits the coverages into property damage coverage and bodily injury coverage. In the example given above, payments for the other driver's vehicle would be paid out under property damage coverage, and payments for the injuries would be paid out under bodily injury coverage.\\r\\n\\r\\nBodily injury liability coverage is also usually split into a maximum payment per person and a maximum payment per accident.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe limits are often expressed separated by slashes in the following form:  \\"bodily injury per person\\"/\\"bodily injury per accident\\"/\\"property damage\\". For example, California requires this minimum coverage:[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nThis would be expressed as \\"$15,000/$30,000/$5,000\\".\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother example, in the state of Oklahoma, drivers must carry at least state minimum liability limits of $25,000/$50,000/$25,000.[5] \\r\\nIf an insured driver hits a car full of people and is found by the insurance company to be liable, the insurance company will pay $25,000 of one person's medical bills but will not exceed $50,000 for other people injured in the accident. The insurance company will not pay more than $25,000 for property damage in repairs to the vehicle that the insured one hit.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the state of Indiana, the minimum liability limits are $25,000/$50,000/$10,000,[6] so there is a greater property damage exposure for only carrying the minimum limits.\\r\\n\\r\\nGenerally, liability coverage purchased through a private insurer extends to rental cars. Comprehensive policies (\\"full coverage\\") usually also apply to the rental vehicle, although this should be verified beforehand. Full coverage premiums are based on, among other factors, the value of the insured's vehicle. This coverage, however, cannot apply to rental cars because the insurance company does not want to assume responsibility for a claim greater than the value of the insured's vehicle, assuming that a rental car may be worth more than the insured's vehicle.\\r\\n\\r\\nMost rental car companies offer insurance to cover damage to the rental vehicle. These policies may be unnecessary for many customers as credit card companies, such as Visa and MasterCard, now provide supplemental collision damage coverage to rental cars if the rental transaction is processed using one of their cards. These benefits are restrictive in terms of the types of vehicles covered.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nMaine requires car insurance to rent a car.\\r\\n\\r\\nFull coverage is the term commonly used to refer to the combination of comprehensive and collision coverages (liability is generally also implied.) The term full coverage is actually a misnomer because, even within traditional \\"full coverage\\" insurance, there are many different types of coverage, and many optional amounts of each. \\"Full coverage\\" is a layman's misnomer that often results in drivers and vehicle owners being woefully underinsured.  Most responsible insurance agents or brokers do not use this term when working with their clients.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne common misconception[citation needed] in the United States is that vehicles that are financed on credit through a bank or credit union are required to have \\"full\\" coverage in order for the financial institution to cover their losses in case of an accident. Insurance requirements vary between financial institutions and each state. Minimum deductibles and liability limits (required by some leasing companies) would be outlined in the loan contract. Failure to carry the required coverages may lead to the lienholder purchasing insurance and adding the cost to the monthly payments or repossession of the vehicle. Vehicles purchased with cash or paid off by the owner are generally required to only carry liability. In some cases, vehicles financed through a \\"buy-here-pay-here\\" car dealershipin which the consumer (generally those with poor credit) finances a car and pays the dealer directly without a bankmay require comprehensive and collision depending on the amount owed for the vehicle.\\r\\n\\r\\nCollision coverage provides coverage for vehicles involved in collisions. Collision coverage is subject to a deductible. This coverage is designed to provide payments to repair the damaged vehicle, or payment of the cash value of the vehicle if it is not repairable or totaled. Collision coverage is optional, however if you plan on financing a car or taking a car loan, the lender will usually insist you carry collision for the finance term or until the car is paid off. Collision Damage Waiver (CDW) or Loss Damage Waiver (LDW) is the term used by rental car companies for collision coverage.\\r\\n\\r\\nComprehensive, also known as other than collision coverage, provides coverage, subject to a deductible, for cars damaged by incidents that are not considered collisions. For example, fire, theft (or attempted theft), vandalism, weather, or impacts with animals are types of comprehensive losses.\\r\\n\\r\\nAdditionally, a few insurance companies list \\"Acts of God\\" as an aspect of comprehensive coverage, although this is an old term that is not ordinarily used today. By definition, it includes any events or occurrences that are beyond human control. For example, a tornado, flood, hurricane, or hail storm would fall under this category.\\r\\n\\r\\nUninsured/Underinsured coverage, also known as UM/UIM, provides coverage if an at-fault party either does not have insurance, or does not have enough insurance. In effect, the insurance company pays the insured medical bills, then would subrogate from the at fault party. This coverage is often overlooked and very important. In Colorado, for example, it was estimated in 2009 that 15% of drivers were uninsured.[8] \\r\\nUsually the limits match the liability limits.[citation needed] Some insurance companies do offer UM/UIM in an umbrella policy.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome states maintain unsatisfied judgment funds to provide compensation to those who cannot collect damages from uninsured driver.[9] Typically, the payout is not more than the minimum liability limits and the negligent driver remains responsible for reimbursing the state's fund.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the United States, the definition of an uninsured/underinsured motorist, and corresponding coverages, are set by state laws. In some states it is mandatory. In the case of underinsured coverage, two different triggers apply: a damages trigger which is based on whether the limits are insufficient to cover the injured party's damages, and a limits trigger which applies when the limits are less than the injured party's limits.[10] According to a 2009 survey by trade association Property Casualty Insurers Association of America, 29 states have a limits trigger while 20 states have a damages trigger.[11] Another variation is whether a particular state requires stacking of policy limits of different vehicles or policies.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nLoss of use coverage, also known as rental coverage, provides reimbursement for rental expenses associated with having an insured vehicle repaired due to a covered loss.\\r\\n\\r\\nLoan/lease payoff coverage, also known as GAP coverage or GAP insurance,[12][13]\\r\\nwas established in the early 1980s to provide protection to consumers based upon buying and market trends.\\r\\n\\r\\nDue to the sharp decline in value immediately following purchase, there is generally a period in which the amount owed on the car loan exceeds the value of the vehicle, which is called \\"upside-down\\" or negative equity. Thus, if the vehicle is damaged beyond economical repair at this point, the owner will still owe potentially thousands of dollars on the loan. The escalating price of cars, longer-term auto loans, and the increasing popularity of leasing gave birth to GAP protection. GAP waivers provide protection for consumers when a \\"gap\\" exists between the actual value of their vehicle and the amount of money owed to the bank or leasing company. In many instances, this insurance will also pay the deductible on the primary insurance policy. These policies are often offered at auto dealerships as a comparatively low cost add-on to the car loan that provides coverage for the duration of the loan. GAP Insurance does not always pay off the full loan value however.  These cases include but are not limited to:\\r\\n\\r\\nTherefore, it is important for a policy holder to understand that they may still owe on the loan even though the GAP policy was purchased. Failure to understand this can result in the lender continuing their legal remedies to collect the balance and the potential of damaged credit.\\r\\n\\r\\nConsumers should be aware that a few states, including New York, require lenders of leased cars to include GAP insurance within the cost of the lease itself. This means that the monthly price quoted by the dealer must include GAP insurance, whether it is delineated or not. Nevertheless, unscrupulous dealers sometimes prey on unsuspecting individuals by offering them GAP insurance at an additional price, on top of the monthly payment, without mentioning the State's requirements.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn addition, some vendors and insurance companies offer what is called \\"Total Loss Coverage.\\" This is similar to ordinary GAP insurance but differs in that instead of paying off the negative equity on a vehicle that is a total loss, the policy provides a certain amount, usually up to $5000, toward the purchase or lease of a new vehicle. Thus, to some extent the distinction makes no difference, i.e., in either case the owner receives a certain sum of money. However, in choosing which type of policy to purchase, the owner should consider whether, in case of a total loss, it is more advantageous for him or her to have the policy pay off the negative equity or provide a down payment on a new vehicle.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor example, assuming a total loss of a vehicle valued at $15,000, but on which the owner owes $20,000, is the \\"gap\\" of $5000. If the owner has traditional GAP coverage, the \\"gap\\" will be wiped out and he or she may purchase or lease another vehicle or choose not to. If the owner has \\"Total Loss Coverage,\\" he or she will have to personally cover the \\"gap\\" of $5000, and then receive $5000 toward the purchase or lease of a new vehicle, thereby either reducing monthly payments, in the case of financing or leasing, or the total purchase price in the case of outright purchasing. So the decision on which type of policy to purchase will, in most instances, be informed by whether the owner can pay off the negative equity in case of a total loss and/or whether he or she will definitively purchase a replacement vehicle.\\r\\n\\r\\nVehicle towing coverage is also known as roadside assistance coverage. Traditionally, automobile insurance companies have agreed to only pay for the cost of a tow that is related to an accident that is covered under the automobile policy of insurance. This had left a gap in coverage for tows that are related to mechanical breakdowns, flat tires and gas outages. To fill that void, insurance companies started to offer the car towing coverage, which pays for non-accident related tows.\\r\\n\\r\\nPersonal items in a vehicle that are damaged due to an accident typically are not covered under the auto insurance policy. Any type of property that is not attached to the vehicle should be claimed under a home insurance or renters' insurance policy. However, some insurance companies will cover unattached GPS devices intended for automobile use.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nInsurers use actuarial science to determine the rates, which involves statistical analysis of the various characteristics of drivers.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the United States, automotive insurance covering liability for injuries and property damage is compulsory in most states, but different states enforce the insurance requirement differently. In Virginia, where insurance is not compulsory, residents must pay the state a $500 annual fee per vehicle if they choose not to buy liability insurance.[14]  Penalties for not purchasing insurance vary by state, but often include a substantial fine, license and/or registration suspension or revocation, and possible jail time. Usually, the minimum required by law is third party insurance to protect third parties against the financial consequences of loss, damage or injury caused by a vehicle.\\r\\n\\r\\nCalifornia and New Jersey have enacted \\"Personal Responsibility Acts\\" which put further pressure on all drivers to carry liability insurance by preventing uninsured drivers from recovering non economic damages (e.g. compensation for \\"pain and suffering\\") if they are injured in any way while operating a motor vehicle.\\r\\n\\r\\nNorth Carolina is the only state to require that a driver hold liability insurance before a license can be issued.  North Carolina does allow for a \\"fleet license\\" to be issued if the license holder has no insurance, however the fleet license only allows for the driver to operate vehicles owned and insured by their employer.  The license holder must produce a state form (DL-123) to prove they have insurance, requiring the signature of an insurance agent, in addition to a ten dollar fee, in order to convert the fleet license to a full license.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome states require that proof of insurance be carried in the car at all times, while others do not. For example, North Carolina does not specify that proof of insurance must be carried in the vehicle; it does, however, require that a driver have that information to trade with another driver in the event of an accident.  Some states allow for an electronic insurance card to be produced on a smartphone\\r\\n\\r\\nArizona Department of Transportation Research Project Manager John Semmens has recommended that car insurers issue license plates and be held responsible for the full cost of injuries and property damage caused by their licensees under the Disneyland model. Plates would expire at the end of the insurance coverage period, and licensees would need to return their plates to their insurance office to receive a refund on their premiums. Vehicles driving without insurance would thus be easy to spot because they would not have license plates, or the plates would be past the marked expiration date.[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nWith the invention of the automobile in the late 19th century came the inevitable side effect of automobile collisions.[16] As automotive collisions increased in frequency, it became clear that, unlike other torts, which relied on personal responsibility, there was a possibility that automobiles would need to be governed by laws because \\"[t]here was no way of assuring that even though fault was assessed the victim of an automobile collision would be able to collect from the tortfeasor.\\"[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nThis led Massachusetts and Connecticut to create the first financial responsibility and compulsory insurance laws. Connecticut's 1925 financial responsibility law required any vehicle owner involved in a collision with damages over $100 to prove \\"financial responsibility to satisfy any claim for damages, by reason of personal injury, to, or death of, any person, of at least $10,000.\\"[17] This early financial responsibility requirement only required vehicle owners to prove financial responsibility after their first collision.[16] Massachusetts also introduced a law to address the problem of collisions, but theirs was a compulsory insurance, not financial responsibility law. It required automotive liability insurance as a prerequisite to vehicle registration.[18]\\r\\n\\r\\nUntil 1956, when the New York legislature passed their compulsory insurance law, Massachusetts was the only state in the U.S. that required drivers to get insurance before registration. North Carolina followed suit in 1957 and then in the 1960s and 1970s numerous other states passed similar compulsory insurance laws. Since the genesis of automotive insurance schemes in 1925 nearly every state has adopted a compulsory insurance scheme.[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nAdvocates of compulsory auto insurance rely on the assumption that, at least some of the time, the person at fault in a car accident won't be able to pay for the damage to the other person's car.  Because insurance has been mandatory in most states for so long, the data to prove this theory is somewhat sparse. \\r\\nNevertheless, proponents of compulsory auto insurance argue that:\\r\\n\\r\\nOpponents of compulsory insurance believe that it is not the best way to allocate risk among drivers. Arizona, Mississippi, New Hampshire, and Virginia do not require motor vehicle insurance. In Arizona, drivers can opt to deposit $40,000 to the State Treasurer in the form of a security deposit, cash, or bond. In Mississippi, drivers can opt to utilize a cash, security deposit, or bond in the amount of the state minimums. In  New Hampshire, vehicle owners must satisfy a personal responsibility requirement; instead of paying monthly premiums, and prove that they are capable of paying in case of an accident. In Virginia, vehicle owners may pay an uninsured motorist fee of 500 dollars a year to the state DMV; however this fee is not insurance. Many insurance companies oppose compulsory auto insurance, for example: \\r\\nthe NAII (National Association of Independent Insurers).  State Farm opposes compulsory auto insurance because it forces poor to choose between groceries and insurance. A study done by Dr. Robert Maril showed that, in a poor area of Arizona, 44% said they had trouble buying food or paying rent due to auto insurance. A survey done by the Montana DPHHS showed 12 of the 96 surveyed said auto insurance was a reason for needing food stamps.[19][20]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe tables below contain minimum liability requirements for vehicle owners within the United States. They are divided into two categories: compulsory and non compulsory. See the table on the right for an explanation of the values.\\r\\n\\r\\nInsurers may be unwilling to insure drivers (especially at an affordable price) with particularly bad histories, which had led states to create \\"residual market\\" programs through which insurers are required to make insurance available. There are various ways that this is accomplished, with the most common being an assigned risk plan[34] and other programs including joint underwriting associations, reinsurance facilities, and in the case of Maryland a state-owned fund subsidized by insurers.","input":"What car insurance do you need in america?"},{"output":"The Tehri Dam","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Tehri Dam is the highest dam in India and one of the highest in the world. It is a multi-purpose rock and earth-fill embankment dam on the Bhagirathi River near Tehri in Uttarakhand, India. It is the primary dam of the THDC India Ltd. and the Tehri hydroelectric complex. Phase 1 was completed in 2006. The Tehri Dam withholds a reservoir for irrigation, municipal water supply and the generation of 1,000 megawatts (1,300,000?hp) of hydroelectricity. The dam's 1,000?MW variable-speed pumped-storage scheme is currently under construction with expected commissioning in May 2018.[1][2]\\r\\n\\r\\nA preliminary investigation for the Tehri Dam Project was completed in 1961 and its design was completed in 1972 with a 600?MW capacity power plant based on the study. Construction began in 1978 after feasibility studies but was delayed due to financial, environmental and social impacts.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1986, technical and financial assistance was provided by the USSR, but this was interrupted years later with political instability. India was forced to take control of the project and at the first it was placed under the direction of the Irrigation Department of Uttar Pradesh. However, in 1988 the Tehri Hydro Development Corporation was formed to manage the dam and 75% of the funding would be provided by the federal government, 25% by the state. Uttar Pradesh would finance the entire irrigation portion of the project.\\r\\n\\r\\nTehri Dam is a 260.5?m (855?ft) high rock and earth-fill embankment dam. Its length is 575?m (1,886?ft), crest width 20?m (66?ft), and base width 1,128?m (3,701?ft). The dam creates a reservoir of 4.0 cubic kilometres (3,200,000?acre?ft) with a surface area of 52?km2 (20?sq?mi). The installed hydrocapacity is 1,000 MW along with an additional 1,000 MW of pumped storage hydroelectricity. The lower reservoir for the pumped-storage plant is created by the Koteshwar Dam downstream.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Tehri Dam and the Tehri Pumped Storage Hydroelectric Power Plant are part of the Tehri Hydropower Complex which also includes the 400?MW Koteshwar Dam.[3] Power is distributed to Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Punjab, Delhi, Haryana, Jammu & Kashmir, Chandigarh, Rajasthan and Himachal Pradesh. The complex will afford irrigation to an area of 270,000 hectares (670,000 acres), irrigation stabilization to an area of 600,000 hectares (1,500,000 acres), and a supply of 270?million imperial gallons (1.2G10^6?m3) of drinking water per day to the industrialized areas of Delhi, Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe total expenditure for this project was USD 1 billion. The Indian National Trust for Art and Cultural Heritage (INTACH), a cost benefit analysis was commissioned and was concluded that the construction cost of the dam twice the projected benefits.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe scheduling and dispatch of the Tehri Hydro Power plant is done by Northern Regional Load Dispatch Center which is the apex body to ensure the integrated operation of the power system grid in the Northern region and comes under Power System Operation Corporation Limited (POSOCO). At present, THDC India Ltd. is generating around 3,000 GWh annually from this dam.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Tehri Dam has been the object of protests by environmental organizations and local people of the region. V.D. Saklani, lawyer and founder of the Anti-Tehri Dam Struggle Committee, was quick to point out the consequences associated to the large project.[5] Environmental activist Sunderlal Bahuguna led the Anti-Tehri Dam movement from 1980s till 2004.[6][7] The protest was against the displacement of town inhabitants and environmental consequence of the weak ecosystem.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn addition to the human rights concerns, the project has spurred concerns about the environmental consequences of locating such a large dam in the fragile ecosystem of the Himalayan foothills. There are further concerns regarding the dam's geological stability. The Tehri dam is in the Central Himalayan Seismic Gap, a major geologic fault zone. This region was the site of a 6.8 magnitude earthquake in October 1991, with an epicenter 53?km (33?mi) from the dam. Dam proponents claim that the complex is designed to withstand an earthquake of 8.4 magnitude, but some seismologists say that earthquakes with a magnitude of 8.5 or more could occur in this region. Were such a catastrophe to occur, the potentially resulting dam-break would submerge numerous towns downstream, whose populations total near half a million.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe relocation of more than 100,000 people from the area has led to protracted legal battles over resettlement rights and, ultimately, resulted in the project's delayed completion.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nSince 2005, filling of the reservoir has led to the reduced flow of Bhagirathi water from the normal 1,000?cu?ft/s (28?m3/s) to a mere 200?cu?ft/s (5.7?m3/s). This reduction has been central to local protest against the dam, since the Bhagirathi is considered part of the sacred Ganges whose waters are crucial to Hindu beliefs. At some points during the year, the tampering with Bhagirathi waters means this tributary stops flowing. This has created resentments among many Hindus, who claim that the sanctity of the Ganges has been compromised for the generation of electricity. The officials say that when the reservoir is filled to its maximum capacity the flow of the river will again become normal. In spite of concerns and protestation, operation of the Tehri Dam continues.","input":"Which dam is the highest dam in india?"},{"output":"light-middleweight weight class","context":"Floyd Mayweather Jr. vs. Conor McGregor, also known as \\"The Money Fight\\"[2] and \\"The Biggest Fight in Combat Sports History\\",[3] was a professional boxing match between undefeated eleven-time five-division boxing world champion Floyd Mayweather Jr. and two-division mixed martial arts (MMA) world champion and at-the-time current UFC Lightweight Champion Conor McGregor. The match took place at the T-Mobile Arena in Paradise, Nevada, on August 26, 2017 at the light-middleweight weight class (154 lbs; 69.9 kgs). It was scheduled for twelve rounds.\\r\\nMayweather extended his professional boxing undefeated streak to 50 victories and 0 defeats (50ÿ0), surpassing the 49ÿ0 record of Hall of Famer Rocky Marciano by defeating McGregor by technical knockout (TKO) in the 10th round.[4] Mayweather's guaranteed disclosed paycheck was $100,000,000 and McGregor's guaranteed disclosed paycheck was $30,000,000.[5][6] However, the purse for the two fighters was expected to be substantially higher for each, with Mayweather reportedly earning over $300,000,000 from the fight and McGregor earning $100,000,000.[7][8][9]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring his successful UFC mixed martial arts career McGregor maintained an interest in boxing and entertained the idea of a \\"money fight\\" with Mayweather.[10] Mayweather reportedly talked to Freddie Roach to train McGregor for the fight in case it would happen.[11] UFC president Dana White dismissed the rumors of a fight with Mayweather on The Dan Patrick Show, stating that Mayweather would have to contact him since McGregor was under contract with the UFC.[12] White even went as far as stating, \\"Heres what I think the chances are [of the fight happening]: About the same of me being the backup quarterback for Brady on Sunday,\\" referring to Super Bowl LI.[13] In January 2017, it was reported that the two parties had entered an \\"exploratory phase\\" in negotiating a potential match between Mayweather and McGregor. On The Herd with Colin Cowherd, White openly offered to pay Mayweather $25 million to hold the proposed bout during a UFC event. He also predicted that pay-per-view viewership of the hypothetical bout could possibly rival Mayweather vs. Pacquiao.[14]\\r\\nOn March 7, 2017, Mayweather called upon McGregor to \\"sign the paper\\" and \\"make it happen\\", arguing that \\"if Conor McGregor really wants this fight to happen, stop blowing smoke up everybody's ass.\\"[15] On March 10, 2017, Mayweather stated that only a fight with McGregor would make him come out of retirement.[16] On March 16, 2017, Dana White backpedaled on his stance against a MayweatherÿMcGregor bout and said that he would not deprive McGregor of a massive payday.[17][18] On May 18, 2017, McGregor reportedly agreed to all of Mayweather's updated terms and signed the contract.[19] The official confirmation of the fight was made on June 14.[20] An international press tour was held from July 11ÿ14.[21]\\r\\nIn July 2017, IBF junior lightweight champion Gervonta Davis was reported to be going to participate in a co-main event.[22] On July 19, additional undercard details were released.[23] By that time, three names had been confirmed on the undercard, including British amateur boxer Savannah Marshall, who signed up earlier in the year with Mayweather Promotions, and Badou Jack, who stepped up to fight at light heavyweight.[24] On July 26, 2017, it was announced that former welterweight titleholder Shawn Porter would be headlining the preliminary card, facing Thomas Dulorme.[25][26] On August 17, Porter pulled out of the fight due to personal reasons, including a death in the family. He was replaced by Cuban boxer Yordenis Ugs.[27] On July 29, it was reported that Gervonta Davis would defend his IBF junior lightweight title against former WBO champion Roman 'Rocky' Martinez.[28] Martnez was dropped due to not having enough time to make the 130 pound [59?kg] limit.[29] Instead Davis has been rescheduled to fight unbeaten prospect Francisco Fonseca.[30] On August 9, 2017, it was announced that Nathan Cleverly would defend his WBA light heavyweight title against Money Team fighter Badou Jack.[31][32]\\r\\nA mural was painted in McGregor's Dublin training facility, Straight Blast Gym, depicting McGregor hitting Mayweather with a left-handed punch.[33]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the United States, the fight was televised via Showtime pay-per-view, available through both traditional television providers and various digital services, including the Showtime PPV website and apps, and UFC.tv. Fathom Events organized public screenings at venues such as cinemas.[34][35][36] On July 10, 2017, it was announced that pricing for the PPV in the U.S. would mirror that of Mayweather vs. Pacquiao, being set at US$89.95 (with an additional $10 charge for high definition).[37]\\r\\nThe fight was called by Showtime's lead commentary team of Mauro Ranallo (play-by-play), Al Bernstein (color), and Paulie Malignaggi (color), along with ringside reporter Jim Gray.[38] Showtime produced a four-part documentary series, All Access: Mayweather vs. McGregor, focusing on the preparations for the fight.[39] Fox Sports (the television rightsholder of the UFC) provided shoulder programming for the fight, including coverage of the press tour on UFC Tonight, as well as a pre-show and preliminary card on Fox and Fox Deportes.[37]\\r\\nDue to the high demand, a large number of television providers, as well as UFC.tv, experienced technical issues with their carriage of the PPV. The main event was delayed by an hour from its projected start time in order to address these problems.[40] Following the fight, a class-action lawsuit was proposed in Oregon against Showtime Networks for unlawful trading practices and unjust enrichment, alleging that the network knowingly advertised a level of quality it was unable to deliver with the amount of bandwidth it allocated, as the plaintiff and others had experienced technical issues with the PPV stream, including errors, buffering and low video quality.[41] Showtime and the UFC stated that they were investigating their respective customer complaints, and would issue refunds on a case-by-case basis.[42]\\r\\nSky Sports Box Office held broadcasting rights to the fight in McGregor's native Ireland, and the United Kingdom. Although it was initially believed that the price would match that of the U.S. PPV, the price was set at ?24.95 (S19.95).[43] The fight was called for Sky Sports by Johnny Nelson and Carl Froch, joined by British MMA fighter and UFC analyst Dan Hardy.[44] British radio rights were held by the BBC, with Mike Costello and Steve Bunce on commentary for BBC Radio 5 Live.[45]\\r\\nIn Hispanic America, the fight aired on Fox Premium Action.[46] In Brazil, the event aired on Globosat-owned Combate.[47]\\r\\nAs with Mayweather vs. Pacquiao, it was expected that many viewers would seek unauthorized streams of the fight due to the high cost of the PPV. Showtime successfully received a preliminary injunction against the registrant of a group of 44 websites who planned to illegally stream the fight in violation of its copyrights, and all parties in active concert or participation with them.[48][49]\\r\\nIt was estimated that nearly 2.93 million viewers illegally streamed the fight, on video streaming websites and social media channels such as Facebook, YouTube and Periscope.[50][51]\\r\\nMayweather was expected to earn at least $100 million, increasing up to four times that amount upon the event achieving all its metrics.[52] McGregor was expected to earn $75 million, but both men signed NDAs barring them from publicly communicating the financial details.[53] According to the Nevada State Athletic Commission, Mayweather would earn a guaranteed purse of $100 million and McGregor was guaranteed $30 million.[54]\\r\\nIn a Q&A session in Glasgow in September 2017, McGregor revealed, had he been disqualified, he would have been fined $10 million. The referee also warned him, had he lifted a leg, he would have not been warned and got a straight point deduction.[55]\\r\\nOn August 23, 2017, the WBC unveiled a special belt that would go to the winner of the fight, the \\"Money Belt\\"; it is made from Italian-made alligator leather and encrusted with 3.3 pounds (1.5 kg) of 24-karat gold, 3,360 diamonds, 600 sapphires, and 300 emeralds.[56]\\r\\nOn August 16, 2017, the officials were named for the fight:[57]\\r\\nBoth athletes initially agreed to box in 10-ounce (285 g) gloves per Nevada State Athletic Commission (NSAC) rules which require 10-ounce (285 g) gloves for boxing matches contracted over 147 pounds [67?kg] (the fight is contracted at 154 pounds [70?kg]).[58] McGregor wanted 8-ounce (225 g) gloves and Mayweather agreed, and both athletes submitted formal requests to box in 8-ounce (225 g) gloves, which was granted by the NSAC.[58]\\r\\nExperts expected that more money would be bet on the fight than any other boxing match in history; estimates ranged up to $85 million in bets.[59][60] There were six separate $1 million bets on Mayweather in Las Vegas bookmakers, but a large majority of bets overall were on the underdog, McGregor.[60]\\r\\nNevada State Athletic Commission announced the live gate for the event was $55,414,865.79 from 13,094 tickets sold and 137 complimentary tickets given out. This was far less than the Mayweather vs. Pacquiao fight which grossed $72 million from a paid attendance of 16,219 in 2015, despite claims from Ellerbe and Mayweather that it did more than $80 million.[61]\\r\\nSky Sports announced the fight garnered over a million PPV buys in the UK and grossed in excess of S20 million, surpassing the record set in April 2017 when Anthony Joshua defeated Wladimir Klitschko in front of 90,000 at the Wembley Stadium. This also meant the fight generated more buys in the UK than Mayweather-Pacquiao which took place in 2015.[62]\\r\\nShowtime Sports Stephen Espinoza told the LA Times the fight was expected to generate around 4.4 million domestic buys, which would fall just short of the 4.6 million record which was set by Mayweather-Pacquiao.[63]\\r\\nAt the weigh-in, Mayweather tipped the scales at 149.5 lbs, with McGregor at 153 lbs.[64] Mayweather and McGregor entered the ring following the Irish and American national anthems; the Irish singer, songwriter and multi-instrumentalist Imelda May performed on behalf of Conor McGregor,[65] followed by the American singer-songwriter and actress Demi Lovato, who was personally chosen by Mayweather.[66]\\r\\nMayweather was widely expected to dominate the fight early, but McGregor started strong and was ahead on the score cards for the first few rounds, due in part to Mayweather using the rope-a-dope technique liberally in the early stages.[67] As the fight progressed, McGregor weakened. In rounds 9 and 10, Mayweather landed a series of punches to McGregor's face, and referee Robert Byrd eventually called the fight in favor of Mayweather after McGregor failed to defend himself.[68]\\r\\nAfter the match Mayweather stated that he had expected McGregor to be a fast starter, and had allowed him to deliver his heavy blows early.[69][70] McGregor on the other hand was disappointed by what he saw as an early stoppage, but respected the referee's decision. Former boxers such as George Foreman and Evander Holyfield expressed their impression regarding McGregor's boxing skills and the competitiveness of the fight,[71][72] with Foreman claiming that experts who criticized the fight \\"should apologize. It was competitive\\".[73] Mike Tyson gave McGregor an \\"A grade\\" for his performance, stating he was impressed.[74] The fight was lauded for its entertaining and exciting nature, especially when compared to Mayweather's most recent bouts.[75]\\r\\nMayweather announced in his post-fight interview that he had fought his final boxing match, and would retire from the sport. McGregor said in his post-fight interview that he would be willing to box again, and that he would return to mixed martial arts and the UFC.[citation needed]\\r\\nDavis failed to make weight during the August 25 weigh in, forcing the IBF to strip him of the title. The title was declared vacant, but would be still up for grabs if Fonseca secures victory.[76] Davis would go on to win by KO in the eighth round. Cleverly lost his WBA light heavyweight title to Jack in a one-sided bout which ended when the referee stopped the fight in the fifth.[77] Cleverly retired after the fight.[78]","input":"What weight class is mayweather and mcgregor fighting at?"},{"output":"In 2017","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nChristopher Emmanuel Paul (born May 6, 1985) is an American professional basketball player for the Houston Rockets of the National Basketball Association (NBA).

He attended Wake Forest University for two years of college basketball, where he helped the Demon Deacons achieve their first-ever number one ranking. He was selected fourth overall in the 2005 NBA draft by the New Orleans Hornets, where he developed into one of the league's premier players, finishing second in NBA Most Valuable Player Award voting in 2008. During the 2011 offseason, Paul was traded to the Los Angeles Lakers, only for the transaction to be controversially voided by the NBA. Later that summer, he was dealt to the Los Angeles Clippers instead. Behind Paul's playmaking, the Clippers developed a reputation for their fast-paced offense and spectacular alley-oop dunks, earning them the nickname \\"Lob City\\". In 2017, he was traded to the Rockets, and helped the team win a franchise-record 67 games in his debut season.\\r\\n\\r\\nOff the court, Paul has served as the National Basketball Players Association president since August 2013. One of the highest-paid athletes in the world, he holds endorsement deals with companies such as Nike and State Farm.\\r\\n\\r\\nPaul was born on May 6, 1985, in Winston-Salem, North Carolina to Charles Edward Paul and Robin Jones.[3] He has an older brother named Charles \\"C.J.\\" Paul.[3] A former athlete himself, Charles Sr. taught his sons basketball and football and coached them in various youth leagues throughout their childhoods.[4] Growing up, the Paul brothers spent their summers working at a service station owned by their grandfather Nathanial Jones,[5] to whom Paul attributes many life lessons, and describes as his \\"best friend\\".[6] One of Paul's uncles is a police officer.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nPaul attended West Forsyth High School in Clemmons, North Carolina.[8] During his freshman and sophomore seasons, he played on the junior varsity team.[9] For his junior year, he averaged 25 points, 5.3 assists, and 4.4 steals per game, helping West Forsyth reach the state semifinals.[10] Over the ensuing summer, he led the Winston-Salem-based Kappa Magic to the National U-17 AAU title, earning tournament MVP honors in the process.[11] During his senior season, Paul received national attention for scoring 61 points in a game; his 61-year-old grandfather was slain earlier in the year and Paul honored him by scoring one point for each year of his life.[8] Paul finished the season with averages of 30.8 points, 5.9 rebounds, 9.5 assists, and 6 steals per game, leading West Forsyth to a 27ÿ3 record and the Class 4A Eastern Regional finals.[10] He was then named a McDonald's All-American, first-team Parade All-American, and North Carolina's Mr. Basketball by The Charlotte Observer.[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs a freshman at Wake Forest University, Paul averaged 14.8 points, 5.9 assists, and 2.7 steals per game,[12] setting school freshman records for three-point percentage, free throws, free throw percentage, assists, and steals in the process.[10] Behind his play, the Demon Deacons qualified for the NCAA Tournament, losing in the Sweet Sixteen to St. Joseph's.[13] At the conclusion of the season, Paul was named ACC Rookie of the Year and Third Team All-ACC.[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nFor two weeks early in Paul's sophomore season, Wake Forest was ranked number one in the nation for the first time in school history.[14] In the final game of the year, Paul punched NC State guard Julius Hodge in the groin and received a one-game suspension for the ACC Tournament,[15] an incident that marred Paul's image for a short time.[14] The Demon Deacons again qualified for the NCAA Tournament but suffered a second round upset at the hands of West Virginia.[16] With final averages of 15.3 points, 4.5 rebounds, 6.6 assists, and 2.4 steals per game, Paul was eventually named First Team Consensus All-America,[12] and with a 3.21 grade point average (GPA), he was also named to ESPN's Academic All-America Team.[17] On April 15, 2005, he announced he would be hiring an agent and turning professional.[14] On March 2, 2011, Wake Forest retired his jersey.[18]\\r\\n\\r\\nPaul was selected fourth overall in the 2005 NBA draft by the New Orleans Hornets.[19] Due to the devastation caused by Hurricane Katrina, the Hornets played most of their games in Oklahoma City that year.[20] Paul finished the season leading all rookies in points, assists, steals, and double-doubles, and became only the second rookie in NBA history to lead the league in total steals.[21] With final averages of 16.1 points, 5.1 rebounds, 7.8 assists, and 2.2 steals per game,[22] he was named NBA Rookie of the Year, falling just one vote shy of winning the award unanimously.[21] The only other rookie to receive a first place vote was Deron Williams, with whom Paul enjoyed a brief rivalry early in their careers.[23]\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the 2007 All-Star Weekend, Paul set new Rookie Challenge records with 17 assists and 9 steals.[24] For his sophomore season, he increased his scoring

front of his home fans in New Orleans.[25] Behind his leadership, the Hornets were near the top of the Western Conference standings all year, temporarily occupying first place on March 17 following a win against the Chicago Bulls.[26] New Orleans finished the season with a franchise-record 56 wins and the second seed in the West.[27][28] Paul led the NBA with 11.6 assists and 2.7 steals per game to go along with 21.1 points per game,[22][29] finishing second in NBA Most Valuable Player Award voting and being named to his first All-NBA and All-Defensive teams.[22][30] In his playoff debut, he scored 35 points against the Dallas Mavericks.[31] In Game 2, he set a franchise playoff record with 17 assists.[32] The Hornets defeated the Mavericks in five games, with Paul registering 24 points, 11 rebounds, and 15 assists in the final game.[33] New Orleans were eliminated in the next round by the San Antonio Spurs.[27]\\r\\n\\r\\nPrior to the start of the 2008ÿ09 season, Paul signed a contract extension with the Hornets worth $68 million.[34] On December 17, 2008, he set the NBA record for consecutive games with a steal at 106.[35] On several occasions, he came within a few steals of recording a quadruple-double, including a 27-point, 10 rebound, 15 assist, and 7 steal game against the Philadelphia 76ers on January 26, 2009.[36] His final averages were 22.8 points, 5.5 rebounds, 11 assists, and 2.8 steals per game.[22] Despite Paul's individual accomplishments, New Orleans' record fell from the year before and they were eliminated in the first round of the playoffs by the Denver Nuggets.[37]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter a slow start to the 2009ÿ10 season, the Hornets fired coach Byron Scott.[38] Paul stirred up controversy when he announced his displeasure with the move, commenting that team management should have \\"consulted with me and asked how I felt before it happened.\\"[39] In early February, 2010, Paul tore cartilage in his left knee and was sidelined for over a month by surgery, forcing him to miss the All-Star Game.[40][41] In total, he played in only 45 games and his averages dropped to 18.7 points, 3.8 rebounds, 10.7 assists, and 2.1 steals per game.[22] Without Paul, the Hornets struggled, missing the playoffs.[42]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2010ÿ11, Paul had another injury scare on March 6, 2011, suffering a concussion after colliding with Cavaliers guard Ramon Sessions and being carried off the court in a stretcher.[43] He returned two games later, registering 33 points and 15 assists against the Sacramento Kings.[44] With Paul playing a full season, the Hornets qualified for the playoffs and were matched up with the defending champion Los Angeles Lakers in the first round.[45] Paul had a \\"historically great\\" performance in the series,[46] contributing 33 points, 14 assists, and 4 steals in Game 1 and 27 points, 13 rebounds, and 15 assists in Game 4.[47][48] His final averages were 22 points, 6.7 rebounds, 11.5 assists, and 1.8 steals per game on 54.5 percent shooting.[22] New Orleans were eliminated in six games,[45] and ownership, fearing that Paul would leave the franchise via free agency, began actively pursuing a trade that would provide the team equitable compensation in return for his services.[49]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn December 8, 2011, the Hornets agreed to a three-team trade sending Paul to the Los Angeles Lakers. The NBA, who owned the team at the time, nullified the deal, with commissioner David Stern claiming New Orleans would be better off keeping Paul.[50] The teams involved in the trade attempted to lobby the league to reverse its ruling and reconstruct the deal to no avail.[51][52] On December 12, the Hornets agreed to a trade sending Paul to the Los Angeles Clippers, but the deal broke down after the NBA added additional demands to the original terms.[53] Two days later, the teams finally made the trade, sending Paul and two future second round draft picks to the Clippers for Eric Gordon, Chris Kaman, Al-Farouq Aminu, and the Minnesota Timberwolves' unprotected first round pick in the 2012 draft.[54] Upon the deal's completion, Paul announced that he would opt into the final year of his contract and remain in Los Angeles for at least two more seasons.[55]\\r\\n\\r\\nPaul's arrival to Los Angeles rejuvenated the Clippers franchise, with teammate Blake Griffin later commenting, \\"It put us on the map.\\"[56] Early in Paul's debut season, the team developed a reputation for their fast paced offense and spectacular alley-oop dunks,[57] usually from Paul to Griffin or DeAndre Jordan,[58] earning them the nickname \\"Lob City\\".[59] Paul finished the year averaging 19.8 points, 9.1 assists, and 2.5 steals per game,[22] becoming the first Clipper to be named to the All-NBA First Team since the franchise moved to Los Angeles in the 1980s.[60] Behind his play and the emergence of Griffin as an All-NBA performer, Los Angeles qualified for the playoffs, losing to the San Antonio Spurs in the Conference Semifinals.[61]\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the 2013 All-Star Game, Paul led the West to victory with a 20-point and 15 assist performance, earning his first NBA All-Star Game Most Valuable Player Award.[62][63] He finished the season averaging 16.9 points, 9.7 assists, and 2.4 steals per game, helping the Clippers to a franchise-record 56 wins.[22][64] Seeded fourth in the West entering the playoffs, Los Angeles were defeated in the first round by the Memphis Grizzlies.[65] Shortly after their early postseason exit, the Clippers announced they would not renew coach Vinny Del Negro's contract and rumors arose of Paul forcing Del Negro out. Los Angeles later denied any player involvement in the coaching decision.[66][67][68]\\r\\n\\r\\nPrior to the start of the 2013ÿ14 season, Paul re-signed with the Clippers for five years on a contract worth approximately $107 million.[69] Despite a shoulder injury that sidelined him for over a month,[70] Los Angeles set another new franchise record for wins with 57.[71] His final averages were 19.1 points, 10.7 assists, and 2.5 steals per game.[22] In Game 1 of the second round of the playoffs, he hit a career postseason-high eight three-pointers to help the Clippers take an early series lead over the Oklahoma City Thunder.[72] In Game 5 and with the series tied 2ÿ2, he made a string of late mistakes leading to an eventual Thunder victory, later commenting, \\"It's me ... Everything that happened at the end is on me.\\"[73] Oklahoma City eventually eliminated Los Angeles in six games.[74]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2014ÿ15, Paul played in all 82 games for the first time in his career, averaging 19.1 points and a league-high 10.2 assists per game.[75] In Game 7 of the first round of the playoffs, he hit a go-ahead shot with a second left to lift the Clippers over the Spurs despite a hamstring injury.[76] The injury forced him to miss the first two games of the next series versus the Houston Rockets, and Los Angeles eventually lost in seven games despite holding a 3ÿ1 series lead.[77][78] The defeat marked ten consecutive seasons and seven consecutive playoff appearances without a Conference Finals appearance for Paul.[79]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn January of the 2015ÿ16 season, Paul led the Clippers on a ten-game winning streak despite missing Griffin and Jordan at various points due to injury.[80] For the third straight year, he finished the season with averages of over 19 points, 10 assists, and 2 steals per game.[22] To begin the postseason, the Clippers drew a matchup with the Portland Trail Blazers, taking a 2ÿ1 lead to start the series. In Game 4, Paul broke his hand and was ruled out indefinitely.[81] Without Paul, as well as Griffin, who also injured himself in Game 4, Los Angeles eventually lost the series in six games.[82]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2016ÿ17, Paul missed 21 regular season games due to rest or injury, and averaged 18.1 points, 9.2 assists, and 5 rebounds in just over 31 minutes per game.[22] At season's end, Paul was not rewarded with an All-NBA honor, marking just the second time he failed to make an All-NBA team since 2008 and the first time in his six years as a Clipper.[83] In the playoffs, Los Angeles was eliminated after their first round series against the Utah Jazz, with Paul averaging 25.3 points, 9.9 assists, 5 rebounds per game over seven games.[83]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn June 28, 2017, Paul was traded to the Houston Rockets in exchange for Patrick Beverley, Sam Dekker, Montrezl Harrell, Darrun Hilliard, DeAndre Liggins, Lou Williams, Kyle Wiltjer, a future first round pick, and cash considerations.[84] In his debut for the Rockets in their season opener on October 17, 2017, Paul had four points on 2-for-9 shooting in a 122ÿ121 win over the Golden State Warriors.[85] Paul sat on the bench down the stretch while the Rockets made their final push, and it was later revealed he was playing through a knee injury.[86] He subsequently missed the next 14 games. He returned to the lineup on November 16 and had 11 points and 10 assists in a 142ÿ116 win over the Phoenix Suns.[87] On December 13, he recorded a then season-high 31 points, 11 assists, and seven rebounds in a 108ÿ96 win over the Charlotte Hornets.[88] Two days later, he had 28 points, eight assists, and seven steals to lead the Rockets to their 12th straight victory, a 124ÿ109 win over the San Antonio Spurs. Paul became the first player in NBA history to post 28 points, eight assists, and seven steals in a game against the Spurs. In the previous 10 years, that stat line had been achieved just 10 timessix of those 10 recorded by Paul.[89] He was subsequently named Western Conference Player of the Week for games played from Monday, December 11 through Sunday, December 17. It was his 13th career Player of the Week honor and his first since January 2016.[90] On January 10, Paul took 29 shots and finished with a then season-high 37 points in a 121ÿ112 win over the Portland Trail Blazers.[91] On January 18, against the Minnesota Timberwolves, Paul earned his 1,958th steal, passing Derek Harper to move into 13th place on the NBA's career steals list.[92] On January 26, he scored a season-high 38 points in a 115ÿ113 loss to the New Orleans Pelicans.[93] On February 3, he recorded 22 points and 11 assists in a 120ÿ88 win over the Cleveland Cavaliers. During the game, Paul passed Andre Miller (8,624) for ninth place on the career assists list.[94] On February 23, in a 120ÿ102 win over the Timberwolves, Paul passed Allen Iverson for 12th on the NBA's career steals list with 1,984.[95] The Rockets finished the regular season as the No. 1 seed for the first time in franchise history, with a franchise-best 65ÿ17 record.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Game 5 of the Rockets' second-round playoff series against the Jazz, Paul scored a playoff career-high 41 points with eight 3-pointers to reach the conference finals for the first time in his career, helping the Rockets eliminate the Jazz in five games with a 112ÿ102 win. He also had 10 assists and seven rebounds.[96] In Game 5 of the Western Conference Finals, Paul injured his hamstring late in the game as the Rockets went up 3ÿ2 in the series against the Warriors. With Paul out for Games 6 and 7, the Rockets were eliminated from the playoffs with back-to-back losses.[97]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn July 8, 2018, Paul signed a four-year, $160 million maximum contract extension with the Rockets.[98][99]\\r\\n\\r\\nPaul made his debut for the United States national team at the 2006 FIBA World Championship in Japan.[100] He finished the competition with a tournament-high 44 assists, helping Team USA win the bronze medal.[101] At the 2008 Olympics in Beijing, he played a key role off the bench, scoring 13 points in a gold medal game victory against Spain.[102] Team USA finished the competition with a perfect 8ÿ0 record.[100] Paul was promoted to the starting point guard position for the 2012 Olympics in London, averaging 8.2 points, 5.1 assists, and 1.6 steals per game en route to another gold medal and undefeated tournament.[103][104]\\r\\n\\r\\nStanding 6 feet tall (1.83 m) and weighing 175 pounds (79?kg), Paul plays point guard exclusively.[22] His career averages are 18.7 points, 4.4 rebounds, 9.9 assists, and 2.3 steals per game.[22] He has earned All-NBA honors eight times (2008ÿ09, 2011ÿ16), All-Defensive honors eight times (2008ÿ09, 2011ÿ16), and led the NBA in steals six times (2008ÿ09, 2011ÿ14) and in assists four times (2008ÿ09, 2014ÿ2015).[22] In 2013, he was ranked the third-best player in the league by ESPN and Sports Illustrated.[58][105] In his 2014 NBA preview, ESPN's Kevin Pelton called Paul the league's best point guard, adding, \\"a title he's held throughout his career when healthy\\".[106]\\r\\n\\r\\nPaul prefers playing in the half court versus playing up-tempo.[106] He creates scoring opportunities by constantly changing speeds; upon beating his defender one-on-one or shedding him in the pick-and-roll, he will often slow down and box him out, denying him from regaining front side position and forcing the defense to help at all times.[58] His ability to penetrate deep into the paint leads to easy shots for his teammates, and in 2013, he was second in the league in assisted three pointers.[106] As a playmaker, he is noted for his consistently high assist-to-turnover ratio,[107] averaging just 2.4 turnovers per game over his career.[22] A deft midrange shooter, he is especially proficient from the right elbow, leading the league in shooting percentage from that area in 2015.[108] On defense, he aggravates opponents with active hands and high effort,[58] and has been ranked as one of the best perimeter defenders in the NBA.[109]\\r\\n\\r\\nPaul married his college sweetheart, Jada Crawley, on September 10, 2011.[110] Together they have two children, Christopher Emmanuel Paul, Jr. (born May 23, 2009) and Camryn Alexis Paul (born August 16, 2012).[111] The family resides in a Mediterranean-style mansion in Bel Air, which Paul bought from Avril Lavigne for $8.5 million in 2012.[112] On November 11, 2011, Paul appeared with his family on Family Feud.[113]\\r\\n\\r\\nPaul is a Christian and attends church every Sunday whenever possible.[114] In one interview, Paul commented, \\"I am so thankful that my parents raised me and C.J. to depend on God's guidance and our faith in Him, and to always be thankful for what we receive.\\"[115] He enjoys bowling and owns a franchise in the Professional Bowlers Association (PBA) League called L.A.X.[116] He has hosted and participated in numerous celebrity and youth bowling events as the head of the CP3 Foundation, which benefits programs in Louisiana affected by Hurricane Katrina, as well as charities in Winston-Salem.[117][118][119] In 2018, Paul purchased a minority ownership stake in the Winston-Salem Dash, a minor league baseball team located in his hometown.[120]\\r\\n\\r\\nPaul's brother, C.J., played college basketball at Hampton University and University of South Carolina Upstate. In 2004, they played against each other when Wake Forest had a preseason exhibition with USC-Upstate.[121] C.J. now works as Chris's personal manager.[122] Paul is close friends with footballer Reggie Bush; the two lived in the One River Place complex in the New Orleans Central Business District while Bush was playing for the Saints.[123] They also shared a personal chef.[124]\\r\\n\\r\\nPaul is represented by NBA agent Leon Rose of Creative Artists Agency, who also represents Carmelo Anthony and Dwyane Wade, among others.[125] In 2014, Forbes ranked Paul as one of the highest-paid athletes in the world with $24.2 million in earnings including $5.5 million in endorsements.[126] Some of the companies he does business with are Nike and State Farm.[127] He was the cover athlete for the video game NBA 2K8.[128]\\r\\n\\r\\nPaul was selected president of the National Basketball Players Association on August 21, 2013, after having served on the executive committee for four years.[129] He was a key figure in the banning of Clippers owner Donald Sterling from the NBA following racist remarks Sterling made in 2014. In one interview, Paul mentioned a possible boycott if Sterling continued to own the team.[130] Paul played a significant role in the election of Michele Roberts as the Executive Director of the Players Association, giving a strong recommendation to the executive committee responsible for filling the position.[131]","input":"When did chris paul join the houston rockets?"},{"output":"in the South Beach neighborhood of San Francisco, California","context":"Baseball:\\r\\n1,500 standing-room capacity\\r\\nNCAA Football:\\r\\nSoccer:\\r\\nAT&T Park is a baseball park located in the South Beach neighborhood of San Francisco, California. Since 2000, it has served as the home of the San Francisco Giants, the city's Major League Baseball (MLB) franchise. Originally named Pacific Bell Park, then SBC Park in 2003 after SBC Communications acquired Pacific Bell, the stadium was ultimately christened AT&T Park in 2006, following SBC's buyout of AT&T. The park stands along the San Francisco Bay, a segment of which is named McCovey Cove in honor of former Giants player Willie McCovey.\\r\\nAT&T Park has also played host to both professional and collegiate American football games. The stadium was the home of the Foster Farms Bowl, an annual college postseason bowl game, from its inaugural playing in 2002 until 2013 and also served as the temporary home for the University of California's football team in 2011. Professionally, AT&T Park was the home of the San Francisco Demons of the XFL and the California Redwoods of the United Football League.\\r\\nThe stadium will host the Rugby World Cup Sevens 2018 [9]\\r\\nThe stadium can be reached via San Francisco's Muni Metro; the 2nd and King Station is directly outside the ballpark.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOriginally designed to be a 42,000-seat stadium, there were slight modifications before the final design was complete. When the ballpark was brought to the ballot box in the fall of 1996 for voter approval, the stadium was 15 clockwise from its current position. Also the center-field scoreboard was atop the right-field wall and the Giants Pavilion Building were two separate buildings.[10] Groundbreaking on the ballpark began on December 11, 1997, in the industrial waterfront area of San Francisco known as China Basin in the up-and-coming neighborhoods of South Beach and Mission Bay. The stadium cost $357 million to build and supplanted the Giants' former home, Candlestick Park, a multi-use stadium in southeastern San Francisco that was also home to the National Football League's San Francisco 49ers until 2014, when they too relocated to Levi's Stadium in nearby Santa Clara. A team of engineers from UC Davis was consulted in the design process of the park, resulting in wind levels that are approximately half those at Candlestick. Fans had shivered through 40 seasons at \\"The 'Stick\\" and looked forward to warmer temperatures at the new ballpark.[11] But because AT&T Park, like its predecessor, is built right on San Francisco Bay, cold summer fog and winter jackets in July are still not unusual at Giants games, despite the higher average temperature.\\r\\nWhen it opened on March 31, 2000, the ballpark was the first Major League ballpark built without public funds since the completion of Dodger Stadium in 1962.[12] However, the Giants did receive a $10?million tax abatement from the city and $80?million for upgrades to the local infrastructure (including a connection to the Muni Metro).[13] The Giants have a 66-year lease on the 12.5-acre (51,000?m2) ballpark site, paying $1.2?million in rent annually to the San Francisco Port Commission.[12] The park opened with a seating capacity of 40,800, but this has increased over time as seats have been added.\\r\\nIn April 2010, the stadium became the first MLB ballpark to receive LEED Silver Certification for Existing Buildings, Operations and Maintenance.[14]\\r\\nThe Pacific Telephone & Telegraph Company, a local telephone company in the San Francisco Bay Area, purchased the naming rights for the park for $50?million over 24?years in the Winter of 1996.[15] Pacific Bell had been recently purchased by SBC Communications when the naming rights deal was agreed upon. SBC eventually dropped the Pacific Bell name and reached an agreement with the Giants to change the stadium's name to \\"SBC Park\\" on January 1, 2004.[15]\\r\\nAfter SBC bought AT&T Corporation on November 18, 2005, the name of the merged company became AT&T Inc. As a result, the stadium was given its third name in six years: \\"AT&T Park\\".[15] A few fans still refer to the stadium as \\"Pac Bell Park\\", as it was the first name given to the stadium. Others have named the stadium \\"The Phone Booth\\" or \\"Telephone Park\\", for the constant name changes, while some referred to the stadium as \\"Some Big Corporation Park\\" due to the SBC years. Others yet refer to it as \\"Mays Field\\" in honor of Giants great Willie Mays or simply \\"The Bell\\".[16] Many also refer to the stadium as \\"China Basin\\" or \\"McCovey Cove\\" after its location, which would be immune to changes in sponsorship naming.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe stadium contains 68 luxury suites, 5,200 club seats on the club level, and an additional 1,500 club seats at the field level behind home plate.\\r\\nOn the facing of the upper deck along the left-field line are the retired numbers of Bill Terry, Mel Ott, Carl Hubbell, Monte Irvin, Willie Mays, Juan Marichal, Orlando Cepeda, Jackie Robinson, Willie McCovey, and Gaylord Perry, as well as the retired uniforms, denoted \\"NY\\", of Christy Mathewson and John McGraw who played or managed in the pre-number era. These two pre-numberÿera retired uniforms are among only six such retired uniforms in all of the Major Leagues.\\r\\nAT&T Park has a reputation of being a pitcher's park and the most pitcher-friendly ballpark in the National League, because the depth of the outfield limits home runs, according to ESPN.[17]\\r\\nIn 2014, PETA declared the park to be the Most Vegetarian-Friendly MLB ballpark in the country. It held the top spot on the same list in 2011, 2006 and 2005.[18]\\r\\nThe most prominent feature of the ballpark is the right-field wall, which is 24 feet (7.3?m) high in honor of former Giant Willie Mays, who wore number 24. Because of the proximity to the San Francisco Bay, the right-field foul pole is only 309 feet (94?m) from home plate. The wall is made of brick, with fenced-off archways opening to the Cove beyond, above which are several rows of arcade seating. The fence angles quickly away from home plate; right-center field extends out to 421 feet (128?m) from home plate. Atop the fence are four pillars with fountains atop. Jets of water burst from the four pillars at the end of the National Anthem and also when the Giants hit a home run or win a game.\\r\\nIn the past, rubber chickens put up by fans whenever a Giants player (especially Barry Bonds) was intentionally walked, would line the foul portion of the wall. The fans would do this to show that the opposing team is \\"chicken\\" for not pitching right to the Giants players. In recent seasons, as the team's strength has shifted from hitting to pitching, fans will line up \\"K\\" signs with each strikeout by a Giants pitcher. To some seniors, the right field area vaguely suggests the layout at the Polo Grounds. This deep corner of the ballpark has been dubbed \\"Death Valley\\" and \\"Triples' Alley.\\" Like its Polo Grounds counterpart, it is very difficult to hit a home run to this area, and a batted ball that finds its way into this corner often results in a triple. Triples' Alley is also infamous for bad bounces, most notably when Ichiro Suzuki hit the first-ever inside-the-park home run in an All-Star Game by lining the ball off one of the archways and sideways past the outfielders. Nate Schierholtz performed the same feat in the 2009 season as a pinch hitter. Aubrey Huff did it again in the 2010 season, as did Conor Gillaspie in 2011. ngel Pagn ended a game in May 2013 with a two-run walk-off inside-the-park home run, the first of its kind at AT&T Park.\\r\\nBeyond right field is China Basin, a section of San Francisco Bay, which is dubbed McCovey Cove after famed Giants first baseman and left-handed slugger Willie McCovey, and into which a number of home runs have been hit on the fly. As of August 21 2017, 75 \\"splash hits\\" have been knocked into the Cove by Giants players since the park opened; 35 of those were by Barry Bonds, and the most recent being Denard Span hitting one off Carlos Carrasco of the Cleveland Indians on July 19, 2017. These hits are tallied on an electronic counter on the right field wall. Opponents have hit the water on the fly 42 times; Todd Hundley of the Los Angeles Dodgers was the first visitor to do so on June 30, 2000. Curtis Granderson of the New York Mets, Luis Gonzalez of the Arizona Diamondbacks and Cliff Floyd of the Chicago Cubs are the only visiting players to do so twice, while Carlos Delgado of the New York Mets has performed the feat three times. Adam LaRoche has also hit three splash hits, twice with the Arizona Diamondbacks and once with the Pittsburgh Pirates. Curtis Granderson of the New York Mets most recently hit one into the water as a visiting player on August 19, 2016 On June 27, 2010, David Ortiz of the Boston Red Sox became the first American League player to hit a splash hit. The only other AL players who have done it are Mitch Moreland of the Texas Rangers on June 9, 2012 and Adam Dunn of the Chicago White Sox on August 13, 2014. Barry Bonds is the Giant who has hit the most home runs into \\"The Cove\\" as Giants fans call it and is the only one to have had hit 2 splash hits in one game (a feat he accomplished twice).[19]\\r\\nBehind the scoreboard in center field there is a pier where ferries can tie up and let off fans right at the park. On game days, fans take to the water of McCovey Cove in boats and even in kayaks, often with fishing nets in the hope of collecting a home run ball. (This echoes what used to happen during McCovey's playing days. Before Candlestick Park's upper deck was extended, the area behind right field was occupied by three small bleacher sections and a lot of open space. Kids in those bleachers would gather behind the right field fence when \\"Stretch\\" would come to the plate.) Just beyond the wall is a public waterfront promenade, where fans can watch three innings of a game through the wall's archways, free of charge, albeit with a somewhat obstructed view. Across the cove from the ballpark is McCovey Point and China Basin Park, featuring monuments to past Giants legends.\\r\\nWhen the park opened in 2000, taking residence on the right field wall was Rusty, the Mechanical Man based on a theme of Old Navy since the wall was sponsored by the company. Rusty was a two-dimensional robotic ballplayer that stood 14 feet (4.3?m) tall and weighed 5? tons. The Valencia, California firm, Technifex, engineered, fabricated and programmed Rusty to appear after major plays, during games, as a fully animated giant 1920's era tin \\"toy\\". After technical problems arose with Rusty, it was removed from the Old Navy Splash Landing, though the enclosure that housed him remained for years. In 2006 the Old Navy sponsorship of the wall was terminated and renamed \\"Levi's Landing\\". In 2008, the enclosure was removed as that area near the right field foul pole was renovated for a new luxury party suite called the \\"McCovey Cove Loft\\".[20]\\r\\nBehind the left field bleachers is \\"The Coca-Cola Fan Lot\\". The ballpark features an 80-foot (24?m) long Coca-Cola bottle with playground slides that lights up with every Giants home run, and a miniature version of the stadium. \\"The Coca-Cola Superslide\\" is popular with children as is with adults, and the terraced levels of the slides are a fun way to catch the game. Bubbles originally accompanied the bottle, but never worked as intended and were removed. If one were viewing the outfield promenade from home plate, directly to the bottle's right is another oversized representation of a ballpark stalwart, the \\"Giant 1927 Old-Time Four-Fingered Baseball Glove\\"  this particular one is made of steel and fiberglass. Behind and farther to the left is \\"The Little Giants Park\\" ÿ a miniature baseball diamond  sort of a minor league tryout for Pee-Wee Ball.[21]\\r\\nTo the right of the glove sculpture is the elevator and large plaza area for functions and parties to be held during games. It's also the site of \\"Orlando's\\", the concessions stand of Giants great Orlando Cepeda. The signature fare at the stand is the \\"Caribbean Cha Cha Bowl\\". Right-center field features a real San Francisco cable car (retired cable car #4, formerly #504), with a label that states \\"No Dodgers Fans Allowed\\". The fog horn  a feature introduced at Candlestick Park by the current Giants ownership group ÿ was transferred to AT&T and hung underneath the scoreboard. It blows when a Giants player hits a home run or at the conclusion of a Giants win. Continuing right takes one to the promenade above the Cove, so that one can make a completely uninterrupted circuit of the park at that concourse level. Both levels of the concourse, inside the stadium, feature not only concession stands of all sorts, but other attractions as well.\\r\\nLocated behind the centerfield bleachers, the ballpark features the @Caf,[22] a social media caf, which opened in the 2013 season. The cafe serves Peet's Coffee and features large screens that show off fans' social media posts from Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram, which are curated by the Giants organization.\\r\\nThe cafe replaced a team-themed Build-A-Bear Workshop store, where fans could build their own stuffed Giants' mascot, Lou Seal, or create other Giants-themed stuffed animals.\\r\\nIn addition to the automated scoreboards, which now include a new high-definition video board by Mitsubishi, the park has enormous, manually operated boards on the right field wall, which display the scores of Major League games played elsewhere. These manual scoreboards are operated by three employees, whose work on game days starts at least two hours before the first pitch.\\r\\nStarting in 2004, the Giants installed 122 wireless internet access points, covering all concourses and seating areas, creating one of the largest public hotspots in the world[23] at the time.\\r\\nOn September 23, 2008, the Giants Wall of Fame was unveiled on the King Street side of the ballpark,[24] as part of the 50th-anniversary celebration of the Giants' move to San Francisco. Forty-three retired players were inducted, based on longevity and achievement.[25] Eligibility requirements for players to be on the Wall are either five years as a San Francisco Giant with an All-Star Game appearance or nine years as a Giant.[26] Rich Aurilia and Shawn Estes were added in 2010.[27] Jason Schmidt and Marvin Benard were added in 2011.\\r\\nOutside the ballpark are six statues, five of which are dedicated to San Francisco Giants all-time greats.\\r\\nThe Willie Mays Statue is located in front of the ballpark entrance at 24 Willie Mays Plaza and is surrounded with 24 palm trees, in honor of his number 24 uniform, retired by the Giants. It was dedicated at noon on March 31, 2000, prior to the opening of the ballpark and was commissioned by Giants Managing Partner Peter Magowan and his wife Debby.[29]\\r\\nAnother statue is located at McCovey Point across McCovey Cove, and is dedicated to Willie McCovey. Around the Willie McCovey Statue are a number of plaques that celebrate the winners of the Willie Mac Award. The statue is located at China Basin Park next to The Barry Bonds Junior Giants Field, a T-ball park. Also located on the sea wall promenade are plaques showing the Opening Day roster of every Giants team from 1958 through 1999. Giants fans who contributed funds to China Basin Park, had their own tiles with their own inscriptions set into the wall.[30]\\r\\nA third statue, dedicated in 2005, honors former Giants pitcher Juan Marichal, and is located outside the ballpark at the Lefty O'Doul Gate entrance. The fourth statue is located at the park's ferry plaza behind center field, also known as Seals Plaza; a statue of a seal bobbing a baseball on its nose honors the memory of the San Francisco Seals, the minor league baseball club that played before the arrival of the Giants in 1958.\\r\\nOn September 6, 2008, during a series against the Pittsburgh Pirates, a fifth statue depicting former Giants great Orlando Cepeda was dedicated at the corner of 2nd and King Streets next to the ballpark. A sixth statue, dedicated on August 13, 2016, honors former Giants pitcher Gaylord Perry and is also located at the corner of 2nd and King Streets next to the ballpark. All five statues of the Giants Hall of Fame players were created by sculptor William Behrends of North Carolina.\\r\\nThe opening series took place April 11ÿ13, 2000 against the Los Angeles Dodgers (the team the Giants faced in their final series at Candlestick Park), and the Giants were swept in three games. In the first game of that series, the Giants lost 6ÿ5, highlighted by three home runs from the Dodgers' Kevin Elster. On May 1, 2000, Barry Bonds became the first player to hit a \\"splash hit\\" home run into McCovey Cove.\\r\\nIn just its first few years of existence, the ballpark saw its share of historic events primarily due to veteran Giants outfielder Barry Bonds. On April 17, 2001, Bonds hit his 500th career home run at then-Pacific Bell Park. Later that year, he set the single season home run record when he hit home runs number 71, 72, and 73 over the weekend of October 5 to close the season. On August 9, 2002, Bonds hit his 600th career home run at the park. On April 12, 2004, Bonds hit career home run 660 at SBC Park to tie Willie Mays for third on the all-time list and on the next night, he hit number 661 to move into sole possession of third place. On September 17, 2004, Bonds hit his 700th career home run at the park to become just the third member of baseball's 700 club. On May 28, 2006, Bonds hit his 715th home run at the park to pass Babe Ruth for second place on the all-time list. On August 7, 2007, Bonds hit his 756th home run, breaking Hank Aaron's record.\\r\\nThe park hosted games three through five of the 2002 World Series against the Anaheim Angels, which the Giants lost four games to three. It also hosted the 2007 MLB All-Star Game, which the American League won 5ÿ4 over the National League.\\r\\nOn July 10, 2009, the Giants' Jonathan Snchez pitched the first no-hitter at AT&T Park.\\r\\nOn October 27 & 28, 2010, the Giants hosted the first two games of the World Series, beating the Texas Rangers in both games. They ultimately went on to win the series, their first championship since the team moved to San Francisco in 1958, though the clinching game was played at Rangers Ballpark in Arlington rather than at AT&T Park.\\r\\nOn June 13, 2012, Matt Cain threw the 22nd perfect game in MLB history  and first in Giants history  against the Houston Astros.\\r\\nAT&T Park hosted Games 1 and 2 of the 2012 World Series on October 24 and 25. The Giants beat the Detroit Tigers twice, 8ÿ3 and 2ÿ0 respectively. The Giants would go on to win the 2012 World Series in a four-game sweep at Comerica Park.\\r\\nThe stadium hosted of the semifinal and final rounds of the 2013 World Baseball Classic on March 17ÿ19.\\r\\nOn July 23, 2013, due to a previous rain-out in Cincinnati, AT&T Park served as the \\"home\\" venue of the Cincinnati Reds for the second game of a doubleheader against the Giants.[31] Giants manager Bruce Bochy won his 1,500th career game.\\r\\nOn June 25, 2014 Tim Lincecum pitched the 3rd no hitter at AT&T Park against the San Diego Padres in a 4-0 win. It was his 2nd no hitter of his career, with both of them coming against the Padres. His first one was in San Diego on July 13, 2013.\\r\\nAT&T Park hosted Games 3, 4, and 5 of the 2014 World Series on October 24, 25, and 26. The Giants beat the Kansas City Royals 2 out of the 3 games played at AT&T Park, losing Game 3, 3ÿ2, before winning Games 4 and 5, 11ÿ4 and 5ÿ0 respectively. They ultimately went on to win the series in seven games, with the clinching game played at Kauffman Stadium rather than at AT&T Park. As of 2017, the Giants have not hosted a World Series clincher in San Francisco.\\r\\nOn June 15, 2015, the Giants set a record for most consecutive home losses at AT&T Park at nine straight games with a 5-1 loss to the Seattle Mariners. This losing streak was the Giants' longest since an 11-game home loss streak at the Polo Grounds in New York in 1940.[32]\\r\\nFrom October 1, 2010 to July 18, 2017, AT&T Park recorded 530 consecutive sellouts, the second longest in Major League history behind Fenway Park's 794 consecutive sellouts from 2003ÿ13.\\r\\nGiants Enterprises, a wholly owned subsidiary of the San Francisco Giants created and headed by longtime team executive Pat Gallagher, brings non-baseball events to AT&T Park on days when the Giants do not play. Prominent among these has been the usage of the stadium for football. It has also hosted a range of other sporting and musical events.\\r\\nThe park was home to the XFL's San Francisco Demons in 2001, was the home of the East-West Shrine Game (until 2006), and was the former home stadium of the California Redwoods of the UFL in 2009.\\r\\nFrom 2002 to 2013, it has also been home to college football's Fight Hunger Bowl, previously the San Francisco Bowl and most recently the Emerald Bowl. In 2011, AT&T Park became the temporary home football stadium for the California Golden Bears while Cal's on-campus stadium, California Memorial Stadium, underwent renovation.[33]\\r\\nAT&T Park also hosted its first high school football game in 2011, the Central Coast Section Division III football championship game between long-time San Francisco rivals St. Ignatius College Preparatory and Sacred Heart Cathedral Preparatory.[34]\\r\\nOn February 10, 2006, the U.S. men's soccer team defeated Japan 3ÿ2 at AT&T in a friendly.\\r\\nA match of the 2011 World Football Challenge between Manchester City and Club America was held at AT&T, drawing a crowd of 11,250.\\r\\nA virtual recreation of the park was created as a gig venue for Guitar Hero World Tour.\\r\\nIn summer 2010, the park hosted an audition stop for the 2011 (10th) season of American Idol.\\r\\nThe stadium hosted an AMA Supercross Championship round from 2003 to 2010.[35]\\r\\nThe Mavericks big-wave surfing contest is broadcast live on the giant video display at AT&T Park when the event is held. In 2006, the park hosted ICER AIR the first stadium big-air ski and snowboard competition to be held in the United States.\\r\\nSan Francisco Opera partnered with Giants Enterprises to do three broadcasts, most recently Tosca, in June and September 2009.\\r\\nIn October 2013, rapper Kanye West rented out the stadium and the scoreboard for a private event, which turned out to be an elaborate marriage proposal to his girlfriend, reality personality Kim Kardashian.[36]","input":"Where is the san francisco giants stadium located?"},{"output":"Got to Be There","context":"","input":"When did michael jackson released his first album?"},{"output":"December 29, 1845","context":"The Texas Annexation was the 1845 incorporation of the Republic of Texas into the United States of America, which was admitted to the Union as the 28th state on December 29, 1845.\\r\\nThe Republic of Texas declared independence from the Republic of Mexico on March 2, 1836. At the time the vast majority of the Texian population favored the annexation of the Republic by the United States. The leadership of both major U.S. political parties, the Democrats and the Whigs, opposed the introduction of Texas, a vast slave-holding region, into the volatile political climate of the pro- and anti-slavery sectional controversies in Congress. Moreover, they wished to avoid a war with Mexico, whose government refused to acknowledge the sovereignty of its rebellious northern province. With Texas's economic fortunes declining by the early 1840s, the President of the Texas Republic, Sam Houston, arranged talks with Mexico to explore the possibility of securing official recognition of independence, with the United Kingdom mediating.\\r\\nIn 1843, U.S. President John Tyler, unaligned with any political party, decided independently to pursue the annexation of Texas in a bid to gain a base of popular support for another four years in office. His official motivation was to outmaneuver suspected diplomatic efforts by the British government for emancipation of slaves in Texas, which would undermine slavery in the United States. Through secret negotiations with the Houston administration, Tyler secured a treaty of annexation in April 1844. When the documents were submitted to the U.S. Senate for ratification, the details of the terms of annexation became public and the question of acquiring Texas took center stage in the presidential election of 1844. Pro-Texas-annexation southern Democratic delegates denied their anti-annexation leader Martin Van Buren the nomination at their party's convention in May 1844. In alliance with pro-expansion northern Democratic colleagues, they secured the nomination of James K. Polk, who ran on a pro-Texas Manifest Destiny platform.\\r\\nIn June 1844, the Senate, with its Whig majority, soundly rejected the TylerÿTexas treaty. The pro-annexation Democrat Polk narrowly defeated anti-annexation Whig Henry Clay in the 1844 presidential election. In December 1844, lame-duck President Tyler called on Congress to pass his treaty by simple majorities in each house. The Democratic-dominated House of Representatives complied with his request by passing an amended bill expanding on the pro-slavery provisions of the Tyler treaty. The Senate narrowly passed a compromise version of the House bill (by the vote of the minority Democrats and several southern Whigs), designed to provide the incoming President-elect Polk the options of immediate annexation of Texas or new talks to revise the annexation terms of the House-amended bill.\\r\\nOn March 1, 1845, President Tyler signed the annexation bill, and on March 3 (his last day in office), he forwarded the House version to Texas, offering immediate annexation (which preempted Polk). When Polk took office the next day, he encouraged Texas to accept the Tyler offer. Texas ratified the agreement with popular approval from Texans. The bill was signed by Polk on December 29, 1845, accepting Texas as the 28th state of the Union. Texas formally relinquished its sovereignty to the United States on February 19, 1846. Following the annexation, relations between the United States and Mexico deteriorated due to an unresolved dispute over the border between Texas and Mexico, and the Mexican-American War broke out only a few months later.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFirst mapped by Spain in 1519, Texas was part of the vast Spanish empire seized by the Spanish Conquistadors from its indigenous people for over 300 years.[1] When the Louisiana territory was acquired by the United States from France in 1803, many in the U.S. believed the new territory included parts or all of present-day Texas.[2] The US-Spain border along the northern frontier of Texas took shape in the 1817ÿ1819 negotiations between Secretary of State John Quincy Adams and the Spanish ambassador to the United States, Luis de Ons y Gonzlez-Vara.[3] The boundaries of Texas were determined within the larger geostrategic struggle to demarcate the limits of the United States' extensive western lands and of Spain's vast possessions in North America.[4] The Florida Treaty of February 22, 1819[5][6] emerged as a compromise that excluded Spain from the lower Columbia River watershed, but established southern boundaries at the Sabine and Red Rivers, \\"legally extinguish[ing]\\" any American claims to Texas.[7][8] Nonetheless, Texas remained an object of fervent interest to American expansionists, among them Thomas Jefferson, who anticipated the eventual acquisition of its fertile lands.[9]\\r\\nThe Missouri crisis of 1819ÿ1821 sharpened commitments to expansionism among the country's slaveholding interests, when the so-called Thomas proviso established the 3630' parallel, imposing free-soil and slave-soil futures in the Louisiana Purchase lands.[10] While a majority of southern congressmen acquiesced to the exclusion of slavery from the bulk of the Louisiana Purchase, a significant minority objected.[11][12] Virginian editor Thomas Ritchie of the Richmond Enquirer predicted that with the proviso restrictions, the South would ultimately require Texas: \\"If we are cooped up on the north, we must have elbow room to the west.\\"[13][14] Representative John Floyd of Virginia in 1824 accused Secretary of State Adams of conceding Texas to Spain in 1819 in the interests of Northern anti-slavery advocates, and so depriving the South of additional slave states.[15] Then-Representative John Tyler of Virginia invoked the Jeffersonian precepts of territorial and commercial growth as a national goal to counter the rise of sectional differences over slavery. His \\"diffusion\\" theory declared that with Missouri open to slavery, the new state would encourage the transfer of underutilized slaves westward, emptying the eastern states of bondsmen and making emancipation feasible in the old South.[16] This doctrine would be revived during the Texas annexation controversy.[17][18]\\r\\nWhen Mexico won its independence from Spain in 1821,[19] the United States did not contest the new republic's claims to Texas, and both presidents John Quincy Adams (1825ÿ1829) and Andrew Jackson (1829ÿ1837) persistently sought, through official and unofficial channels, to procure all or portions of provincial Texas from the Mexican government, without success.[20]\\r\\nSpanish and Indigenous immigrants, primarily from North Eastern provinces of New Spain began to settle Texas in the late 17th century. The Spanish constructed chains of missions and presidios in what is today Louisiana, East Texas and South Texas. The first chain of missions was designed for the Tejas Indians, near Los Adaes. Soon thereafter, the San Antonio Missions were founded along the San Antonio River. The City of San Antonio, then known as San Fernando de Bexar, was founded in 1719. In the early 1760s, Jose de Escandon created five settlements along the Rio Grande River, including Laredo.\\r\\nAnglo-American immigrants, primarily from the Southern United States, began emigrating to Mexican Texas in the early 1820s at the invitation of the Texas faction of the Coahuila y Texas state government, which sought to populate the sparsely inhabited lands of its northern frontier for cotton production.[21][22] Colonizing empresario Stephen F. Austin managed the regional affairs of the mostly American-born population ÿ 20% of them slaves[23] ÿ under the terms of the generous government land grants.[24] Mexican authorities were initially content to govern the remote province through salutary neglect, \\"permitting slavery under the legal fiction of 'permanent indentured servitude', similar to Mexico's peonage system.[25]\\r\\nA general lawlessness prevailed in the vast Texas frontier, and Mexico's civic laws went largely unenforced among the Anglo-American settlers. In particular, the prohibitions against slavery and forced labor were ignored. The requirement that all settlers be Catholic or convert to Catholicism was also subverted.[26][27] Mexican authorities, perceiving that they were losing control over Texas and alarmed by the unsuccessful Fredonian Rebellion of 1826, abandoned the policy of benign rule. New restrictions were imposed in 1829ÿ1830, outlawing slavery throughout the nation and terminating further American immigration to Texas.[28][29] Military occupation followed, sparking local uprisings and a civil war. Texas conventions in 1832 and 1833 submitted petitions for redress of grievances to overturn the restrictions, with limited success.[30] In 1835, an army under Mexican President Santa Anna entered its territory of Texas and abolished self-government. Texans responded by declaring their independence from Mexico on March 2, 1836. On April 20ÿ21, rebel forces under Texas General Sam Houston defeated the Mexican army at the Battle of San Jacinto.[31][32] In June 1836, Santa Anna agreed to Texas independence, but the Mexican government refused to honor Santa Anna's pledge.[33] Texans, now de facto independent, recognized that their security and prosperity could never be achieved while Mexico denied the legitimacy of their revolution.[34]\\r\\nIn the years following independence, the migration of white settlers and importation of black slave labor into the vast republic was deterred by Texas's unresolved international status and the threat of renewed warfare with Mexico.[35] American citizens who considered migrating to the new republic perceived that \\"life and property were safer within the United States\\" than in an independent Texas.[36] The situation led to labor shortages, reduced tax revenue, large national debts and a diminished Texas militia.[37][38]\\r\\nThe Anglo-American immigrants residing in newly-independent Texas overwhelmingly desired immediate annexation by the United States.[39] But, despite his strong support for Texas independence from Mexico,[40] then-President Andrew Jackson delayed recognizing the new republic until the last day of his presidency to avoid raising the issue during the 1836 general election.[41][42] Jackson's political caution was informed by northern concerns that Texas could potentially form several new slave states and undermine the North-South balance in Congress.[43]\\r\\nJackson's successor, President Martin Van Buren, viewed Texas annexation as an immense political liability that would empower the anti-slavery northern Whig opposition ÿ especially if annexation provoked a war with Mexico.[44] Presented with a formal annexation proposal from Texas minister Memucan Hunt, Jr. in August 1837, Van Buren summarily rejected it.[45] Annexation resolutions presented separately in each house of Congress were either soundly defeated or tabled through filibuster. After the election of 1838, new Texas president Mirabeau B. Lamar withdrew his republic's offer of annexation due to these failures.[46] Texans were at an annexation impasse when John Tyler entered the White House in 1841.[47]\\r\\nWilliam Henry Harrison, Whig Party presidential nominee, defeated US President Martin Van Buren in the 1840 general election. Upon Harrison's death shortly after his inauguration, Vice-President John Tyler assumed the presidency.[48] President Tyler was expelled from the Whig party in 1841 for repeatedly vetoing their domestic finance legislation. Tyler, isolated and outside the two-party mainstream, turned to foreign affairs to salvage his presidency, aligning himself with a southern states' rights faction that shared his fervent slavery expansionist views.[49]\\r\\nIn his first address to Congress in special session on June 1, 1841, Tyler set the stage for Texas annexation by announcing his intention to pursue an expansionist agenda so as to preserve the balance between state and national authority and to protect American institutions, including slavery, so as to avoid sectional conflict.[50] Tyler's closest advisors counseled him that obtaining Texas would assure him a second term in the White House,[51] and it became a deeply personal obsession for the president, who viewed the acquisition of Texas as the \\"primary objective of his administration\\".[52] Tyler delayed direct action on Texas to work closely with his Secretary of State Daniel Webster on other pressing diplomatic initiatives.[53]\\r\\nWith the Webster-Ashburton Treaty ratified in 1843, Tyler was ready to make the annexation of Texas his \\"top priority\\".[54] Representative Thomas W. Gilmer of Virginia was authorized by the administration to make the case for annexation to the American electorate. In a widely circulated open letter, understood as an announcement of the executive branch's designs for Texas, Gilmer described Texas as a panacea for North-South conflict and an economic boon to all commercial interests. The slavery issue, however divisive, would be left for the states to decide as per the US Constitution. Domestic tranquility and national security, Tyler argued, would result from an annexed Texas; a Texas left outside American jurisdiction would imperil the Union.[55] Tyler adroitly arranged the resignation of his anti-annexation Secretary of State Daniel Webster, and on June 23, 1843 appointed Abel P. Upshur, a Virginia states' rights champion and ardent proponent of Texas annexation. This cabinet shift signaled Tyler's intent to pursue Texas annexation aggressively.[56]\\r\\nIn late September 1843, in an effort to cultivate public support for Texas, Secretary Upshur dispatched a letter to the US Minister to Great Britain, Edward Everett, conveying his displeasure with Britain's global anti-slavery posture, and warning their government that forays into Texas's affairs would be regarded as \\"tantamount to direct interference 'with the established institutions of the United States'\\".[57] In a breach of diplomatic norms, Upshur leaked the communique to the press to inflame popular Anglophobic sentiments among American citizens.[58]\\r\\nIn the spring of 1843, the Tyler administration had sent executive agent Duff Green to Europe to gather intelligence and arrange territorial treaty talks with Great Britain regarding Oregon; he also worked with American minister to France, Lewis Cass, to thwart efforts by major European powers to suppress the maritime slave trade.[59] Green reported to Secretary Upshur in July 1843 that he had discovered a \\"loan plot\\" by American abolitionists, in league with Lord Aberdeen, British Foreign Secretary, to provide funds to the Texas in exchange for the emancipation of its slaves.[60] Minister Everett was charged with determining the substance of these confidential reports alleging a Texas plot. His investigations, including personal interviews with Lord Aberdeen, concluded that British interest in abolitionist intrigues was weak, contradicting Secretary of State Upshur's conviction that Great Britain was manipulating Texas.[61] Though unsubstantiated, Green's unofficial intelligence so alarmed Tyler that he requested verification from the US minister to Mexico, Waddy Thompson.[62]\\r\\nJohn C. Calhoun of South Carolina, a pro-slavery extremist [63] counseled Secretary Upshur that British designs on American slavery were real and required immediate action to preempt a takeover of Texas by Great Britain. When Tyler confirmed in September that the British Foreign Secretary Aberdeen had encouraged dtente between Mexico and Texas, allegedly pressing Mexico to maneuver Texas towards emancipation of its slaves, Tyler acted at once.[64][65] On September 18, 1843, in consultation with Secretary Upshur, he ordered secret talks opened with Texas Minister to the United States Isaac Van Zandt to negotiate the annexation of Texas.[66] Face-to-face negotiations commenced on October 16, 1843.[67]\\r\\nBy the summer of 1843 Sam Houston's Texas administration had returned to negotiations with the Mexican government to consider a rapprochement that would permit Texas self-governance, possibly as a state of Mexico, with Great Britain acting as mediator.[68][69] Texas officials felt compelled by the fact that the Tyler administration appeared unequipped to mount an effective campaign for Texas annexation.[70] With the 1844 general election in the United States approaching, the leadership in both the Democratic and Whig parties remained unequivocally anti-Texas.[71] Texas-Mexico treaty options under consideration included an autonomous Texas within Mexico's borders, or an independent republic with the provision that Texas should emancipate its slaves upon recognition.[72]\\r\\nVan Zandt, though he personally favored annexation by the United States, was not authorized to entertain any overtures from the US government on the subject. Texas officials were at the moment deeply engaged in exploring settlements with Mexican diplomats, facilitated by Great Britain. Texas's predominant concern was not British interference with the institution of slavery ÿ English diplomats had not alluded to the issue ÿ but the avoidance of any resumption of hostilities with Mexico.[73] Still, US Secretary of State Upshur vigorously courted Texas diplomats to begin annexation talks, finally dispatching an appeal to President Sam Houston in January 1844. In it, he assured Houston that, in contrast to previous attempts, the political climate in the United States, including sections of the North, was amenable to Texas statehood, and that a two-thirds majority in Senate could be obtained to ratify a Texas treaty.[74]\\r\\nTexans were hesitant to pursue a US-Texas treaty without a written commitment of military defense from America, since a full-scale military attack by Mexico seemed likely when the negotiations became public. If ratification of the annexation measure stalled in the US Senate, Texas could face a war alone against Mexico.[75] Because only Congress could declare war, the Tyler administration lacked the constitutional authority to commit the US to support of Texas. But when Secretary Upshur provided a verbal assurance of military defense, President Houston, responding to urgent calls for annexation from the Texas Congress of December 1843, authorized the reopening of annexation negotiations.[76]\\r\\nAs Secretary Upshur accelerated the secret treaty discussions, Mexican diplomats learned that US-Texas talks were taking place. Mexican minister to the U.S. Juan Almonte confronted Upshur with these reports, warning him that if Congress sanctioned a treaty of annexation, Mexico would break diplomatic ties and immediately declare war.[77] Secretary Upshur evaded and dismissed the charges, and pressed forward with the negotiations.[78] In tandem with moving forward with Texas diplomats, Upshur was secretly lobbying US Senators to support annexation, providing lawmakers with persuasive arguments linking Texas acquisition to national security and domestic peace. By early 1844, Upshur was able to assure Texas officials that 40 of the 52 members of the Senate were pledged to ratify the Tyler-Texas treaty, more than the two-thirds majority required for passage.[79] Tyler, in his annual address to Congress in December 1843, maintained his silence on the secret treaty, so as not to damage relations with the wary Texas diplomats.[80] Throughout, Tyler did his utmost to keep the negotiations secret, making no public reference to his administration's single-minded quest for Texas.[81]\\r\\nThe Tyler-Texas treaty was in its final stages when its chief architects, Secretary Upshur and Secretary of the Navy Thomas W. Gilmer, died in an accident aboard USS Princeton on February 28, 1844, just a day after achieving a preliminary treaty draft agreement with the Texas Republic.[82] The Princeton disaster proved a major setback for Texas annexation, in that Tyler expected Secretary Upshur to elicit critical support from Whig and Democratic Senators during the upcoming treaty ratification process.[83] Tyler selected John C. Calhoun to replace Upshur as Secretary of State and to finalize the treaty with Texas. The choice of Calhoun, a highly regarded but controversial American statesman,[84] risked introducing a politically polarizing element into the Texas debates, but Tyler prized him as a strong advocate of annexation.[85][86]\\r\\nWith the Tyler-Upshur secret annexation negotiations with Texas near consummation, Senator Robert J. Walker of Mississippi, a key Tyler ally, issued a widely distributed and highly influential letter, reproduced as a pamphlet, making the case for immediate annexation.[87] In it, Walker argued that Texas could be acquired by Congress in a number of ways ÿ all constitutional ÿ and that the moral authority to do so was based on the precepts for territorial expansion established by Jefferson and Madison, and promulgated as doctrine by Monroe in 1823.[88] Senator Walker's polemic offered analysis on the significance of Texas with respect to slavery and race. He envisioned Texas as a corridor through which both free and enslaved African-Americans could be \\"diffused\\" southward in a gradual exodus that would ultimately supply labor to the Central American tropics, and in time, empty the United States of its slave population.[89]\\r\\nThis \\"safety-valve\\" theory \\"appealed to the racial fears of northern whites\\" who dreaded the prospect of absorbing emancipated slaves into their communities in the event that the institution of slavery collapsed in the South.[90] This scheme for racial cleansing was consistent, on a pragmatic level, with proposals for overseas colonization of blacks, which were pursued by a number of American presidents, from Jefferson to Lincoln.[91] Walker bolstered his position by raising national security concerns, warning that in the event annexation failed, imperialist Great Britain would maneuver the Republic of Texas into emancipating its slaves, forecasting a dangerous destabilizing influence on southwestern slaveholding states. The pamphlet characterized abolitionists as traitors who conspired with the British to overthrow the United States.[92][93]\\r\\nA variation of the Tyler's \\"diffusion\\" theory, it played on economic fears in a period when slave-based staple crop markets had not yet recovered from the Panic of 1837. The Texas \\"escape route\\" conceived by Walker promised to increase demand for slaves in fertile cotton-growing regions of Texas, as well as the monetary value of slaves. Cash-poor plantation owners in the older eastern South were promised a market for surplus slaves at a profit.[94] Texas annexation, wrote Walker, would eliminate all these dangers and \\"fortify the whole Union.\\"[95]\\r\\nWalker's pamphlet brought forth strident demands for Texas from pro-slavery expansionists in the South; in the North, it allowed anti-slavery expansionists to embrace Texas without appearing to be aligned with pro-slavery extremists.[96] His assumptions and analysis \\"shaped and framed the debates on annexation but his premises went largely unchallenged among the press and public.[97]\\r\\nThe Tyler-Texas treaty, signed on April 12, 1844, was framed to induct Texas into the Union as a territory, following constitutional protocols. To wit, Texas would cede all its public lands to the United States, and the federal government would assume all its bonded debt, up to $10 million. The boundaries of the Texas territory were left unspecified.[98] Four new states could ultimately be carved from the former republic ÿ three of them likely to become slave states.[99] Any allusion to slavery was omitted from the document so as not to antagonize anti-slavery sentiments during Senate debates, but it provided for the \\"preservation of all [Texas] property as secured in our domestic institutions.\\"[100]\\r\\nUpon the signing of the treaty, Tyler complied with the Texans' demand for military and naval protection, deploying troops to Fort Jesup in Louisiana and a fleet of warships to the Gulf of Mexico.[101] In the event that the Senate failed to pass the treaty, Tyler promised the Texas diplomats that he would officially exhort both houses of Congress to establish Texas as a state of the Union upon provisions authorized in the Constitution.[102] Tyler's cabinet was split on the administration's handling of the Texas agreement. Secretary of War William Wilkins praised the terms of annexation publicly, touting the economic and geostrategic benefits with relation to Great Britain.[103] Secretary of the Treasury John C. Spencer was alarmed at the constitutional implications of Tyler's application of military force without congressional approval, a violation of the separation of powers. Refusing to transfer contingency funds for the naval mobilization, he resigned.[104]\\r\\nTyler submitted his treaty for annexation to the Senate, delivered April 22, 1844, where a two-thirds majority was required for ratification.[105][106] Secretary of State Calhoun (assuming his post March 29, 1844)[107] had sent a letter to British minister Richard Packenham denouncing British anti-slavery interference in Texas. He included the Packenham Letter with the Tyler bill, intending to create a sense of crisis in Southern Democrats.[108] In it, he characterized slavery as a social blessing and the acquisition of Texas as an emergency measure necessary to safeguard the \\"peculiar institution\\" in the United States.[109] In doing so, Tyler and Calhoun sought to unite the South in a crusade that would present the North with an ultimatum: support Texas annexation or lose the South.[110]\\r\\nPresident Tyler expected that his treaty would be debated secretly in Senate executive session.[111] However, less than a week after debates opened, the treaty, its associated internal correspondence, and the Packenham letter were leaked to the public. The nature of the Tyler-Texas negotiations caused a national outcry, in that \\"the documents appeared to verify that the sole objective of Texas annexation was the preservation of slavery.\\"[112] A mobilization of anti-annexation forces in the North strengthened both major parties' hostility toward Tyler's agenda. The leading presidential hopefuls of both parties, Democrat Martin Van Buren and Whig Henry Clay, publicly denounced the treaty.[113] Texas annexation and the reoccupation of Oregon territory emerged as the central issues in the 1844 general election.[114]\\r\\nIn response, Tyler, already ejected from the Whig party, quickly began to organize a third party in hopes of inducing the Democrats to embrace a pro-expansionist platform.[115] By running as a third-party candidate, Tyler threatened to siphon off pro-annexation Democratic voters; Democratic party disunity would mean the election of Henry Clay, a staunchly anti-Texas Whig.[116] Pro-annexation delegates among southern Democrats, with assistance from a number of northern delegates, blocked anti-expansion candidate Martin Van Buren at the convention, which instead nominated the pro-expansion champion of Manifest Destiny, James K. Polk of Tennessee. Polk unified his party under the banner of Texas and Oregon acquisition.[117]\\r\\nIn August 1844, in the midst of the campaign, Tyler withdrew from the race. The Democratic Party was by then unequivocally committed to Texas annexation, and Tyler, assured by Polk's envoys that as President he would effect Texas annexation, urged his supporters to vote Democratic.[118] Polk narrowly defeated Whig Henry Clay in the November election.[119] The victorious Democrats were poised to acquire Texas under President-elect Polk's doctrine of Manifest Destiny,[120] rather than on the pro-slavery agenda of Tyler and Calhoun.[121]\\r\\nAs a treaty document with a foreign nation, the Tyler-Texas annexation treaty required the support of a two-thirds majority in the Senate for passage. But in fact, when the Senate voted on the measure on June 8, 1844, fully two-thirds voted against the treaty (16ÿ35).[122] The vote went largely along party lines: Whigs had opposed it almost unanimously (1ÿ27), while Democrats split, but voted overwhelmingly in favor (15ÿ8).[123] The election campaign had hardened partisan positions on Texas among Democrats.[124] Tyler had anticipated that the measure would fail, due largely to the divisive effects of Secretary Calhoun's Packenham letter.[125] Undeterred, he formally asked the House of Representatives to consider other constitutional means to authorize passage of the treaty. Congress adjourned before debating the matter.[126]\\r\\nThe same Senate that had rejected the TylerÿCalhoun treaty by a margin of 2:1 in June 1844[127] reassembled in December 1844 in a short lame-duck session.[128] (Though pro-annexation Democrats had made gains in the fall elections, those legislators ÿ the 29th Congress ÿ would not assume office until March 1845.)[129] Lame-duck President Tyler, still trying to annex Texas in the final months of his administration, wished to avoid another overwhelming Senate rejection of his treaty.[130] In his annual address to Congress on December 4, he declared the Polk victory a mandate for Texas annexation[131] and proposed that Congress adopt a joint resolution procedure by which simple majorities in each house could secure ratification for the Tyler treaty.[132] This method would avoid the constitutional requirement of a two-thirds majority in the Senate.[133] Bringing the House of Representatives into the equation boded well for Texas annexation, as the pro-annexation Democratic Party possessed nearly a 2:1 majority in that chamber.[134][135]\\r\\nBy resubmitting the discredited treaty through a House-sponsored bill, the Tyler administration reignited sectional hostilities over Texas admission.[136] Both northern Democratic and southern Whig Congressmen had been bewildered by local political agitation in their home states during the 1844 presidential campaigns.[137] Now, northern Democrats found themselves vulnerable to charges of appeasement of their southern wing if they capitulated to Tyler's slavery expansion provisions. On the other hand, Manifest Destiny enthusiasm in the north placed politicians under pressure to admit Texas immediately to the Union.[138]\\r\\nConstitutional objections were raised in House debates as to whether both houses of Congress could constitutionally authorize admission of territories, rather than states. Moreover, if the Republic of Texas, a nation in its own right, were admitted as a state, its territorial boundaries, property relations (including slave property), debts and public lands would require a Senate-ratified treaty.[139] Democrats were particularly uneasy about burdening the United States with $10 million in Texas debt, resenting the deluge of speculators, who had bought Texas bonds cheap and now lobbied Congress for the Texas House bill.[140] House Democrats, at an impasse, relinquished the legislative initiative to the southern Whigs.[141]\\r\\nAnti-Texas Whig legislators had lost more than the White House in the general election of 1844. In the southern states of Tennessee and Georgia, Whig strongholds in the 1840 general election, voter support dropped precipitously due to the pro-annexation excitement in the Deep South ÿ and Clay lost every Deep South state to Polk.[142] Northern Whigs' uncompromising hostility to slavery expansion increasingly characterized the party, and southern members, by association, had suffered from charges of being \\"soft on Texas, therefore soft on slavery\\" by Southern Democrats.[143] Facing congressional and gubernatorial races in 1845 in their home states, a number of Southern Whigs sought to erase that impression with respect to the Tyler-Texas bill.[144][145]\\r\\nSouthern Whigs in the Congress, including Representative Milton Brown and Senator Ephraim Foster, both of Tennessee, and Representative Alexander Stephens of Georgia[146] collaborated to introduce a House amendment on January 13, 1845[147] that was designed to enhance slaveowner gains in Texas beyond those offered by the Democratic-sponsored Tyler-Calhoun treaty bill.[148] The legislation proposed to recognize Texas as a slave state which would retain all its vast public lands, as well as its bonded debt accrued since 1836. Furthermore, the Brown amendment would delegate to the U.S. government responsibility for negotiating the disputed Texas-Mexico boundary. The issue was a critical one, as the size of Texas would be immensely increased if the international border were set at the Rio Grande River, with its headwaters in the Rocky Mountains, rather than the traditionally recognized boundary at the Nueces River, 100 miles to the north.[149] While the Tyler-Calhoun treaty provided for the organization of a total of four states from the Texas lands ÿ three likely to qualify as slave states ÿ Brown's plan would permit Texas state lawmakers to configure a total of five states from its western region, south of the 3630' Missouri Compromise line, each pre-authorized to permit slavery upon statehood, if Texas designated them as such.[150]\\r\\nPolitically, the Brown amendment was designed to portray Southern Whigs as \\"even more ardent champions of slavery and the South, than southern Democrats.\\"[151] The bill also served to distinguish them from their northern Whig colleagues who cast the controversy, as Calhoun did, in strictly pro- versus anti-slavery terms.[152] While almost all Northern Whigs spurned Brown's amendment, the Democrats quickly co-opted the legislation, providing the votes necessary to attach the proviso to Tyler's joint resolution, by a 118ÿ101 vote.[153] Southern Democrats supported the bill almost unanimously (59ÿ1), while Northern Democrats split strongly in favor (50ÿ30). Eight of eighteen Southern Whigs cast their votes in favor. Northern Whigs unanimously rejected it.[154] The House proceeded to approve the amended Texas treaty 120ÿ98 on January 25, 1845.[155] The vote in the House had been one in which party affiliation prevailed over sectional allegiance.[156] The bill was forwarded the same day to the Senate for debate.\\r\\nBy early February 1845, when the Senate began to debate the Brown-amended Tyler treaty, its passage seemed unlikely, as support was \\"perishing\\".[157] The partisan alignments in the Senate were near parity, 28ÿ24, slightly in favor of the Whigs.[158] The Senate Democrats would require undivided support among their colleagues, and three or more Whigs who would be willing to cross party lines to pass the House-amended treaty. The fact that Senator Foster had drafted the House amendment under consideration improved prospects of Senate passage.[159]\\r\\nAnti-annexation Senator Thomas Hart Benton of Missouri had been the only Southern Democrat to vote against the Tyler-Texas measure in June 1844.[160][161] His original proposal for an annexed Texas had embodied a national compromise, whereby Texas would be divided in two, half slave-soil and half free-soil.[162] As pro-annexation sentiment grew in his home state, Benton retreated from this compromise offer.[163] By February 5, 1845, in the early debates on the Brown-amended House bill, he advanced an alternative resolution that, unlike the Brown scenario, made no reference whatsoever to the ultimate free-slave apportionment of an annexed Texas and simply called for five bipartisan commissioners to resolve border disputes with Texas and Mexico and set conditions for the Lone Star Republic's acquisition by the United States.[164]\\r\\nThe Benton proposal was intended to calm northern anti-slavery Democrats (who wished to eliminate the Tyler-Calhoun treaty altogether, as it had been negotiated on behalf of the slavery expansionists), and allow the decision to devolve upon the soon-to-be-inaugurated Democratic President-elect James K. Polk.[165] President-elect Polk had expressed his ardent wish that Texas annexation should be accomplished before he entered Washington in advance of his inauguration on March 4, 1845, the same day Congress would end its session.[166] With his arrival in the capital, he discovered the Benton and Brown factions in the Senate \\"paralyzed\\" over the Texas annexation legislation.[167] On the advice of his soon-to-be Secretary of the Treasury Robert J. Walker, Polk urged Senate Democrats to unite under a dual resolution that would include both the Benton and Brown versions of annexation, leaving enactment of the legislation to Polk's discretion when he took office.[168] In private and separate talks with supporters of both the Brown and Benton plans, Polk left each side with the \\"impression he would administer their [respective] policy. Polk meant what he said to Southerners and meant to appear friendly to the Van Burenite faction.\\"[169] Polk's handling of the matter had the effect of uniting Senate northern Democrats in favor of the dual alternative treaty bill.[170]\\r\\nOn February 27, 1845, less than a week before Polk's inauguration, the Senate voted 27ÿ25 to admit Texas, based on the Tyler protocols of simple majority passage. All twenty-four Democrats voted for the measure, joined by three southern Whigs.[171] Benton and his allies were assured that Polk would act to establish the eastern portion of Texas as a slave state; the western section was to remain unorganized territory, not committed to slavery. On this understanding, the northern Democrats had conceded their votes for the dichotomous bill.[172] The next day, in an almost strict party line vote, the Benton-Milton measure was passed in the Democrat-controlled House of Representatives.[173] President Tyler signed the bill the following day, March 1, 1845 (Joint Resolution for annexing Texas to the United States, J.Res. 8, enacted March 1, 1845, 5?Stat.?797).[174]\\r\\nSenate and house legislators who had favored Benton's renegotiated version of the Texas annexation bill had been assured that President Tyler would sign the joint house measure, but leave its implementation to the incoming Polk administration.[175] But, during his last day in office, President Tyler, with the urging of his Secretary of State Calhoun,[176] decided to act decisively to improve the odds for the immediate annexation of Texas. On March 3, 1845, with his cabinet's assent, he dispatched an offer of annexation to the Republic of Texas by courier, exclusively under the terms of the BrownÿFoster option of the joint house measure.[177] Secretary Calhoun apprised President-elect Polk of the action, who demurred without comment.[178][179] Tyler justified his preemptive move on the grounds that Polk was likely to come under pressure to abandon immediate annexation and reopen negotiations under the Benton alternative.[180]\\r\\nWhen President Polk took office on March 4, he was in a position to recall Tyler's dispatch to Texas and reverse his decision. On March 10, after conferring with his cabinet, Polk upheld Tyler's action and allowed the courier to proceed with the offer of immediate annexation to Texas.[181] The only modification was to exhort Texans to accept the annexation terms unconditionally.[182] Polk's decision was based on his concern that a protracted negotiation by US commissioners would expose annexation efforts to foreign intrigue and interference.[183] While Polk kept his annexation endeavors confidential, Senators passed a resolution requesting formal disclosure of the administration's Texas policy. Polk stalled, and when the Senate special session had adjourned on March 20, 1845, no names for US commissioners to Texas had been submitted by him. Polk denied charges from Senator Benton that he had misled Benton on his intention to support the new negotiations option, declaring \\"if any such pledges were made, it was in a total misconception of what I said or meant.\\"[184]\\r\\nOn May 5, 1845, Texas President Jones called for a convention on July 4, 1845, to consider the annexation and a constitution.[185] On June 23, the Texan Congress accepted the US Congress's joint resolution of March 1, 1845, annexing Texas to the United States, and consented to the convention.[186] On July 4, the Texas convention debated the annexation offer and almost unanimously passed an ordinance assenting to it.[187] The convention remained in session through August 28, and adopted the Constitution of Texas on August 27, 1845.[188] The citizens of Texas approved the annexation ordinance and new constitution on October 13, 1845.[citation needed]\\r\\nPresident Polk signed the legislation making the former Lone Star Republic a state of the Union on December 29, 1845 (Joint Resolution for the admission of the state of Texas into the Union, J.Res. 1, enacted December 29, 1845, 9?Stat.?108).[189] Texas formally relinquished its sovereignty to the United States on February 14, 1846.[190]\\r\\nThe joint resolution and ordinance of annexation have no language specifying the boundaries of Texas, but only refer in general terms to \\"the territory properly included within, and rightfully belonging to the Republic of Texas\\", and state that the new State of Texas is to be formed \\"subject to the adjustment by this [U.S.] government of all questions of boundary that may arise with other governments.\\" According to George Lockhart Rives, \\"That treaty had been expressly so framed as to leave the boundaries of Texas undefined, and the joint resolution of the following winter was drawn in the same manner. It was hoped that this might open the way to a negotiation, in the course of which the whole subject of the boundaries of Mexico, from the Gulf to the Pacific, might be reconsidered, but these hopes came to nothing.\\"[191]\\r\\nThere was an ongoing border dispute between the Republic of Texas and Mexico prior to annexation. Texas claimed the Rio Grande as its border based on the Treaties of Velasco, while Mexico maintained that it was the Nueces River and did not recognize Texan independence. In November 1845, President James K. Polk sent John Slidell, a secret representative, to Mexico City with a monetary offer to the Mexican government for the disputed land and other Mexican territories. Mexico was not inclined nor able to negotiate due to instability in the government[192] and popular nationalistic sentiment against such a sale.[193] Slidell returned to the United States, and Polk ordered General Zachary Taylor to garrison the southern border of Texas, as defined by the former Republic, in 1846. Taylor moved into Texas, ignoring Mexican demands to withdraw, and marched as far south as the Rio Grande, where he began to build a fort near the river's mouth on the Gulf of Mexico. The Mexican government regarded this action as a violation of its sovereignty, and immediately prepared for war. Following a United States victory and the signing of the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, Mexico ceded its claims to Texas and the Rio Grande border was accepted by both nations.\\r\\nThe formal controversy over the legality of the annexation of Texas stems from the fact that Congress approved the annexation of Texas as a state, rather than a territory, with simple majorities in each house, instead of annexing the land by Senate treaty, as was done with Native American lands. Tyler's extralegal joint resolution maneuver in 1844 exceeded strict constructionist precepts, but was passed by Congress in 1845 as part of a compromise bill. The success of the joint house Texas annexation set a precedent that would be applied to Hawaii's annexation in 1897.[194]\\r\\nRepublican President Benjamin Harrison (1889ÿ1893) attempted, in 1893, to annex Hawaii through a Senate treaty. When this failed, he was asked to consider the Tyler joint house precedent; he declined. Democratic President Grover Cleveland (1893ÿ1897) did not pursue the annexation of Hawaii. When President William McKinley took office in 1897, he quickly revived expectations among territorial expansionists when he resubmitted legislation to acquire Hawaii. When the two-thirds Senate support was not forthcoming, committees in the House and Senate explicitly invoked the Tyler precedent for the joint house resolution, which was successfully applied to approve the annexation of Hawaii in July 1898.[195]","input":"When was texas annexed by the united states?"},{"output":"in 2014","context":"Notre Dame Stadium is an outdoor football stadium in Notre Dame, Indiana, the home field of the University of Notre Dame Fighting Irish. It is located on the university's campus and also hosts commencement.\\r\\n\\r\\nOpened 88?years ago on October 4, 1930, the stadium seating capacity was nearly 60,000 for decades. More than 21,000 seats were added for the 1997 season, which increased the capacity to over 80,000. After the Campus Crossroads renovation, the seat number decreased to 77,622. The playing surface was changed to FieldTurf in 2014, after 84 seasons on natural grass.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe stadium opened its gates on October 4, 1930, replacing Cartier Field. The total cost of construction exceeded  $750,000 and the original seating capacity was 54,000. Head coach Knute Rockne played a key role in its design, keeping the space between the playing field and the stands to a minimum. The stadium is patterned, on a smaller scale, after Michigan Stadium, the main difference being the tunnel location. In 1929, plans were started by Osborn Engineering of Cleveland, selected for their experience in designing Yankee Stadium and Fenway Park. The original stadium held 59,075 people, measured a half-mile (800 m) in circumference, stood 45 feet (14?m) high, and featured a glass-enclosed press box rising 60 feet (18?m) above ground level. Initial stands reached 55 rows.[2] The building was built by the Sollitt Construction Company of South Bend. Earth preparation began in the fall of 1929, but due to an unusually cold fall and winter, above ground construction did not begin until April 2, 1930.  This building was effectively built in six months. Over two million bricks were used in the construction of the walls and the concrete was placed in a monolithic continuous placement by section.  There were over 300 workers on the site at most times and they worked five 10-hour days and one six-hour day on Saturdays. The average worker was paid one dollar a day plus lunch with the more skilled workers earning up to five dollars a day.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe construction of the stadium project was brought to a head by the actions of Knute Rockne. The 1928  season had not been a stellar one for the football team, but the net profits from football for that season approached $500,000.  Rockne was frustrated with the slow and cautious Holy Cross priests and their decision making process about spending money on the new stadium.  Rockne could not believe that a decision could not be made when there was such a large amount of money in the bank.  Because of this and a number of other issues, Rockne submitted his resignation to Father ODonnell, the president of the university.  ODonnell knew of Rocknes history of submitting his resignations and he also knew that nothing would ever completely satisfy Rockne. ODonnell was willing to find a compromise but was also unwilling to put the university in debt to finance the stadium.  He knew that the excess receipts from 1928 season and the projected receipts from playing all the away games in 1929 on neutral fields would bring adequate cash into the university to finance the construction of the stadium.  ODonnell also devised the scheme to finance 240 six-person reserved box seats.  This precursor of the personal seat license would allow the buyer to purchase tickets at face value and guarantee the same prime location for 10 years for an investment of $3,000 between the 45-yard lines, $2,500 between the 45 and 35-yard line and $2,000 between the 35 and the 25-yard line.  The university raised over $150,000 on this idea alone.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Irish played their first game in the new stadium in 1930 on October 4, beating SMU 20ÿ14. The first Notre Dame touchdown in the stadium was scored by \\"Jumping Joe\\" Savoldi on a 98-yard kickoff return. The official dedication was a week later on October 11 against Navy, and Savoldi scored three touchdowns and was cited as \\"the first hero in the lore of Notre Dame Stadium.\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAs originally built, the stadium seated 54,000 people. However, with temporary bleachers, it could hold as many as 61,000 people. By 1966, its capacity increased to 59,075, mainly by changing the average seat width from 18 to 17 inches (45.7 to 43.2?cm). In 1997, 21,000 new seats were added to the stadium, bringing the seating capacity to the present 80,795. The playing surface had always been natural grass through 2013, but it was announced on April 12, 2014, that after the commencement weekend, the playing field would be replaced with FieldTurf, an infilled artificial turf.[5] Notre Dame athletic director Jack Swarbrick, in making the announcement, cited recent difficulties with maintaining an acceptable grass surface, and added that the change would allow the stadium to be used for football practices and non-football events.[5] During 2013, the university replaced the grass surface four times, including twice during the football season.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn January 29, 2014, the university announced plans to attach three new buildings to the stadium, totaling more than 750,000 square feet in expansions and costing about $400 million, with a timetable of 33 months for completion. According to a published statement by university president John I. Jenkins, \\"the integrated nature of this project will maintain the compact walkability of campus, facilitate deeper connection and collaboration across the various units of the university, and offer an exciting addition\\" to the campus.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe FieldTurf installation, as scheduled, began after Commencement Weekend on May 16ÿ18, and the university sold 2-by-5-foot (61 by 152?cm) sections of the old turf to the public for $150 each.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nPrior to the 1997 expansion, Notre Dame Stadium lacked permanent field lights. In 1982, portable lighting by Musco Lighting was used for the first night game in the stadium's history on September 18 versus Michigan. Permanent lights were installed as part of the expansion. The lights were paid for by NBC, which has held the exclusive television rights to all home games since 1991. The permanent lights were added primarily to ensure sufficient lighting for mid-afternoon games in November; the university's agreements with NBC from 1991 to 2010 stipulated that there be no home night games.[8] However, the stadium hosted its first night game in 21 years on October 22, 2011 when the Irish hosted USC.[9] It was announced in 2015 that Musco would be installing a LED field lighting system as part of the 2014ÿ2017 stadium renovation and expansion project.[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe stadium is known for its view of \\"Touchdown Jesus\\", a nickname given to the large mural  entitled The Word of Life by Millard Sheets of the resurrected Jesus.[11] Installed in 1964 on the Hesburgh Library, the mosaic wall looms over the stadium. The mural's nickname is derived from Jesus' upraised arms, which are similar in appearance to the raised arms of a referee signifying a touchdown. The expansion of the stadium in the late 1990s partially obscured the view of the mural from the playing field. The Word of Life mural was a gift of Mr. and Mrs. Howard V. Phalin of Winnetka, Illinois.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn January 2014, the University announced a $ 400 million dollar enhancement of the stadium, the Campus Crossroads project. This expansion will feature 3, 8-story high buildings, on the south, west and east sides of the stadium. The expansion will add more than 750,000 square feet of teaching, research, and performance space. The enhancement will also add new premium stadium seats.\\r\\nThe three buildings are called the Duncan Student Center on the west, O'Neill Hall on the south, and Corbett Family Hall on the east.\\r\\n\\r\\nPrior to 1966, attendance figures were based on an actual count of patrons through the gates. The largest crowd to attend a home game prior to expansion was 61,296 in 1962, against Purdue on October 6. Since 1966, attendance figures have been based on paid admissions with a fixed number of tickets available, accounting for the familiar 59,075 figure through the 1996 season. Until Ara Parseghian arrived as coach at Notre Dame in 1964, sellouts were not the norm. Since then, tickets for Notre Dame football have been notoriously hard to come by. As of the end of the 2015 season, there have been 249 consecutive sellouts at Notre Dame Stadium, and 294 sellouts in the past 295 games dating back to 1964. The lone exception was a 1973 game against Air Force which had been moved midseason by ABC to Thanksgiving Day and was played with the students absent. The announced attendance was 57,235. Attendance at all five home games in 1965 exceeded 59,000 as well.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe official capacity was listed at 80,225 when the stadium was first expanded. A subsequent computer revision put it at 80,012 in 1998 and 80,232 in 2000. Sideline bleachers, which had been removed during expansion, were put back in after a few years, bringing the figure to its present 80,795 in 2001.\\r\\nIn January 2014 the University of Notre Dame announced the campus crossroads project. A $400 million renovation would add luxury boxes and increase the stadium's capacity to around 85,000, but after the project was completed the seats were made wider and the number decreased to 77,622.[12] The project began after the conclusion of the 2014 football season and finished in time for the 2017 season.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe stadium is scheduled to host the 2019 NHL Winter Classic on New Years' Day between the Chicago Blackhawks and Boston Bruins.\\r\\nOn October 20, 2018, the stadium hosted Garth Brooks as the very first concert in the stadium. It is the first stop on his stadium tour, and it was also announced during the concert that he would also end his tour at Notre Dame Stadium.","input":"When did notre dame go to artificial turf?"},{"output":"the United States","context":"The History of Hip-Hop dance encompasses the people and events since the late 1970s that have contributed to the development of the early hip-hop dance moves, such as uprock, breaking, locking, roboting, boogaloo, and popping. Black Americans and Latino Americans created uprock and breaking in New York City. Black Americans in California created locking, roboting, boogaloo, and poppingcollectively referred to as the funk styles. All of these dance styles are different stylistically. They share common ground in their street origins and in their improvisational nature.\\r\\nMore than 50 years old, hip-hop dance became widely known after the first professional street-based dance crews formed in the 1970s in the United States. The most influential groups were Rock Steady Crew, New York City Breakers, The Lockers, and The Electric Boogaloos who are responsible for the spread of breaking, locking, and popping respectively. The Brooklyn-based dance style uprock influenced breaking early in its development. Boogaloo gained more exposure because it is the namesake of the Electric Boogaloos crew. Uprock, roboting, and boogaloo are respected dance styles but none of them are as mainstream or popular as breaking, locking, and popping.\\r\\nParallel with the evolution of hip-hop music, hip-hop social dancing emerged from breaking and the funk styles into different forms. Dances from the 1990s such as the Running Man, the Worm, and the Cabbage Patch entered the mainstream and became fad dances. After the millennium, newer social dances such as the Cha Cha Slide and the Dougie also caught on and became very popular.\\r\\nHip-hop dance is not a studio-derived style. Street dancers developed it in urban neighborhoods without a formal process. All of the early substyles and social dances were brought about through a combination of events including inspiration from James Brown, DJ Kool Herc's invention of the break beat, the formation of dance crews, and Don Cornelius' creation of the television show Soul Train.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to hip-hop activist Afrika Bambaataa[1] and b-boy Richard \\"Crazy Legs\\" Col܇n,[2] the purest hip-hop dance style, breaking (commonly called \\"breakdancing\\"), began in the early 1970s as elaborations on how James Brown danced to his song \\"Get on the Good Foot\\".[3] People mimicked these moves in their living rooms, in hallways, and at parties. It was at these parties that breaking flourished and developed with the help of a young Clive Campbell. Campbell, better known as DJ Kool Herc, was a Jamaican-born DJ who frequently spun records at neighborhood teenage parties in the Bronx.[4] Jeff Chang, in his book Can't Stop Won't Stop (2005), describes DJ Kool Herc's eureka moment in this way:\\r\\nIn response to this revelation, Herc developed the Merry-Go-Round technique to extend the breaksthe percussion interludes or instrumental solos within a longer work of music.[6] When he played a break on one turntable, he repeated the same break on the second turntable as soon as the first was finished. He then looped these records one after the other in order to extend the break as long as he wanted: \\"And once they heard that, that was it, wasn't no turning back,\\" Herc told Chang. \\"They always wanted to hear breaks after breaks after breaks after breaks.\\" It was during these times that the dancers, later known as break-boys or b-boys, would perform what is known as breaking.[5]\\r\\nBreaking started out strictly as toprock, footwork-oriented dance moves performed while standing up.[7] Toprock usually serves as the opening to a breaker's performance before transitioning into other dance moves performed on the floor. A separate dance style that influenced toprock is uprock, also called rocking or Brooklyn uprock, because it comes from Brooklyn, New York.[8] The uprock dance style has its roots in gangs.[2][9] Although it looks similar to toprock, uprock is danced with a partner[10] and is more aggressive, involving fancy footwork, shuffles, hitting motions, and movements that mimic fighting.[7] When there was an issue over turf, the two warlords of the feuding gangs would uprock, and whoever won this preliminary dance battle decided where the real fight would be.[1][2] Because uprock's purpose was to moderate gang violence, it never crossed over into mainstream breaking as seen today, except for some specific moves adopted by breakers who use it as a variation for their toprock.[11]\\r\\nAside from James Brown and uprock, hip-hop historian Jorge \\"Popmaster Fabel\\" Pabon writes that toprock was also influenced by \\"tap dance, Lindy hop, salsa, Afro-Cuban, and various African and Native American dances.\\"[12] From toprock, breaking progressed to being more floor-oriented, involving freezes, downrock, head spins, and windmills.[13][note 1] These additions occurred due to influences from 1970s martial arts films,[15] influences from gymnastics, and the formation of dance crews[16]teams of street dancers who get together to develop new moves, create dance routines, and battle other crews. One b-boy move taken from gymnastics is called the flare, which was made famous by gymnast Kurt Thomas and is called the \\"Thomas flair\\" in gymnastics.[17]\\r\\nB-boys Jamie \\"Jimmy D\\" White and Santiago \\"Jo Jo\\" Torres founded Rock Steady Crew (RSC) in 1977 in the Bronx.[18] Along with Dynamic Rockers and Afrika Bambaataa's Mighty Zulu Kings, they are one of the oldest continually active breaking crews.[note 2] For others to get into the crew, they had to battle one of the Rock Steady b-boysthat was their audition, so to speak.[20] The crew flourished once it came under the leadership of b-boy Richard \\"Crazy Legs\\" Col܇n. Crazy Legs opened a Manhattan chapter of the crew and made his friends and fellow b-boys Wayne \\"Frosty Freeze\\" Frost[note 3] and Kenneth \\"Ken Swift\\" Gabbert co-vice presidents.[20] RSC was instrumental in the spread of breaking's popularity beyond New York City. They appeared in Wild Style and Beat Street1980s films about hip-hop cultureas well as in the movie Flashdance.[note 4] They also performed at the Ritz, at the Kennedy Center, and on the Jerry Lewis Telethon.[20] In 1981, the Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts hosted a breaking battle between Dynamic Rockers and Rock Steady Crew.[23] The Daily News and National Geographic covered this event.[24] In 1982, their manager Ruza \\"Kool Lady\\" Blue organized the New York City Rap Tour, which featured Rock Steady Crew, Afrika Bambaataa, Cold Crush Brothers, the Double Dutch Girls, and Fab 5 Freddy.[25] This tour traveled to England and France, which spread hip-hop culture to these countries.[23][25] In 1983, they performed for Queen Elizabeth II at the Royal Variety Performance.[20] The following year, they recorded a song titled \\"(Hey You) The Rock Steady Crew\\", which was commercially released.[26] RSC now has satellite crews based in Japan, the United Kingdom, and Italy.[20]\\r\\nCapoeira is an Afro-Brazilian martial art, described by Pabon as \\"a form of self defense disguised as a dance.\\"[27] Its influence on breaking is disputed and debated; one side believes that breaking came from capoeira, while the other side denies this. Capoeira is hundreds of years older than breaking, and uprock is similar in purpose to capoeira in that both translate aggressive combat movements into stylized dance. Both breaking and capoeira are performed to music and, since both art forms are acrobatic, some moves look similar to each other. However, capoeira is more rule-oriented. One rule in capoeira is that a capoeirista's back can never touch the ground.[28][29] In contrast, a breaker's back is almost always on the ground, and the only rule in breaking is that you do not touch your opponent during a battle.[30]\\r\\nJelon Vieira and Lorel Machado brought capoeira to the United States in the 1970s.[31] Throughout this decade Vieira taught capoeira workshops in New York City and started a capoeira performance company called Dance Brazil that toured across the United States.[31] In Gerard Taylor's Capoeira: The Jogo de Angola from Luanda to Cyberspace (2005), master capoeira teacher Mestre Acordeon is quoted as saying: \\"Demonstrations by Maestre Jelon [Vieira] and Leromil Machado are considered by many to be responsible for the incorporation of capoeira movements into breakdancing.\\"[29] Former Village Voice reporter Sally Banes and her colleague, photographer Martha Cooper, witnessed breaking in 1980 while covering Henry Chalfant's photography exhibit of subway graffiti. She wrote of the dance: \\"Its spatial level called to mind capoeira, the spectacular Brazilian dance cum martial art form that incorporates kartwheels, kicks, and feints low to the ground, but the two were dissimilar enough in shape and timing that capoeira seemed at most only a distant relative, and certainly one the breakdancers weren't acquainted withat least on a conscious level.\\"[32] In his book Hip Hop Had a Dream (2008), Damien Morgan states: \\"Breakdancing can have its origins in capoeira, because it does not focus on injuring the opponent; it rather emphasizes skill towards your opponent, to express yourself away from violence... in most cases, it is blatantly obvious to see some of Breakdancing's foundations in Capoeira.\\"[33]\\r\\nSeveral breaking practitioners and pioneers tend to side with the camp that does not believe breaking came from capoeira. B-boy Crazy Legs states: \\"We didn't know what the f-ck no capoeira was, man. We were in the ghetto!\\"[2] According to Pabon, \\"Unlike the popularity of the martial arts films, capoeira was not seen in the Bronx jams until the 1990s. Top rockin' seems to have developed gradually and unintentionally, leaving space for growth and new additions, until it evolved into a codified form.\\"[27] B-boy crew Spartanic Rockers adds: \\"Despite of [sic] many rumours and opinions Breaking didn't originate from Capoeira but during the last few years many moves, steps and freezes of this Brazilian (fight-) dance have inspired more and more B-Girls and B-Boys who integrated them into their dance.\\"[34] B-boy Ken Swift was breaking long before he saw capoeria: \\"In '78 I started [breaking] and I didn't see it [capoeira] til '92 ... I was around, tooI was in Brooklyn, Bronx, Queens, I went around and I didn't see it. What we saw was Kung Fuwe saw Kung Fu from the 42nd Street theaters. So those were our inspirations... when we did the Kung Fu sh-t we switched it up and we put this B-boy flavor into it...\\"[35]\\r\\nWhile breaking was developing in New York, other styles of dance were developing in California. Unlike breaking, the funk styleswhich originated in the 1970s in Californiawere not originally hip-hop dance styles: they were danced to funk music rather than hip-hop music, and they were not associated with the other cultural pillars of hip-hop (DJing, graffiti writing, and MCing).[36][37][38] The funk styles are actually slightly older than breaking due to fact that boogaloo and locking were developed in the late 1960s.[39][40]\\r\\nLike breaking, the different moves within the funk styles occurred due to the formation of crews. Don \\"Campbellock\\" Campbell created locking, and in 1973 founded The Lockers (originally called The Cambellock Dancers) in Los Angeles.[41][42] Locking is characterized by consistently freezing or \\"locking\\" in place while dancing. Campbell developed locking accidentally while pausing in between dance moves when trying to remember how to do the Funky Chicken.[43] He developed routines based on his new style using these pauses or \\"locks\\".[44] Chang lists some of the other dance moves performed in locking, including \\"...points, skeeters, scooby doos, stop 'n go, which-away, and the fancies.\\"[43]\\r\\nThe Lockers made several appearances on Soul Train[45]the song-and-dance television program featuring funk music, soul music, disco, R&B, and social dancing. They also appeared on The Carol Burnett Show,[46] The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson, The Dick Van Dyke Show, and Saturday Night Live.[27] Three original members of The Lockers were Toni Basil, who doubled as the group's manager; Charles \\"Charles Robot\\" Washington, a pioneer of roboting; and Fred \\"Mr. Penguin\\" Berry, who played the character of Rerun on the television show What's Happening!!.[47] Berry left the group in 1976 to be on the show and was replaced by street dancer Tony \\"Go-Go\\" Lewis.[47] After The Lockers disbanded, Tony Go-Go went on to open a locking school in Japan in 1985.[41]\\r\\nRoboting comes from Richmond, California.[27] Before joining The Lockers, Charles Robot had his own dance crew called The Robot Brothers.[48] He was inspired in 1969 by a mime artist named Robert Shields, who would pantomime in front of the Hollywood Wax Museum where he worked.[49] On October 27, 1973, The Jackson 5 performed \\"Dancing Machine\\" on Soul Train, which popularized roboting,[50] but this was not the first time the dance had been performed on the show. Charles Robot had performed roboting on Soul Train two years earlier with his dance partner Angela Johnson.[51]\\r\\nThe Electric Boogaloos are another funk styles crew founded in Fresno in 1977[44] by Sam \\"Boogaloo Sam\\" Solomon, Nate \\"Slide\\" Johnson, and Joe \\"Robot Joe\\" Thomas.[46] Their name was originally The Electric Boogaloo Lockers, but they dropped \\"Lockers\\" the following year[44] at the urging of their manager Jeff Kutash[52] after the group moved from Fresno to Long Beach.[53] Boogaloo Sam is widely credited with developing popping and boogaloo.[37][44][54] However, there is disagreement as to whether he created the dances himself or borrowed moves from other street dancers.[55][56] What is not contested is how influential he and his crew were in exposing popping and boogaloo to mainstream audiences.[55][57]\\r\\nBoogaloo is both a style of dance and a style of music.[58] It started out as a fad dance, and several songs were released in the 1960s celebrating it including \\"Boogaloo Down Broadway\\", \\"My Baby Likes to Boogaloo\\", \\"Hey You! Boo-Ga-Loo\\", \\"Do the Boogaloo\\", \\"Boogaloo #3\\", and \\"Sock Boogaloo\\".[39][40] In response to this song-and-dance craze, Puerto Rican artists in New York City created a style of music called Bugal~ (or Latin boogaloo) that combined mambo, soul, and R&B. Singer Joe Cuba was a pioneer of this style.[40][58]\\r\\nAlthough boogaloo was already a fad dance and a music genre in the 1960s, it did not become a dance style until Boogaloo Sam learned it, expanded it, and started performing it in public venues.[59] He was influenced to expand boogaloo by cartoons; the 1960s social dances the Twist, the Popcorn, and the Jerk; and the movements of everyday people.[27][46] As a dance style, it is characterized by rolling hip, knee, and head movements as if the body has no bones.[59] Electric boogaloo is the signature dance style of The Electric Boogaloos.[60] It is a combination of boogaloo and popping.[59]\\r\\nPopping is based on the technique of quickly contracting and relaxing muscles to cause a jerk in the dancer's body, referred to as a pop or a hit. Popping is also an inadvertent umbrella term that includes several other illusory dance styles such as ticking, liquid, tutting, waving, gliding, twisto-flex, and sliding.[38][44][54] Most of these cannot be traced to a specific person or group and may have influences earlier than hip-hop. Earl \\"Snake Hips\\" Tucker was a professional dancer in the 1920s who appeared in the film Symphony in Black and performed at the Cotton Club in Harlem.[61][62] Since hip-hop did not exist in the 1920s his style was considered jazz, but his \\"slithering, writhing\\" movement foreshadowed waving and sliding.[63]\\r\\nThe most recognizable popping move is the moonwalk. In 1983, Michael Jackson performed the moonwalkcalled the backslide in popping context[50] on ABC's Motown 25 television special.[64] This performance popularized the moonwalk all over the world.[65] However, it was not the first time the backslide had been performed on television or on film. Cab Calloway performed the backslide in 1932,[66][67] and Bill Bailey performed it in the movies Cabin in the Sky (1943) and Rhythm and Blues Revue (1955).[68] In 1982, during a performance in London on Top of the Pops, street dancer Jeffrey Daniel performed the backslide during the song \\"A Night to Remember\\".[69][70]\\r\\nIn the 1970s, while Los Angeles was known for locking and Fresno was known for popping, several other cities in Northern California had their own local funk styles. Sacramento was known for a style called sac-ing, San Jose for dime stopping, and Oakland for snake hitting.[27] The San Francisco crew Granny and Robotroid incorporated stepping moves and JROTC rifle drill movements in their dancing to make a unique funk style called Fillmore strutting. This dance was named after the Fillmore district in San Francisco where Granny and Robotroid were from.[71] Granny and Robotroid performed on the Gong Show in 1976.[72] Although strutting had exposure on national television, it (and the rest of the localized funk styles) faded and never became mainstream.\\r\\nWhen the movies Breakin' and Breakin' 2: Electric Boogaloo were released, all the styles of dance performed in those films were put under the \\"breakdance\\" label. In addition, Breakin was released outside the United States as Breakdance: The Movie.[73] The media followed suit by calling all represented styles \\"breakdancing\\", which caused a naming confusion among the general public.[27][59][74] This was problematic for two reasons.\\r\\nThe first reason is that \\"breakdancing\\" became an inadvertent umbrella term among the general public for both breaking and the funk styles. The funk styles were created in California independent from breaking, which was created in New York.[36][38] They are called funk styles because they were originally danced to funk music. This name gives them a separate identity from breaking, which is traditionally danced to break beats.[59]\\r\\nThe second reason this was problematic is that \\"breakdancing\\" was originally called b-boying or breaking by the street dancers who created it.[74][75] A break is a musical interlude during a songthe section on a musical recording where the singing stops and the percussive rhythms are the most aggressive. When 1970s hip-hop DJs played break beats, dancers reacted to those breaks with their most impressive dance moves.[75][76] DJ Kool Herc coined the terms \\"b-boys\\" and \\"b-girls\\", which stands for \\"break-boys\\" and \\"break-girls.\\"[75] To describe the movement, the suffix \\"ing\\" was added after the word identifying the dancer (b-boying) or the music beat (breaking). According to Timothy \\"Popin Pete\\" Solomon, one of the original members of the Electric Boogaloos, and Raquel Rivera, author of the book New York Ricans from the Hip Hop Zone (2003), \\"breakdancing\\" is a media-coined term and incorrect.[77][78]\\r\\nA dance crew is a team of street dancers who come together to develop new moves and battle other crews. As hip-hop culture spread throughout New York City, the more often breaking crews got together to battle against each other. It was during this time that the different dance moves within breaking developed organically.[16][note 5] All styles of hip-hop are rooted in battling,[79] and being a part of a crew was the only way to learn when these styles began because they were not taught in studios: they all started out as social dances.[80]:74 Forming and participating in a crew is how street dancers practiced, improved, made friends, and built relationships.[81] In breaking in particular, battling is how b-boys/b-girls improved their skill.[82]\\r\\nAside from Rock Steady Crew, several breaking crews were active in the 1970s such as Mighty Zulu Kings, Dynamic Rockers, New York City Breakers, SalSoul, Air Force Crew, Crazy Commanders Crew, Starchild La Rock, and Rockwell Association. In the same way b-boy crews were active on the east coast of the United States spreading breaking throughout New York, funk crews were also active on the west coast spreading the funk styles throughout California. Aside from The Lockers and The Electric Boogaloos, other funk styles crews such as Medea Sirkas/Demons of the Mind, Black Messengers, The Robot Brothers, The Go-Go Brothers, Granny and Robotroid, and Chain Reaction were active during the 1970s performing on stage.[83]\\r\\nChain Reaction was a four-man dance crew from Reseda, California whose members included Thomas \\"T-Bopper\\" Guzman-Sanchez, Paul \\"Cool Pockets\\" Guzman-Sanchez, Robert \\"Bosco\\" Winters, and Mike \\"Deuce\\" Donley.[84] Just like The Electric Boogaloos had their own signature dance style called electric boogaloo, Chain Reaction also had their own signature dance style called crossover locking.[85] They performed on the talk show Thicke of the Night and in the movie Xanadu.[86] Xanadu premiered in 1980, four years earlier than the hip-hop dance classics Beat Street and Breakin'. Xanadu was the first time boogaloo, popping, and crossover locking were performed on film.[87] In 1984, T-Bopper created a new dance crew called United Street Force. By invitation, this crew performed at the White House for President Ronald Reagan.[88]\\r\\nCrews still form based on friendships and neighborhoods. For example, dance crew Diversityformed in 2007[89]consists of brothers and friends from Essex and London.[90] Crews also form for other reasons such as theme (Jabbawockeez), gender (ReQuest Dance Crew), ethnicity (Kaba Modern), dance style (Massive Monkeys), and age (Hip Op-eration). In 2013, Hip Op-eration performed an exhibition routine at the World Hip Hop Dance Championships in Las Vegas. At the time, their youngest member was 66.[91]\\r\\nIn the 1970s, b-boy crews were neighborhood-based and would engage in battles held at local block parties called \\"jams\\".[92] Today crews can battle in organized competitions with other crews from around the world. New Zealand crew ReQuest won the Australian-based competition World Supremacy Battlegrounds in 2009 and the American-based competition Hip Hop International in 2009 and 2010.[93] On October 12, 2010, the Vietnamese Ministry of Culture, Sport, and Tourism presented the Certificate of Merit to dance crew Big Toe for winning a variety of international dance competitions.[94] Dance crews are more prevalent in hip-hop, but hip-hop dance companies do exist. Examples include Zoo Nation (UK), Culture Shock (USA), Lux Aeterna (USA), Boy Blue Entertainment (UK), Unity UK (UK), Bounce Streetdance Company (Sweden), and Funkbrella Dance Company (USA).\\r\\nHip-hop social dancing (party dancing) began when hip-hop musical artists started to release songs with an accompanying dance. In 1990, rapper MC Hammer created the Hammer dance[95] and popularized it in his music video \\"U Can't Touch This\\". The Hammer dance was a social dance that became wildly popular and then faded as the album it was associated with, Please Hammer, Don't Hurt 'Em, lost popularity. Most social dances are short-lived fad dances, some are line dances, and others spawn new dance styles that stay relevant even after the life of the songs they came from come to an end. The development of hip-hop social dancing extends further back than the 1990s with the Charleston, a jazz dance; Chubby Checker's Twist, which was considered rock & roll; several 1970s fad dances made popular by James Brown; and the influence of the television show Soul Train.\\r\\nThe Charleston was created in the 1920s by African-Americans in Charleston, South Carolina as a rebellion against prohibition.[96] It gained popularity once it was embraced by Caucasians, but it was still considered an immoral dance due to its association with alcohol.[97] This dance relied on partnering and eventually led to the creation of Lindy Hop.[98] Lindy Hop and the Charleston fall under the swing dance genre; however, there is a dance move used in breaking that is taken from the Charleston called the Charlie rock.[11] Singer-songwriter Chubby Checker released the song \\"The Twist\\" with an accompanying dance of the same name in 1960. He performed the dance on the television show American Bandstand, and the song reached number one in 1960 and 1962.[99] The Twist was the most popular dance craze of the 1960s because it broke away from the trend of partner dancing enabling people to perform on their own.[100][101][102]\\r\\nJames Brown was a major contributor to social dance. He popularized several fad dances in the 1970s such as the Mashed Potato,[104] the Boogaloo, and the Good Foot. His accompanying songs to these dances include \\"(Do the) Mashed Potatoes\\", \\"Do the Boogaloo\\", and \\"Get on the Good Foot\\". The song \\"Do the Boogaloo\\" influenced Boogaloo Sam when he created the boogaloo dance style,[59] and the Good Foot triggered the creation of breaking.[1] In addition, James Brown also popularized the Funky Chicken, which was a major influence to Don Campbell when he created locking.[43] In an interview with NPR, Lockers' member Adolpho \\"Shabba Doo\\" Qui?ones stated \\"We're all children of James Brown... And you know, if James Brown was our father then you'd have to say Don Cornelius was our great uncle.\\"[105]\\r\\nIn 1970, Don Cornelius created Soul Train.[106] Before officially becoming a crew, members of The Lockers made several appearances on this show.[45] They introduced different dance moves such as the Robot, Which-Aways, and the Stop-and-Go during the \\"Dance of the Week\\" segment of the broadcast.[105] Disco was very popular during the 1970s, so some dance styles at that time such as waacking and hustle stemmed from disco music rather than funk.[107][108] Hip-hop became more mainstream in the 1980s, and this surge in interest combined with the popularity of Soul Train kick-started the rise of hip-hop social dancing.\\r\\nOne of the more popular social dances created during the 1980s was the Cabbage Patch. The rap group Gucci Crew II created the dance and introduced it in their 1987 song of the same name, \\"The Cabbage Patch\\".[109] Another popular social dance was the Roger Rabbit. This dance imitates the floppy movements of the lead cartoon character as seen in the 1988 film Who Framed Roger Rabbit.[110] The rap duo Kid 'n Play created the Kid 'n Play kick-step and performed it in their 1990 movie House Party. It is a variation on the Charleston with elements of the Roger Rabbit and the Running Man.[111] The Running Man is one of the most recognizable hip-hop social dances. According to Essence magazine, Paula Abdul created the Running Man and taught the dance to Janet Jackson when she was working as her choreographer during Jackson's Control era.[112][note 6] Jackson further popularized the dance when she performed it in her 1989 music video \\"Rhythm Nation\\", and rapper MC Hammer kept the fervor going when he started to do the Running Man in his performances.[112] The pop duo LMFAO brought the Running Man back into the mainstream with their song \\"Party Rock Anthem\\", which was named the 2011 song of the summer by Billboard.com.[114] The accompanying dance in the song called The Shuffle combines three social dances: the Running Man, the (half) Charleston, and the T-step.[99]\\r\\nDJ Troy \\"Webstar\\" Ryan and Bianca \\"Young B\\" Dupree released the song \\"Chicken Noodle Soup\\" in 2006. The dance was so popular, at one point YouTube had over 2,000 video clips of kids performing it.[115] The song sold 335,000 ringtones, but it was not strong enough to sustain momentum for the full length album \\"Webstar Presents: Caught in the Web\\", which was not successful.[115] For this reason, the Chicken Noodle Soup song and dance faded. The Dougie comes from Dallas, Texas.[116] The dance was named after the 1980s rapper Doug E. Fresh and popularized in the 2010 song \\"Teach Me How to Dougie\\" by the rap group Cali Swag District.[116] According to the Wall Street Journal, the Dougie has been particularly popular as a celebratory dance among professional athletes.[116] In 2010, CNN news anchor Wolf Blitzer performed the Dougie at the Soul Train Music Awards.[117]\\r\\nThe Cha Cha Slide, the Cupid Shuffle, and the Soulja Boy are examples of urban line dances that were created from hip-hop songs of the same name. These line dances have the same premise as the more widely know Electric Slide. There are variations to the Electric Slide, but the dance is always performed to the song \\"Electric Boogie\\" by Marcia Griffiths.[118] In keeping with this tradition, the Cha Cha Slide, the Cupid Shuffle, and the Soulja Boy are always performed to their respective songs.\\r\\nDJ Willie \\"Casper\\" Perry created the song \\"Cha Cha Slide\\" in 1996 for a personal trainer in his hometown Chicago.[119] It did not get commercial airplay until 2000 when Chicago radio station WGCI-FM started playing the song as part of its rotation. Soon after, other radio stations across the United States also started playing the song, and this increase in popularity led to a record deal with Universal Music Group.[120] After securing a deal, the label began producing and distributing instructional videos of the dance to nightclubs, which helped spread its popularity.[120] On February 20, 2011, dancers in Anaheim, California set a Guinness world record when 2,387 people performed the dance at the Anaheim Convention Center.[121]\\r\\nThe song \\"Cupid Shuffle\\" was released in February 2007 by singer Bryson \\"Cupid\\" Bernard from Lafayette, Louisiana. In August 2007, 17,000 people set a world record when they performed the Cupid Shuffle (dance) to his song in Atlanta.[115] The Soulja Boy dance became popular through MySpace when rapper DeAndre \\"Soulja Boy\\" Way posted his song \\"Crank That\\" to his MySpace page and uploaded an accompanying instructional video showing viewers how to perform the dance. After amassing more than 16 million page views, he was signed to Interscope Records.[115]\\r\\nCitations\\r\\nBibliography","input":"Where did hip hop dance originally come from?"},{"output":"to determine the presence of phenols in a given sample or compound","context":"The ferric chloride test is used to determine the presence of phenols in a given sample or compound (for instance natural phenols in a plant extract).

During the 16th and 17th centuries, rides consisting of wooden sleds that took riders down large slides made from ice were popular in Russia.

Lagos was annexed on 6 August 1861 under the threat of force by Commander Beddingfield of HMS Prometheus who was accompanied by the Acting British Consul, William McCoskry. Oba Dosunmu of Lagos (spelled \\"Docemo\\" in British documents) resisted the cession for 11 days while facing the threat of violence on Lagos and its people, but capitulated and signed the Lagos Treaty of Cession.[1] Lagos was declared a colony on 5 March 1862.[2] By 1872 Lagos was a cosmopolitan trading center with a population over 60,000.[3] In the aftermath of prolonged wars between the mainland Yoruba states, the colony established a protectorate over most of Yorubaland between 1890 and 1897.[4] The colony and protectorate were incorporated into Southern Nigeria in February 1906, and Lagos became the capital of the protectorate of Nigeria in January 1914.[2] Since then, Lagos has grown to become the largest city in West Africa, with an estimated metropolitan population of over 9,000,000 as of 2011.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLagos was originally a fishing community on the north of Lagos Island, which lies in Lagos Lagoon, a large protected harbour on the Atlantic coast of Africa in the Gulf of Guinea west of the Niger River delta. The Lagoon is protected from the ocean by long sand spits that run east and west for up to 100 kilometres (62?mi) in both directions.[6] Lagos has a tropical savanna climate with two rainy seasons. The heaviest rains fall from April to July and there is a weaker rainy season in October and November. Total annual rainfall is 1,900 millimetres (75?in). Average temperatures range from 25?C (77?F) in July to 29?C (84?F) in March.[7]\\r\\nFor many years the staple products of the region were palm oil and palm kernels. Manufacture of palm oil was mainly considered a job for women.[8] Later exports included copra made from the coconut palm, guinea grains, gum copal, camwood and sesame (benne).[9]\\r\\nThe earliest incarnation of Lagos was an Awori Yoruba fishing community located on the islands and peninsula that form the modern state.[10] The area was inhabited by families who claimed a semi-mythical ancestry from a figure called Olofin.[11] The modern descendants of this figure are the contemporary nobility known as the Idejo or \\"white cap chiefs\\" of Lagos.\\r\\nIn the 16th century, Lagos island was sacked and colonized by troops of the Oba of Benin during that kingdom's expansionary phase. They established a war camp in the town, and it became known as Eko. In the 17th century it became an important port town in the Benin Empire. The monarchs of Lagos since then have claimed descent from the warrior Ashipa[12] who is sometimes said to have been a prince of Benin or, sometimes, an Awori freebooter loyal to the Benin throne. The Idejo aristocracy remained Yoruba. Ashipa's son built his palace on Lagos Island, and his grandson moved the seat of government to the palace from the Iddo peninsula. In 1730 the Oba of Lagos invited Portuguese slave traders to the island, where soon a flourishing trade developed.[13] 18th century Lagos was still technically a vassal city-state within the Benin Empire, but was increasingly independent and surpassing the latter in power and influence as Benin's power waned.[14]\\r\\nIn the first half of the 19th century the Yoruba hinterland was in a state of near-constant warfare due to internal conflicts and incursions from the northern and western neighbouring states. By then the fortified island of Lagos had become a major centre of the slave trade. The United Kingdom abolished import of slaves to their colonies in 1807, and abolished slavery in all British territories in 1833. The British became increasingly active in suppressing the slave trade.[15] At the end of 1851 a naval expedition bombarded Lagos into submission,[16] deposed Oba Kosoko, installed the more amenable Oba Akitoye, and signed the Great Britain-Lagos treaty that made slavery illegal in Lagos on January 1, 1852. A few months later Louis Fraser from the Bight of Benin consulate was posted to the island as vice-Consul. The next year Lagos was upgraded to a full consulate with Benjamin Campbell appointed as Consul.[17][15] A Yoruba emigrant, the catechist James White, wrote in 1853 \\"By the taking of Lagos, England has performed an act which the grateful children of Africa shall long remember ... One of the principal roots of the slave trade is torn out of the soil\\".[18]\\r\\nTensions between the new ruler, Akitoye, and supporters of the deposed Kosoko led to fighting in August 1853. An attempt by Kosoko himself to take the town was defeated, but Akitoye died suddenly on 2 September 1853, perhaps by poison. After consulting with the local chiefs, the consul declared Dosunmu (Docemo), the eldest son of Akitoye, the new Oba.[19] With succeeding crises and interventions, the consulate evolved over the following years into a form of protectorate.[15] Lagos became a base from which the British gradually extended their jurisdiction, in the form of a protectorate, over the hinterland. The process was driven by the demands of trade and security rather than by any deliberate policy of expansion.[20]\\r\\nThe CMS Grammar School was founded in Lagos on 6 June 1859 by the Church Missionary Society, modelled on the CMS Grammar School in Freetown, Sierra Leone.[21]\\r\\nIn August 1861 a British naval force entered Lagos and annexed Lagos as a British colony via the Lagos Treaty of Cession. King Dosunmu's powers were significantly reduced and consul William McCoskry became acting governor.[22][fn 1] As a colony, Lagos was now protected and governed directly from Britain.[24] Africans born in the colony were British subjects, with full rights including access to the courts. By contrast, Africans in the later protectorates of southern and northern Nigeria were protected people but remained under the jurisdiction of their traditional rulers.[25]\\r\\nIn the early years, trade with the interior was severely restricted due to a war between Ibadan and Abeokuta. The Ogun River leading to Abeokuta was not safe for canoe traffic, with travellers at risk from Egba robbers. On 14 November 1862 Governor Henry Stanhope Freeman called on all British subjects to return from Abeokuta to Lagos, leaving their property, for which the chiefs of Abeokuta would be answerable to the British government.[26] Acting Governor William Rice Mulliner met the Bashorun of Abeokuta in May 1863, who told him that recent robberies of traders' property were due to the custom of suppressing trading so as to force the men to war. The plunder would cease when the war was over. In the meantime, traders should not travel to Abeokuta since their safety could not be guaranteed.[27]\\r\\nAlthough the slave trade had been suppressed, and slavery was illegal in British territory, slavery still continued in the region. Lagos was seen as a haven by runaway slaves, who were something of a problem for the administration. McCoskry set up a court to hear cases of abuse against slaves and of runaway slaves from the interior, and established a \\"Liberated African Yard\\" to give employment to freed runaways until they were able to look after themselves. He did not consider that abolition of slavery in the colony would be practical.[28]\\r\\nMcCoskry, and other merchants in the colony, opposed the activities of missionaries, which they felt interfered with trade. In 1855 McCloskry had been among signatories of a petition to prevent two missionaries who had gone on leave from returning to Lagos. McCloskry communicated his view to the former explorer Richard Francis Burton, who visited Lagos and Abeokuta in 1861 while acting as consul at Fernando Po, and who was also opposed to missionary work.[29]\\r\\nFreeman, his successor, agreed with Burton that the blacks were more likely to be converted by Islam than by Christianity.[30]\\r\\nFreeman attempted to prevent Robert Campbell, a Jamaican of part-Scottish, part-African descent, from establishing a newspaper in the colony. He considered it would be \\"a dangerous instrument in the hands of semi-civilized Negroes\\". The British government did not agree, and the first issue of the Anglo-African, appeared on 6 June 1863.[31] Earlier, in 1854, there had been a newspaper that can truly be described as the first Nigerian newspaper called Iwe Iroyin Yoruba fun awon Egba ati Yoruba.\\r\\nA small legislative council was established when the colony was founded in 1861, with the mandate of assisting and advising the Governor but without formal authority, and was maintained until 1922. The majority of members were colonial officials.[32] In 1863 the British established the Lagos Town Improvement Ordinance, aiming to control physical development of the town and surrounding territory.[24] The administration was merged with that of Sierra Leone in 1866, and was transferred to the Gold Coast in 1874. The Lagos elites lobbied intensively to have autonomy restored, which did not happen until 1886.[33]\\r\\nColonial Lagos developed into a busy, cosmopolitan port, with an architecture that blended Victorian and Brazilian styles.[7] The Brazilian element was imparted by skilled builders and masons who had returned from Brazil.[34] The black elite was composed of English-speaking \\"Saros\\" from Sierra Leone and other emancipated slaves who had been repatriated from Brazil and Cuba.[7] By 1872 the population of the colony was over 60,000, of whom less than 100 were of European origin. In 1876 imports were valued at S476,813 and exports at S619,260.[3]\\r\\nOn 13 January 1874, leaders of the Methodist community, including Charles Joseph George, met to discuss founding a secondary school for members of their communion as an alternative to the CMS Grammar School. After a fund-raising drive, the Methodist Boys School building was opened in June 1877.[35] On 17 February 1881, George was one of the community leaders who laid the foundation stone for the Wesley Church at Olowogbowo, in the west of Lagos Island.[36]\\r\\nThe colony had largely succeeded in eliminating slavery and had become a prosperous trading community, but until the start of the European scramble for Africa the British Imperial government considered that the Lagos colony in some respects a failure. The British had refused to intervene in the politics of the hinterland and cut-throat competition among British and French firms along the Niger had kept it from returning any significant profit.[18]\\r\\nIn 1877 a trade war broke out between Ibadan and both Egba Alake (Abeokuta) and Ijebu. Further to the east, the Ekiti and Ijesa revolted against Ibadan rule in 1878, and sporadic fighting continued for the next sixteen years. Assistance from Saro merchants in Lagos in the form of breech-loading rifles gave the Ekiti the advantage. The Lagos government, at that time subordinate to Accra in the Gold Coast, was instructed to stay out of the conflict, despite the damage it was doing to trade, and attempts to mediate by the Saro merchants and by the Fulani emirs were rejected.[4]\\r\\nBy 1884, George Goldie's United African Company had succeeded in absorbing all of his competition and eliminated the French posts from the lower Niger; the situation permitted Britain to claim the entire region at the Berlin Conference the next year. In 1886 Lagos became a separate colony from the Gold Coast under Governor Cornelius Alfred Moloney. The legislative council of the new colony was composed of four official and three unofficial members. Governor Moloney nominated two Africans as unofficial representatives: the clergyman, later bishop James Johnson and the trader Charles Joseph George.[37] At this time the European powers were in intense competition for African colonies while the protagonists in the Yoruba wars were wearying. The Lagos administration, acting through Samuel Johnson and Charles Phillips of the Church Mission Society, arranged a ceasefire and then a treaty that guaranteed the independence of the Ekiti towns. Ilorin refused to cease fighting however, and the war dragged on.[4]\\r\\nConcerned about the growing influence of the French in nearby Dahomey, the British established a post at Ilaro in 1890.[4] On 13 August 1891 a treaty was signed placing the kingdom of Ilaro under the protection of the British queen.[38] When Governor Gilbert Thomas Carter arrived in 1891, he followed an aggressive policy. In 1892 he attacked Ijebu, and in 1893 made a tour of Yorubaland signing treaties, forcing the armies to disperse, and opening the way for construction of a railway from Lagos to Ibadan.[4] Thus on 3 February 1893, Carter signed a treaty of protection with the Alafin of Oyo and on 15 August 1893, acting Governor George Chardin Denton signed a protectorate agreement with Ibadan.[39] Colonial control was firmly established throughout the region after the bombardment of Oyo in 1895 and the capture of Ilorin by the Royal Niger Company in 1897.[4]\\r\\nIn 1887 Captain Maloney, the Governor, gave a report to the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew in which he outlined plans for a Botanic Station at Lagos with the purpose of developing indigenous trees and plants that had commercial value.[9] By 1889 rubber had been introduced to the colony, and was promising excellent yields and quality. A report that year described other products including gum and coconut oil, for which a small-scale crushing business had promise, various fibres, camwood, borwood and Indigo, also seen as having large potential.[40]\\r\\nThe growth of the city of Lagos was largely unplanned, impeded by the complex of swamps, canals and sand spits.[41] William MacGregor, governor from 1898 to 1903, instituted a campaign against the prevalent malaria, draining the swamps and destroying as far as possible the mosquitoes that were responsible for the spread of the disease.[42]\\r\\nTelephone links with Britain were established by 1886, and electric street lighting in 1898.[34] In August 1896, Charles Joseph George and G.W. Neville, both merchants and both unofficial members of the Legislative Council, presented a petition urging construction of the railway terminus on Lagos Island rather than at Iddo, and also asking for the railway to be extended to Abeokuta. George was the leader of the delegation making this request, and described its many commercial advantages.[43] A major strike broke out in the colony in 1897, which has been described as the \\"first major labour protest\\" in African history.[44]\\r\\nOn 21 February 1899 the Alake of the Egba signed an agreement opening the way for construction of a railway through their territory, [45] and the new railway from Aro to Abeokuta was opened by the Governor in December 1901, in the presence of the Alake.[46]\\r\\nIn 1901 the first qualified African lawyer in the colony, Christopher Sapara Williams, was nominated to the Legislative Council, serving as a member until his death in 1915.[47] In 1903 there was a crisis over the payment of the tolls that were collected from traders by native rulers, although Europeans were exempted. The alternative was to replace the tolls by a subsidy. MacGregor requested views from Williams, Charles Joseph George and Obadiah Johnson as indigenous opinion leaders. All were in favour of retaining the tolls to avoid upsetting the rulers.[48] In 1903 Governor MacGregor's administration prepared a Newspaper Ordinance ostensibly designed to prevent libels being published. George, Williams and Johnson, the three Nigerian council members, all objected on the grounds that the ordinance would inhibit freedom of the press. George said \\"any obstacle in the way of publication of newspapers in this colony means throwing Lagos back to its position forty or fifty years ago\\". Despite these objections, the ordinance was passed into law.[49]\\r\\nWalter Egerton was the last Governor of Lagos Colony, appointed in 1903. Egerton enthusiastically endorsed the extension of the Lagos ÿ Ibadan railway onward to Oshogbo, and the project was approved in November 1904. Construction began in January 1905 and the line reached Oshogbo in April 1907.[50] The colonial office wanted to amalgamate the Lagos Colony with the protectorate of Southern Nigeria, and in August 1904 also appointed Egerton as High Commissioner for the Southern Nigeria Protectorate. He held both offices until 28 February 1906.[51] On that date the two territories were amalgamated, with the combined territory called the Colony and Protectorate of Southern Nigeria. In 1914, the Governor-General Sir Frederick Lugard amalgamated this territory with the Protectorate of Northern Nigeria to form the Colony and Protectorate of Nigeria.[52]\\r\\nLagos was the capital of Nigeria until 1991, when that role was ceded to the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja, and remains the commercial capital.[34] The estimated population in 2011 was over 9 million.[5]\\r\\nGovernors of the Lagos Colony were as follows:[2]\\r\\nFrom 1866 to 1886 Lagos was subordinate first to Sierra Leone, then to Gold Coast.\\r\\n\\r\\nSee also: List of schools in Lagos\\r\\nSee also: List of hospitals in Lagos\\r\\nSee also: Architecture of Lagos","input":"When was lagos annexed by the colonial masters?"},{"output":"Zachary Taylor","context":"Zachary Taylor (November 24, 1784 ÿ July 9, 1850) was the 12th President of the United States, serving from March 1849 until his death in July 1850. Before his presidency, Taylor was a career officer in the United States Army, rising to the rank of major general. Taylor's status as a national hero as a result of his victories in the MexicanÿAmerican War won him election to the White House despite his vague political beliefs. His top priority as president was preserving the Union, but he died 16 months into his term, before making any progress on the status of slavery, which had been inflaming tensions in Congress. He remains the only President to come from Louisiana.[1]\\r\\nTaylor was born into a prominent family of planters who migrated westward from Virginia to Kentucky in his youth. He was commissioned as an officer in the U.S. Army in 1808 and made a name for himself as a captain in the War of 1812. He climbed the ranks establishing military forts along the Mississippi River and entered the Black Hawk War as a colonel in 1832. His success in the Second Seminole War attracted national attention and earned him the nickname \\"Old Rough and Ready\\".\\r\\nIn 1845, as the annexation of Texas was underway, President James K. Polk dispatched Taylor to the Rio Grande area in anticipation of a potential battle with Mexico over the disputed TexasÿMexico border. The MexicanÿAmerican War broke out in April 1846. In May, Taylor defeated Mexican troops commanded by General Mariano Arista at the Battles of Palo Alto and Resaca de la Palma and managed to drive his troops out of Texas. Taylor subsequently led his troops into Mexico, where they once again defeated Mexican troops commanded by Pedro de Ampudia at the Battle of Monterrey in September. Defying orders, Taylor moved his troops further south. Despite being severely outnumbered, he dealt a crushing blow to Mexican forces under Antonio L܇pez de Santa Anna in February 1847 at the Battle of Buena Vista. After this, most of Taylor's troops were transferred to the command of Major General Winfield Scott, but Taylor's popularity remained significant.\\r\\nThe Whig Party convinced the reluctant Taylor to lead their ticket in the 1848 presidential election, despite his unclear political beliefs and lack of interest in politics. At the 1848 Whig National Convention, Taylor defeated Scott and former Senator Henry Clay to take the nomination. He won the general election alongside New York politician Millard Fillmore, defeating Democratic candidates Lewis Cass and William Orlando Butler, as well as a third party effort led by former President Martin Van Buren and Charles Francis Adams, Sr. of the Free Soil Party. Taylor became the first President to be elected with no prior office.\\r\\nAs President, Taylor kept his distance from Congress and his cabinet, even as partisan tensions threatened to divide the Union. Debate over the status of slavery in the Mexican Cession dominated the political agenda and led to threats of secession from Southerners. Despite being a Southerner and a slaveholder himself, Taylor did not push for the expansion of slavery, and he sought sectional harmony above all other concerns. To avoid the issue of slavery, he urged settlers in New Mexico and California to bypass the territorial stage and draft constitutions for statehood, setting the stage for the Compromise of 1850.\\r\\nTaylor died suddenly of a stomach-related illness in July 1850, with his administration having accomplished little aside from the ratification of the ClaytonÿBulwer Treaty. Fillmore served the remainder of Taylor's term.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nZachary Taylor was born on November 24, 1784, on a plantation in Orange County, Virginia, to a prominent family of planters of English ancestry. He is inconclusively believed to have been born at the home of his maternal grandfather, Hare Forest Farm.[2] He was the third of five surviving sons in his family (a sixth died in infancy) and had three younger sisters. His mother was Sarah Dabney (Strother) Taylor. His father, Richard Taylor, had served as a lieutenant colonel in the American Revolution.[3]\\r\\nTaylor was a descendant of Elder William Brewster, the Pilgrim colonist leader of the Plymouth Colony, a Mayflower immigrant, and one of the signers of the Mayflower Compact; and Isaac Allerton Jr., a colonial merchant and colonel who was the son of Mayflower Pilgrim Isaac Allerton and Fear Brewster. Taylor's second cousin through that line was James Madison, the fourth president.[4]\\r\\nLeaving exhausted lands, his family joined the westward migration out of Virginia and settled near what developed as Louisville, Kentucky, on the Ohio River. Taylor grew up in a small woodland cabin before his family moved to a brick house with increased prosperity. The rapid growth of Louisville was a boon for Taylor's father, who came to own 10,000 acres (40?km2) throughout Kentucky by the start of the 19th century; he held 26 slaves to cultivate the most developed portion of his holdings. There were no formal schools on the Kentucky frontier, and Taylor had a sporadic formal education. A schoolmaster recalled Taylor as a quick learner. His early letters show a weak grasp of spelling and grammar, and his handwriting was later described as \\"that of a near illiterate\\".[5]\\r\\nIn June 1810, Taylor married Margaret Mackall Smith, whom he had met the previous autumn in Louisville. \\"Peggy\\" Smith came from a prominent family of Maryland planters; she was the daughter of Major Walter Smith, who had served in the Revolutionary War.[6] The couple had six children:\\r\\nOn May 3, 1808, Taylor joined the U.S. Army, receiving a commission as a first lieutenant of the Seventh Infantry Regiment. He was among the new officers commissioned by Congress in response to the ChesapeakeÿLeopard Affair, in which an American frigate had been boarded by the crew of a British warship, sparking calls for war.[13] Taylor spent much of 1809 in the dilapidated camps of New Orleans and nearby Terre aux Boeufs. Under the command of James Wilkinson, the soldiers at Terre aux Boeufs suffered greatly from disease and lack of supplies, and Taylor was given an extended leave, returning to Louisville to recover.[14] Taylor was promoted to captain in November 1810. His army duties were limited at this time, and he attended to his personal finances. Over the next several years, he began to purchase slaves and a good deal of bank stock in Louisville.[15] He bought a plantation in Louisville for $95,000 that had 83 slaves attached to it, as well as the Cypress Grove Plantation near Rodney, Jefferson County, Mississippi, bringing the total number of slaves under him above 200.[16][17] In July 1811 he was called to the Indiana Territory, where he assumed control of Fort Knox after the commandant fled. In only a few weeks, he was able to restore order in the garrison, for which he was lauded by Governor William Henry Harrison.[18] Taylor was temporarily called to Washington to testify for Wilkinson as a witness in a court-martial, and so he did not take part in the November 1811 Battle of Tippecanoe against the forces of Tecumseh, a Shawnee chief.[19]\\r\\nDuring the War of 1812, in which U.S. forces battled the British Empire and its Indian allies, Taylor successfully defended Fort Harrison in Indiana Territory from an Indian attack commanded by Tecumseh. The September 1812 battle represented the first land victory of the war for the American forces, and Taylor's leadership received wide praise. He received a brevet (temporary) promotion to the rank of major; according to Eisenhower, this represented the first brevet ever awarded in United States history.[20] Later that year, Taylor joined General Samuel Hopkins as an aide on two expeditions: the first into the Illinois Territory and the second to the Tippecanoe battle site, where they were forced to retreat in the Battle of Wild Cat Creek.[21] Taylor moved his growing family to Fort Knox after the violence subsided. In spring 1814, he was called back into action under Brigadier General Benjamin Howard. After Howard fell sick, Taylor led a 430-man expedition from St. Louis, Missouri up the Mississippi River. In the Battle of Credit Island, Taylor defeated Indian forces, but retreated after the Indians were joined by their British allies.[22] That October he supervised the construction of Fort Johnson near present-day Warsaw, Illinois, the last toehold of the U.S. Army in the upper Mississippi River Valley. Upon Howard's death a few weeks later, Taylor was ordered to abandon the fort and retreat to St. Louis. Reduced to the rank of captain when the war ended in 1815, he resigned from the army. He re-entered it a year later after gaining a commission as a major.[23]\\r\\nFor two years, Taylor commanded Fort Howard at the Green Bay, Michigan Territory, settlement. He then returned to Louisville and his family. In April 1819 he was promoted to the rank of lieutenant colonel and dined with President James Monroe and General Andrew Jackson.[24] In late 1821, Taylor took the 7th Infantry to Natchitoches, Louisiana, on the Red River. On the orders of General Edmund P. Gaines, they set out to locate a new post more convenient to the Sabine River frontier. By the following March, Taylor had established Fort Jesup, at the Shield's Spring site southwest of Natchitoches. That November he was transferred to Fort Robertson at Baton Rouge, where he remained until February 1824.[25] He spent the next few years on recruiting duty. In late 1826 he was called to Washington, D.C., to work on an Army committee to consolidate and improve military organization. In the meantime he acquired his first Louisiana plantation and decided to move with his family to Baton Rouge as their home.[25]\\r\\nIn May 1828, Taylor was called back to action, commanding Fort Snelling in Michigan Territory (now Minnesota) on the northern Mississippi River for a year, and nearby Fort Crawford for a year. After some time on furlough, when he expanded his landholdings, Taylor was promoted to colonel of the 1st Infantry Regiment in April 1832.[26] At that time, the Black Hawk War was beginning in the West. Taylor campaigned under General Henry Atkinson to pursue and later defend against Chief Black Hawk's forces throughout the summer. The end of the war in August 1832 signaled the end of Indian resistance to U.S. expansion in the area, and the following years were relatively quiet. During this period Taylor resisted the courtship of his 17-year-old daughter Sarah Knox Taylor and Lieutenant Jefferson Davis, the future President of the Confederate States of America. He respected Davis but did not approve of his daughter becoming a military wife, as he knew it was a hard life for families. Davis and Sarah Taylor married in June 1835, but she died three months later of malaria contracted on a summer visit to Davis' sister in St. Francisville, Louisiana.[27]\\r\\nBy 1837, the Second Seminole War was underway when Taylor was directed to Florida. He defeated the Seminole Indians in the Christmas Day Battle of Lake Okeechobee, which was among the largest U.S.ÿIndian battles of the nineteenth century. He was promoted to brigadier general in recognition of his success. In May 1838, Brig. Gen. Thomas Jesup stepped down and placed Taylor in command of all American troops in Florida, a position he held for two years. His reputation as a military leader was growing, and with it, he began to be known as \\"Old Rough and Ready.\\"[28] Taylor was criticized for using bloodhounds in order to track Seminole.[16] After his long-requested relief was granted, Taylor spent a comfortable year touring the nation with his family and meeting with military leaders. During this period, he began to be interested in politics and corresponded with President William Henry Harrison. He was made commander of the Second Department of the Army's Western Division in May 1841. The sizable territory ran from the Mississippi River westward, south of the 37th parallel north. Stationed in Arkansas, Taylor enjoyed several uneventful years, spending as much time attending to his land speculation as to military matters.[29]\\r\\nIn anticipation of the annexation of the Republic of Texas, which had established independence in 1836, Taylor was sent in April 1844 to Fort Jesup in Louisiana. He was ordered to guard against any attempts by Mexico to reclaim the territory.[30] There were more senior generals in the army who might have taken this important command, such as Winfield Scott and Edmund P. Gaines. But both were known members of the Whig Party, and Harrison's apolitical reputation and friendly relations with Andrew Jackson made him the choice of Democratic President James K. Polk.[31] Polk directed him to deploy into disputed territory in Texas, \\"on or near the Rio Grande\\" near Mexico. Taylor chose a spot at Corpus Christi, and his Army of Occupation encamped there until the following spring in anticipation of a Mexican attack.[32]\\r\\nTaylor's men advanced to the Rio Grande in March 1846. Polk's attempts to negotiate with Mexico had failed, and war appeared imminent. Violence broke out several weeks later, when some of Captain Seth B. Thornton's men were attacked by Mexican forces north of the river.[33] Polk, learning of the Thornton Affair, told Congress in May that a war between Mexico and the U.S. had begun.[34] That same month, Taylor commanded American forces at the Battle of Palo Alto and the nearby Battle of Resaca de la Palma. Though greatly outnumbered, he defeated the Mexican force, which consisted of the Army of the North, commanded by General Mariano Arista, and forced the troops back across the Rio Grande.[35] Before accepting a prisoner exchange with General Arista, Taylor was noted for his humane treatment of the wounded Mexican soldiers, giving them the same care as was given to the American wounded. After tending to the wounded he performed the last rites for the dead of both the American and Mexican soldiers killed during the battle.[36]\\r\\nThese victories made him a popular hero, and within weeks he received a brevet promotion to major general and a formal commendation from Congress. The national press compared him to George Washington and Andrew Jackson, both generals who had ascended to the presidency, although Taylor denied any interest in running for office. \\"Such an idea never entered my head,\\" he remarked in a letter, \\"nor is it likely to enter the head of any sane person.\\"[37]\\r\\nIn September, Taylor, after crossing the Rio Grande, inflicted heavy casualties upon the Mexican defenders at the Battle of Monterrey. The city of Monterrey had been considered \\"impregnable\\", but was captured in three days, forcing Mexican forces to retreat. Taylor was criticized for signing a \\"liberal\\" truce, rather than pressing for a large-scale surrender.[38] Polk had hoped that the occupation of Northern Mexico would induce the Mexicans to sell Alta California and New Mexico, but the Mexicans remained unwilling to part with so much territory. Polk sent an army under the command of Winfield Scott to besiege Veracruz, an important Mexican port city, while Taylor was ordered to remain near Monterrey. Many of Taylor's experienced soldiers were placed under the command of Scott, leaving Taylor with a smaller and less effective force. Mexican General Antonio L܇pez de Santa Anna intercepted a letter from Scott regarding Taylor's smaller force, and he moved north, intent on destroying Taylor's force before confronting Scott's army.[39]\\r\\nLearning of Santa Anna's approach, and refusing to retreat despite the Mexican army's greater numbers, Taylor established a strong defensive position near the town of Saltillo.[40] Santa Anna attacked Taylor with 20,000 men at the Battle of Buena Vista in February 1847, leaving around 700 Americans dead or wounded at a cost of over 1,500 Mexican.[b] Outmatched, the Mexican forces retreated, ensuring a \\"far-reaching\\" victory for the Americans.[44]\\r\\nIn recognition of his victory at Buena Vista, Taylor was elected an honorary member of the New York Society of the Cincinnati on July 4, 1847. Taylor's father had been an Original Member of the Virginia Society of the Cincinnati. Unfortunately for the younger Taylor, the Virginia society had disbanded shortly before the elder Taylor's death, which prevented him from succeeding to his father's \\"seat\\" in the Society. Taylor was a member of the Aztec Club of 1847, Military Society of the Mexican War.[45]\\r\\nTaylor remained at Monterrey until late November 1847, when he set sail for home. While he would spend the following year in command of the Army's entire western division, his active military career was over. In December he received a hero's welcome in New Orleans and Baton Rouge, and his popular legacy set the stage for the 1848 presidential election.[46]\\r\\nIn his capacity as a career officer, Taylor had never publicly revealed his political beliefs before 1848 nor voted before that time.[47] He thought of himself as an independent, believing in a strong and sound banking system for the country, and thought that President Andrew Jackson, a Democrat, should not have allowed the Second Bank of the United States to collapse in 1836.[47] He believed it was impractical to talk about expanding slavery into the western areas of the U.S., as he concluded that neither cotton nor sugar (both were produced in great quantities as a result of slavery) could be easily grown there through a plantation economy.[47] He was also a firm nationalist, and due to his experience of seeing many people die as a result of warfare, he believed that secession was not a good way to resolve national problems.[47] Taylor, although he did not agree with their stand in favor of protective tariffs and expensive internal improvements, aligned himself with Whig Party governing policies: the President should not be able to veto a law, unless that law was against the Constitution; that the office should not interfere with Congress; and that the power of collective decision-making, as well as the Cabinet, should be strong.[47]\\r\\nWell before the American victory at Buena Vista, political clubs were formed which supported Taylor for President. His support was drawn from an unusually broad assortment of political bands, including Whigs and Democrats, Northerners and Southerners, allies and opponents of national leaders such as Henry Clay and James K. Polk. By late 1846 Taylor's opposition to a presidential run began to weaken, and it became clear that his principles more closely resembled Whig orthodoxy. Still, he maintained that he would only accept election as a national, independent figure, rather than a partisan loyalist.[48] Taylor declared, as the 1848 Whig Party convention approached, that he had always been a Whig in principle, but he did consider himself a Jeffersonian-Democrat.[47] Many southerners believed that Taylor supported slavery and its expansion into the new territory absorbed from Mexico, and some were angered when Taylor suggested that if he were elected President he would not veto the Wilmot Proviso, which proposed against such an expansion.[47] This position did not enhance his support from activist antislavery elements in the Northern U.S., as these wanted Taylor to speak out strongly in support of the Proviso, not simply fail to veto it.[47] Most abolitionists did not support Taylor, since he was a slave-owner.[47] Many southerners also knew that Taylor supported states' rights and was opposed to protective tariffs and government spending for internal improvements.[47] The Whigs hoped that he put the federal union of the United States above all else.[47]\\r\\nAt the 1848 Whig National Convention, Taylor defeated Henry Clay and Winfield Scott to receive the Whig nomination for President. For his Vice Presidential nominee the convention chose Millard Fillmore, a prominent New York Whig who had chaired the House Ways and Means Committee and had been a contender for Clay's Vice Presidential nominee in the 1844 election. Fillmore's selection was largely an attempt at reconciliation with northern Whigs, who were furious at the nomination of a slaveowning southerner; all factions of the party were dissatisfied with the final ticket.[49] Taylor continued to minimize his role in the campaign, preferring not to directly meet with voters or correspond regarding his political views. His campaign was skillfully directed by Senator John J. Crittenden of Kentucky, a friend and early political supporter, and bolstered by a late endorsement from Senator Daniel Webster of Massachusetts.[50] Taylor defeated Lewis Cass, the Democratic candidate, and Martin Van Buren, the Free Soil candidate, taking 163 of the 290 electoral votes. In the popular vote, he took 47.3%, while Cass won 42.5% and Van Buren won 10.1%. Taylor would be the last Whig to be elected president and the last person elected to the U.S. presidency from neither the Democratic Party or the Republican Party, as well as the last Southerner to win a presidential election until Woodrow Wilson's election in 1912.[c]\\r\\nTaylor ignored the Whig platform, as historian Michael F. Holt explains:\\r\\nTaylor was equally indifferent to programs Whigs had long considered vital. Publicly, he was artfully ambiguous, refusing to answer questions about his views on banking, the tariff, and internal improvements. Privately, he was more forthright. The idea of a national bank \\"is dead, and will not be revived in my time.\\" In the future the tariff \\"will be increased only for revenue\\"; in other words, Whig hopes of restoring the protective tariff of 1842 were vain. There would never again be surplus federal funds from public land sales to distribute to the states, and internal improvements \\"will go on in spite of presidential vetoes.\\" In a few words, that is, Taylor pronounced an epitaph for the entire Whig economic program.[51]\\r\\nAs president-elect, Taylor kept his distance from Washington, not resigning his Western Division command until late January 1849. He spent the months following the election formulating his cabinet selections. He was deliberate and quiet about his decisions, to the frustration of his fellow Whigs. While he despised patronage and political games, he endured a flurry of advances from office-seekers looking to play a role in his administration.[52]\\r\\nWhile he would not appoint any Democrats, Taylor wanted his cabinet to reflect the nation's diverse interests, and so apportioned the seats geographically. He also avoided choosing prominent Whigs, sidestepping such obvious selections as Clay. He saw Crittenden as a cornerstone of his administration, offering him the crucial seat of Secretary of State, but Crittenden insisted on serving out the Governorship of Kentucky to which he had just been elected. Taylor settled instead on Senator John M. Clayton of Delaware, a close associate of Crittenden's.[52]\\r\\nWith Clayton's aid, Taylor chose the six remaining members of his cabinet. One of the incoming Congress's first actions would be to establish the Department of the Interior, so Taylor would be appointing that department's inaugural secretary. Thomas Ewing, who had previously served as a senator from Ohio and as Secretary of the Treasury under William Henry Harrison, accepted the patronage-rich position of Secretary of the Interior. For the position of Postmaster General, which also served as a center of patronage, Taylor chose Congressman Jacob Collamer of Vermont. After Horace Binney refused appointment as Secretary of the Treasury, Taylor chose another prominent Philadelphian in William M. Meredith. George W. Crawford a former Governor of Georgia, accepted the position of Secretary of War, while Congressman William B. Preston of Virginia became Secretary of the Navy. Senator Reverdy Johnson of Maryland accepted appointment as Attorney General, and Johnson became one of the most influential members of Taylor's cabinet. Vice President Fillmore was not in favor with Taylor, and Fillmore was largely sidelined throughout Taylor's presidency.[53]\\r\\nTaylor began his trek to Washington in late January, a journey rife with bad weather, delays, injuries, sicknessand an abduction by a family friend. Taylor finally arrived in the nation's capital on February 24 and soon met with the outgoing President Polk.[54] The incumbent Democrat held a low opinion of Taylor, privately deeming him \\"without political information\\" and \\"wholly unqualified for the station\\" of President.[55] Taylor spent the following week meeting with political elites, some of whom were unimpressed with his appearance and demeanor. With less than two weeks until his inauguration, he met with Clayton and hastily finalized his cabinet.[56]\\r\\nTaylor's term as president began Sunday, March 4, but his inauguration was not held until the following day out of religious concerns.[d] His inauguration speech discussed the many tasks facing the nation, but presented a governing style of deference to Congress and sectional compromise instead of assertive executive action.[58] His speech also emphasized the importance of following President Washington's precedent in avoiding entangling alliances.[59] During the period after his inauguration, Taylor made time to meet with numerous office-seekers and other ordinary citizens who desired his attention. He also attended an unusual number of funerals, including services for former President Polk and Dolley Madison. According to Eisenhower, Taylor coined the phrase \\"First Lady\\" in his eulogy for Madison.[60] Throughout the summer of 1849, Taylor toured the northeastern U.S., to familiarize himself with a region of which he had seen little. He spent much of the trip plagued by gastrointestinal illness and returned to Washington by September.[61]\\r\\nAs Taylor took office, Congress faced a battery of questions related to the Mexican Cession, acquired by the U.S. after the Mexican War and divided into military districts. It was unclear which districts would be established into states and which would become federal territories, while the question of their slave status threatened to bitterly divide Congress. Additionally, many in the South had grown increasingly angry about the aid that northerners had given to fugitive slaves. While a southern slaveowner himself, Taylor believed that slavery was economically infeasible in the Mexican Cession, and as such he opposed slavery in those territories as a needless source of controversy.[62] His major goal was sectional peace, preserving the Union through legislative compromise.[63] As the threat of Southern secession grew, he sided increasingly with antislavery northerners such as Senator William H. Seward of New York, even suggesting that he would sign the Wilmot Proviso to ban slavery in federal territories should such a bill reach his desk.[64]\\r\\nIn Taylor's view, the best way forward was to admit California as a state rather than a federal territory, as it would leave the slavery question out of Congress's hands. The timing for statehood was in Taylor's favor, as the Gold Rush was well underway at the time of his inauguration, and California's population was exploding.[65] The administration dispatched Rep. Thomas Butler King to California, to test the waters and advocate on behalf of statehood, knowing that the Californians were certain to adopt an anti-slavery constitution. King found that a constitutional convention was already underway, and by October 1849, the convention unanimously agreed to join the Unionand to ban slavery within their borders.[66]\\r\\nThe question of the New MexicoÿTexas border was unsettled at the time of Taylor's inauguration. The territory newly won from Mexico was under federal jurisdiction, but the Texans claimed a swath of land north of Santa Fe and were determined to include it within their borders, despite having no significant presence there. Taylor sided with the New Mexicans' claim, initially pushing to keep it as a federal territory, but eventually supported statehood so as to further reduce the slavery debate in Congress. The Texas government, under newly instated governor P. Hansborough Bell, tried to ramp up military action in defense of the territory against the federal government, but was unsuccessful.[67]\\r\\nThe Latter Day Saint settlers of modern-day Utah had established a provisional State of Deseret, an enormous swath of territory which had little hope of recognition by Congress. The Taylor administration considered combining the California and Utah territories, but instead opted to organize the Utah Territory. To alleviate the Mormon population's concerns over religious freedom, Taylor promised they would have relative independence from Congress despite being a federal territory.[68]\\r\\nTaylor sent his only State of the Union report to Congress in December 1849. He recapped international events and suggested several adjustments to tariff policy and executive organization, but such issues were overshadowed by the sectional crisis facing Congress. He reported on California's and New Mexico's applications for statehood, and recommended that Congress approve them as written and \\"should abstain from the introduction of those exciting topics of a sectional character\\".[69] The policy report was prosaic and unemotional, but ended with a sharp condemnation of secessionists. It had no effect on Southern legislators, who saw the admission of two free states as an existential threat, and Congress remained stalled.[70]\\r\\nTaylor and his Secretary of State, John M. Clayton, both lacked diplomatic experience, and came into office at a relatively uneventful time in Americanÿinternational politics. Their shared nationalism allowed Taylor to devolve foreign policy matters to Clayton with minimal oversight, although no decisive foreign policy was established under their administration.[71] As opponents of the autocratic European order, they vocally supported German and Hungarian liberals in the revolutions of 1848, although they offered little in the way of aid.[72] A perceived insult from the French minister Guillaume Tell Poussin nearly led to a break in diplomatic relations until Poussin was replaced, and a reparation dispute with Portugal resulted in harsh words from the Taylor administration. In a more positive effort, the administration arranged for two ships to assist in the United Kingdom's search for a team of British explorers, led by John Franklin, who had gotten lost in the Arctic.[73] While previous Whig administrations had emphasized Pacific trade as an economic imperative, the Taylor administration took no major initiative in the Far East.[74]\\r\\nThroughout 1849 and 1850, they contended with Narciso L܇pez, the Venezuelan radical who led repeated filibustering expeditions in an attempt to conquer the island of Cuba. The annexation of Cuba was the object of fascination among many in the South, who saw in Cuba a potential new slave state, and L܇pez had several prominent Southern supporters.[75] L܇pez made generous offers to American military leaders to support him, but Taylor and Clayton saw the enterprise as illegal. They issued a blockade, and later, authorized a mass arrest of L܇pez and his fellows, although the group would eventually be acquitted.[76] They also confronted Spain, which had arrested several Americans on the charge of piracy, but the Spaniards eventually surrendered them to maintain good relations with the U.S.[77]\\r\\nArguably the Taylor administration's definitive accomplishment in foreign policy was the ClaytonÿBulwer Treaty of 1850, regarding a proposed inter-oceanic canal through Central America. While the U.S. and Britain were on friendly terms, and the construction of such a canal was decades away from reality, the mere possibility put the two nations in an uneasy position.[78] For several years, Britain had been seizing strategic points, particularly the Mosquito Coast on the eastern coast of present-day Nicaragua. Negotiations were held with Britain that resulted in the landmark ClaytonÿBulwer Treaty. Both nations agreed not to claim control of any canal that might be built in Nicaragua. The treaty promoted development of an Anglo-American alliance; its completion was Taylor's last action as president.[79]\\r\\nClay took a central role as Congress debated the slavery question. While his positions had some overlap with Taylor's, the president always maintained his distance from Clay. Historians disagree on his motivations for doing so.[80] With assistance from Daniel Webster, Clay developed his landmark proposal, the Compromise of 1850. The proposal allowed statehood for California, giving it independence on the slavery question, while the other territories would remain under federal jurisdiction. This would include the disputed parts of New Mexico, although Texas would be reimbursed for the territory. Slavery would be retained in the District of Columbia, but the slave trade would be banned. Meanwhile, a strict Fugitive Slave Law would be enacted, bypassing northern legislation which had restricted Southerners from retrieving runaway slaves.[81] Tensions flared as Congress negotiated and secession talks grew, culminating with a threat from Taylor to send troops into New Mexico to protect its border from Texas, with himself leading the army. Taylor also said that anyone \\"taken in rebellion against the Union, he would hang ... with less reluctance than he had hanged deserters and spies in Mexico.\\" [82] The omnibus law was a major step forward but ultimately could not pass, due to extremists on both sides.[83]\\r\\nNo great compromise reached Taylor's desk during his presidency; instead, his last days were overshadowed by the Galphin affair. Before joining the Taylor cabinet, Secretary of War Crawford had served as a lawyer. He had been involved in a fifteen-year case, representing the descendants of a colonial trader whose services to the British crown had not been repaid at the time of the American Revolution. The British debt to George Galphin was to be assumed by the federal government, but Galphin's heirs only received payment on the debt's principal after years of litigation, and were unable to win an interest payment from the Polk administration. Treasury Secretary Meredith, with the support of Attorney General Johnson, finally signed off on the payment in April 1850. To the president's embarrassment, this payment included a legal compensation of nearly $100,000 to Crawford; two cabinet members had effectively offered a tremendous chunk of the public treasury to another. A House investigation cleared Crawford of any legal wrongdoing, but nonetheless expressed disapproval of his accepting the payment. Taylor, who had already been sketching out a re-organization of his cabinet, now had an unfolding scandal to complicate the situation.[84]\\r\\nOn July 4, 1850, Taylor reportedly consumed copious amounts of raw fruit and iced milk while attending holiday celebrations and a fund-raising event at the Washington Monument, which was then under construction.[85] Over the course of several days, he became severely ill with an unknown digestive ailment. His doctor \\"diagnosed the illness as cholera morbus, a flexible mid-nineteenth-century term for intestinal ailments as diverse as diarrhea and dysentery but not related to Asiatic cholera\\", the latter being a widespread epidemic at the time of Taylor's death.[86] The identity and source of Taylor's illness are the subject of historical speculation (see below), although it is known that several of his cabinet members had come down with a similar illness.[87]\\r\\nFever ensued and Taylor's chance of recovery was small. On July 8, Taylor remarked to a medical attendant:\\r\\nI should not be surprised if this were to terminate in my death. I did not expect to encounter what has beset me since my elevation to the Presidency. God knows I have endeavored to fulfill what I conceived to be an honest duty. But I have been mistaken. My motives have been misconstrued, and my feelings most grossly outraged.[88]\\r\\nDespite treatment, Taylor died at 10:35?p.m. on July 9, 1850. He was 65 years old.[89] After his death, Vice President Fillmore assumed the presidency and completed Taylor's term, which ended on March 4, 1853. Soon after taking office, Fillmore signed into law the Compromise of 1850, which settled many of the issues faced by the Taylor administration.[90]\\r\\nTaylor was interred in the Public Vault of the Congressional Cemetery in Washington, D.C., from July 13, 1850, to October 25, 1850. (It was built in 1835 to hold remains of notables until either the grave site could be prepared or transportation arranged to another city.) His body was transported to the Taylor Family plot where his parents were buried on the old Taylor homestead plantation known as \\"Springfield\\" in Louisville, Kentucky.\\r\\nBecause of his short tenure, Taylor is not considered to have strongly influenced the office of the Presidency or the United States.[92] Some historians believe that Taylor was too inexperienced with politics, at a time when officials needed close ties with political operatives.[92] Despite his shortcomings, the ClaytonÿBulwer Treaty affecting relations with Great Britain in Central America is \\"recognized as an important step in scaling down the nation's commitment to Manifest Destiny as a policy.\\"[92] While historical rankings of Presidents of the United States have generally placed Taylor in the bottom quarter of chief executives, most surveys tend to rank him as the most effective of the four Presidents from the Whig Party.\\r\\nTaylor was the last President to own slaves while in office. He was the third of four Whig presidents,[g] the last being Fillmore, his successor. Taylor was also the second president to die in office, preceded by William Henry Harrison who died while serving as President nine years earlier, as well as the only President elected from Louisiana.\\r\\nIn 1883, the Commonwealth of Kentucky placed a 50-foot monument topped by a life-sized statue of Taylor near his grave. By the 1920s, the Taylor family initiated the effort to turn the Taylor burial grounds into a national cemetery. The Commonwealth of Kentucky donated two adjacent parcels of land for the project, turning the half-acre Taylor family cemetery into 16 acres (65,000?m2). On May 6, 1926, the remains of Taylor and his wife (who died in 1852) were moved to the newly constructed Taylor mausoleum, made of limestone with a granite base and marble interior, nearby. The cemetery property has been designated as the Zachary Taylor National Cemetery.\\r\\nThe US Post Office released the first postage stamp issue honoring Zachary Taylor on June 21, 1875, 25 years after his death. In 1938, Taylor would appear again on a US Postage stamp, this time on the 12-cent Presidential Issue of 1938. Taylor's last appearance (to date, 2010) on a US postage stamp occurred in 1986 when he was honored on the AMERIPEX presidential issue. After Washington, Jefferson, Jackson and Lincoln, Zachary Taylor was the fifth American president to appear on US postage.[93]\\r\\nHe is the namesake for several names and places throughout the United States, including:\\r\\nHe was also the namesake for architect Zachary Taylor Davis.\\r\\nAlmost immediately after his death, rumors began to circulate that Taylor was poisoned by pro-slavery Southerners, and similar theories persisted into the 21st century.[97][98] In 1978, Hamilton Smith based his assassination theory on the timing of drugs, the lack of confirmed cholera outbreaks, and other material.[99] In the late 1980s, Clara Rising, a former professor at University of Florida, persuaded Taylor's closest living relative to agree to an exhumation so that his remains could be tested.[100] The remains were exhumed and transported to the Office of the Kentucky Chief Medical Examiner on June 17, 1991. Samples of hair, fingernail, and other tissues were removed, and radiological studies were conducted. The remains were returned to the cemetery and reinterred, with appropriate honors, in the mausoleum.[101]\\r\\nNeutron activation analysis conducted at Oak Ridge National Laboratory revealed no evidence of poisoning, as arsenic levels were too low.[101][102] The analysis concluded Taylor had contracted \\"cholera morbus, or acute gastroenteritis\\", as Washington had open sewers, and his food or drink may have been contaminated. Any potential for recovery was overwhelmed by his doctors, who treated him with \\"ipecac, calomel, opium, and quinine\\" at 40?grains per dose (approximately 2.6 grams), and \\"bled and blistered him too.\\"[103] Political scientist Michael Parenti questions the traditional explanation for Taylor's death. Relying on interviews and reports by forensic pathologists, he argues that the procedure used to test for arsenic poisoning was fundamentally flawed.[104][105] A 2010 review concludes: \\"there is no definitive proof that Taylor was assassinated, nor would it appear that there is definitive proof that he was not.\\"[106]\\r\\nGeneral biographies\\r\\n\\r\\nPolitical history\\r\\nGenealogy\\r\\nFurther reading","input":"What military hero from the mexican war became potus?"},{"output":"December 15, 1791","context":"","input":"When was the right to bear arms passed?"},{"output":"to prevent engine knocking","context":"Methyl tert-butyl ether (also known as MTBE and tert-butyl methyl ether) is an organic compound with a structural formula (CH3)3COCH3. MTBE is a volatile, flammable, and colorless liquid that is sparingly soluble[1] in water. It has a minty odor vaguely reminiscent of diethyl ether, leading to unpleasant taste and odor in water. MTBE is a gasoline additive, used as an oxygenate to raise the octane number. Its use is controversial because of its contamination of groundwater and legislation favoring ethanol. However, worldwide production of MTBE has been constant owing to growth in Asian markets.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMTBE is manufactured via the chemical reaction of methanol and isobutylene. Methanol is derived from natural gas, and isobutylene is derived from butane obtained from crude oil or natural gas, thus MTBE is derived from fossil fuels. In the United States, it was produced in very large quantities (more than 200,000 barrels (32,000?m3) per day in 1999) during its use as a fuel additive.\\r\\nMTBE is used as a fuel component in fuel for gasoline engines. It is one of a group of chemicals commonly known as oxygenates because they raise the oxygen content of gasoline.\\r\\nIn the US it has been used in gasoline at low levels since 1979, replacing tetraethyl lead as an antiknock (octane rating) additive to prevent engine knocking. Oxygenates also help gasoline burn more completely, reducing tailpipe emissions and dilute or displace gasoline components such as aromatics (e.g., benzene). Before the introduction of other oxygenates and octane enhancers, refiners chose MTBE for its blending characteristics and low cost.\\r\\nOther oxygenates are available as additives for gasoline including ethanol and other ethers such as ETBE.\\r\\nEthanol has been advertised as a safe alternative by agricultural and other interest groups in the US and Europe. In 2003, California was the first US state to start replacing MTBE with ethanol.\\r\\nAn alternative to ethanol is ETBE, which is manufactured from ethanol and isobutene. Its performance as an additive is similar to MTBE, but due to the higher price of ethanol compared to methanol, it is more expensive.\\r\\nHigher quality gasoline is also an alternative, so that additives such as MTBE are unnecessary. Iso-octane itself is used. MTBE plants can be retrofitted to produce iso-octane from isobutylene.[3][4]\\r\\nMTBE is extensively used in industry as a safer alternative to diethyl ether (which is commonly used in academic research) as the tert-butyl group prevents MTBE from forming potentially explosive peroxides. It is also used as a solvent in academic research,[5][6][7] although it is less commonly used than diethyl ether. Although an ether, MTBE is a poor Lewis base and does not support formation of Grignard reagents. It is also unstable toward strong acids. It reacts dangerously with bromine.[8]\\r\\nMTBE forms azeotropes with water (52.6?C; 96.5% MTBE)[9] and methanol (51.3?C; 68.6% MTBE).[10]\\r\\nIn a procedure called contact dissolution therapy, MTBE is injected directly into the gallbladder to dissolve gallstones.[11][12]\\r\\nMTBE gives water an unpleasant taste at very low concentrations. MTBE is often introduced into water-supply aquifers by leaking underground storage tanks (USTs) at gasoline stations or by gasoline containing MTBE spilled onto the ground. The higher water solubility and persistence of MTBE cause it to travel faster and farther than many other components of gasoline when released into an aquifer.[13]\\r\\nMTBE is biodegraded by the action of bacteria. In the proper type of bioreactor, such as a fluidized bed bioreactor, MTBE can be rapidly and economically removed from water to undetectable levels. Activated carbon produced from coconut shells and optimized for MTBE adsorption may reduce MTBE to undetectable levels,[14] although this level of reduction is likely only in the most ideal circumstances. There are currently no known published cases of any in-situ treatment method which has been capable of reducing contaminant concentrations to baseline (pre-development) conditions within the aquifer soil matrix itself.\\r\\nAccording to the IARC, a cancer research agency of the World Health Organization, MTBE is not classified as a human carcinogen. MTBE can be tasted in water at concentrations of 5 ÿ 15?g/l.[15]\\r\\nAs of 2007, researchers have limited data about the health effects of ingestion of MTBE. The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has concluded that available data are inadequate to quantify health risks of MTBE at low exposure levels in drinking water, but the data support the conclusion that MTBE is a potential human carcinogen at high doses.[16]\\r\\nIn 2000, EPA drafted plans to phase out the use of MTBE nationwide over four years.[citation needed] Some states enacted MTBE prohibitions without waiting for federal restrictions. California banned MTBE as a gasoline additive in 2002.[17] The State of New York banned the use of MTBE as a \\"fuel additive\\", effective in 2004.[18] MTBE use is still legal in the state for other industrial uses.[19]\\r\\nThe Energy Policy Act of 2005, as approved by the U.S. House of Representatives, did not include a provision for shielding MTBE manufacturers from water contamination lawsuits. This provision was first proposed in 2003 and had been thought by some to be a priority of Tom DeLay and Rep. Joe Barton, then chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee.[20] This bill did include a provision that gives MTBE makers, including some major oil companies, $2 billion in transition assistance while MTBE was phased out over the next nine years.[21] Due to opposition in the Senate,[22] the conference report dropped all MTBE provisions. The final bill was signed into law by President George W. Bush.[23] The lack of MTBE liability protection is resulting in a switchover to the use of ethanol as a gasoline additive.\\r\\nMTBE removal from groundwater and soil contamination in the U.S. was estimated to cost from $1 billion[24] to $30 billion,[25] including removing the compound from aquifers and municipal water supplies and replacing leaky underground oil tanks. In one case, the cost to oil companies to clean up the MTBE in wells belonging to the city of Santa Monica, California was estimated to exceed $200 million.[26] In another case, New York City estimated a $250 million cost for cleanup of a single wellfield in the borough of Queens in 2009.[27] In 2013 a jury awarded the State of New Hampshire $236 million in damages in order to treat groundwater contaminated by MTBE.[28]\\r\\nAs of 2016, hundreds of lawsuits are still pending regarding MTBE contamination of public and private drinking water supplies.[citation needed]\\r\\nEPA first listed MTBE in 1998 as a candidate for development of a national Maximum Contaminant Level (MCL) standard in drinking water.[29] As of 2018 the Agency has has not announced whether it will develop an MCL.[30] EPA uses toxicity data in developing MCLs for public water systems.[31]\\r\\nCalifornia established a state-level MCL for MTBE in 2000.[32]","input":"Why is mtbe used as a gasoline additive?"},{"output":"18 years","context":"The legal age of consent for sexual activity varies by jurisdiction across Asia, from age 12 to age 21. The specific activity engaged in or the gender of its participants can also be affected by the law. Below is a discussion of the various laws dealing with this subject. The highlighted age refers to an age at or above which an individual can engage in unfettered sexual relations with another who is also at or above that age. Other variables, for example homosexual relations or close in age exceptions may exist and are noted when relevant, for example in Indonesia.\\r\\nThe below is a list of all jurisdictions in Asia as listed in List of sovereign states and dependent territories in Asia.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSexual activity outside marriage is illegal in Afghanistan.

The penalty of imprisonment exceeding 10 years is the sentence for anyone who has sex with a woman who is over sixteen years but less than twenty one years, with consent.\\r\\nThis age of consent applies to women who marry without the permission of their fathers.[5]\\r\\nThe Penal Code of Bangladesh considers 14 years as the age of consent.[6]\\r\\nThe age of consent in Bhutan is 18 regardless of gender or sexual orientation, according to Article 183 of the Penal Code of Bhutan.[7]\\r\\nThe age of consent in Brunei is 16.\\r\\nArticle 2 of this Act determines the offence as follows: Any person who has or attempts to have carnal knowledge of a girl under the age of sixteen (16) years except by way of marriage, shall be guilty of an offence: Penalty, imprisonment for a term which shall not be less than 2 years and not more than 7 years and to whipping not exceeding 24 strokes of the rattan in the case of an adult or 12 strokes of the rattan in the case of a youthful offender.[8]\\r\\nThe age of consent in Cambodia is 15 regardless of gender or sexual orientation.[9] The age of consent in this country is determined by Article 8, of Chapter 4 (Debauchery) of the Law on Suppression of the Kidnapping, Trafficking, and Exploitation of Human Beings, which has been specifically enacted to prohibit sex with children under 15. The law prohibits \\"debauchery\\" with a child under 15, and this term (the original Cambodian word is anacha) has been interpreted by courts to forbid any form of sexual conduct (both consensual and non-consensual; both 'ordinary' sex and paid sex) with a child under 15. This is the main legal tool used to prosecute foreigners engaging in child sex tourism in Cambodia.[10][11][12][13]\\r\\nArticle 8 of the 'Law on Suppression of the Kidnapping, Trafficking, and Exploitation of Human Beings' states, Any person who commits acts of debauchery involving a minor below 15 years old, even if there is consent from the concerned minor, or even if the person has bought such minor from someone else or from a pimp, shall be punished by ten (10) to twenty (20) years in prison. In case of repeat offenses, the maximum punishment term shall be applied.[14]\\r\\nIn China the age of consent for sexual activity is 14 years, regardless of gender or sexual orientation.[15] Chinese law defines statutory rape as having sex with a girl who is less than fourteen years of age. A five-year prison sentence and fine may result if the girl under 14 years of age was acting as a prostitute.[16] On August 2015, the law concerning underage prostitutes was repealed. The Statutory rape law now applies to underage prostitution as well.[17]\\r\\nIn Hong Kong the age of consent for sexual activity is 16 regardless of gender or sexual orientation.[18]However, the age of consent for a female receiving anal sex is 21.[19]\\r\\nUnder s.124 of the Crimes Ordinance (Cap.200),[18] a man who has unlawful sexual intercourse with a girl under the age of 16 shall be liable to imprisonment for 5 years. Under s.123 of the Crimes Ordinance,[20] a man who has unlawful sexual intercourse with a girl under the age of 13 shall be liable to imprisonment for life.\\r\\nUnder s.122 of the Crimes Ordinance,[21] a person under the age of 16 cannot in law give any consent which would prevent an act being an assault for the purposes of indecent assault. Hence, a woman who has sexual activity with a boy or a girl under 16 will be prosecuted under this section.\\r\\nThe previous position regarding homosexual couples is contained in s.118C which provides that a man who commits or suffers to commit buggery with a man under the age of 21 is liable on conviction on indictment to imprisonment for life.[22] However, this section was struck down as unconstitutional in Leung TC William Roy v Secretary for Justice.[23] Hence, the age of consent between two males have been effectively equalized with that between a male and a female, which is 16.\\r\\nPrior to 2012 there was a presumption that a male minor under 14 could not consent to sexual intercourse under any circumstances. The law was changed after a 13-year-old boy attacked a 5-year-old girl at a Chai Wan hospital ward; the prosecution was unable to convict him of rape, instead only able to do so for indecent assault. In 2015 an 11-year-old boy and a 13-year-old boy were arrested after they were found having sex with an 11-year-old girl. Under the new laws they have the possibility of having the maximum sentence of life in prison.[24]\\r\\nThe general age of consent in Macau is 14, regardless of gender or sexual orientation.

In 1949, it was raised to 15 after agitation from women groups about the adverse effect of early pregnancy. In 1982, it was again raised to 16.[28] On 3 April 2014 the Criminal Law (Amendment) Act, 2013 came into effect which raised the legal permissible age for sexual consent from 16 to 18. Although, the Criminal Law (Amendment) Act, 2013 initially sought to lower the age to 16, it was set at 18 due to political pressure from conservative parties.[29]\\r\\nSection 375 reads: A man is said to commit \\"rape\\" if he (...) Sixthly  With or without her consent, when she is under eighteen years of age. There is an exception clause under Section 375, which stipulates: \\"Sexual intercourse or sexual acts by a man with his own wife, the wife not being under ?fteen years of age, is not rape\\".[30]\\r\\nThere is a standing legal confusion as to Marital Rape within prohibited Child Marriages in India. Marital rape per se is not a crime in India; but the position with regard to children is confusing. While the exception under the criminal law (section 375, Indian Penal Code, 1860) applicable to adults puts an exception and allows marital rape of a girl child between the age of 15ÿ18 years by her husband; another new and progressive legislation Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012 disallows any such sexual relationships and puts such crimes with marriages as an aggravated offense.

It was used to prosecute people for having anal or oral sex, although prosecutions are rare. The law was constitutionally challenged at the Delhi High Court in 2009 for violating the human rights of sexual minorities. But, after the Delhi High Court declared some parts of the law unconstitutional on the issue, the age of consent for consensual homosexual sex was set at 18.[31] However, on 11 December 2013, the Supreme Court of India overturned the verdict.[32]\\r\\nAccording to the Indonesian Penal Code article 287, the Age of Consent in Indonesia is 15 years old.[33] The age of consent is the minimum age at which an individual is considered legally old enough to consent to participation in sexual activity. Individuals aged 14 or younger in Indonesia are not legally able to consent to sexual activity, and such activity may result in prosecution for statutory rape or the equivalent local law.\\r\\nEven though the Age of Consent is 15 years old, the offender can only be charged and prosecuted if there is legal complaint lodged to the law enforcement. Exception to this law is when the age of the victim is under 12 years old, or under certain circumstances such as bodily injury or incest.\\r\\nHowever under Child Protection Act, the Age of Consent could be raised higher to 18 years old.[34] The argument used is that sexual act to a child could results in bodily and mental injury, while the definition of a child is anyone who is under 18 years old. A reported court verdict using the Child Protection Act was done back in 2009 against an Australian national.[35]\\r\\nIn Iran, sex outside marriage, regardless of age, is illegal.[36][37] The minimum age of marriage in Iran is 18 for men and 15 for women.[38][39] Ways around these regulations include temporary marriages (Nikah mutah).[40] With the permission of a court girls may marry at a younger age; during 2010 as many as 42,000 children aged between 10 and 14 were married,[41] and 716 girls younger than 10 had wed.[42]\\r\\nThe age of consent in Iraq is 18. \\"Any person who sexually assaults a boy or girl under the age of 18 without the use of force, menaces or deception is punishable by detention...\\"\\r\\n\\"Any person who has sexual intercourse with a female relative to the third generation under the age of 15 with her consent and the offence leads to her death, to pregnancy or loss of virginity [is punishable by death].\\"[43]\\r\\nHowever, the age of consent might change in the future to the age of nine for females and age of 15 for the males.[44][45] However, some reporters believe that the draft suggests that there will not be an age of consent.[46][47][48]\\r\\nAccording to the Israeli Penal Code of 1977 the age of consent in Israel is 16 regardless of gender or sexual orientation, for any form of sexual relations involving penetration (unless the person above 16 is the one being penetrated - in that case the age of consent is 14). In all cases that don't involve penetration, the age of consent is 14 (for both heterosexual and homosexual activities ). A special case arises when a person aged 14 or 15 had sexual relations with an older partner; in this case the older partner would be exempt of criminal liability if three conditions are met: the age difference between the partners was less than three years, the younger partner gave consent and the act was done out of \\"regular friendly relations\\" and without the abuse of power.\\r\\nThe Japanese Penal Code sets a minimal age of consent of 13 regardless of gender or sexual orientation.[49] However, the Children Welfare Act chapter 34 forbids any act of \\"fornication\\" (k) with children (here defined as anyone under 18 years of age)[50] with prefectures and districts specifying further details in (largely similar) \\"obscenity ordinances\\" (k) like adding exemptions for sex in the context of a sincere romantic relationship (typically determined by parental approval).[51]\\r\\nIt has been stated[52] that there are two territories of Japan that have their own local age of consent laws  Marcus Islands and Okinotori Islands  with an age of consent of 13.

It is also exported to over 55 countries. Kangaroo leather is recognised as the strongest lightweight leather throughout the world and extensively used in first class sporting shoes and gloves.[4]\\r\\nOf the 48 species of macropods (kangaroos) in Australia, only six can be commercially harvested.[1]\\r\\nOver 99% of the commercial kangaroo harvest occurs in the arid grazing rangelands. The populations of kangaroos in these areas are estimated every year in each State by well-developed aerial survey techniques. These are sparsely timbered, [savannah] type ecosystems; hence, it is possible to fly over them and count the large animals, such as kangaroos, seen. Using either low-flying fixed-wing aircraft or helicopters, flying at heights of two to 300 meters, the National Parks authorities count the numbers of kangaroos seen over fixed transects. Thirty years of such monitoring have allowed them to develop sophisticated and accurate techniques of extrapolating out to total population numbers.[5] Kangaroos are one of only a very few species (including humans) which have an annual census of their populations.\\r\\nCurrent populations stand around 25 million.[6] This means the numbers of kangaroos in Australia are similar to cattle numbers.[7]\\r\\nIt is widely accepted that within the rangelands kangaroos are now more common than prior to European settlement.[5] This situation has arisen due to the increased food and water supply generated by the activities of the sheep and cattle industry. Prior to European settlement, these areas had very few places of surface water from which kangaroos could drink. The pastoral industry has tapped into below-ground water supplies to the point where now very few points in the rangelands are further than 3?km from a permanent water source and no point is further than 10?km.[8]\\r\\nFor any kangaroo species to be harvested, the State's National Parks authority must have a detailed management plan approved by the federal conservation department. These plans must detail the population monitoring and quota-setting controls and the controls over the take, and they must be renewed every five years.[1]\\r\\nEach year after the population estimate is obtained, each management plan will set a maximum allowable take (quota) of between 10 and 20% of total population. The State's authority will then issue individually and sequentially numbered plastic lockable tags. These tags are designed to ensure, once properly applied, any tampering with them will be perfectly obvious.[1] Populations fluctuate seasonally. Some evidence suggests a correlation between droughts and population decline.[9]\\r\\nEach kangaroo taken by licensed harvesters must have such a tag fixed to it and the harvester and processor must report back to the authorities on a monthly basis the details of the exact number of the tags they have used, where the tags were used, and what species, sex and weight of animal to which they were attached. The authority monitors the release and use of tags to ensure the harvest in any one area does not exceed the quota.\\r\\nThe complexity and detail of the controls in the management plans can be indicated by a brief examination of the NSW plan. It divides the State into 15 different zones, 14 in which commercial kangaroo harvesting is allowed and one comprising over one-third of the State in which no harvesting can take place. The population is estimated in each individual zone and a harvest quota allocated to it. An appropriate number of tags are then issued to the conservation authority managers in each zone, and these can only be obtained by kangaroo harvesters on two days of each month. The harvester must use and submit reports for all tags issued before more can be obtained, and the issue of tags by zone is closely monitored. As soon as the harvest in any one zone approaches the quota, it is closed to commercial activity for the rest of the year.[10]\\r\\nTo purchase the tags issued by the authorities, kangaroo harvesters must be licensed as such. To do so, they must undergo training delivered by government-accredited agencies and approved by the Australian Tertiary and Further Education agency in the appropriate State. This training covers the regulatory controls and compliance requirements, the animal welfare controls, and the hygiene controls to which each harvester must adhere. They must then pass assessment in their knowledge and practices relating to these controls by two separate government departments. This will include assessment of their competency with their firearms. Only then will they be able to obtain the required licenses from the two authorities concerned.[1]\\r\\nThe kangaroo harvesters' licenses are conditional on adherence to the guidelines laid out in the federal Code of Practice for the Humane Shooting of Kangaroos. This specifies the minimum high-caliber firearms which can be used, and requires all animals to be head-shot, and documents procedures for the humane dispatch of any pouch young.[11]\\r\\nAny kangaroo or kangaroo product accepted by processors, be it for meat or skins, must have an approved tag applied to it and be supplied by a licensed harvester. Each processor must report on a monthly basis to the State authority the numbers of kangaroos purchased, from whom, and the relevant tags numbers.\\r\\nThe kangaroo management plans have been operating under strict and intensive supervision for almost 30 years. Over this period, the average harvest per year has been in excess of 2 million animals.\\r\\nDespite long-term harvests in excess of 2 million animals per year, the kangaroo population has consistently increased. Even following the worst drought on record (2005ÿ07), numbers in 2008 are still at what could be considered historically typical levels. Their current population of 25 million is only marginally lower than the 25-year average of 26.7 million (which is skewed by the very high levels reached during a run of highly favorable years in the late 1990s).[6]\\r\\nA project conducted by NSW Department of Agriculture, which employed extensive field study and highly sophisticated computer modeling techniques, has cast light on why kangaroo populations are so resilient to harvesting. The project examined harvester activity and modeled it in response to terrain and prices paid for kangaroos harvested. It demonstrated, in the areas investigated and at current prices, 20-40% of any one property will rarely be visited by a kangaroo harvester because the terrain is too rough or other limitations make it not economic to do so. These areas then become refugia, areas in which the resident kangaroo population is never harvested and from which the population expands to repopulate areas which are harvested.[12]\\r\\nThe authors conclude:\\r\\nModels presented here suggest that kangaroo populations may be more resilient to harvesting than we had previously thought.[12]\\r\\nThe argument is often mooted that kangaroo harvesting selects the largest animals and will therefore affect the genetic fitness of the species. The scientific data strongly refute this argument. Four separate reports have recently provided considerable evidence to discount these claims.\\r\\nSeveral trials have indicated uncontrolled kangaroo numbers present a risk to plant biodiversity. Kangaroos can not be commercially harvested in National Parks; as a result, their numbers often rise to excessive levels which sometimes require culling programs to be used. In biodiversity monitoring done following a cull at Hattah-Kulkyne National Park in Victoria, increased abundance of 20 rare or threatened plant species was recorded in areas where kangaroo were culled compared with control areas (Sluiter et al. 1997).[16]\\r\\nAll kangaroos taken for commercial use are harvested by professional shooters. State and federal government controls ensure that no kangaroo can enter the commercial industry unless it has been taken by a licensed kangaroo harvester who has passed an accredited training course, which includes training in the animal welfare aspects of kangaroo harvesting. In addition, anyone wishing to harvest kangaroos for human consumption must undergo assessment of their accuracy with their firearms. The accreditation and competency assessment are controlled by state government regulations in each State.[1]\\r\\nTo date agricultural development in Australia has largely been based on modified European systems, using European animals. In recent decades this Eurocentric view has come under considerable academic question. A ground swell of opinion is developing that Australians should develop management systems adapted to the specific environmental conditions, not impose systems adapted to Europe.[3] Under this philosophy use of free ranging populations of native animals adapted to the environment makes environmental sense.\\r\\nTo this end the University of New South Wales has implemented a major new project aimed at encouraging the development of farm enterprises based on using native plants and animals and specifically kangaroos. The project intends to monitor the environment benefits that accrue from doing so.[17]\\r\\nKangaroos emit small amounts of methane compared to domestic livestock. Cattle and sheep do so in large volumes, and methane is 21 times worse than carbon dioxide as a global warming gas. The beef industry alone is estimated to account for 11% of Australias carbon emissions.[18]","input":"What's the population of kangaroos in australia?"},{"output":"Florence Nightingale","context":"","input":"Who established the first higher education program for nurses?"},{"output":"George S.

More than 1,800 games were published under the Parker Brothers name since 1883.[1] Among its products were Monopoly, Cluedo (licensed from the British publisher and known as Clue in North America), Sorry!, Risk, Trivial Pursuit, Ouija, Aggravation, Bop It and Probe. The trade name is now defunct; former products are marketed under the \\"Hasbro Gaming\\" label.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nParker Brothers was founded by George S. Parker. Parker's philosophy deviated from the prevalent theme of board game design; he believed that games should be played for enjoyment and did not need to emphasize morals and values. He created his first game, called Banking, in 1883 when he was 16.[2] Banking is a game in which players borrowed money from the bank and tried to generate wealth by guessing how well they could do. The game included 160 cards which foretold their failures or successes. The game was so popular among family and friends that his brother, Charles Parker, urged him to publish it. George approached two Boston publishers with the idea, but was unsuccessful. Not discouraged, he spent $40 to publish 500 sets of Banking.[2] He eventually sold all but twelve copies, making a profit of $100.\\r\\nParker founded his game company, initially called the George S. Parker Company, in his hometown of Salem, Massachusetts in 1883.[3] When George's brother Charles joined the business in 1888, the company's name was changed to its more familiar form. In 1898 a third brother, Edward H. Parker, joined the company. For many years, George designed most of the games himself, and wrote all the rules. Many games were based on important events of the day: Klondike was based on the Alaskan gold rush, and War in Cuba was based on the impending SpanishÿAmerican War.\\r\\nThe game industry was growing, and the company was becoming very profitable. In 1906, Parker Brothers published the game Rook, their most successful card game to this day, and it quickly became the best-selling game in the country. During the Great Depression, a time when many companies went out of business, Parker Brothers released a new board game called Monopoly. Although the company had originally rejected the game in 1934, they decided to publish it the next year.[4] It was an instant success, and the company had difficulty keeping up with demand. The company continued to grow throughout the next several decades, producing such lasting games as Clue, Risk, and Sorry!\\r\\nParker Brothers marketed its first puzzle in 1887. The most highly sought of Parker puzzles are the wooden Parker Pastimes. Parker also produced children's puzzles, as well as the Climax, Jig-A-Jig, Jig Wood, and Paramount lines. According to Jigsaw Puzzles: An Illustrated History and Price Guide, by Anne D. Williams, Parker Bros. closed the Pastime line in the 1950s and their die-cut puzzles were phased out in the late 1970s.[5]\\r\\nEven after George Parker's death, the company remained family-owned until 1968 when General Mills purchased the company. After this, Parker Brothers produced the first Nerf ball, which became another major national hit. In the UK during the 1970s, Parker Bros. was the games division of Palitoy (also a General Mills company), and produced a variety of releases such as Escape from Colditz. By the turn of the decade, the company relocated to Beverly, Massachusetts.\\r\\nThe company began to produce electronic versions of their popular board games in the late 1970s and early 1980s. At this time, the company ventured into the toy market with the electronic action figure, Rom the Spaceknight, in 1977. Although the toy proved a failure, the licensed comic book published by Marvel Comics ran for years after the toy was discontinued. They also produced video games for various systems during the early 1980s, with home ports of many popular arcade games like Konami's Frogger, Popeye, Gottlieb games like Q*bert and Reactor, the first video games based on the Star Wars movies, The Empire Strikes Back, Jedi Arena, and Death Star Battle, and more.\\r\\nIn early 1983, Parker Brothers spent US$15 million establishing a book publishing branch;[6] their first titles featured the American Greetings franchises, Care Bears and Strawberry Shortcake.[6][7] The branch published twelve titles by February 1984; sales of these books totalled 3.5 million units.[8] Parker Brothers also operated a record label around the same time; one of its releases, based on Coleco's Cabbage Patch Kids and involving Tom and Stephen Chapin titled Cabbage Patch Dreams,[8] was certified Gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) in July 1984.[6]\\r\\nIn 1985, General Mills merged the company with their subsidiary Kenner; this new company, Kenner Parker Toys Inc., was acquired by Tonka in 1987.\\r\\nTonka, including Parker Brothers, was bought in 1991 for about $516 million by Hasbro which also owned the Milton Bradley Company.[9] Following the acquisition, Parker Brothers continued to have its corporate offices in Beverly, but production of the games were moved to Milton Bradley's headquarters in East Longmeadow.[10] In 1998, Parker Brothers and Milton Bradley were consolidated at the new Hasbro Games campus (based in Parker Brother's former headquarters).[11]","input":"Who was the founder of the parker brothers?"},{"output":"Harold \\"Hal\\" Jordan","context":"Green Lantern is the name of several superheroes appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics. They fight evil with the aid of rings that grant them a variety of extraordinary powers.\\r\\nThe first Green Lantern character, Alan Scott, was created in 1940 by Martin Nodell during the initial popularity of superheroes. Alan Scott usually fought common criminals in New York City with the aid of his magic ring.\\r\\nThe Green Lanterns are among DC Comics' longer lasting sets of characters. They have been adapted to television, video games, and motion pictures.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMartin Nodell (using the name Mart Dellon) created the first Green Lantern. He first appeared in the Golden Age of comic books in All-American Comics #16 (July 1940), published by All-American Publications, one of three companies that would eventually merge to form DC Comics.\\r\\nThis Green Lantern's real name was Alan Scott, a railroad engineer who, after a railway crash, came into possession of a magic lantern which spoke to him and said it would bring power. From this, he crafted a magic ring which gave him a wide variety of powers. The limitations of the ring were that it had to be \\"charged\\" every 24 hours by touching it to the lantern for a time, and that it could not directly affect objects made of wood. Alan Scott fought mostly ordinary human villains, but he did have a few paranormal ones such as the immortal Vandal Savage and the zombie Solomon Grundy. Most stories took place in New York.\\r\\nAs a popular character in the 1940s, the Green Lantern featured both in anthology books such as All-American Comics and Comic Cavalcade, as well as his own book, Green Lantern. He also appeared in All Star Comics as a member of the superhero team known as the Justice Society of America.\\r\\nAfter World War II the popularity of superheroes in general declined. The Green Lantern comic book was cancelled with issue #38 (MayÿJune 1949), and All Star Comics #57 (1951) was the character's last Golden Age appearance. When superheroes came back in fashion in later decades, the character Alan Scott was revived, but he was forever marginalized by the new Hal Jordan character who had been created to supplant him (see below). Initially, he made guest appearances in other superheroes' books, but eventually got regular roles in books featuring the Justice Society. He never got another solo series. Between 1995 and 2003, DC Comics changed Alan Scott's superhero codename to \\"Sentinel\\" in order to distinguish him from the newer and more popular science fiction Green Lanterns.\\r\\nIn 2011, the Alan Scott character was revamped. His costume was redesigned and the source of his powers was changed to that of the mystical power of nature (referred to in the stories as \\"the Green\\").\\r\\nIn 1959, Julius Schwartz reinvented the Green Lantern character as a science fiction hero named Hal Jordan. Hal Jordan's powers were more or less the same as Alan Scott's, but otherwise this character was completely different than the Green Lantern character of the 1940s. He had a new name, a redesigned costume, and a rewritten origin story. Hal Jordan received his ring from a dying alien and was commissioned as an officer of the Green Lantern Corps, an interstellar law enforcement agency overseen by the Guardians of the Universe.[1]\\r\\nHal Jordan was introduced in Showcase #22 (SeptemberÿOctober 1959). Gil Kane and Sid Greene were the art team most notable on the title in its early years, along with writer John Broome.\\r\\nWith issue #76 (April 1970), the series made a radical stylistic departure. Editor Schwartz, in one of the company's earliest efforts to provide more than fantasy, worked with the writer-artist team of Denny O'Neil and Neal Adams to spark new interest in the comic book series and address a perceived need for social relevance. They added the character Green Arrow (with the cover, but not the official name, retitled Green Lantern Co-Starring Green Arrow) and had the pair travel through America encountering \\"real world\\" issues, to which they reacted in different ways  Green Lantern as fundamentally a lawman, Green Arrow as a liberal iconoclast. Additionally during this run, the groundbreaking \\"Snowbirds Don't Fly\\" story was published (issues #85 and #86) in which Green Arrow's teen sidekick Speedy (the later grown-up hero Red Arrow) developed a heroin addiction that he was forcibly made to quit. The stories were critically acclaimed, with publications such as The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, and Newsweek citing it as an example of how comic books were \\"growing up\\".[2] However, the O'Neil/Adams run was not a commercial success, and the series was cancelled after only 14 issues, though an additional unpublished three installments were finally published as backups in The Flash #217-219.[3]\\r\\nThe title would know a number of revivals and cancellations. Its title would change to Green Lantern Corps at one point as the popularity rose and waned. During a time there were two regular titles, each with a Green Lantern, and a third member in the Justice League. A new character, Kyle Rayner, was created to become the feature while Hal Jordan first became the villain Parallax, then died and came back as the Spectre.\\r\\nIn the wake of The New Frontier, writer Geoff Johns returned Hal Jordan as Green Lantern in Green Lantern: Rebirth (2004ÿ05). Johns began to lay groundwork for \\"Blackest Night\\" (released July 13, 2010[4]), viewing it as the third part of the trilogy started by Rebirth. Expanding on the Green Lantern mythology in the second part, \\"Sinestro Corps War\\" (2007), Johns, with artist Ethan van Sciver, found wide critical acclaim and commercial success with the series, which promised the introduction of a spectrum of colored \\"lanterns\\".\\r\\nThe series and its creators have received several awards over the years, including the 1961 Alley Award for Best Adventure Hero/Heroine with Own Book[5] and the Academy of Comic Book Arts Shazam Award for Best Continuing Feature in 1970, for Best Individual Story (\\"No Evil Shall Escape My Sight\\", Green Lantern vol. 2, #76, by Dennis O'Neil and Neal Adams),[6] and in 1971 for Best Individual Story (\\"Snowbirds Don't Fly\\", Green Lantern vol. 2, #85 by O'Neil and Adams).[7]\\r\\nWriter O'Neil received the Shazam Award for Best Writer (Dramatic Division) in 1970 for his work on Green Lantern, Batman, Superman, and other titles, while artist Adams received the Shazam for Best Artist (Dramatic Division) in 1970 for his work on Green Lantern and Batman.[6] Inker Dick Giordano received the Shazam Award for Best Inker (Dramatic Division) for his work on Green Lantern and other titles.[6]\\r\\nIn Judd Winick's first regular writing assignment on Green Lantern, he wrote a storyline in which an assistant of Kyle Rayner's emerged as a gay character in Green Lantern #137 (June 2001). In Green Lantern #154 (November 2001) the story entitled \\"Hate Crime\\" gained media recognition when Terry was brutally beaten in a homophobic attack. Winick was interviewed on Phil Donahue's show on MSNBC for that storyline on August 15, 2002[8] and received two GLAAD Media Awards for his Green Lantern work.[9]\\r\\nIn May 2011, Green Lantern placed 7th on IGN's Top 100 Comic Book Heroes of All Time.[10]\\r\\nAlan Scott's Green Lantern history originally began thousands of years ago when a mystical \\"green flame\\" meteor fell to Earth in ancient China. The voice of the flame prophesied that it would act three times: once to bring death (a lamp-maker named Luke Fairclough crafted the green metal of the meteor into a lamp; in fear and as punishment for what they thought sacrilege, the local villagers killed him, only to be destroyed by a sudden burst of the green flame), once to bring life (in modern times, the lamp came into the hands of a patient in a mental institution who fashioned the lamp into a modern lantern; the green flame restored him to sanity and gave him a new life), and once to bring power. By 1940, the lantern passed into the possession of Alan Scott, a young engineer. Following a railroad-bridge collapse of which he was the only survivor, the flame instructed Scott how to fashion a ring from its metal to give him fantastic powers as the superhero Green Lantern. He adopted a colorful costume and became a crime-fighter. Alan was a founding member of the Justice Society of America.\\r\\nAfter the Crisis on Infinite Earths (although the original origin story was still in continuity), a later Tales of the Green Lantern Corps story was published that brought Scott even closer to the Corps' ranks, when it was revealed that Alan Scott was predated as Earth's Green Lantern by a Green Lantern named Yalan Gur, a resident of China. Not only had the Corps' now-familiar green, black and white uniform motif not yet been adopted, but Yalan Gur altered the basic red uniform to more closely resemble the style of clothing worn by his countrymen. Power ultimately corrupted this early Green Lantern, as he attempted to rule over mankind, which forced the Guardians to cause his ring to manifest a weakness to wood, the material from which most Earth weapons of the time were fashioned. This allowed the Chinese peasants to ultimately defeat their corrupted \\"champion\\". His ring and lantern were burned and it was during this process that the intelligence inhabiting the ring and the lantern and linking them to the Guardians was damaged. Over time, when it had occasion to manifest itself, this \\"intelligence\\" became known as the mystical 'Starheart' of fable.\\r\\nCenturies later, it was explained, when Scott found the mystical lantern, it had no memory of its true origins, save a vague recollection of the uniform of its last master. This was the origin of Scotts distinctive costume. Due to its damaged link to them, the Guardians presumed the ring and lantern to be lost in whatever cataclysm overcame their last owner of record, thus Scott was never noticed by the Guardians and went on to carve a history of his own apart from that of the Corps, sporting a ring with an artificially induced weakness against anything made of wood. Honoring this separate history, the Guardians never moved to force Scott to relinquish the ring, formally join the Corps, or adopt its colors. Some sort of link between Scott and the Corps, however, was hinted at in a Silver Age crossover story which depicts Scott and Hal Jordan charging their rings at the same Power Battery while both reciting the \\"Brightest Day\\" oath. During the Rann-Thanagar War, it was revealed that Scott is an honorary member of the Corps.\\r\\nOn June 1, 2012, DC Comics announced that it would be introducing an alternate version of Alan Scott as a gay man in the title \\"Earth 2.\\" The New 52 issue was released on June 6, 2012.[11] In its story, Alan Scott and his partner Sam were both passengers aboard a train, but the latter was killed when their train was wrecked in the railroad-bridge collapse that Scott alone survived; a magical green flame found Alan amongst the rubble. Telling him he is to become an avatar of the flame's great power and that he must channel this power through an item of importance to his heart, Alan chooses the engagement ring he was to give his boyfriend, becoming Green Lantern. This alternate version is not a member of the Green Lantern Corps, which doesn't exist in Earth 2, but rather adopts the name Green Lantern for himself, for his powers derives his mystical powers from the Green, the elemental force which connects plant life on Earth.\\r\\nThe character of Harold \\"Hal\\" Jordan was a second-generation test pilot, having followed in the footsteps of his father. He was given the power ring and battery (lantern) by a dying alien named Abin Sur, whose spaceship crashed on Earth. Abin Sur used his ring to seek out an individual who was \\"utterly honest and born without fear\\" to take his place as a member of the corps. At one point, when Hal Jordan was incapacitated, it was revealed that there were two individuals matching the specified criteria on Earth, the other being Guy Gardner, and the ring chose Jordan solely because of his proximity to Abin Sur. Gardner then became listed as Hal's \\"backup\\", even though he had a strong friendship with Barry Allen (The Flash). Gardner would fill in if Jordan was unavailable or otherwise incapacitated. Later, when Gardner was put into a coma, it turned out that by then there was a third human suitable for the task, John Stewart, who was designated as the Earth Sector's \\"backup\\" Lantern. Jordan, as Green Lantern, became a founding member of the Justice League of America and as of the mid-2000s is, along with John Stewart, one of the two active-duty Lanterns in Earth's sector of space.\\r\\nJordan also automatically became a member of the Green Lantern Corps, a galactic \\"police\\" force which bears some similarities to the \\"Lensmen\\" from the science fiction series written by E.E. Smith, although both creators Julius Schwartz and John Broome denied ever reading Smith's stories.[12] Nevertheless, the early 1980s miniseries \\"Green Lantern Corps\\" honors the similarity with two characters in the corps: Eddore of Tront and Arisia.\\r\\nFollowing the rebirth of Superman and the destruction of Green Lantern's hometown of Coast City in the early 1990s, Hal Jordan seemingly went insane and destroyed the Green Lantern Corps and the Central Power Battery. Now calling himself Parallax, Hal Jordan would devastate the DC Universe on and off for the next several years. However, after Earth's sun was threatened by a Sun-Eater, Jordan sacrificed his life, expending the last of his vast power to reignite the dying star. Jordan subsequently returned from beyond the grave as the Spectre, the divine Spirit of God's Vengeance, whom Jordan attempted to transform into a Spirit of Redemption, which ended in failure.\\r\\nIn Green Lantern: Rebirth, it is revealed that Jordan was under the influence of a creature known as Parallax when he turned renegade. Parallax was a creature of pure fear that had been imprisoned in the Central Power Battery by the Guardians of the Universe in the distant past. Imprisonment had rendered the creature dormant and it was eventually forgotten, becoming known merely as the \\"yellow impurity\\" in the power rings. Sinestro was able to wake Parallax and encourage it to seek out Hal Jordan as a host. Although Parallax had been trying to corrupt Jordan (via his ring) for some time, it was not until after the destruction of Coast City that it was able to succeed. It took advantage of Jordan's weakened emotional state to lure him to Oa and cause him to attack anyone who stood in his way. After killing several Green Lanterns, Jordan finally entered the Central Power Battery and absorbed all the power, unwittingly freeing the Parallax entity and allowed it to graft onto his soul.\\r\\nThe Spectre bonded with Jordan in the hopes of freeing the former Green Lantern's soul from Parallax's taint, but was not strong enough to do so. In Green Lantern: Rebirth, Parallax began to assert control of the Parallax-Spectre-Jordan composite. Thanks to a supreme effort of will, Jordan was able to free himself from Parallax, rejoin his soul to his body and reclaim his power ring. The newly revived (and rejuvenated) Jordan awoke just in time to save Kyle Rayner and Green Arrow from Sinestro. After the Korugarian's defeat, Jordan was able to successfully lead his fellow Green Lanterns in battle against Parallax and with help from Guardians Sayd and Ganthet, imprisoned it within the personal power batteries of Earth's Lanterns, rendering the Green Lantern's rings free of the yellow impurity, provided they had the power of will to do so. Hal Jordan is once again a member of both the Justice League and the Green Lantern Corps, and along with John Stewart is one of the two Corps members assigned to Sector 2814, personally defeating Sinestro in the Sinestro Corps War. Jordan is designated as Green Lantern 2814.1.\\r\\nPost-Sinestro Corps War, DC Comics revisited the origin of Hal Jordan as a precursor to Blackest Night storyline, the next chapter in the Geoff Johns era on Green Lantern. Hal Jordan is the Green Lantern portrayed by Ryan Reynolds in the 2011 Green Lantern film.\\r\\nIn the late 1960s, Guy Gardner appeared as the second choice to replace Abin Sur as Green Lantern of sector 2814. Gardner was a candidate to receive Abin Sur's ring, but Jordan was closer. This placed him as the \\"backup\\" Green Lantern for Jordan. But early in his career as a Green Lantern, tragedy struck Gardner as a power battery blew up in his face, putting him in a coma for years. During the Crisis on Infinite Earths, the Guardians split into factions, one of which appointed a newly revived Gardner as their champion. As a result of his years in a coma, Guy was emotionally unstable, although he still mostly managed to fight valiantly. He has gone through many changes, including wielding Sinestro's yellow Guardian power ring, then gaining and losing Vuldarian powers, and readmission to the Corps during Green Lantern: Rebirth. He later became part of the Green Lantern Honor Guard, and oversees the training of new Green Lanterns. Gardner is designated as Green Lantern 2814.2 within the Corps.\\r\\nGuy Gardner helped lead the defense of Oa during the events of Blackest Night.\\r\\nFollowing his outstanding acts of valour, the Guardians appoint Guy to a unique role and highest rank in the Green Lantern Corps-Sentinel, answering directly to the Guardians themselves.\\r\\nIn the early 1970s, John Stewart, an architect from Detroit, was selected by the Guardians to replace a comatose Guy Gardner as the backup Green Lantern for Jordan. When Jordan resigned from the Corps for an extended period of time, Stewart served as the regular Lantern, coming into his own as he battled numerous Green Lantern villains and played a key role during the Crisis on Infinite Earths. During that time the Guardians of the Universe assigned Katma Tui to train Stewart, and the two developed romantic feelings for each other. They married, but Katma was soon murdered by longtime Green Lantern villain Star Sapphire. Stewart was crushed by this, and his life began to unravel. He reached his lowest point when he failed to save the planet Xanshi from destruction during the Cosmic Odyssey.\\r\\nJohn Stewart redeemed himself during the Mosaic crisis, when an insane Guardian abducted cities from all over the universe and placed them together on Oa. When the Guardian was defeated, the cities remained, as the other Guardians claimed to not have enough energy in the Central Power Battery to send them home. While they gathered the resources, John Stewart was assigned to oversee the jammed together communities. Using his intellect and unconventional thinking, he formed the warring communities into a cohesive society. He was aided by Rose Hardin, a farmer from West Virginia who was trapped on Oa, due to her town being abducted. Stewart once again found love with Rose, and the two of them came to feel more comfortable on their new world than they did back on Earth.\\r\\nStewart eventually deduced that the Guardians had the energy to send the cities home whenever they wanted, and that they let them remain on Oa as an experiment in cosmic integration, and also as a test for John Stewart. Stewart passed the test, and discovered that he was a figure in Oan prophecy. That was why the Guardians directly chose him instead of allowing a Power Ring to do it, as is standard procedure. John Stewart rose to a new level of awareness and became the first mortal Guardian of the Universe. He was also rewarded with the resurrection of Katma Tui, which caused him to break up with Rose.\\r\\nStewart's new powers and resurrected wife were taken from him when Hal Jordan went mad and became Parallax, absorbing the power from the Central Power Battery. During this time, the Green Lantern Corps was disbanded, and Stewart went on to lead the Darkstars, a new organization of universal peacekeepers led by the Controllers, offshoots of the Guardians of the Universe. During a battle, Stewart was badly injured and left paralyzed from the waist down. Hal Jordan eventually restored his ability to walk before sacrificing himself to save Earth's sun. Soon after, John Stewart found himself hunted by a serial killer from Xanshi called Fatality. She sought out any remnants of the Green Lantern Corps so that she may kill them in the name of avenging her doomed planet. Stewart fended off Fatality with residual energy he blasted from his body, which was in him due to Hal Jordan healing his crippling condition, however, this left him unable to walk again.\\r\\nStewart later visited Fatality while she was in custody, and she revealed to him that his back was fine, and he had the ability to walk if he wanted to. Stewart had imposed a psychological block upon himself due to feeling guilty over his sister's death. Stewart overcame this condition and was given a power ring by Kyle Rayner. Rayner departed Earth and Stewart became the Green Lantern of Earth once again, and also a member of the Justice League of America.\\r\\nWhen the Green Lantern Corps reformed, Stewart begun serving with Jordan as one of his sector's two designated regular-duty Lanterns, designated as Green Lantern 2814.3. Since then, he played key roles in all big Green Lantern events, such as The Sinestro Corps War and Blackest Night.\\r\\nIn the New 52 continuity, John Stewart was a U.S. Marine along with being an architect and the son of a social activist. He started a romantic relationship with his longtime enemy Fatality, who by that point had become a Star Sapphire and apparently forgave him for failing to save her world. In the events leading up to the \\"Uprising\\", Fatality was captured by shape-shifting Durlans, and a Durlan operative replicated her and took her place. John Stewart was at first hesitant about the relationship, but he eventually came to love Fatality, but it turns out that it had been the impostor by that point. In the final battle of the \\"Uprising\\", the impostor revealed itself as Verrat Din, an eons old Durlan, and destroyed Fatality's Star Sapphire ring, having no use for it after gaining the power of a Daxamite. Though Stewart defeated the powerful threat, he was shaken by having been misled so long, and having been intimate with a Durlan shape-shifter.\\r\\nStewart immediately set out to find the real Fatality, and when he did, he was astonished to discover that she had reverted to hating him. Fatality revealed that she was forcibly inducted into the Star Sapphires and brainwashed into being one of them. When her ring was destroyed, the spell was broken. Every moment she was with Stewart, she was trapped within herself. She revealed that she never loved John Stewart and departed, leaving Stewart emotionally crushed.\\r\\nJohn Stewart is notable for being the Green Lantern showcased on the Justice League and Justice League Unlimited cartoon shows, as well as being the primary Green Lantern of the DC Animated Universe.\\r\\nKyle Rayner was a struggling freelance artist when he was approached by the last Guardian of the Universe, Ganthet, to become a new Green Lantern with the very last power ring. Ganthet's reasons for choosing Rayner remained a secret for quite some time. Despite not being from the same cloth of bravery and fearlessness as Hal Jordanor perhaps because of thatRayner proved to be popular with readers and his fellow characters. Having continually proven himself on his own and with the JLA, he became known amongst the Oans as The Torch Bearer. He briefly operated as Ion after using the power of the entire Green Lantern Corps. He was responsible for the rebirth of the Guardians and the re-ignition of the Central Power Battery, essentially restoring all that Jordan had destroyed as Parallax.\\r\\nKyle Rayner was chosen to wield the last ring because he knew fear, and Parallax had been released from the Central Power Battery. Ganthet knew this and chose Kyle because his experiences dealing with fear enabled him to resist Parallax. Because Parallax is a manifestation of fear, and yellow, none of the other Green Lanterns, including Hal, could harm Parallax and, therefore, came under his control. Kyle taught them to feel and overcome fear so they could defeat Parallax and incarcerate him in the Central Power Battery once again.\\r\\nKyle became Ion, who is later revealed to be the manifestation of willpower in the same way Parallax is fear. During the Sinestro Corps War between the Green Lantern Corps and the Sinestro Corps, Ion was imprisoned while Parallax possesses Kyle. In Green Lantern (vol. 4) #24, Parallax consumes Hal Jordan. Hal Jordan enters into Kyle's prison, and with his help, Kyle finally escapes Parallax.\\r\\nAfterward, Ganthet and Sayd trap Parallax in the Lanterns of the four Green Lanterns of Earth. Ganthet asks Kyle to give up his right to be Ion and become a Green Lantern again. Kyle accepts, and Ganthet gives Kyle a power ring. Kyle is outfitted with a new costume including a mask that looks like the one from his first uniform. Kyle is now a member of the Green Lantern Corps Honor Guard, and has been partnered with Guy Gardner.\\r\\nKyle now shows up mostly as part of the ensemble cast of Green Lantern Corps. Corps rookie Sodam Yat took over the mantle of Ion. Sodam has made an appearance in the Legion of Super Heroes Final Crisis tie-in Legion of Three Worlds as the last surviving Green Lantern/Guardian of the Universe.\\r\\nKyle is designated as Green Lantern 2814.4 within the Corps.[citation needed]\\r\\nKyle Rayner died in Green Lantern Corps #42 (Jan. 2010) after sacrificing himself to save Oa from an attack by the Black Lantern Corps. The following issue, Kyle is brought back to life by the power of a Star Sapphire who connects Soranik Natu's heart to his heart.\\r\\nSimon Baz is a Lebanese American Muslim from the Detroit suburb of Dearborn, Michigan. He first appeared in The New 52! FCBD #1 before making his first full appearance in Green Lantern #0 during the \\"Rise of the Third Army\\" storyline written by Geoff Johns. He was caught by the police street racing in a stolen car with an armed bomb in the back of the van. While being questioned by authorities, Sinestro's Green Lantern ring chose Simon as its next ring bearer, recruiting him into the Green Lantern Corps. The squirrel-like Lantern B'dg follows, becoming Baz's mentor and friend. The Justice League eventually tracks Baz down and questions him as to how he came into the possession of a Green Lantern ring. Batman tries to disarm him by removing Simon's ring, but self-defense mechanisms of the ring prevent this.[13] Following the events of \\"Wrath of The First Lantern\\",[14][15][16][17] Simon Baz was offered the opportunity to join Amanda Waller and Steve Trevor's \\"Justice League of America\\" under the pretense that his criminal charges would be dropped and his innocence publicly declared after FBI Agent Franklin Fed vouched for him.[18] During the events of the \\"Trinity War\\" storyline, after Cyborg's (Victor) body was mangled by Crime Syndicate member \\"The Grid\\", Baz's ring was the only thing preventing Victor from death.[19] During the battle against Relic, when Lantern Guy Gardner and the Red Lantern Corps become the protectors of space sector 2814, Simon was appointed Green Lantern ambassador on earth by Hal Jordan. Additionally per Hals request Simon became the protector of Hal Jordan's family.[citation needed] In Green Lantern #20, after the fierce battle against the First Lantern, it was revealed that Simon Baz will go on to train the first female Green Lantern of Earth, Jessica Cruz.[17]\\r\\nFirst mentioned in Green Lantern #20 as the first female Green Lantern of Earth. Jessica Cruz is a young Latin American woman who was forced to become the unwilling host to the evil Ring of Volthoom after \\"Power Ring\\" dies in his alternate Earth universe. Though she is not technically \\"Power Ring\\", as she is not a member of the Crime Syndicate and has no association with the organization, for namesake purposes she is dubbed \\"Power Ring\\" while the ring uses her as a host. She is helped by the Justice League and Simon Baz, who help her understand her cursed powers. In the Darkseid War, she becomes trapped inside the Ring of Volthoom, as Volthoom himself takes over Jessica's body. She then battles the previous wearers of the ring with the help of Cyborg, and forces her body in front of the Black Racer (who at the time was controlling the Flash) and kills Volthoom. After the battle, whilst the League mourns her motionless body, a Green Lantern ring appears and Jessica is made the 6th Green Lantern of Earth, to everyone's surprise.\\r\\nIn Green Lantern: Rebirth #1, she meets up with Simon Baz to battle a Manhunter. This turns out to be an exercise controlled by Hal Jordan, as he needs them to protect Earth whilst he goes on a mission to find the rest of the Corps. He then fuses both their Lanterns into one, which can only be used when they are together. Hal also gives them membership into the Justice League to help with their training.\\r\\nThe daughter of Alan Scott, Jennifer-Lynn Hayden would discover she shared her father's mystical connection to the Starheart, which gave her the abilities of a Green Lantern. Choosing to follow in her father's footsteps, she became the superheroine Jade. She would later fight a manifestation of the Starheart and lose those abilities. When Jade was fighting an Okaaran monster, she was saved by an orange lantern named Cade and fell in love with him.\\r\\nAfter Jade was stripped of her powers, Kyle Rayner gave her a copy of Hal Jordan's power ring. When Rayner left Earth to restart the Green Lantern Corps, Jade donned the classic Green Lantern uniform and served as the planet's Green Lantern until losing the ring during a battle with the villain Fatality. Later, when the ring was returned to her, she changed her Green Lantern uniform to a modified version of Rayner's. Jade continued to function as a Green Lantern until Rayner, as Ion, used his power to restore her connection to the Starheart. During Infinite Crisis, she died while trying to stop Alexander Luthor, Jr. from destroying the universe to create a new multiverse. Upon her death, Jade returned her Starheart power to Rayner. In the Blackest Night event, her remains have been reanimated as one of the Black Lantern Corps after receiving a black power ring. She was resurrected by the Life Entity along with eleven other Black Lantern Corps members.\\r\\nSinestro was born on the planet Korugar and became Green Lantern of space sector 1417. He was a friend of Abin Sur and mentor to Hal Jordan. His desire for order was an asset in the Corps, and initially led him to be considered one of the greatest Green Lanterns. As the years passed, he became more and more fixated upon not simply protecting his sector, but on preserving order in the society of his home planet no matter what the cost. Eventually, he concluded that the best way to accomplish this was to conquer Korugar and rule the planet as a dictator. Exposed by Hal Jordan and punished, he later wielded a yellow ring of fear from Qward. Later in league with Parallax, he would establish the Sinestro Corps, which began the War of Light. Following Blackest Night and War of the Green Lanterns Sinestro would once again receive a Green Lantern ring and temporarily headline the monthly Green Lantern following The New 52.\\r\\nPremiering in Green Lantern: New Guardians Annual #1, Caul is a deep undercover Green Lantern operative that works in the Tenebrian Dominion. He unwillingly helps Carol Ferris and the New Guardians attempt to petition Lady Styx to send aid against the Third Army. For betraying them, the New Guardians leave Caul behind and he is forced to become part of a reality program called \\"The Hunted\\", stripped of his powers and with his discharged power ring embedded into his chest. Caul stars as part of an ensemble cast of spacebound DC characters including the Blue Beetle and a new Captain K'rot in the \\"Hunted\\" main feature of Threshold. Caul received his Green Lantern Ring after he shot and killed its previous bearer, unsure himself why he was then chosen. Caul is able to save Sh'diki Borough on the planet Tolerance after it had been bottled by Brainiac. Caul is later informed that The Hunted has been cancelled and offered the lead role on a new show, Team Cauldron with the rest of his friends and Hunted competitors. Caul agrees to the role, having his power ring re-embedded into his chest. He is granted a meeting with Lady Styx to finalize his new role. However, as soon as Caul materializes at her base, he is killed by multiple gunshots, as planned by Colonel T'omas T'morra. In a glimmernet commercial, it is shown that T'morra replaces Caul in the proposed new show. However Caul is shown alive later along with Captain K'rot in tow when the planet Telos manifests during Convergence investigating it alongside Superman, Supergirl, Guy Gardner and the Red Lanterns.\\r\\nThe ring is powered by willpower. Each Green Lantern wears a ring that grants them a variety of possibilities. The full extent of the ring's ability has never been rigorously defined in the stories, but two consistent traits are that it grants the power of flight and that all its effects are accompanied by a green light.\\r\\nEarly Green Lantern stories showed the characters performing all sorts of feats with the ring, from shrinking objects to turning people invisible. Later stories de-emphasized these abilities in favor of constructs.\\r\\nThe signature power of all Green Lanterns is the ability to conjure \\"constructs:\\" solid green objects that the Green Lantern can control telekinetically. These can be anything, such as a disembodied fist to beat a foe, a shield to block an attack, a sword to cut a rope, or chains to bind a prisoner. Whatever their shape or size, these constructs are always pure green in color, unless a Lantern is skillful enough to know how to change the EM spectrum the construct emits. Hal Jordan has shown the ability to have a construct emit kryptonite radiation under Batman's guidance.\\r\\nThe rings of the Green Lantern Corps allow their bearers to travel very quickly across interstellar distances, fast enough that they can efficiently patrol the universe. They allow the wearer to survive in virtually any environment, and also remove the need to eat, sleep and pass waste. The rings can translate practically any language in the universe. They possess powerful sensors that can identify and analyze objects. Lanterns are granted full access to all Guardian knowledge by their rings, through the Book of Oa.\\r\\nA noteworthy power the rings do not have is the ability to automatically heal injuries, though they can provide shielding. In Hal Jordan's origin story, Abin Sur passed on his ring to Hal because he was unable to treat his own fatal injuries. If the Green Lantern happens to be a skilled physician, then the ring can be invaluable as it can conjure any conceivable medical tool, but it cannot do much for a Lantern who lacks medical expertise. When Hal Jordan breaks his arm, the best he can do is conjure up a cast. This is further extended into an ability to replace large sections of one's injured body with constructs, but this too requires detailed biological knowledge of one's body and concentration enough to prolong the construct.\\r\\nAlan Scott's ring is unable to directly affect anything made of wood. Alan can conjure a green shield to block bullets, but a wooden club will pass through it effortlessly. The rings of Hal Jordan and his colleagues originally shared a similar weakness to anything colored yellow, though due to the removal of the yellow impurity from the Central Battery on Oa, more recent stories have removed this weakness.\\r\\nThe effectiveness of the ring is tied to the wearer's willpower. A Green Lantern with strong willpower will best a weaker-willed Lantern in a duel. Anything which weakens the Green Lantern's mind, such as a telepathic attack, may render his ring useless.\\r\\nGreen Lantern is famous for the oath he recites when he charges his ring. Originally, the oath was:\\r\\n...and I shall shed my light over dark evil.\\r\\nFor the dark things cannot stand the light,\\r\\nThe light of the Green Lantern!\\r\\nThis oath is also used by Lanterns Tomar-Re of sector 2813 and Chief Administrator Salaak.[20] In the mid-1940s, this was revised into the form that became famous during the Hal Jordan era:\\r\\nIn brightest day, in blackest night,\\r\\nNo evil shall escape my sight!\\r\\nLet those who worship evil's might\\r\\nBeware my power, Green Lantern's light!\\r\\nThe oath in this form is credited to Alfred Bester,[21] who wrote many Green Lantern stories in the 1940s. This version of the oath was first spoken by Alan Scott in Green Lantern #9 from the fall of 1943. Scott would revert to reciting his original oath after he was reintroduced during the Silver Age.\\r\\nMany Green Lanterns have a unique personal oath, but some oaths are shared by several Lanterns. They are usually four lines long with a rhyme scheme of AAAA or AABB.\\r\\nThe Pre-Crisis version of Hal Jordan was inspired to create his oath after a series of adventures in which he developed new ways to detect evasive criminals: in the first adventure, he used his ring as radar to find robbers who had blinded him with a magnesium flash; in the second, he tracked criminals in a dark cave by using his ring to make them glow with phosphorescence; finally, Jordan tracked safecrackers by the faint shockwaves from the explosives they had used.\\r\\nMedphyll, the Green Lantern of the planet J586 (seen in Swamp Thing #61, \\"All Flesh is Grass\\"), a planet where a sentient plant species lives, has the following oath:\\r\\nOther notable oaths include that of Jack T. Chance,\\r\\nand that of Rot Lop Fan, a Green Lantern whose species lacks sight, and thus has no concepts of brightness, darkness, day, night, color, or lanterns.\\r\\nSince Green Lantern: Rebirth and the re-establishment of the Green Lantern Corps, the only oath used has been the Brightest Day, Blackest Night version.\\r\\nIn Green Lantern (vol. 4) #27, the Alpha Lanterns use the oath:\\r\\nIn Legion of 3 Worlds, Sodam Yat in the 31st century ÿ the last of the Green Lanterns and the last of the Guardians ÿ recited a new oath:\\r\\nIn Batman: The Dawnbreaker #1, the Dawnbreaker (an amalgamation of Batman and Green Lantern from the Dark Multiverse's Earth-32) creates and recites his own oath after the death of the Guardians of the Universe and the Green Lantern Corps by his own hands:\\r\\nIn the video game, Infinite Crisis, Hal Jordan of Earth-13 (the Arcane universe) has his own variation:\\r\\nIn the animated TV series Duck Dodgers, Duck Dodgers temporarily becomes a Green Lantern after accidentally picking up Hal Jordan's laundry. In the first part of the episode, he forgets the real quote and makes up his own version:\\r\\nIn 2011, soon after the release of the Green Lantern movie, a trailer for The Muppets featured Kermit reciting a parody of the oath:[22]\\r\\nThe TV show, Mad, included a movie parody called \\"RiOa\\", a fusion of Green Lantern and Rio. Blu from Rio is turned into a Green Lantern, and recruits Big Bird, the Road Runner, Mordecai from Regular Show, Mumble from Happy Feet, and one of the Angry Birds and turns them into Green Lanterns.\\r\\nThe phrase \\"in the brightest day and in the darkest night\\" can also be found in a letter Sullivan Ballou wrote to his wife during the American Civil War, shortly before he was killed in the First Battle of Bull Run (1861).\\r\\nWith the exception of Alan Scott, all Lantern oaths are formatted in four lines of Iambic tetrameter.","input":"Who came first hal jordan or john stewart?"},{"output":"based in New York City","context":"The National Multiple Sclerosis Society (NMSS) is a non-profit organization based in New York City with chapters located throughout the United States.

It has been rated by Forbes magazine[1] as #63 in the 100 Largest U.S. Charities 2016 Ranking.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe NMSS supports and funds research activities in early research, translational research that develops laboratory results into treatments, and clinical trials to find out whether they are effective in treating MS. In 2012, the Society invested $44 million in more than 350 new and ongoing projects.[3][4]. As of 2016, NMSS has raised $974 million for research[5].\\r\\nResearch rewards consist of several types of contributions to researchers in early to late stages of their careers. The following is a list of awards distributed by NMSS[2] to researchers in 2017.\\r\\nThe Career Transition Fellowship program sponsors postdoctoral training and research funding for scientists who demonstrate a dedication to MS research. Awards are in amounts up to $550,000 for a total of five years of training and research. The training period covers two years and research funding covers three additional years for research in a new faculty position.\\r\\nThe NMSS offers funding to research centers with the intent to promote interaction among researchers. The Collaborative MS Research Center Awards program is intended to create collaboration between MS researchers, including independent investigators, and clinical research organizations. In addition, the program reaches out to professionals working in other fields of research to recruit them into MS research projects.\\r\\nMS Research Center Awards are obtained through an application process through the NMSS MS Grants web page.\\r\\nFast Forward is a commercial research funding entity under the NMSS which provides funding for drug development and MS research being conducted through commercial entities such as EMD Pharmaceuticals, the University of Cambridge, the University of Edinburgh, and others. Researchers interested in the program are able to apply for funding through the Commercial Funding Opportunities web page.\\r\\nThis award was named after a member of the Board of Directors of the NMSS. Its purpose was to provide funding for training of MS researchers who needed additional education regarding the disease. As of 2017, this award was on hold[3] and not accepting applications.\\r\\nHarry Weaver, PhD, was a researcher in the field of neuroscience who had a dedication to MS research. He was the Director of Research at NMSS from 1966 to 1977. The scholarship in his name is offered to provide salary and research funding for a period of five years to researchers who are beginning their careers in MS research. The program is most often supported through universities.\\r\\nThe Health Care Delivery and Policy Research (HCDPR) program funds investigators who are conducting research projects which address NMSS organization's priorities. These priorities are listed by the NMSS as funding, quality, outcomes, and costs for care related to MS.\\r\\nThe International Progressive MS Alliance was founded in 2012 as the International Progressive MS Collaborative. The MS Alliance membership is composed of MS organizations from around the world. The Alliance provides two different funding awards, including the Challenge Award[4] and Collaborative Network Award grants. Both grants provide funding over multiple years to researchers and institutions in the international community.[5]\\r\\nThis program supports a combination of mentors and MS postdoctoral training institutions to recruit and train MS rehabilitation fellows. Mentors are required to be experienced MS researchers who have an established and active participation in their field. Interested parties must submit an application for the program through the NMSS website.\\r\\nParticipants in the program include the Duke University School of Medicine,[6] the Weizmann Institute of Science,[7] University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, University of Utah,[8] and additional related institutions.\\r\\nThe American Academy of Neurology and NMSS have partnered to develop this grant program. The program focuses on providing grant funding to MS researchers. One such grant was issued in 2005 to support Dr. Green of the University of California San Francisco Medical Center, whose research focused on the optical nerve and retina in people with MS[9]..\\r\\nIn 2016, the American Academy of Neuroscience Clinician Scientist Development Program[10] awarded $3 million to research and training programs with a focus on neuroscience. The Clinician Scientist Development Award in Multiple Sclerosis was awarded to Joseph Sabatino, MD, PhD at the University of California San Francisco.\\r\\nHigh-risk pilot research programs[10] focus on cutting-edge ideas and methods which have not been tested which may contribute to MS medical research. The Pilot Research Grants provide one year of research funding to pilot programs in order to develop results which can be used to apply for long term funding programs.\\r\\nFormer employees of NMSS have made complaints about working for the organization. On the website Glassdoor.com, the company has received a rating of 2.9 out of 5 stars.[11] While some former employees did state that the organization demonstrated passion for supporting research and fundraising for MS, a majority claimed that the company offered low wages for employment. In addition, they also showed agreement that the company is understaffed and that senior leadership in the company has not been performing their duties satisfactorily, or demonstrating responsible management practices. Some comments suggested that the leadership was dishonest.\\r\\nThe website Indeed.com did have more positive claims about NMSS, including reinforcement for the organizations support for research and funding.[12] Many reviews stated that the employees had enjoyed their coworkers and their work. The most common complaint, however, was that the company is understaffed. In addition, former employees complained that management did a poor job of leading.\\r\\nOn October 26, 2012, Ruckus Sports, LLC filed a legal suit against the National Multiple Sclerosis Society complaining that the organization committed Trademark Infringement for its use of \\"Muckruckus MS\\" as the name for its adventure race fundraising event. Ruckus Sports claimed that the Ruckus Trademark had been advertised and used for marketing their adventure charity races since September 2010. The NMSS filed a trademark application for \\"Muckruckus MS\\" on November 21, 2011.\\r\\nThe legal complaint, under Case No. 91207735-OPP, was filed in Massachusetts, claiming that the NMSS had committed one count of Federal Trademark Infringement Under 15 U.S.C.  1125,[13] one count of Federal Unfair Competition,[14] one count of State Common Law Trademark Infringement under Massachusetts Law,[15] and one count of Unfair and Deceptive Trade Practices and Unfair Methods of Competition in Violation of Massachusetts General Law c. 93A.[16] According to the website PlainSite.com, there were 7 filings in the case, in which the NMSS filed a withdrawal of the Trademark application in January 2013. The website shows that the case was dismissed by the court on January 29, 2013.","input":"Where is the national multiple sclerosis society located?"},{"output":"Ryder","context":"PAW Patrol is a Canadian CGIÿanimated television series created by Keith Chapman. It is produced by Spin Master Entertainment in association with TVOKids and Nickelodeon, with animation provided by Guru Studio. In Canada, the series is primarily broadcast on TVOKids, which first ran previews of the show in August 2013. The series first aired on Nickelodeon in the United States on August 12, 2013.\\r\\nThe series focuses on a boy named Ryder who leads a pack of rescue dogs known as the PAW Patrol. They work together on missions to protect the shoreside community of Adventure Bay. Each dog has a specific set of skills based on a real-life profession. For example, Marshall has the abilities of a firefighter and Chase's responsibilities are similar to those of a police officer. They all reside in doghouses that can transform into customized vehicles when necessary. They are also equipped with backpacks called \\"pup packs\\" that contain tools, and the tools relate to the pups jobs.\\r\\nSpin Master has developed the show into a media franchise and released an ongoing line of toys based on it. PAW Patrol toy sales have generated millions of dollars in revenue for the corporation and increased Spin Master's presence in the preschool toy market.[3] The show, and its associated products, have received a variety of awards and nominations from associations such as the Academy of Canadian Cinema & Television and the Academy of Television Arts & Sciences.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nEach episode of PAW Patrol follows a similar pattern and features recurring themes. Episodes normally open with a scene depicting the dogs going about their everyday lives, often playing with dog toys or engaging in activities at the local playground. Ryder, a ten-year-old boy, is advised of a problem by receiving a call for help or by witnessing a situation himself. His most frequent caller is an accident-prone marine biologist named Cap'n Turbot, who knows much about Adventure Bay's wildlife. Ryder always alerts the dogs via their blinking pet tags. The team members report to their base, the Lookout, and enter its elevator. Marshall typically arrives last causing a humorous mishap that makes the other dogs laugh as the elevator rises. When they reach the top floor, they arrange themselves in a line. Chase announces that the team is ready for action as Ryder tells the pups what has happened. He chooses several members of the team, normally two first responders, to help solve whatever problem has emerged. They ride a slide down to their vehicles and complete their mission. When they have finished, Ryder says his catchphrase: \\"Whenever you're in trouble, just yelp for help!\\" and congratulates the pups.\\r\\nAccording to Spin Master, the concept for PAW Patrol stemmed from a prototype for a transforming truck toy.[6] After developing a relationship with Nickelodeon, Spin Master approached British television producer Keith Chapman to \\"invent a franchise\\" based on their model.[3] The PAW Patrol plot was ultimately based on one of Chapman's ideas.[7] The company hired toy designers to develop the format further; after the concept was in place, they began designing merchandise.[8]\\r\\nNickelodeon first announced that it had picked up PAW Patrol at the 2013 Licensing Expo in Las Vegas, Nevada.[9] The series became Spin Master's first solely-owned intellectual property (IP)[10] once it was released in August 2013.[11]\\r\\nSince it began production, the show's animation has been provided by Guru Studio. In a 2016 interview with Maclean's Magazine, Guru president Frank Falcone stated that his studio's animators were originally suspicious of the show's \\"toyetic\\" concept.[12] The series' rock-inspired[13] original score was composed by the Ontario-based group Voodoo Highway Music & Post. The opening theme song, and the ending song used in each episode include vocals performed by Scott Simons.\\r\\nWith each season of the show, new supporting characters and themes are introduced in its episodes. In a May 2016 interview for the Toronto Star, Spin Master president Ben Gadbois stated that his company would continue to introduce additional characters and concepts to increase the franchise's longevity and to expand upon the success of tie-in merchandise.[14] In August of the same year, Spin Master co-founder Ronnen Harary explained that these changes were intended to keep the show's content \\"fresh\\" and \\"relevant\\".[15]\\r\\nThe first season aired from August 2013 to August 2014. The second season premiered in August 2014; in Canada, it concluded in September 2015 and in the United States, it concluded in December 2015. A third season premiered in November 2015. A fourth season premiered February 6, 2017. Spin Master has confirmed that fifth and sixth seasons are in development.[16]\\r\\nThe series has been sold to TV networks in over 160 countries.[17]\\r\\nIn Canada, the series is shown on TVOKids, Knowledge Kids, Tl-Qubec and City Kids. In the United States, the series is aired on Nickelodeon with reruns on Nick Jr.\\r\\nAs required for Canadian programs aired on federally-funded networks, PAW Patrol has been dubbed in French for Quebec broadcasts and for its broadcast in France on TF1.[18] Canal Panda airs a European Portuguese dub.[19] A British English dub, which uses the same scripts as the Canadian version with minor changes, is shown on Channel 5 and Nick Jr. UK.[20] Anione, JEI TV, and KBS have all broadcast the Korean-dubbed version.[21] The show has been aired in the Icelandic language on Iceland's public broadcaster R~V since 2015.[22] The first two seasons were shown in Finnish on Yle TV2.[23] The video on demand platform Le.com obtained broadcast rights for a Mandarin Chinese-dubbed version of PAW Patrol in April 2016.[24]\\r\\nIn July 2016, film distribution company Notorious Pictures acquired the rights to an Italian theatrical release of the series.[25] Six episodes of PAW Patrol were screened as a package film in select Italian cinemas from December 22, 2016 until January 8 of the following year.[26] Sabahat Khan, of Spin Master partner RBC Capital Markets, has stated that he \\"wouldn't be surprised by a [North American] feature film down the line.\\"[3]\\r\\nPAW Patrol has received consistently high ratings on Nickelodeon. Viacom CEO Philippe Dauman cited the series as a source of Nickelodeon's 2014 ratings growth.[35] It ranked as the highest-rated, preschool TV program in the United States in November 2013[36] and held that position throughout the spring 2014 season.[37] The spot was briefly overtaken by Team Umizoomi reruns in July 2016, but PAW Patrol reclaimed the title later the same month.[38] Bloomberg L.P. described PAW Patrol as part of a \\"creative resurgence\\" that increased the Nick Jr. channel's viewership in 2016.[39] At Nickelodeon's 2016 upfront presentation for future advertisers, Cyma Zarghami named PAW Patrol one of two preschool shows to have significantly helped boost ratings for the network (the other being Blaze and the Monster Machines).[40]\\r\\nIn March 2015, two back-to-back premieres of the show ranked among the top twenty weekday showings (among total viewers) in Australia.[41] In May 2015, it was reported that PAW Patrol broadcasts on TF1 had been viewed by 45 per cent of households in France with preschool-aged children.[42]\\r\\nDespite the commercial success of the show which as of September 8, 2017 has 340,000 more viewers than ESPN's Sportscenter, critical reception has been mixed. Common Sense Media reviewer Emily Ashby gave the show a four-star rating, stating that \\"perhaps the show's best attribute is how it demonstrates the value of thoughtful problem-solving\\".[43] Randy Miller of DVD Talk recommended the show, calling it \\"packed with all the harmless action and cornball jokes that kids?... can't help but snicker at\\".[44] Stuff.co.nz reviewer Pattie Pegler also wrote favourably of the series, but felt that some of the characters \\"seem rather arbitrary, like Rocky the Recycling Pup\\".[45] The About Group's Carey Bryson gave the series a mixed review, criticizing its \\"formulaic\\" nature but affirming that the \\"show is not without funny moments\\".[13]\\r\\nA research study, commissioned by Sky in March 2016, reported that 16 per cent of surveyed British and Irish children named PAW Patrol as their favourite program.[46]\\r\\nCriticism has been directed toward the show's unequal gender representation because the team of dogs is primarily male and includes only one main female. Cat Conway of Dan Abrams' The Mary Sue rhetorically asked, \\"the police pup, firefighting pup, builder pup, sea-rescue pup, and whatever the hell Rocky does are all coded male, because of course you couldn't have a female police dog, could you?\\"[47] Brandy King of the Center on Media and Child Health \\"found the gender imbalance immediately noticeable\\" while watching the program.[48] Today's Parent noted in April 2015 that PAW Patrol images appeared frequently on Twitter with the hashtag \\"#IncludeTheGirls\\".[49]\\r\\nIn 2014, the series' theme song was nominated for Outstanding Original Song ÿ Main Title and Promo in the 41st Daytime Creative Arts Emmy Awards.[50] In 2016, the season two episode \\"Pups Save a Mer-Pup\\" was nominated for Best Animated Television/Broadcast Production for Preschool Children in the 43rd Annie Awards.[51] As of 2017, PAW Patrol has received four Canadian Screen Award nominations, winning one of them in 2016.[52]\\r\\nOn May 18, 2014, Spin Master introduced a toy line based on the television series at Toys \\"R\\" Us locations across Canada.[64] The line was not distributed to international markets until June 22 of the same year.[65] Dion Vlachos, a representative from Nickelodeon, was in charge of the U.S. product launch.[66]\\r\\nPAW Patrol has since become one of Spin Master's most profitable brands. Analysts for the National Bank of Canada reported that toys and games based on the show accounted for approximately $245 million U.S. (or 25 per cent) of Spin Master's gross product sales for 2015.[3] Spin Master chairman Anton Rabie noted in August 2016 that the \\"continuing strength\\" of PAW Patrol toys, in addition to new acquisitions and movie licenses, made up 40.5 per cent of the firm's second quarter revenue.[67] Marketing manager Emma Eden said that the toys were responsible for increasing the company's presence in the preschool market.[68] Throughout 2016, Spin Master's revenue grew more in this market than in any other toy category. PAW Patrol has been cited as the sole reason for this.[69]\\r\\nThe NPD Group named PAW Patrol the top new toy brand of 2015 in the United Kingdom.[70] The group also reported that it was the best-selling preschool license in France in the first quarter of 2015.[42] Dave Brandon, the chief executive officer of Toys \\"R\\" Us, listed the PAW Patroller vehicle toy as one of the 2015 holiday season's \\"hottest\\" items.[71][72] Argos the U.K. catalogue retailer included the PAW Patrol Air Patroller vehicle on its list of the toys it predicts will be bestsellers during the Christmas 2016 season.[73]\\r\\nIn April 2016, a stage show titled PAW Patrol Live: Race to the Rescue was announced.[74] The show features the PAW Patrol characters competing in a race. It toured Canada, the United States, Mexico, Australia and the Philippines.[75][76] A sequel show, titled PAW Patrol Live: The Great Pirate Adventure, was announced in June 2017. It follows the PAW Patrol as they rescue Cap'n Turbot from a cavern, and it will tour the same countries as its predecessor.[77]\\r\\nMascots based on the PAW Patrol characters have appeared at events across Canada, the United States, and the United Kingdom. They joined an \\"Etch A Sketch Day\\" celebration at Spin Master's office in Toronto on July 26, 2016.[78] The characters, along with replicas of the Lookout tower from the program, were included as part of the Nick Jr. Play Date Tour in autumn 2015.[79] Marshall and Chase made appearances at shopping malls throughout Nottingham, Suffolk, and Somerset in the U.K. in the summer of 2016.[80] Multiple meet-and-greet events attracted far more attendees than expected, with some reaching over 5,000 visitors.[81][82] They appeared for the first time in Northern Ireland at Glenarm Castle on July 13, 2016.[83] They are scheduled to appear regularly in a Nickelodeon-themed area of the Thurrock's Lakeside Shopping Centre located on the outskirts of London, England.[84]\\r\\nUnauthorized productions and events featuring the show's characters have attracted the attention of the shows distributor. In February 2016, several Greene King pubs in the U.K. scheduled breakfast events with costumed characters modelled after the pups. Nickelodeon forced the chain to stop every event by threatening a lawsuit if they went ahead.[85] There was some consumer backlash as a result, but the events were not held.[86]","input":"Who is the main character on paw patrol?"},{"output":"About 1,500","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\n? Calliasterellidae \\r\\n? Trichasteropsida[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nStarfish or sea stars are star-shaped echinoderms belonging to the class Asteroidea. Common usage frequently finds these names being also applied to ophiuroids, which are correctly referred to as brittle stars or \\"basket stars\\". About 1,500 species of starfish occur on the seabed in all the world's oceans, from the tropics to frigid polar waters. They are found from the intertidal zone down to abyssal depths, 6,000?m (20,000?ft) below the surface.\\r\\n\\r\\nStarfish are marine invertebrates. They typically have a central disc and five arms, though some species have a larger number of arms. The aboral or upper surface may be smooth, granular or spiny, and is covered with overlapping plates. Many species are brightly coloured in various shades of red or orange, while others are blue, grey or brown. Starfish have tube feet operated by a hydraulic system and a mouth at the centre of the oral or lower surface. They are opportunistic feeders and are mostly predators on benthic invertebrates. Several species have specialized feeding behaviours including eversion of their stomachs and suspension feeding. They have complex life cycles and can reproduce both sexually and asexually. Most can regenerate damaged parts or lost arms and they can shed arms as a means of defence. The Asteroidea occupy several significant ecological roles. Starfish, such as the ochre sea star (Pisaster ochraceus) and the reef sea star (Stichaster australis), have become widely known as examples of the keystone species concept in ecology. The tropical crown-of-thorns starfish (Acanthaster planci) is a voracious predator of coral throughout the Indo-Pacific region, and the northern Pacific sea star is considered to be one of the world's 100 worst invasive species.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe fossil record for starfish is ancient, dating back to the Ordovician around 450 million years ago, but it is rather sparse, as starfish tend to disintegrate after death. Only the ossicles and spines of the animal are likely to be preserved, making remains hard to locate. With their appealing symmetrical shape, starfish have played a part in literature, legend, design and popular culture. They are sometimes collected as curios, used in design or as logos, and in some cultures, despite possible toxicity, they are eaten.\\r\\n\\r\\nMost starfish have five arms that radiate from a central disc, but the number varies with the group. Some species have six or seven arms and others have 10ÿ15 arms.[3] The Antarctic Labidiaster annulatus can have over fifty.[4] Having descended from bilateral organisms, starfish move in a bilateral fashion, with certain arms acting like the front of the animal.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe body wall consists of a thin cuticle, an epidermis consisting of a single layer of cells, a thick dermis formed of connective tissue and a thin coelomic myoepithelial layer, which provides the longitudinal and circular musculature. The dermis contains an endoskeleton of calcium carbonate components known as ossicles. These are honeycombed structures composed of calcite microcrystals arranged in a lattice.[5] They vary in form, with some bearing external granules, tubercles and spines, but most are tabular plates that fit neatly together in a tessellated manner and form the main covering of the aboral surface.[6]  Some are specialised structures such as the madreporite (the entrance to the water vascular system), pedicellariae and paxillae.[5] Pedicellariae are compound ossicles with forceps-like jaws. They remove debris from the body surface and wave around on flexible stalks in response to physical or chemical stimuli while continually making biting movements. They often form clusters surrounding spines.[7][8] Paxillae are umbrella-like structures found on starfish that live buried in sediment. The edges of adjacent paxillae meet to form a false cuticle with a water cavity beneath in which the madreporite and delicate gill structures are protected. All the ossicles, including those projecting externally, are covered by the epidermal layer.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nSeveral groups of starfish, including Valvatida and Forcipulatida, possess pedicellariae.[7] In Forcipulatida, such as Asterias and Pisaster, they occur in pompom-like tufts at the base of each spine, whereas in the Goniasteridae, such as Hippasteria phrygiana, the pedicellariae are scattered over the body surface. Some are thought to assist in defence, while others aid in feeding or in the removal of organisms attempting to settle on the starfish's surface.[9] Some species like Labidiaster annulatus, Rathbunaster californicus and Novodinia antillensis use their large pedicellariae to capture small fish and crustaceans.[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nThere may also be papulae, thin-walled protrusions of the body cavity that reach through the body wall and extend into the surrounding water. These serve a respiratory function.[11] The structures are supported by collagen fibres set at right angles to each other and arranged in a three-dimensional web with the ossicles and papulae in the interstices. This arrangement enables both easy flexion of the arms by the starfish and the rapid onset of stiffness and rigidity required for actions performed under stress.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe water vascular system of the starfish is a hydraulic system made up of a network of fluid-filled canals and is concerned with locomotion, adhesion, food manipulation and gas exchange. Water enters the system through the madreporite, a porous, often conspicuous, sieve-like ossicle on the aboral surface. It is linked through a stone canal, often lined with calcareous material, to a ring canal around the mouth opening. A set of radial canals leads off this; one radial canal runs along the ambulacral groove in each arm. There are short lateral canals branching off alternately to either side of the radial canal, each ending in an ampulla. These bulb-shaped organs are joined to tube feet (podia) on the exterior of the animal by short linking canals that pass through ossicles in the ambulacral groove. There are usually two rows of tube feet but in some species, the lateral canals are alternately long and short and there appear to be four rows. The interior of the whole canal system is lined with cilia.[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen longitudinal muscles in the ampullae contract, valves in the lateral canals close and water is forced into the tube feet. These extend to contact the substrate. Although the tube feet resemble suction cups in appearance, the gripping action is a function of adhesive chemicals rather than suction.[14]  Other chemicals and relaxation of the ampullae allow for release from the substrate. The tube feet latch on to surfaces and move in a wave, with one arm section attaching to the surface as another releases.[15][16] Some starfish turn up the tips of their arms while moving which gives maximum exposure of the sensory tube feet and the eyespot to external stimuli.[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn some situations, particularly when hunting or in danger, starfish may move in a bilateral fashion. When crawling, some arms act as the leading arms, while others trail behind.[18][8] Most starfish cannot move quickly, a typical speed being that of the leather star (Dermasterias imbricata), which can manage just 15?cm (6?in) in a minute.[19] Some burrowing species from the genera Astropecten and Luidia have points rather than suckers on their long tube feet and are capable of much more rapid motion, \\"gliding\\" across the ocean floor. The sand star (Luidia foliolata) can travel at a speed of 2.8?m (9?ft 2?in) per minute.[20] When a starfish finds itself upside down, two adjacent arms are bent backwards to provide support, the opposite arm is used to stamp the ground while the two remaining arms are raised on either side; finally the stamping arm is released as the starfish turns itself over and recovers its normal stance.[18]\\r\\n\\r\\nApart from their function in locomotion, the tube feet act as accessory gills. The water vascular system serves to transport oxygen from, and carbon dioxide to, the tube feet and also nutrients from the gut to the muscles involved in locomotion. Fluid movement is bidirectional and initiated by cilia.[13] Gas exchange also takes place through other gills known as papulae, which are thin-walled bulges on the aboral surface of the disc and arms. Oxygen is transferred from these to the coelomic fluid, which acts as the transport medium for gasses. Oxygen dissolved in the water is distributed through the body mainly by the fluid in the main body cavity; the circulatory system may also play a minor role.[21]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe gut of a starfish occupies most of the disc and extends into the arms. The mouth is located in the centre of the oral surface, where it is surrounded by a tough peristomial membrane and closed with a sphincter. The mouth opens through a short oesophagus into a stomach divided by a constriction into a larger, eversible cardiac portion and a smaller pyloric portion. The cardiac stomach is glandular and pouched, and is supported by ligaments attached to ossicles in the arms so it can be pulled back into position after it has been everted. The pyloric stomach has two extensions into each arm: the pyloric caeca. These are elongated, branched hollow tubes that are lined by a series of glands, which secrete digestive enzymes and absorb nutrients from the food. A short intestine and rectum run from the pyloric stomach to open at a small anus at the apex of the aboral surface of the disc.[22]\\r\\n\\r\\nPrimitive starfish, such as Astropecten and Luidia, swallow their prey whole, and start to digest it in their cardiac stomachs. Shell valves and other inedible materials are ejected through their mouths. The semi-digested fluid is passed into their pyloric stomachs and caeca where digestion continues and absorption ensues.[22] In more advanced species of starfish, the cardiac stomach can be everted from the organism's body to engulf and digest food. When the prey is a clam or other bivalve, the starfish pulls with its tube feet to separate the two valves slightly, and inserts a small section of its stomach, which releases enzymes to digest the prey. The stomach and the partially digested prey are later retracted into the disc. Here the food is passed on to the pyloric stomach, which always remains inside the disc.[23] The retraction and contraction of the cardiac stomach is activated by a neuropeptide known as NGFFYamide.[24]\\r\\n\\r\\nBecause of this ability to digest food outside the body, starfish can hunt prey much larger than their mouths. Their diets include clams and oysters, arthropods, small fish and gastropod molluscs. Some starfish are not pure carnivores, supplementing their diets with algae or organic detritus. Some of these species are grazers, but others trap food particles from the water in sticky mucus strands that are swept towards the mouth along ciliated grooves.[22]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe main nitrogenous waste product is ammonia. Starfish have no distinct excretory organs; waste ammonia is removed by diffusion through the tube feet and papulae.[21] The body fluid contains phagocytic cells, coelomocytes, which are also found within the hemal and water vascular systems. These cells engulf waste material, and eventually migrate to the tips of the papulae, where a portion of body wall is nipped off and ejected into the surrounding water. Some waste may also be excreted by the pyloric glands and voided with the faeces.[21]\\r\\n\\r\\nStarfish do not appear to have any mechanisms for osmoregulation, and keep their body fluids at the same salt concentration as the surrounding water. Although some species can tolerate relatively low salinity, the lack of an osmoregulation system probably explains why starfish are not found in fresh water or even in many estuarine environments.[21]\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough starfish do not have many well-defined sense organs, they are sensitive to touch, light, temperature, orientation and the status of the water around them. The tube feet, spines and pedicellariae are sensitive to touch. The tube feet, especially those at the tips of the rays, are also sensitive to chemicals, enabling the starfish to detect odour sources such as food.[23] There are eyespots at the ends of the arms, each one made of 80ÿ200 simple ocelli. These are composed of pigmented epithelial cells that respond to light and are covered by a thick, transparent cuticle that both protects the ocelli and acts to focus light. Many starfish also possess individual photoreceptor cells in other parts of their bodies and respond to light even when their eyespots are covered. Whether they advance or retreat depends on the species.[25]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile a starfish lacks a centralized brain, it has a complex nervous system with a nerve ring around the mouth and a radial nerve running along the ambulacral region of each arm parallel to the radial canal. The peripheral nerve system consists of two nerve nets: a sensory system in the epidermis and a motor system in the lining of the coelomic cavity. Neurons passing through the dermis connect the two.[25] The ring nerves and radial nerves have sensory and motor components and coordinate the starfish's balance and directional systems.[11] The sensory component receives input from the sensory organs while the motor nerves control the tube feet and musculature. The starfish does not have the capacity to plan its actions. If one arm detects an attractive odour, it becomes dominant and temporarily over-rides the other arms to initiate movement towards the prey. The mechanism for this is not fully understood.[25]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe body cavity contains the circulatory or haemal system. The vessels form three rings: one around the mouth (the hyponeural haemal ring), another around the digestive system (the gastric ring) and the third near the aboral surface (the genital ring). The heart beats about six times a minute and is at the apex of a vertical channel (the axial vessel) that connects the three rings. At the base of each arm are paired gonads; a lateral vessel extends from the genital ring past the gonads to the tip of the arm. This vessel has a blind end and there is no continuous circulation of the fluid within it. This liquid does not contain a pigment and has little or no respiratory function but is probably used to transport nutrients around the body.[26]\\r\\n\\r\\nStarfish produce a large number of secondary metabolites in the form of lipids, including steroidal derivatives of cholesterol, and fatty acid amides of sphingosine. The steroids are mostly saponins, known as asterosaponins, and their sulphated derivatives. They vary between species and are typically formed from up to six sugar molecules (usually glucose and galactose) connected by up to three glycosidic chains. Long-chain fatty acid amides of sphingosine occur frequently and some of them have known pharmacological activity. Various ceramides are also known from starfish and a small number of alkaloids have also been identified. The functions of these chemicals in the starfish have not been fully investigated but most have roles in defence and communication. Some are feeding deterrents used by the starfish to discourage predation. Others are antifoulants and supplement the pedicellariae to prevent other organisms from settling on the starfish's aboral surface. Some are alarm pheromones and escape-eliciting chemicals, the release of which trigger responses in conspecific starfish but often produce escape responses in potential prey.[27] Research into the efficacy of these compounds for possible pharmacological or industrial use occurs worldwide.[28]\\r\\n\\r\\nMost species of starfish are gonochorous, there being separate male and female individuals. These are usually not distinguishable externally as the gonads cannot be seen, but their sex is apparent when they spawn. Some species are simultaneous hermaphrodites, producing eggs and sperm at the same time and in a few of these, the same gonad, called an ovotestis, produces both eggs and sperm.[29] Other starfish are sequential hermaphrodites. Protandrous individuals of species like Asterina gibbosa start life as males before changing sex into females as they grow older. In some species such as Nepanthia belcheri, a large female can split in half and the resulting offspring are males. When these grow large enough they change back into females.[30]\\r\\n\\r\\nEach starfish arm contains two gonads that release gametes through openings called gonoducts, located on the central disc between the arms. Fertilization is generally external but in a few species, internal fertilization takes place. In most species, the buoyant eggs and sperm are simply released into the water (free spawning) and the resulting embryos and larvae live as part of the plankton. In others, the eggs may be stuck to the undersides of rocks.[31] In certain species of starfish, the females brood their eggs ÿ either by simply enveloping them[31] or by holding them in specialised structures. Brooding may be done in pockets on the starfish's aboral surface,[32][33] inside the pyloric stomach (Leptasterias tenera)[34] or even in the interior of the gonads themselves.[29] Those starfish that brood their eggs by \\"sitting\\" on them usually assume a humped posture with their discs raised off the substrate.[35] Pteraster militaris broods a few of its young and disperses the remaining eggs, that are too numerous to fit into its pouch.[32] In these brooding species, the eggs are relatively large, and supplied with yolk, and they generally develop directly into miniature starfish without an intervening larval stage.[29] The developing young are called lecithotrophic because they obtain their nutrition from the yolk as opposed to \\"planktotrophic\\" larvae that feed in the water column. In Parvulastra parvivipara, an intragonadal brooder, the young starfish obtain nutrients by eating other eggs and embryos in the brood pouch.[36] Brooding is especially common in polar and deep-sea species that live in environments unfavourable for larval development[33] and in smaller species that produce just a few eggs.[37][38]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the tropics, a plentiful supply of phytoplankton is continuously available for starfish larvae to feed on. Spawning takes place at any time of year, each species having its own characteristic breeding season.[39] In temperate regions, the spring and summer brings an increase in food supplies. The first individual of a species to spawn may release a pheromone that serves to attract other starfish to aggregate and to release their gametes synchronously.[40] In other species, a male and female may come together and form a pair.[41][42] This behaviour is called pseudocopulation[43] and the male climbs on top, placing his arms between those of the female. When she releases eggs into the water, he is induced to spawn.[40] Starfish may use environmental signals to coordinate the time of spawning (day length to indicate the correct time of the year,[41] dawn or dusk to indicate the correct time of day), and chemical signals to indicate their readiness to breed. In some species, mature females produce chemicals to attract sperm in the sea water.[44]\\r\\n\\r\\nMost starfish embryos hatch at the blastula stage. The original ball of cells develops a lateral pouch, the archenteron. The entrance to this is known as the blastopore and it will later develop into the anus. Another invagination of the surface will fuse with the tip of the archenteron as the mouth while the interior section will become the gut. At the same time, a band of cilia develops on the exterior. This enlarges and extends around the surface and eventually onto two developing arm-like outgrowths. At this stage the larva is known as a bipinnaria. The cilia are used for locomotion and feeding, their rhythmic beat wafting phytoplankton towards the mouth.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next stage in development is a brachiolaria larva and involves the growth of three short, additional arms. These are  at the anterior end, surround a sucker and have adhesive cells at their tips. Both bipinnaria and brachiolaria larvae are bilaterally symmetrical. When fully developed, the brachiolaria settles on the seabed and attaches itself with a short stalk formed from the ventral arms and sucker. Metamorphosis now takes place with a radical rearrangement of tissues. The left side of the larval body becomes the oral surface of the juvenile and the right side the aboral surface. Part of the gut is retained but the mouth and anus move to new positions. Some of the body cavities degenerate but others become the water vascular system and the visceral coelom. The starfish is now pentaradially symmetrical. It casts off its stalk and becomes a free-living juvenile starfish about 1?mm (0.04?in) in diameter. Starfish of the order Paxillosida have no brachiolaria stage, with the bipinnaria larvae settling on the seabed and developing directly into juveniles.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nSome species of starfish are able to reproduce asexually as adults either by fission of their central discs[45] or by autotomy of one or more of their arms. Which of these processes occurs depends on the genus. Among starfish that are able to regenerate their whole body from a single arm, some can do so even from fragments just 1?cm (0.4?in) long.[46] Single arms that regenerate a whole individual are called comet forms. The division of the starfish, either across its disc or at the base of the arm, is usually accompanied by a weakness in the structure that provides a fracture zone.[47]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe larvae of several species of starfish can reproduce asexually before they reach maturity.[48] They do this by autotomising some parts of their bodies or by budding.[49] When such a larva senses that food is plentiful, it takes the path of asexual reproduction rather than normal development.[50] Though this costs it time and energy and delays maturity, it allows a single larva to give rise to multiple adults when the conditions are appropriate.[49]\\r\\n\\r\\nSome species of starfish have the ability to regenerate lost arms and can regrow an entire new limb given time.[46]  A few can regrow a complete new disc from a single arm, while others need at least part of the central disc to be attached to the detached part.[21] Regrowth can take several months or years,[46] and starfish are vulnerable to infections during the early stages after the loss of an arm. A separated limb lives off stored nutrients until it regrows a disc and mouth and is able to feed again.[46] Other than fragmentation carried out for the purpose of reproduction, the division of the body may happen inadvertently due to part being detached by a predator, or part may be actively shed by the starfish in an escape response.[21] The loss of parts of the body is achieved by the rapid softening of a special type of connective tissue in response to nervous signals. This type of tissue is called catch connective tissue and is found in most echinoderms.[51] An autotomy-promoting factor has been identified which, when injected into another starfish, causes rapid shedding of arms.[52]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe lifespan of a starfish varies considerably between species, generally being longer in larger forms and in those with planktonic larvae. For example, Leptasterias hexactis broods a small number of large-yolked eggs. It has an adult weight of 20?g (0.7?oz), reaches sexual maturity in two years and lives for about ten years.[7] Pisaster ochraceus releases a large number of eggs into the sea each year and has an adult weight of up to 800?g (28?oz). It reaches maturity in five years and has a maximum recorded lifespan of 34 years.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nEchinoderms, including starfish, maintain a delicate internal electrolyte balance that is in equilibrium with sea water. This means that it is only possible for them to live in a marine environment and they are not found in any freshwater habitats.[15] Starfish species inhabit all of the world's oceans. Habitats range from tropical coral reefs, rocky shores, tidal pools, mud, and sand to kelp forests, seagrass meadows[53] and the deep-sea floor down to at least 6,000?m (20,000?ft).[54] The greatest diversity of species occurs in coastal areas.[53]\\r\\n\\r\\nMost species are generalist predators, eating microalgae, sponges, bivalves, snails and other small animals.[23][55] The crown-of-thorns starfish consumes coral polyps,[56] while other species are detritivores, feeding on decomposing organic material and faecal matter.[55][57] A few are suspension feeders, gathering in phytoplankton; Henricia and Echinaster often occur in association with sponges, benefiting from the water current they produce.[58] Various species have been shown to be able to absorb organic nutrients from the surrounding water, and this may form a significant portion of their diet.[58]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe processes of feeding and capture may be aided by special parts; Pisaster brevispinus, the short-spined pisaster from the West Coast of America, can use a set of specialized tube feet to dig itself deep into the soft substrate to extract prey (usually clams).[59] Grasping the shellfish, the starfish slowly pries open the prey's shell by wearing out its adductor muscle, and then inserts its everted stomach into the crack to digest the soft tissues. The gap between the valves need only be a fraction of a millimetre wide for the stomach to gain entry.[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nStarfish are keystone species in their respective marine communities. Their relatively large sizes, diverse diets and ability to adapt to different environments makes them ecologically important.[60] The term \\"keystone species\\" was in fact first used by Robert Paine in 1966 to describe a starfish, Pisaster ochraceus.[61] When studying the low intertidal coasts of Washington state, Paine found that predation by P.?ochraceus was a major factor in the diversity of species. Experimental removals of this top predator from a stretch of shoreline resulted in lower species diversity and the eventual domination of Mytilus mussels, which were able to outcompete other organisms for space and resources.[62] Similar results were found in a 1971 study of Stichaster australis on the intertidal coast of the South Island of New Zealand. S.?australis was found to have removed most of a batch of transplanted mussels within two or three months of their placement, while in an area from which S.?australis had been removed, the mussels increased in number dramatically, overwhelming the area and threatening biodiversity.[63]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe feeding activity of the omnivorous starfish Oreaster reticulatus on sandy and seagrass bottoms in the Virgin Islands appears to regulate the diversity, distribution and abundance of microorganisms. These starfish engulf piles of sediment removing the surface films and algae adhering to the particles.[64]  Organisms that dislike this disturbance are replaced by others better able to rapidly recolonise \\"clean\\" sediment. In addition, foraging by these migratory starfish creates diverse patches of organic matter, which may play a role in the distribution and abundance of organisms such as fish, crabs and sea urchins that feed on the sediment.[65]\\r\\n\\r\\nStarfish sometimes have negative effects on ecosystems. Outbreaks of crown-of-thorns starfish have caused damage to coral reefs in Northeast Australia and French Polynesia.[56][66] A study in Polynesia found that coral cover declined drastically with the arrival of migratory starfish in 2006, dropping from 50% to under 5% in three years. This had an unintended effect on reef-feeding fish and the whole benthic community.[56] Asterias amurensis is one of a few echinoderm invasive species. Its larvae likely arrived in Tasmania from central Japan via water discharged from ships in the 1980s. The species has since grown in numbers to the point where they threaten commercially important bivalve populations. As such, they are considered pests,[67] and are on the Invasive Species Specialist Group's list of the world's 100 worst invasive species.[68]\\r\\n\\r\\nStarfish may be preyed on by conspecifics, other starfish species, tritons, crabs, fish, gulls and sea otters.[37][67][69][70] Their first lines of defence are the saponins present in their body walls, which have unpleasant flavours.[71] Some starfish such as Astropecten polyacanthus also include powerful toxins such as tetrodotoxin among their chemical armoury, and the slime star can ooze out large quantities of repellent mucus. They also have body armour in the form of hard plates and spines.[72] The crown-of-thorns starfish is particularly unattractive to potential predators, being heavily defended by sharp spines, laced with toxins and sometimes with bright warning colours.[73] Other species protect their vulnerable tube feet and arm tips by lining their ambulacral grooves with spines and heavily plating their extremities.[72]\\r\\n\\r\\nSeveral species sometimes suffer from a wasting condition caused by bacteria in the genus Vibrio;[69] however, a more widespread wasting disease, causing mass mortalities among starfish, appears sporadically. A paper published in November 2014 revealed the most likely cause of this disease to be a densovirus the authors named sea star-associated densovirus (SSaDV).[74]\\r\\nThe protozoan Orchitophrya stellarum is known to infect the gonads of starfish and damage tissue.[69] Starfish are vulnerable to high temperatures. Experiments have shown that the feeding and growth rates of P. ochraceus reduce greatly when their body temperatures rise above 23?C (73?F) and that they die when their temperature rises to 30?C (86?F).[75][76] This species has a unique ability to absorb seawater to keep itself cool when it is exposed to sunlight by a receding tide.[77] It also appears to rely on its arms to absorb heat, so as to protect the central disc and vital organs like the stomach.[78]\\r\\n\\r\\nStarfish and other echinoderms are sensitive to marine pollution.[79] The common starfish is considered to be a bioindicator for marine ecosystems.[80] A 2009 study found that P. ochraceus is unlikely to be affected by ocean acidification as severely as other marine animals with calcareous skeletons. In other groups, structures made of calcium carbonate are vulnerable to dissolution when the pH is lowered. Researchers found that when P. ochraceus were exposed to 21?C (70?F) and 770?ppm carbon dioxide (beyond rises expected in the next century), they were relatively unaffected. Their survival is likely due to the nodular nature of their skeletons, which are able to compensate for a shortage of carbonate by growing more fleshy tissue.[81]\\r\\n\\r\\nEchinoderms first appeared in the fossil record in the Cambrian.  The first known asterozoans were the Somasteroidea, which exhibit characteristics of both groups.[82] Starfish are infrequently found as fossils, possibly because their hard skeletal components separate as the animal decays. Despite this, there are a few places where accumulations of complete skeletal structures occur, fossilized in place in Lagerst?tten  so-called \\"starfish beds\\".[83]\\r\\n\\r\\nBy the late Paleozoic, the crinoids and blastoids were the predominant echinoderms, and some limestones from this period are made almost entirely from fragments from these groups. In the two major extinction events that occurred during the late Devonian and late Permian, the blastoids were wiped out and only a few species of crinoids survived.[82] Many starfish species also became extinct in these events, but afterwards the surviving few species diversified rapidly within about sixty million years during the Early Jurassic and the beginning of the Middle Jurassic.[84][85] A 2012 study found that speciation in starfish can occur rapidly. During the last 6,000 years, divergence in the larval development of Cryptasterina hystera and Cryptasterina pentagona has taken place, the former adopting internal fertilization and brooding and the latter remaining a broadcast spawner.[86]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe scientific name Asteroidea was given to starfish by the French zoologist de Blainville in 1830.[87] It is derived from the Greek aster, ?? (a star) and the Greek eidos, ?Ѵ? (form, likeness, appearance).[88] The class Asteroidea belongs to the phylum Echinodermata. As well as the starfish, the echinoderms include sea urchins, sand dollars, brittle and basket stars, sea cucumbers and crinoids. The larvae of echinoderms have bilateral symmetry, but during metamorphosis this is replaced with radial symmetry, typically pentameric.[11]  Adult echinoderms are characterized by having a water vascular system with external tube feet and a calcareous endoskeleton consisting of ossicles connected by a mesh of collagen fibres.[89] Starfish are included in the subphylum Asterozoa, the characteristics of which include a flattened, star-shaped body as adults consisting of a central disc and multiple radiating arms. The subphylum includes the two classes of Asteroidea, the starfish, and Ophiuroidea, the brittle stars and basket stars. Asteroids have broad-based arms with skeletal support provided by calcareous plates in the body wall[84] while ophiuroids have clearly demarcated slender arms strengthened by paired fused ossicles forming jointed \\"vertebrae\\".[90]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe starfish are a large and diverse class with about 1,500 living species. There are seven extant orders, Brisingida, Forcipulatida, Notomyotida, Paxillosida, Spinulosida, Valvatida and Velatida[1] and two extinct ones, Calliasterellidae and Trichasteropsida.[2] Living asteroids, the Neoasteroidea, are morphologically distinct from their forerunners in the Paleozoic. The taxonomy of the group is relatively stable but there is ongoing debate about the status of the Paxillosida, and the deep-water sea daisies, though clearly Asteroidea and currently included in Velatida, do not fit easily in any accepted lineage. Phylogenetic data suggests that they may be a sister group, the Concentricycloidea, to the Neoasteroidea, or that the Velatida themselves may be a sister group.[85]\\r\\n\\r\\nExtinct groups within the Asteroidea include:[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nStarfish are deuterostome animals, like the chordates. A 2014 analysis of 219 genes from all classes of echinoderms gives the following phylogenetic tree.[115] The times at which the clades diverged is shown under the labels in millions of years ago (mya).\\r\\n\\r\\nXenacoelomorpha \\r\\n\\r\\nChordata and allies \\r\\n\\r\\nHolothuroidea \\r\\n\\r\\nEchinoidea \\r\\n\\r\\nOphiuroidea \\r\\n\\r\\nAsteroidea \\r\\n\\r\\nCrinoidea \\r\\n\\r\\nEcdysozoa \\r\\n\\r\\nSpiralia \\r\\n\\r\\nThe phylogeny of the Asteroidea has been difficult to resolve, with visible (morphological) features proving inadequate, and the question of whether traditional taxa are clades in doubt.[2] The phylogeny proposed by Gale in 1987 is:[2][116]\\r\\n\\r\\n?

They presented a phylogenetic tree for the living Asteroidea only; using the traditional names of starfish orders where possible, and indicating \\"part of\\" otherwise, the phylogeny is shown below. The Solasteridae are split from the Velatida, and the old Spinulosida is broken up.[118]\\r\\n\\r\\nSolasteridae and part of Spinulosida, e.g. Stegnaster and part of Valvatida, e.g. Asterina\\r\\n\\r\\nOdontasteridae, which was a part of Valvatida\\r\\n\\r\\nPaxillosida\\r\\n\\r\\npart of Spinulosida, e.g. Echinaster, part of Valvatida, e.g. Archaster\\r\\n\\r\\nForcipulatida\\r\\n\\r\\nBrisingida with part of Velatida, e.g. Caymanostella and part of Forcipulatida, e.g. Stichaster\\r\\n\\r\\nVelatida except for Solasteridae\\r\\n\\r\\nNotomyotida (not analysed)\\r\\n\\r\\nStarfish are deuterostomes, closely related, together with all other echinoderms, to chordates, and are used in reproductive and developmental studies. Female starfishs produce large numbers of oocytes that are easily isolated; these can be stored in a pre-meiosis phase and stimulated to complete division by the use of 1-methyladenine.[119] Starfish oocytes are well suited for this research as they are large and easy to handle, transparent, simple to maintain in sea water at room temperature, and they develop rapidly.[120] Asterina pectinifera, used as a model organism for this purpose, is resilient and easy to breed and maintain in the laboratory.[121]\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother area of research is the ability of starfish to regenerate lost body parts. The stem cells of adult humans are incapable of much differentiation and understanding the regrowth, repair and cloning processes in starfish may have implications for human medicine.[122]\\r\\n\\r\\nStarfish also have an unusual ability to expel foreign objects from their bodies, which makes them difficult to tag for research tracking purposes.[123]\\r\\n\\r\\nAn aboriginal Australian fable retold by the Welsh school headmaster William Jenkyn Thomas (1870ÿ1959)[124] tells how some animals needed a canoe to cross the ocean. Whale had one but refused to lend it, so Starfish kept him busy, telling him stories and grooming him to remove parasites, while the others stole the canoe. When Whale realized the trick he beat Starfish ragged, which is how Starfish still is today.[125]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1900, the scholar Edward Tregear documented The Creation Song, which he describes as \\"an ancient prayer for the dedication of a high chief\\" of Hawaii. Among the \\"uncreated gods\\" described early in the song are the male Kumilipo (\\"Creation\\") and the female Poele, both born in the night, a coral insect, the earthworm, and the starfish.[126]\\r\\n\\r\\nGeorg Eberhard Rumpf's 1705 The Ambonese Curiosity Cabinet describes the tropical varieties of Stella Marina or Bintang Laut, \\"Sea Star\\", in Latin and Malay respectively, known in the waters around Ambon. He writes that the Histoire des Antilles reports that when the sea stars \\"see thunder storms approaching, [they] grab hold of many small stones with their little legs, looking to?... hold themselves down as if with anchors\\".[127]\\r\\n\\r\\nStarfish is the title of novels by Peter Watts[128] and Jennie Orbell,[129] and in 2012, Alice Addison wrote a non-fiction book titled \\"Starfish - A year in the life of bereavement and depression\\".[130] The Starfish and the Spider is a 2006 business management book by Ori Brafman and Rod Beckstrom; its title alludes to the ability of the starfish to regenerate itself because of its decentralized nervous system, and the book suggests ways that a decentralized organisation may flourish.[131]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn his 2002 book The Divine Mystery Fort, Sri Sai Kaleshwar Swami wrote, \\"An eighth type of supernatural power object is a starfish. Sometimes at the full moon time, when the moon is really dazzling and hitting on the ocean, a starfish jumps out of the water and falls down. If you can get that you can suck unbelievable cosmic energy. You can use it as your own power object. It has to be only on the full moon day when it comes up.\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the Nickelodeon animated television series SpongeBob SquarePants, the eponymous character's best friend is a dim-witted starfish, Patrick Star.[132]\\r\\n\\r\\nStarfish are widespread in the oceans, but are only occasionally used as food. There may be good reason for this: the bodies of numerous species are dominated by bony ossicles, and the body wall of many species contains saponins, which have an unpleasant taste,[71] and others contain tetrodotoxins which are poisonous.[133] Some species that prey on bivalve molluscs can transmit paralytic shellfish poisoning.[134] Georg Eberhard Rumpf found few starfish being used for food in the Indonesian archipelago, other than as bait in fish traps, but on the island of \\"Huamobel\\"  [sic] the people cut them up, squeeze out the \\"black blood\\" and cook them with sour tamarind leaves; after resting the pieces for a day or two, they remove the outer skin and cook them in coconut milk.[127] Starfish are sometimes eaten in China,[135] Japan[136][137] and in Micronesia.[138]\\r\\n\\r\\nStarfish are in some cases taken from their habitat and sold to tourists as souvenirs, ornaments, curios or for display in aquariums. In particular, Oreaster reticulatus, with its easily accessed habitat and conspicuous coloration, is widely collected in the Caribbean. In the early to mid 20th century, this species was common along the coasts of the West Indies, but collection and trade have severely reduced its numbers. In the State of Florida, O. reticulatus is listed as endangered and its collection is illegal. Nevertheless, it is still sold throughout its range and beyond.[70] A similar phenomenon exists in the Indo-Pacific for species such as Protoreaster nodosus.[139]\\r\\n\\r\\nWith its multiple arms, the starfish provides a popular metaphor for computer networks,[140] companies[141][142] and software tools.[143] It is also the name of a seabed imaging system and company.[144]\\r\\n\\r\\nStarfish has repeatedly been chosen as a name in military history. Three ships of the Royal Navy have borne the name HMS Starfish: an A-class destroyer launched in 1894;[145] an R-class destroyer launched in 1916;[146] and an S-class submarine launched in 1933 and lost in 1940.[147] In the World War II, Starfish sites  were large-scale night-time decoys created during The Blitz to simulate burning British cities.[148] Starfish Prime was a high-altitude nuclear test conducted by the United States on 9 July 1962.[149]","input":"How many species of sea stars are there?"},{"output":"Tenzing Norgay","context":"Mount Everest is the world's highest mountain, with a peak at 8,848 metres (29,029?ft) above sea level. It is situated in the Himalayan range in Tibet.[1]\\r\\nThe first British expedition[2]organized and financed by the newly formed Mount Everest Committeecame under the leadership of Colonel Charles Howard-Bury, with Harold Raeburn as mountaineering leader, and included George Mallory, Guy Bullock, and Edward Oliver Wheeler.[3] It was primarily for mapping and reconnaissance to discover whether a route to the summit could be found from the north side. As the health of Raeburn broke down, Mallory assumed responsibility for most of the exploration to the north and east of the mountain. He wrote to his wife: \\"We are about to walk off the map...\\" After five months of arduous climbing around the base of the mountain, Wheeler explored the hidden East Rongbuk Glacier and its route to the base of the North Col. On September 23, Mallory became the first person to set foot on the mountain and he, Bullock, and Wheeler reached the North Col at 7,020 metres (23,030?ft) before being forced back by strong winds.[4] To Mallory's experienced eye, the route up the North ridge intersecting the NE Ridge and from there to the summit looked long, but feasible for a fresher party.[3]\\r\\nThe second British expedition, under General Charles Granville Bruce and climbing leader Lt-Col. Edward Lisle Strutt, and containing Mallory, returned for a full-scale attempt on the mountain. On May 22, they climbed to 8,170?m (26,800?ft) on the North Ridge before retreating. They were the first humans to climb above 8,000 metres (26,000?ft) on a mountain. The scope of this accomplishment is reflected by the fact that there are only 14 mountains on earththe eight-thousandersthat reach and exceed 8,000 metres. At that moment, Mallory and Strutt had exceeded the summit of all but five other mountains on the planet.\\r\\nA day later, George Finch and Geoffrey Bruce climbed up the North Ridge and Face to 8,320?m (27,300?ft) using oxygen for the first time. They climbed from the North Col to their highest camp at a phenomenal rate of 900 vert-ft/hr., and were the first climbers to sleep using oxygen.\\r\\nOn June 7, George Mallory, about to lead a third attempt, was caught in an avalanche on the steep walls of the North Col in which seven Sherpa climbers were killed. These became the first reported deaths on Everest.\\r\\nThe third British expedition was led by Brigadier-General Charles Bruce, although becoming indisposed as a result of a flare-up of malaria, he relinquished leadership of the expedition to Lt-Col. Edward Norton, with Mallory promoted to climbing leader. Geoffrey Bruce, Howard Somervell, and John Noel returned from the previous year, along with newcomers Noel Odell and Andrew Irvine.\\r\\nOn June 2, Mallory & Bruce set off from the North Col (C-4) to make the first summit attempt. But extreme wind and cold, exhaustion, and the refusal of the porters to carry farther led Mallory to abandon the attempt and the next day the party returned to the North Col camp. On June 4, Norton and Somervell attempted an oxygenless summit in perfect weather; throat trouble forced Somervell to abandon the climb at about 28,000 feet while Norton continued on alone, reaching a height of 8,573?m (28,126?ft), just 275?m (900?ft) short of the summit. Exhausted, he turned back and rejoined Somervell for the descent.\\r\\nOn June 8, Mallory and Irvine left their high camp (C-6 at 26,900-ft) to attempt the summit, using Irvine's modified oxygen apparatus. Odell, climbing in support below, wrote in his diary that at 26,000-ft he \\"saw Mallory & Irvine on the ridge, nearing base of final pyramid\\" climbing what he thought at the time was the very difficult Second Step at 12:50?p.m. It was the last time the two were seen; whether either of them reached the summit remains a question that has reverberated through the decades.\\r\\nBack in England, the climbing establishment pressured Odell to change his view. After about six months he began to equivocate on which Step it was he saw themfrom the Second to possibly the First. If the First, they had no chance of having reached the top; if the Second, they would have had about three hours of oxygen each and the summit was at least three hours away. It is conceivable (though unlikely) that Mallory might have taken Irvine's remaining oxygen and attempted to reach the summit.\\r\\nA much more probable scenario is that the two reached First Step at about 10:30AM. Mallory, seeing the treacherous nature of the traverse to the Second Step, went it alone. He reconnoitered the base of the climbing crux and decided it was not for him that day. He returned, picked up Irvine and the two decided to climb the First Step for a look around and to photograph the complex approach to the Second Step. It was when climbing this small promontory that they were spotted from below by Odell, who assumed that, since they were ascending, they must therefore have been on the Second Step, although it is now difficult to believe that the two would still be climbing from so low down at a timefive hours latethat was considered to be the turn-around hour. Descending from the First Step, the two continued down when, at 2PM, they were hit by a severe snow squall. Roping up, Mallory, leading, may have slipped pulling himself and Irvine down. The rope must have caught to inflict severe rope-jerk injury around Mallory's (and presumably, Irvine's) waist. Some researchers believe Irvine was able to stay high and struggle along the crest of the NE Ridge another 100 yards, only to succumb to cold and possible injuries of the fall. Others believe that the two became separated after the fall by the near white-out conditions of the squall. Based on his final location, it would seem that Mallory had continued straight down in search of his partner, while Irvine, also injured, might have continued diagonally down through the Yellow Band.\\r\\nIn 1979, climber Wang Hongbao of China revealed to the climbing leader of a Japanese expedition that in 1975, while taking a stroll from his bivouac he had discovered \\"an English dead\\" at 8100?m, roughly below the site of Irvine's ice axe discovered in 1933 near the NE Ridge. Wang was killed in an avalanche the next day before he could provide additional details.\\r\\nIn 1999, however, Conrad Anker of the Mallory and Irvine Research Expedition found Mallory's body in the predicted search area near the old Chinese bivouac. There are opposing views within the mountaineering community as to whether the duo may have reached the summit 29 years before the first successful ascent by Sir Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay in 1953. Despite the existence of many theories, the success of Mallory and Irvine's summit assault must be viewed as remote at best.\\r\\nThe leading theory amongst those supporting the summit push has Mallory overcoming the difficulty of the sheer face of the Second Step by standing on Irvine's shoulders. Armed with Irvine's remaining 3/4-full oxygen tank he could conceivably have reached the summit late in the day, but this would have meant that Irvine would have had to descend by himself. However, rope-jerk injuries around Mallory's waist must mean the two were roped when they fell from below the First Step. 1960s Chinese Everest climber Xu Jing told Eric Simonson and Jochen Hemmleb in 2001 that he recalled spotting a corpse somewhere in the Yellow Band. Despite numerous searches of the north face, no sign of Irvine has turned up so far. One researcher claims to have finally spotted Irvine's body using microscopic examination of aerial photographs. This possible discovery set off a new round of search expeditions in 2010 and 2011.\\r\\nA major expedition, under the leadership of Hugh Ruttledge, set out to climb with the great expectations that this time they would succeed. Oxygen was taken but not used because of the incorrect but lingering belief that it was of little benefit to a properly acclimated climber. After delays caused by poor weather and illness of team members, a much higher assault camp was placed than in 1924. On the first summit attempt, Lawrence Wager and Percy Wyn-Harris intended to follow the Northeastern ridge, but were unable to regain it, having bypassed (rather than climb over) the First Step, which they reached at 7:00 AM. The direct access to the Second Step from the First involves a treacherous traverse. Instead of taking it, they dropped down to follow the lower, easier traverse pioneered by Norton in 1924. Observing the Second Step from 100-ft. below it, Wyn-Harris declared it \\"unclimbable.\\" Shortly after crossing the Great Couloir, they turned back for poor snow conditions and the lateness of the hour. A subsequent attempt by Eric Shipton and Frank Smythe followed the same route but Smythe, who pressed on alone when Shipton turned back because of illness, got no higher.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1996, fifteen people died trying to reach the summit, making it the deadliest year in Everest history. On May 10, a storm stranded several climbers between the summit and the safety of Camp IV, killing Rob Hall, Scott Fischer, Yasuko Namba, Doug Hansen, and guide Andy Harris on the south and the Indian (Ladakhi) climbers Tsewang Paljor, Dorje Morup, Tsewang Smanla on the north. Hall and Fischer were both highly experienced climbers who were leading paid expeditions to the summit.\\r\\nJournalist Jon Krakauer, on assignment from Outside magazine, was in Hall's party. He published the bestseller Into Thin Air about the experience. Anatoli Boukreev, a guide who felt impugned by Krakauer's book, co-authored a rebuttal book called The Climb. The dispute sparked a large debate within the climbing community. In May 2004, Kent Moore, a physicist, and John L. Semple, a surgeon, both researchers from the University of Toronto, told New Scientist magazine that an analysis of weather conditions on that day suggested that freak weather caused oxygen levels to plunge approximately 14%.[69][70]\\r\\nDuring the same season, climber and filmmaker David Breashears and his team filmed the IMAX feature Everest on the mountain (some climbing scenes were later recreated for the film in British Columbia, Canada). The 70?mm IMAX camera was specially modified to be lightweight enough to carry up the mountain, and to function in the extreme cold with the use of particular greases on the mechanical parts, plastic bearings and special batteries. Production was halted as Breashears and his team assisted the survivors of the May 10 disaster, but the team eventually reached the top on May 23 and filmed the first large format footage of the summit. On Breashears' team was Jamling Tenzing Norgay, the son of Norgay, following in his father's footsteps for the first time. Also on his team was Ed Viesturs of Seattle, WA, who summited without the use of supplemental oxygen, and Araceli Segarra, who became the first woman from Spain to summit Everest.\\r\\nThe storm's impact on climbers on the mountain's other side, the North Ridge, where several climbers also died, was detailed in a first hand account by British filmmaker and writer Matt Dickinson in his book The Other Side of Everest.\\r\\nVicky Jacks of Balquidder, Scotland, summited Everest in May 2004 aged 51yrs. At the time the oldest woman to have achieved this, and Scotland's first woman climber.","input":"Who was the second man to climb mount everest?"},{"output":"Disneyland","context":"Coordinates: 282307N 813350W? / ?28.385233N 81.563874W? / 28.385233; -81.563874 The Walt Disney World, officially as Walt Disney World Resort is an entertainment complex in Bay Lake and Lake Buena Vista, Florida, near Orlando and Kissimmee, Florida. Opened on October 1, 1971, the resort is owned and operated by Walt Disney Parks and Resorts, a division of The Walt Disney Company. It was initially operated by Walt Disney World Company. The property covers 27,258 acres (43?sq?mi; 110?km2), featuring four theme parks, two water parks, twenty-seven themed resort hotels, nine nonÿDisney hotels, several golf courses, a camping resort, and other entertainment venues, including the outdoor shopping centre Disney Springs.\\r\\nDesigned to supplement Disneyland in Anaheim, California, which had opened in 1955, the complex was developed by Walt Disney in the 1960s. \\"The Florida Project\\", as it was known, was intended to present a distinct vision with its own diverse set of attractions. Walt Disney's original plans also called for the inclusion of an \\"Experimental Prototype Community of Tomorrow\\" (EPCOT), a planned community intended to serve as a test bed for new city living innovations. After extensive lobbying, the Government of Florida created the Reedy Creek Improvement District, a special government district that essentially gave The Walt Disney Company the standard powers and autonomy of an incorporated city. Walt Disney died on December 15, 1966, before construction began. Without Disney spearheading the construction, the company created a resort similar to Disneyland, abandoning experimental concepts for a planned community. Magic Kingdom was the first theme park to open in the complex, in 1971, followed by Epcot in 1982, Disney's Hollywood Studios in 1989, and the most recent, Disney's Animal Kingdom in 1998.\\r\\nToday, Walt Disney World is the most visited vacation resort in the world, with an average annual attendance of over 52 million.[2] The resort is the flagship destination of Disney's worldwide corporate enterprise, and has become a popular staple in American culture.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1959, Walt Disney Productions began looking for land to house a second resort to supplement Disneyland in Anaheim, California, which had opened in 1955. Market surveys at the time revealed that only 5% of Disneyland's visitors came from east of the Mississippi River, where 75% of the population of the United States lived. Additionally, Walt Disney disliked the businesses that had sprung up around Disneyland and wanted more control over a larger area of land in the next project.[3]\\r\\nWalt Disney flew over a potential site in Orlando, Florida ÿ one of many ÿ in November 1963. After witnessing the well-developed network of roads and taking the planned construction of both Interstate 4 and Florida's Turnpike into account, with McCoy Air Force Base (later Orlando International Airport) to the east, Disney selected a centrally-located site near Bay Lake.[4] To avoid a burst of land speculation, Walt Disney World Company used various dummy corporations to acquire 30,500 acres (48?sq?mi; 123?km2) of land.[4] In May 1965, some of these major land transactions were recorded a few miles southwest of Orlando in Osceola County. In addition, two large tracts totaling $1.5 million were sold, and smaller tracts of flatlands and cattle pastures were purchased by exotically-named companies such as the \\"Ayefour Corporation\\", \\"Latin-American Development and Management Corporation\\" and the \\"Reedy Creek Ranch Corporation\\". Some are now memorialized on a window above Main Street, U.S.A. in Magic Kingdom. The smaller parcels of land acquired were called \\"outs\\". They were 5-acre (2?ha) lots platted in 1912 by the Munger Land Company and sold to investors. Most of the owners in the 1960s were happy to get rid of the land, which was mostly swamp at the time. Another issue was the mineral rights to the land, which were owned by Tufts University. Without the transfer of these rights, Tufts could come in at any time and demand the removal of buildings to obtain minerals. Eventually, Disney's team negotiated a deal with Tufts to buy the mineral rights for $15,000.[5]\\r\\nWorking strictly in secrecy, real estate agents unaware of their client's identity began making offers to landowners in April 1964 in parts of southwest Orange and northwest Osceola counties. The agents were careful not to reveal the extent of their intentions, and they were able to negotiate numerous land contracts with some including large tracts of land for as little as $100 an acre.[6] With the understanding that the recording of the first deeds would trigger intense public scrutiny, Disney delayed the filing of paperwork until a large portion of the land was under contract.[7]\\r\\nEarly rumors and speculation about the land purchases assumed possible development by NASA in support of the nearby Kennedy Space Center, as well as references to other famous investors such as Ford, the Rockefellers, and Howard Hughes.[7] An Orlando Sentinel news article published weeks later on May 20, 1965, acknowledged a popular rumor that Disney was building an \\"East Coast\\" version of Disneyland. However, the publication denied its accuracy based on an earlier interview with Disney at Kennedy Space Center, in which he claimed a $50 million investment was in the works for Disneyland, and that he had no interest in building a new park.[7] In October 1965, editor Emily Bavar from the Sentinel visited Disneyland during the park's 10th-anniversary celebration. In an interview with Disney, she asked him if he was behind recent land purchases in Central Florida; Bavar later described that Disney \\"looked like I had thrown a bucket of water in his face\\" before denying the story.[7] His reaction, combined with other research obtained during her Anaheim visit, led Bavar to author a story on October 21, 1965, where she predicted that Disney was building a second theme park in Florida.[7] Three days later after gathering more information from various sources, the Sentinel published another article headlined, \\"We Say: 'Mystery Industry' Is Disney\\".[7]\\r\\nWalt Disney had originally planned to publicly reveal Disney World on November 15, 1965, but in light of the Sentinel story, Disney asked Florida Governor Haydon Burns to confirm the story on October 25. His announcement called the new theme park \\"the greatest attraction in the history of Florida\\".[7] The official reveal was kept on the previously-planned November 15 date, and Disney joined Burns in Orlando for the event.[7]\\r\\nWalt Disney died from Circulatory Collapse caused by lung cancer on December 15, 1966, before his vision was realized. His brother and business partner, Roy O. Disney, postponed his retirement to oversee construction of the resort's first phase.\\r\\nOn February 2, 1967, Roy O. Disney held a press conference at the Park Theatres in Winter Park, Florida. The role of EPCOT was emphasized in the film that was played. After the film, it was explained that for Disney World, including EPCOT, to succeed, a special district would have to be formed: the Reedy Creek Improvement District with two cities inside it, Bay Lake and Reedy Creek, now Lake Buena Vista. In addition to the standard powers of an incorporated city, which include the issuance of tax-free bonds, the district would have immunity from any current or future county or state land-use laws. The only areas where the district had to submit to the county and state would be property taxes and elevator inspections.[3] The legislation forming the district and the two cities was signed into law by Florida Governor Claude R. Kirk, Jr. on May 12, 1967.[8] The Supreme Court of Florida then ruled in 1968 that the district was allowed to issue tax-exempt bonds for public projects within the district, despite the sole beneficiary being Walt Disney Productions.\\r\\nThe district soon began construction of drainage canals, and Disney built the first roads and the Magic Kingdom. The Contemporary Resort Hotel and Polynesian Village were also completed in time for the park's opening on October 1, 1971.[9][10] The Palm and Magnolia golf courses near Magic Kingdom had opened a few weeks before, while Fort Wilderness opened a month later. 24 days after the park opened, Roy O. Disney dedicated the property and declared that it would be known as \\"Walt Disney World\\" in his brother's honor. In his own words: \\"Everyone has heard of Ford cars. But have they all heard of Henry Ford, who started it all? Walt Disney World is in memory of the man who started it all, so people will know his name as long as Walt Disney World is here.\\" After the dedication, Roy Disney asked Walt's widow, Lillian, what she thought of Walt Disney World. According to biographer Bob Thomas, she responded, \\"I think Walt would have approved.\\" Roy Disney died at age 78 on December 20, 1971, less than three months after the property opened.[11]\\r\\nAdmission prices in 1971 were $3.50 for adults, $2.50 for juniors under age 18, and one dollar for children under twelve.[9]\\r\\nMuch of Walt Disney's plans for his Progress City were abandoned after his death after the company board decided that it did not want to be in the business of running a city. The concept evolved into the resort's second theme park, EPCOT Center (renamed Epcot in 1996), which opened in 1982. While still emulating Walt Disney's original idea of showcasing new technology, it is closer to a world's fair than a \\"community of tomorrow\\". Some of the urban planning concepts from the original idea of EPCOT would instead be integrated into the community of Celebration much later. The resort's third theme park, Disney-MGM Studios (renamed Disney's Hollywood Studios in 2008), opened in 1989 and is inspired by show business. The resort's fourth theme park, Disney's Animal Kingdom, opened in 1998.\\r\\nGeorge Kalogridis was named president of the resort in December 2012, replacing Meg Crofton, who had overseen the site since 2006.\\r\\nOn January 21, 2016, the resort's management structure was changed, with general managers within a theme park being in charge of an area or land, instead of on a functional basis as previously. Theme parks have already had a vice-president overseeing them. Disney Springs and Disney Sports were also affected. Now hotel general managers manage a single hotel instead of some managing multiple hotels.[12]\\r\\nOn October 18, 2017, it was announced that resort visitors can now bring dogs on the following resorts: Disneys Yacht Club Resort, Disney Port Orleans Resort ÿ Riverside, Disneys Art of Animation Resort and Disneys Fort Wilderness Resort & Campground.[13]\\r\\nThe Florida resort is not within Orlando city limits but is southwest of Downtown Orlando. Much of the resort is in southwestern Orange County, with the remainder in adjacent Osceola County. The property includes the cities of Lake Buena Vista and Bay Lake which are governed by the Reedy Creek Improvement District. The site is accessible from Central Florida's Interstate 4 via Exits 62B (World Drive), 64B (US 192 West), 65B (Osceola Parkway West), 67B (SR 536 West), and 68 (SR 535 North), and Exit 8 on SR 429, the Western Expressway. At its founding, the park occupied approximately 30,500 acres (48?sq?mi; 123?km2). Portions of the property have since been sold or de-annexed, including land now occupied by the Disney-built community of Celebration. Now the park occupies 27,258 acres (43?sq?mi; 110?km2),[16] about the size of San Francisco, or twice the size of Manhattan.\\r\\nCinderella Castle at Magic Kingdom\\r\\nSpaceship Earth at Epcot\\r\\nThe Chinese Theatre at Disney's Hollywood Studios\\r\\nTree of Life at Disney's Animal Kingdom\\r\\nDisney's property includes four golf courses. The three 18-hole golf courses are Disney's Palm (4.5 stars), Disney's Magnolia (4 stars), and Disney's Lake Buena Vista (4 stars). There is also a nine-hole walking course (no electric carts allowed) called Oak Trail, designed for young golfers. The Magnolia and Palm courses played home to the PGA Tour's Children's Miracle Network Hospitals Classic. Arnold Palmer Golf Management manages the Disney golf courses.[19]\\r\\nAdditionally, there are two themed miniature golf complexes, each with two courses, Fantasia Gardens and Winter Summerland.[20] The two courses at Fantasia Gardens are Fantasia Garden and Fantasia Fairways. The Garden course is a traditional miniature-style course based on the \\"Fantasia\\" movies with musical holes, water fountains and characters. Fantasia Fairways is a traditional golf course on miniature scale having water hazards and sand traps.[21]\\r\\nThe two courses at Winter Summerland are Summer and Winter, both themed around Santa. Summer is the more challenging of the two 18-hole courses.[21]\\r\\nOf the thirty-four resorts and hotels on the Walt Disney World property, twenty-eight are owned and operated by Walt Disney Parks and Resorts. These are classified into four categories? Deluxe, Moderate, Value, and Disney Vacation Club Villas? and are located in one of five resort areas: the Magic Kingdom, Epcot, Wide World of Sports, Animal Kingdom, or Disney Springs resort areas.\\r\\nWhile all of the Deluxe resort hotels have achieved an AAA Four Diamond rating, Disney's Grand Floridian Resort & Spa is considered the highest tier flagship luxury resort on the Walt Disney World Resort complex.[23]\\r\\nThe Grand Floridian Resort & Spa, Walt Disney World's flagship resort\\r\\nDisney's Polynesian Resort, a deluxe level resort\\r\\nCaribbean Beach Resort, the first moderate resort at Walt Disney World\\r\\nFort Wilderness, Disney's campground and cabin resort\\r\\nDisney's All Star Movies Resort, one of five value resorts\\r\\nShades of Green Resort, owned and operated by the United States Military\\r\\nThe Walt Disney World Dolphin\\r\\nThe Walt Disney World Swan\\r\\nThe Hilton at Walt Disney World, located at Hotel Plaza Boulevard\\r\\nGuests with a Disney Resort reservation (excluding the Walt Disney World Swan and Dolphin) that arrive at Orlando International Airport can be transported to their resort from the airport using the complimentary Disney Magical Express service, which is operated by Mears Destination Services. Guests can also have their bags picked up and transported to their resort for them through a contract with BAGS Incorporated on participating airlines. Many resorts feature Airline Check-in counters for guests returning to the airport. Here their bags will be checked all the way through to their final destination and they can also have boarding passes printed for them. Some participating airlines are Delta, United, American, Jet Blue, and Alaska Airlines.\\r\\nIn 2014, the resort's four theme parks all ranked in the top 8 on the list of the 25 most visited theme parks in the world; (1st) Magic Kingdom - 19,332,000 visitors, (6th) Epcot - 11,454,000 visitors, (7th) Disney's Animal Kingdom - 10,402,000 visitors, and (8th) Disney's Hollywood Studios - 10,312,000 visitors.[25]\\r\\nThe Walt Disney World Resort is serviced by Disney Transport, a complimentary mass transportation system allowing guest access across the property. The Walt Disney World Monorail System provides free transportation at Walt Disney World. The system operates on three routes that interconnect at the Transportation and Ticket Center (TTC), adjacent to the Magic Kingdom's parking lot. A fleet of Disney-operated buses on property, branded Disney Transport, is also complimentary for guests.\\r\\nDisney Transport also operates a fleet of watercraft, ranging in size from water taxis, up to the ferries that connect the Magic Kingdom to the Transportation and Ticket Center. Disney Transport is also responsible for maintaining the fleet of parking lot trams that are used for shuttling visitors between the various theme park parking lots and their respective main entrances.\\r\\nWalt Disney World previously had its own small airport: the Walt Disney World Airport which was also known as the Lake Buena Vista STOLport. During the early 1970s, scheduled passenger service was operated by Shawnee Airlines with small de Havilland Canada DHC-6 Twin Otter commuter turboprops which had STOL (short take off and landing) capabilities on flights to Tampa and Orlando.[35][36] The airport is no longer in operation.\\r\\nWhen the Magic Kingdom opened in 1971, the site employed about 5,500 \\"cast members\\".[37] Today, Walt Disney World employs more than 74,000 cast members,[38] spending more than $1.2 billion on payroll and $474 million on benefits each year. The largest single-site employer in the United States,[39][40] Walt Disney World has more than 3,700 job classifications. The resort also sponsors and operates the Walt Disney World College Program, an internship program that offers American college students (CP's) the opportunity to live about 15 miles (24?km) off-site in four Disney-owned apartment complexes and work at the resort, and thereby provides much of the theme park and resort \\"front line\\" cast members. There is also the Walt Disney World International College Program, an internship program that offers international college students (ICP's) from all over the world the same opportunity.\\r\\nWalt Disney Worlds corporate culture uses jargon based on theatrical terminology.[41][42] For example, park visitors are always guests, employees are called cast members, rides are attractions or adventures, cast members costumed as famous Disney characters in a way that does not cover their faces are known as face characters, jobs are roles, and public and nonpublic areas are respectively labeled onstage and backstage.[41][42]","input":"Which was built first disneyland or disney world?"},{"output":"1 July 1997","context":"The transfer of sovereignty over Hong Kong from the United Kingdom to China, referred to as \\"the Handover\\" internationally or \\"the Return\\" in China, took place on 1 July 1997. The landmark event marked the end of British administration in Hong Kong, and is often regarded as marking the end of the British Empire.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHong Kong's territory was acquired from three separate treaties: the Treaty of Nanking in 1842, the Convention of Peking in 1860, and The Convention for the Extension of Hong Kong Territory in 1898, which gave the UK the control of Hong Kong Island, Kowloon (area south of Boundary Street), and the New Territories (area north of Boundary Street and south of the Sham Chun River, and outlying islands), respectively.\\r\\nAlthough Hong Kong Island and Kowloon had been ceded to the United Kingdom in perpetuity, the control on the New Territories was a 99-year lease. The finite nature of the 99-year lease did not hinder Hong Kong's development as the New Territories were combined as a part of Hong Kong.\\r\\nHowever, by 1997, it was impractical to separate the three territories and only return the New Territories. In addition, with the scarcity of land and natural resources in Hong Kong Island and Kowloon, the New Territories were being developed with large-scale infrastructures and other developments, with the break-even day lying well past 30 June 1997. Thus, the status of the New Territories after the expiry of the 99-year lease became important for Hong Kong's economic development.[1]\\r\\nWhen the People's Republic of China obtained its seat in the United Nations as a result of the UN General Assembly Resolution 2758 in 1971, it began to act diplomatically on the sovereignty issues of Hong Kong and Macau. In March 1972, the Chinese UN representative, Huang Hua, wrote to the United Nations Decolonization Committee to state the position of the Chinese government:\\r\\nThe same year, on 8 November, the United Nations General Assembly passed the resolution on removing Hong Kong and Macau from the official list of colonies.[2]\\r\\nIn March 1979 the Governor of Hong Kong, Murray MacLehose, paid his first official visit to the People's Republic of China (PRC), taking the initiative to raise the question of Hong Kong's sovereignty with Deng Xiaoping.[3] Without clarifying and establishing the official position of the PRC government, the arranging of real estate leases and loans agreements in Hong Kong within the next 18 years would become difficult.[1]\\r\\nIn response to concerns over land leases in the New Territories, MacLehose proposed that British administration of the whole of Hong Kong, as opposed to sovereignty, be allowed to continue after 1997.[4] He also proposed that contracts include the phrase \\"for so long as the Crown administers the territory\\".[5]\\r\\nIn fact, as early as the mid-1970s, Hong Kong had faced additional risks raising loans for large-scale infrastructure projects such as its Mass Transit Railway (MTR) system and a new airport. Caught unprepared, Deng asserted the necessity of Hong Kong's return to China, upon which Hong Kong would be given special status by the PRC government.\\r\\nMacLehose's visit to the PRC raised the curtain on the issue of Hong Kong's sovereignty: Britain was made aware of the PRC's aspiration to resume sovereignty over Hong Kong and began to make arrangements accordingly to ensure the sustenance of her interests within the territory, as well as initiating the creation of a withdrawal plan in case of emergency.\\r\\nThree years later, Deng received the former British Prime Minister Edward Heath, who had been dispatched as the special envoy of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher to establish an understanding of the PRC's view with regards to the question of Hong Kong; during their meeting, Deng outlined his plans to make the territory a special economic zone, which would retain its capitalist system under Chinese sovereignty.[6]\\r\\nIn the same year, Edward Youde, who succeeded MacLehose as the 26th Governor of Hong Kong, led a delegation of five Executive Councillors to London, including Chung Sze-yuen, Lydia Dunn, and Roger Lobo.[7] Chung presented their position on the sovereignty of Hong Kong to Thatcher, encouraging her to take into consideration the interests of the native Hong Kong population in her upcoming visit to China.[7]\\r\\nIn light of the increasing openness of the PRC government and economic reforms on the mainland, the then British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher sought the PRC's agreement to a continued British presence in the territory.[8]\\r\\nHowever, the PRC took a contrary position: not only did the PRC wish for the New Territories, on lease until 1997, to be placed under the PRC's jurisdiction, it also refused to recognize the \\"unfair and unequal treaties\\" under which Hong Kong Island and Kowloon had been ceded to Britain in perpetuity.[9] Consequently, the PRC recognized only the British administration in Hong Kong, but not British sovereignty.[9]\\r\\nIn the wake of Governor MacLehose's visit, Britain and the PRC established initial diplomatic contact for further discussions of the Hong Kong question, paving the way for Thatcher's first visit to the PRC in September 1982.[10]\\r\\nMargaret Thatcher, in discussion with Deng Xiaoping, reiterated the validity of an extension of the lease of Hong Kong territory, particularly in light of binding treaties, including the Treaty of Nanking in 1842, the Convention of Peking in 1856, and the Convention for the Extension of Hong Kong Territory signed in 1890.\\r\\nIn response, Deng Xiaoping cited clearly the lack of room for compromise on the question of sovereignty over Hong Kong; the PRC, as the successor of Qing Dynasty and the Republic of China on the mainland, would recover the entirety of the New Territories, Kowloon and Hong Kong Island. China considered treaties about Hong Kong as unequal and ultimately refused to accept any outcome that would indicate permanent loss of sovereignty over Hong Kong's area, whatever wording the former treaties had.[11]\\r\\nDuring talks with Thatcher, China planned to invade and seize Hong Kong if the negotiations set off unrest in the colony. Thatcher later said that Deng told her bluntly that China could easily take Hong Kong by force, stating that \\"I could walk in and take the whole lot this afternoon\\", to which she replied that \\"there is nothing I could do to stop you, but the eyes of the world would now know what China is like\\".[12]\\r\\nAfter her visit with Deng in Beijing, Thatcher was received in Hong Kong as the first British Prime Minister to set foot on the territory whilst in office. At a press conference, Thatcher re-emphasised the validity of the three treaties, asserting the need for countries to respect treaties on universal terms: \\"There are three treaties in existence; we stick by our treaties unless we decide on something else. At the moment, we stick by our treaties.\\".[8]\\r\\nAt the same time, at the 5th session of the 5th National People's Congress, the constitution was amended to include a new Article 31 which stated that the country might establish Special Administrative Regions (SARs) when necessary.[13]\\r\\nThe additional Article would hold tremendous significance in settling the question of Hong Kong and later Macau, putting into social consciousness the concept of \\"One country, two systems\\". The concept would prove useful to deploy until the territories were secured and conditions were ripe for its gradual abrogation.\\r\\nA few months after Thatcher's visit to Beijing, the PRC government had yet to open negotiations with the British government regarding the sovereignty of Hong Kong.\\r\\nShortly before the initiation of sovereignty talks, Governor Youde declared his intention to represent the population of Hong Kong at the negotiations. This statement sparked a strong response from the PRC, prompting Deng Xiaoping to denounce talk of \\"the so-called 'three-legged stool'\\", which implied that Hong Kong was a party to talks on its future, alongside Beijing and London.[14]\\r\\nAt the preliminary stage of the talks, the British government proposed an exchange of sovereignty for administration and the implementation of a British administration post-handover.[8]\\r\\nThe PRC government refused, contending that the notions of sovereignty and administration were inseparable, and although it recognised Macau as a \\"Chinese territory under Portuguese administration\\", this was only temporary.[15]\\r\\nIn fact, during informal exchanges between 1979 and 1981, the PRC had proposed a \\"Macau solution\\" in Hong Kong, under which it would remain under British administration at China's discretion.[3]\\r\\nHowever, this had previously been rejected following the 1967 Leftist riots, with the then Governor, David Trench, claiming the leftists' aim was to leave the UK without effective control, or \\"to Macau us\\".[16]\\r\\nThe conflict that arose at that point of the negotiations ended the possibility of further negotiation. During the reception of former British Prime Minister Edward Heath during his sixth visit to the PRC, Deng Xiaoping commented quite clearly on the impossibility of exchanging sovereignty for administration, declaring an ultimatum: the British government must modify or give up its position or the PRC will announce its resolution of the issue of Hong Kong sovereignty unilaterally.[17]\\r\\nIn 1983, Typhoon Ellen ravaged Hong Kong, causing great amounts of damage to both life and property.[18] The Hong Kong dollar plummeted on Black Saturday, and the Financial Secretary John Bremridge publicly associated the economic uncertainty with the instability of the political climate.[19] In response, the PRC government condemned Britain through the press for \\"playing the economic card\\" in order to achieve their ends: to intimidate the PRC into conceding to British demands.[20]\\r\\nGovernor Youde with nine members of the Hong Kong Executive Council travelled to London to discuss with Prime Minister Thatcher the crisis of confidencethe problem with morale among the people of Hong Kong arising from the ruination of the Sino-British talks. The session concluded with Thatcher's writing of a letter addressed to the PRC Premier Zhao Ziyang.\\r\\nIn the letter, she expressed Britain's willingness to explore arrangements optimising the future prospects of Hong Kong while utilising the PRC's proposals as a foundation. Furthermore, and perhaps most significantly, she expressed Britain's concession on its position of a continued British presence in the form of an administration post-handover.\\r\\nTwo rounds of negotiations were held in October and November. On the sixth round of talks in November, Britain formally conceded its intentions of either maintaining a British administration in Hong Kong or seeking some form of co-administration with the PRC, and showed its sincerity in discussing PRC's proposal on the 1997 issue. Obstacles were cleared.\\r\\nSimon Keswick, chairman of Jardine Matheson & Co., said they were not pulling out of Hong Kong, but a new holding company would be established in Bermuda instead.[21] The PRC took this as yet another plot by the British. The Hong Kong government explained that it had been informed about the move only a few days before the announcement. The government would not and could not stop the company from making a business decision.\\r\\nJust as the atmosphere of the talks was becoming cordial, members of the Legislative Council of Hong Kong felt impatient at the long-running secrecy over the progress of Sino-British talks on the Hong Kong issue. A motion, tabled by legislator Roger Lobo, declared \\"This Council deems it essential that any proposals for the future of Hong Kong should be debated in this Council before agreement is reached\\", was passed unanimously.[22]\\r\\nThe PRC attacked the motion furiously, referring to it as \\"somebody's attempt to play the three-legged stool trick again\\".[23] At length, the PRC and Britain initiated the Joint Declaration on the question of Hong Kong's future in Beijing. Zhou Nan, the then PRC Deputy Foreign Minister and leader of the negotiation team, and Sir Richard Evans, British Ambassador to Beijing and leader of the team, signed respectively on behalf of the two governments.[24]\\r\\nThe Sino-British Joint Declaration was signed by the Prime Ministers of the People's Republic of China and the United Kingdom governments on 19 December 1984 in Beijing. The Declaration entered into force with the exchange of instruments of ratification on 27 May 1985 and was registered by the People's Republic of China and United Kingdom governments at the United Nations on 12 June 1985.\\r\\nIn the Joint Declaration, the People's Republic of China Government stated that it had decided to resume the exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong (including Hong Kong Island, Kowloon, and the New Territories) with effect from 1 July 1997 and the United Kingdom Government declared that it would restore Hong Kong to the PRC with effect from 1 July 1997. In the document, the People's Republic of China Government also declared its basic policies regarding Hong Kong.\\r\\nIn accordance with the \\"One Country, Two Systems\\" principle agreed between the United Kingdom and the People's Republic of China, the socialist system of the People's Republic of China would not be practised in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR), and Hong Kong's previous capitalist system and its way of life would remain unchanged for a period of 50 years. This would have left Hong Kong unchanged until 2047.\\r\\nThe Joint Declaration provided that these basic policies should be stipulated in the Hong Kong Basic Law. The ceremony of the signing of the Sino-British Joint Declaration took place at 18:00, 19 December 1984 at the Western Main Chamber of the Great Hall of the People. The Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office at first proposed a list of 60-80 Hong Kong people to attend the ceremony. The number was finally extended to 101.\\r\\nThe list included Hong Kong government officials, members of the Legislative and Executive Councils, chairmen of the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation and Standard Chartered Bank, prominent businessmen such as Li Ka-shing, Pao Yue-kong and Fok Ying-tung, and also Martin Lee Chu-ming and Szeto Wah.\\r\\nThe Basic Law was drafted by a Drafting Committee composed of members from both Hong Kong and mainland China. A Basic Law Consultative Committee formed purely by Hong Kong people was established in 1985 to canvas views in Hong Kong on the drafts.\\r\\nThe first draft was published in April 1988, followed by a five-month public consultation exercise. The second draft was published in February 1989, and the subsequent consultation period ended in October 1989.\\r\\nThe Basic Law was formally promulgated on 4 April 1990 by the NPC, together with the designs for the flag and emblem of the HKSAR. Some members of the Basic Law drafting committee were ousted by Beijing following the 4 June 1989 Tiananmen Square protests, after voicing views supporting the students.\\r\\nThe Basic Law was said to be a mini-constitution drafted with the participation of Hong Kong people. The political system had been the most controversial issue in the drafting of the Basic Law. The special issue sub-group adopted the political model put forward by Louis Cha. This \\"mainstream\\" proposal was criticised for being too conservative.[citation needed]\\r\\nAccording to Clauses 158 and 159 of the Basic Law, powers of interpretation and amendment of the Basic Law are vested in the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress and the National People's Congress, respectively. Hong Kong's people have limited influence.\\r\\nAfter the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989, the Executive Councillors and the Legislative Councillors unexpectedly held an urgent meeting, in which they agreed unanimously that the British Government should give the people of Hong Kong the right of abode in the United Kingdom.[25]\\r\\nMore than 10,000 Hong Kong residents rushed to Central in order to get an application form for residency in the United Kingdom. On the eve of the deadline, over 100,000 lined up overnight for a BN(O) application form. While mass migration did begin well before 1989, the event did lead to the peak migration year in 1992 with 66,000 leaving.[26]\\r\\nMany citizens were pessimistic towards the future of Hong Kong and the transfer of the region's sovereignty. A tide of emigration, which was to last for no less than five years, broke out. At its peak, citizenship of small countries, such as Tonga, was also in great demand.[27]\\r\\nSingapore, which also had a predominantly Chinese population, was another popular destination, with the country's Commission (now Consulate-General) being besieged by anxious Hong Kong residents.[28] By September 1989, 6000 applications for residency in Singapore had been approved by the Commission.[29]\\r\\nSome consul staff were suspended or arrested for their corrupt behaviour in granting immigration visas. In April 1997, the acting immigration officer at the US Consulate-General, James DeBates, was suspended after his wife was arrested for smuggling of Chinese migrants into the United States.[30] The previous year, his predecessor, Jerry Stuchiner, had been arrested for smuggling forged Honduran passports into the territory before being sentenced to 40 months in prison.[31]\\r\\nCanada (Vancouver and Toronto), United Kingdom (London, Glasgow, and Manchester), Australia (Sydney and Melbourne), and the United States (San Francisco and New York) were, by and large, the most popular destinations. The United Kingdom devised the British Nationality Selection Scheme, granting 50,000 families British citizenship under the British Nationality Act (Hong Kong) 1990.[32]\\r\\nVancouver was among the most popular destinations, earning the nickname of \\"Hongcouver\\".[33] Richmond, a suburb of Vancouver, was nicknamed \\"Little Hong Kong\\".[34] Other popular settlements are found in Auckland, New Zealand and Dublin, Ireland. All in all, from the start of the settlement of the negotiation in 1984 to 1997, nearly 1 million people emigrated; consequently, Hong Kong suffered serious loss of capital.[35]\\r\\nChris Patten became the last governor of Hong Kong. This was regarded as a turning point in Hong Kong's history. Unlike his predecessors, Patten was not a diplomat, but a career politician and former Member of Parliament. He introduced democratic reforms which pushed PRCÿBritish relations to a standstill and affected the negotiations for a smooth handover.\\r\\nPatten introduced a package of electoral reforms in the Legislative Council. These reforms proposed to enlarge the electorate, thus making voting in the Legislative Council more democratic. This move posed significant changes because Hong Kong citizens would have the power to make decisions regarding their future.\\r\\nThe handover ceremony was held at the new wing of the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre in Wan Chai on the night of 30 June 1997.\\r\\nThe principal British guest was Prince Charles, who read a farewell speech on behalf of the Queen. The newly elected Prime Minister, Tony Blair, the Foreign Secretary Robin Cook, the departing Governor Chris Patten and General Sir Charles Guthrie, Chief of the Defence Staff, also attended.\\r\\nRepresenting the People's Republic of China were the President, Jiang Zemin, the Premier, Li Peng, and the first Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa. The event was broadcast around the world.[36][37]\\r\\nAfter the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989, the Hong Kong government proposed a grand \\"Rose Garden Project\\" to restore faith and solidarity among the residents.[124] As the construction of the new Hong Kong International Airport would extend well after the handover, Governor Wilson met PRC Premier Li Peng in Beijing to ease the mind of the PRC government.[125]\\r\\nThe communist press published stories that the project was an evil plan to bleed Hong Kong dry before the handover, leaving the territory in serious debt.[126] After three years of negotiations, Britain and the PRC finally reached an agreement over the construction of the new airport, and signed a Memorandum of Understanding.[127] Removing hills and reclaiming land, it took only a few years to construct the new airport.\\r\\nThe Walled City was originally a single fort built in the mid-19th century on the site of an earlier 17th century watch post on the Kowloon Peninsula of Hong Kong.[128] After the ceding of Hong Kong Island to Britain in 1842 (Treaty of Nanjing), Manchu Qing Dynasty authorities of China felt it necessary for them to establish a military and administrative post to rule the area and to check further British influence in the area.\\r\\nThe 1898 Convention which handed additional parts of Hong Kong (the New Territories) to Britain for 99 years excluded the Walled City, with a population of roughly 700. It stated that China could continue to keep troops there, so long as they did not interfere with Britain's temporary rule.\\r\\nBritain quickly went back on this unofficial part of the agreement, attacking Kowloon Walled City in 1899, only to find it deserted. They did nothing with it, or the outpost, and thus posed the question of Kowloon Walled City's ownership squarely up in the air. The outpost consisted of a yamen, as well as buildings which grew into low-lying, densely packed neighbourhoods from the 1890s to 1940s.\\r\\nThe enclave remained part of Chinese territory despite the turbulent events of the early 20th century that saw the fall of the Qing government, the establishment of the Republic of China and later, a Communist Chinese government (PRC).\\r\\nSquatters began to occupy the Walled City, resisting several attempts by Britain in 1948 to drive them out. The Walled City became a haven for criminals and drug addicts, as the Hong Kong Police had no right to enter the City and China refused maintainability. The 1949 foundation of the People's Republic of China added thousands of refugees to the population, many from Guangdong; by this time, Britain had had enough, and simply adopted a \\"hands-off\\" policy.\\r\\nA murder that occurred in Kowloon Walled City in 1959 set off a small diplomatic crisis, as the two nations each tried to get the other to accept responsibility for a vast tract of land now virtually ruled by anti-Manchurian Triads.\\r\\nAfter the Joint Declaration in 1984, the PRC allowed British authorities to demolish the City and resettle its inhabitants. The mutual decision to tear down the walled city was made in 1987.[129] The government spent up to HK$ 3 billion to resettle the residents and shops.\\r\\nSome residents were not satisfied with the compensation, and some even obstructed the demolition in every possible way.[130] Ultimately, everything was settled, and the Walled City became a park.[131]\\r\\nRennie's Mill got its name from a Canadian businessman named Alfred Herbert Rennie, who established a flour mill at Junk Bay. The business failed, and Rennie hanged himself there in 1908. The incident gave the Chinese name for the site Tiu Keng Leng (?X), meaning \\"Hanging (neck) Ridge\\". The name was later formally changed to similar-sounding Tiu King Leng (?X) because it was regarded as inauspicious.\\r\\nIn the 1950s the (British) Government of Hong Kong settled a considerable number of refugees from Chinaformer Nationalist soldiers and other Kuomintang supportersat Rennie's Mill, following the Chinese civil war. For many years the area was a Kuomintang enclave known as \\"Little Taiwan\\", with the flag of the Republic of China flying, its own school system and practically off-limits to the Royal Hong Kong Police Force.\\r\\nIn 1996 the Hong Kong government finally forcibly evicted Rennie's Mill's residents, ostensibly to make room for new town developments, as part of the Tseung Kwan O New Town, but widely understood to be a move to please the Communist Chinese government before Hong Kong reverted to Communist Chinese rule in 1997.\\r\\nBefore the eviction, Rennie's Mill could be reached by the winding, hilly and narrow Po Lam Road South. At that time, Rennie's Mill's only means of public transport were the routes 90 and 290 of Kowloon Motor Bus, which were operated by minibuses, and by water transport.\\r\\nThe Republic of China on Taiwan promulgated the Laws and Regulations Regarding Hong Kong & Macao Affairs on 2 April 1997 by Presidential Order, and the Executive Yuan on 19 June 1997 ordered the provisions pertaining to Hong Kong to take effect on 1 July 1997.[132]\\r\\nThe United StatesÿHong Kong Policy Act or more commonly known as the Hong Kong Policy Act (P.L no. 102-383m 106 Stat. 1448) is a 1992 act enacted by the United States Congress. It allows the United States to continue to treat Hong Kong separately from China for matters concerning trade export and economics control after the handover.[133]\\r\\nThe United States was represented by then Secretary of State Madeleine Albright at the Hong Kong handover ceremony.[134] However, she partially boycotted it in protest of China's dissolution of the democratically elected Hong Kong legislature.[135]\\r\\nScholars have begun to study the complexities of the transfer as shown in the popular media, such as films, television and video and online games. For example, Hong Kong director Fruit Chan made a sci-fi thriller The Midnight After (2014) that stressed the sense of loss and alienation represented by survivors in an apocalyptic Hong Kong. Chan infuses a political agenda in the film by playing on Hong Kongers' collective anxiety towards communist China.[136] Yiman Wang has argued that America has viewed China through the prisms of films from Shanghai and Hong Kong, with a recent emphasis on futuristic disaster films set in Hong Kong after the transfer goes awry.[137]","input":"When did hong kong become a part of china?"},{"output":"President John Adams","context":"The White House is the official residence and workplace of the President of the United States. It is located at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue NW in Washington, D.C. and has been the residence of every U.S. President since John Adams in 1800. The term is often used as a metonym for the president and his advisers.\\r\\nThe residence was designed by Irish-born architect James Hoban[2] in the neoclassical style. Construction took place between 1792 and 1800 using Aquia Creek sandstone painted white. When Thomas Jefferson moved into the house in 1801, he (with architect Benjamin Henry Latrobe) added low colonnades on each wing that concealed stables and storage.[3] In 1814, during the War of 1812, the mansion was set ablaze by the British Army in the Burning of Washington, destroying the interior and charring much of the exterior. Reconstruction began almost immediately, and President James Monroe moved into the partially reconstructed Executive Residence in October 1817. Exterior construction continued with the addition of the semi-circular South portico in 1824 and the North portico in 1829.\\r\\nBecause of crowding within the executive mansion itself, President Theodore Roosevelt had all work offices relocated to the newly constructed West Wing in 1901. Eight years later in 1909, President William Howard Taft expanded the West Wing and created the first Oval Office, which was eventually moved as the section was expanded. In the main mansion, the third-floor attic was converted to living quarters in 1927 by augmenting the existing hip roof with long shed dormers. A newly constructed East Wing was used as a reception area for social events; Jefferson's colonnades connected the new wings. East Wing alterations were completed in 1946, creating additional office space. By 1948, the residence's load-bearing exterior walls and internal wood beams were found to be close to failure. Under Harry S. Truman, the interior rooms were completely dismantled and a new internal load-bearing steel frame constructed inside the walls. Once this work was completed, the interior rooms were rebuilt.\\r\\nThe modern-day White House complex includes the Executive Residence, West Wing, East Wing, the Eisenhower Executive Office Buildingthe former State Department, which now houses offices for the President's staff and the Vice Presidentand Blair House, a guest residence. The Executive Residence is made up of six storiesthe Ground Floor, State Floor, Second Floor, and Third Floor, as well as a two-story basement. The property is a National Heritage Site owned by the National Park Service and is part of the President's Park. In 2007, it was ranked second[4] on the American Institute of Architects list of \\"America's Favorite Architecture\\".\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFollowing his April 1789 inauguration, President George Washington occupied two executive mansions in New York City: the Samuel Osgood House at 3 Cherry Street (April 1789?ÿ February 1790), and the Alexander Macomb House at 39ÿ41 Broadway (FebruaryÿAugust 1790). In May 1790, New York began construction of Government House for his official residence, but he never occupied it. The national capital moved to Philadelphia in December 1790.\\r\\nThe July 1790 Residence Act named Philadelphia, Pennsylvania the temporary national capital for a 10-year period while the Federal City was under construction. The City of Philadelphia rented Robert Morris's city house at 190 High Street (now 524ÿ30 Market Street) for Washington's presidential residence.\\r\\nThe first U.S. President occupied the Market Street mansion from November 1790 to March 1797 and altered it in ways that may have influenced the design of the White House. As part of a futile effort to have Philadelphia named the permanent national capital, Pennsylvania built a much grander presidential mansion several blocks away, but Washington declined to occupy it.\\r\\nPresident John Adams also occupied the Market Street mansion from March 1797 to May 1800. On Saturday,[5] November 1, 1800,[6] he became the first president to occupy the White House. The President's House in Philadelphia became a hotel and was demolished in 1832, while the unused presidential mansion became home to the University of Pennsylvania.\\r\\nThe President's House was a major feature of Pierre (Peter) Charles L'Enfant's' plan for the newly established federal city, Washington, D.C. (see: L'Enfant Plan).[7][8] The architect of the White House was chosen in a design competition which received nine proposals, including one submitted anonymously by Thomas Jefferson.[9]\\r\\nPresident Washington visited Charleston, South Carolina in May 1791 on his \\"Southern Tour\\", and saw the under-construction Charleston County Courthouse designed by Irish architect James Hoban. He is reputed to have met with Hoban then. The following year, he summoned the architect to Philadelphia and met with him in June 1792.[10]\\r\\nOn July 16, 1792, the President met with the commissioners of the federal city to make his judgment in the architectural competition. His review is recorded as being brief, and he quickly selected Hoban's submission.[11]\\r\\nWashington was not entirely pleased with the original submission, however; he found it too small, lacking ornament, and not monumental enough to house the nation's president. On his recommendation, the house was changed from three stories to two and was widened from a nine-bay facade to an 11-bay facade. Hoban's competition drawings do not survive.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe building has classical inspiration sources, that could be found directly or indirectly in the Roman architect Vitruvius or in Andrea Palladio styles; Palladio being an Italian architect of the Renaissance which had a considerable influence on the Western architecture (Palladian architecture). The building Hoban designed is verifiably influenced by the upper floors of Leinster House, in Dublin, which later became the seat of the Oireachtas (the Irish parliament).[12] Several other Georgian-era Irish country houses have been suggested as sources of inspiration for the overall floor plan, details like the bow-fronted south front, and interior details like the former niches in the present Blue Room. These influences, though undocumented, are cited in the official White House guide, and in White House Historical Association publications. The first official White House guide, published in 1962, suggested a link between Hoban's design for the South Portico and Chateau de Rastignac, a neoclassical country house located in La Bachellerie in the Dordogne region of France and designed by Mathurin Salat. Construction on the French house was initially started before 1789, interrupted by the French Revolution for twenty years and then finally built 1812ÿ1817 (based on Salat's pre-1789 design).[13] The theoretical link between the two houses has been criticized because Hoban did not visit France. Supporters of a connection posit that Thomas Jefferson, during his tour of Bordeaux in 1789, viewed Salat's architectural drawings (which were on-file at the College) at the cole Spciale d'Architecture (Bordeaux Architectural College).[14] On his return to the U.S. he then shared the influence with Washington, Hoban, Monroe, and Benjamin Henry Latrobe.[13]\\r\\nConstruction of the White House began with the laying of the cornerstone on October 13, 1792, although there was no formal ceremony.[15] The main residence, as well as foundations of the house, were built largely by enslaved and free African-American laborers, as well as employed Europeans.[16] Much of the other work on the house was performed by immigrants, many not yet with citizenship. The sandstone walls were erected by Scottish immigrants, employed by Hoban,[17] as were the high-relief rose and garland decorations above the north entrance and the \\"fish scale\\" pattern beneath the pediments of the window hoods. There are conflicting claims as to where the sandstone used in the construction of the White House originated. Some reports suggest sandstone from the Croatian island of Bra? (specifically the Pu?i??a querry whose stone was used to build the ancient Roman palace of Emperor Diocletian) was used in the original construction of the building, contrarily researchers believe limestone from the island was used in the 1902 renovations and not the original construction. Others suggest the original sandstone simply came from Aquia Creek in Stafford County, Virginia, as importing the stone would be too costly.[18][19][20] The initial construction took place over a period of eight years, at a reported cost of $232,371.83 (equal to $3,350,711 today). Although not yet completed, the White House was ready for occupancy circa November 1, 1800.[21]\\r\\nShortages, including material and labor, forced alterations to the earlier plan developed by French engineer Pierre Charles L'Enfant for a \\"palace\\" that was five times larger than the house that was eventually built.[17] The finished structure contained only two main floors instead of the planned three, and a less costly brick served as a lining for the stone fa?ades. When construction was finished, the porous sandstone walls were whitewashed with a mixture of lime, rice glue, casein, and lead, giving the house its familiar color and name.[17]\\r\\nAs it is a famed structure in America, several replicas of the White House have been constructed.\\r\\nThe north front is the principal fa?ade of the White House and consists of three floors and eleven bays. The ground floor is hidden by a raised carriage ramp and parapet, thus the fa?ade appears to be of two floors. The central three bays are behind a prostyle portico (this was a later addition to the house, built circa 1830) serving, thanks to the carriage ramp, as a porte cochere. The windows of the four bays flanking the portico, at first-floor level, have alternating pointed and segmented pediments, while at second-floor level the pediments are flat. The principal entrance at the center of the portico is surmounted by a lunette fanlight. Above the entrance is a sculpted floral festoon. The roofline is hidden by a balustraded parapet.\\r\\nThe mansion's southern fa?ade is a combination of the Palladian and neoclassical styles of architecture. It is of three floors, all visible. The ground floor is rusticated in the Palladian fashion. At the center of the fa?ade is a neoclassical projecting bow of three bays. The bow is flanked by five bays, the windows of which, as on the north fa?ade, have alternating segmented and pointed pediments at first-floor level. The bow has a ground floor double staircase leading to an Ionic colonnaded loggia (with the Truman Balcony at second-floor level), known as the south portico. The more modern third floor is hidden by a balustraded parapet and plays no part in the composition of the fa?ade.\\r\\nThe building was originally variously referred to as the \\"President's Palace\\", \\"Presidential Mansion\\", or \\"President's House\\".[22] The earliest evidence of the public calling it the \\"White House\\" was recorded in 1811.[23] A myth emerged that during the rebuilding of the structure after the Burning of Washington, white paint was applied to mask the burn damage it had suffered,[24] giving the building its namesake hue.[25] The name \\"Executive Mansion\\" was used in official contexts until President Theodore Roosevelt established the formal name by having \\"White HouseÿWashington\\" engraved on the stationery in 1901.[26][27] The current letterhead wording and arrangement \\"The White House\\" with the word \\"Washington\\" centered beneath goes back to the administration of Franklin D. Roosevelt.[27]\\r\\nAlthough the structure was not completed until some years after the presidency of George Washington, there is speculation that the name of the traditional residence of the President of the United States may have derived from Martha Washington's home, White House Plantation in Virginia, where the nation's first President had courted the First Lady in the mid-18th century.[28]\\r\\nOn Saturday, November 1, 1800, John Adams became the first president to take residence in the building.[17] During Adams' second day in the house, he wrote a letter to his wife Abigail, containing a prayer for the house. Adams wrote:\\r\\nI pray Heaven to bestow the best of blessings on this House, and all that shall hereafter inhabit it. May none but honest and wise men ever rule under this roof.[29]\\r\\nFranklin D. Roosevelt had Adams's blessing carved into the mantel in the State Dining Room.[29]\\r\\nAdams lived in the house only briefly before Thomas Jefferson moved into the \\"pleasant country residence\\"[30] in 1801. Despite his complaints that the house was too big (\\"big enough for two emperors, one pope, and the grand lama in the bargain\\"[31]), Jefferson considered how the White House might be added to. With Benjamin Henry Latrobe, he helped lay out the design for the East and West Colonnades, small wings that help conceal the domestic operations of laundry, a stable and storage.[17] Today, Jefferson's colonnades link the residence with the East and West Wings.[17]\\r\\nIn 1814, during the War of 1812, the White House was set ablaze by British troops[32] during the Burning of Washington, in retaliation for burning Upper Canada's Parliament Buildings in the Battle of York; much of Washington was affected by these fires as well. Only the exterior walls remained, and they had to be torn down and mostly reconstructed because of weakening from the fire and subsequent exposure to the elements, except for portions of the south wall. Of the numerous objects taken from the White House when it was ransacked by British troops, only two have been recovered. Employees and slaves rescued a painting of George Washington,[32] and in 1939, a Canadian man returned a jewelry box to President Franklin D. Roosevelt, claiming that his grandfather had taken it from Washington. Some observers allege that most of these spoils were lost when a convoy of British ships led by HMS Fantome sank en route to Halifax off Prospect during a storm on the night of November 24, 1814,[33][34] even though Fantome had no involvement in that action.[35]\\r\\nAfter the fire, President James Madison resided in The Octagon House from 1814 to 1815, and then the Seven Buildings from 1815 to the end of his term.[36] Meanwhile, both architect Benjamin Henry Latrobe and Hoban contributed to the design and oversight of the reconstruction, which lasted from 1815 until 1817. The south portico was constructed in 1824 during the James Monroe administration; the north portico was built six years later.[17] Though Latrobe proposed similar porticos before the fire in 1814, both porticos were built as designed by Hoban.[37] An elliptical portico at Chateau de Rastignac in La Bachellerie, France with nearly identical curved stairs is speculated as the source of inspiration due to its similarity with the South Portico,[38] although this matter is one of great debate.[39] Italian artisans, brought to Washington to help in constructing the U.S. Capitol, carved the decorative stonework on both porticos. Contrary to speculation, the North Portico was not modeled on a similar portico on another Dublin building, the Viceregal Lodge (now ras an Uachtarin, residence of the President of Ireland), for its portico postdates the White House porticos' design.[38] For the North Portico, a variation on the Ionic Order was devised incorporating a swag of roses between the volutes. This was done to link the new portico with the earlier carved roses above the entrance.\\r\\nThe White House as it looked following the conflagration of August 24, 1814\\r\\nJefferson and Latrobe's West Wing Colonnade, in this nineteenth-century engraved view, is now the James S. Brady Press Briefing Room.\\r\\nPrincipal story plan for the white house by Benjamin Henry Latrobe, 1807.\\r\\nEarliest known photograph of the White House, taken c. 1846 by John Plumbe during the administration of James K. Polk.\\r\\nBy the time of the American Civil War, the White House had become overcrowded. The location of the White House was questioned, just north of a canal and swampy lands, which provided conditions ripe for malaria and other unhealthy conditions.[40] Brigadier General Nathaniel Michler was tasked to propose solutions to address these concerns. He proposed abandoning the use of the White House as a residence and designed a new estate for the first family at Meridian Hill in Washington, D.C., but Congress rejected the plan.[40]\\r\\nWhen Chester Arthur took office in 1881, he ordered renovations to the White House to take place as soon as the recently widowed Lucretia Garfield moved out. Arthur inspected the work almost nightly and made several suggestions. Louis Comfort Tiffany was asked to send selected designers to assist. Over twenty wagonloads of furniture and household items were removed from the building and sold at a public auction.[41] All that was saved were bust portraits of John Adams and Martin Van Buren.[42] A proposal was made to build a new residence south of the White House, but it failed to gain support.\\r\\nIn the fall of 1882 work was done on the main corridor, including tinting the walls pale olive and adding squares of gold leaf, and decorating the ceiling in gold and silver, and colorful traceries woven to spell \\"USA\\". The Red Room was painted a dull Pomeranian red, and its ceiling was decorated with gold, silver, and copper stars and stripes of red, white, and blue. A fifty-foot jeweled Tiffany glass screen, supported by imitation marble columns, replaced the glass doors that separated the main corridor from the north vestibule.[43][44]\\r\\nIn 1891, First Lady Caroline Harrison proposed major extensions to the White House, including a National Wing on the east for a historical art gallery, and a wing on the west for official functions.[40] A plan was devised by Colonel Theodore A. Bingham, which reflected the Harrison proposal.[40] These plans were ultimately rejected.\\r\\nHowever, in 1902 Theodore Roosevelt hired McKim, Mead & White to carry out expansions and renovations in a neoclassical style suited to the building's architecture, removing the Tiffany screen and all Victorian additions.[45][46] Charles McKim himself designed and managed the project, which gave more living space to the President's large family by removing a staircase in the West Hall and moving executive office staff from the second floor of the residence into the new West Wing.[17]\\r\\nPresident William Howard Taft enlisted the help of architect Nathan C. Wyeth to add additional space to the West Wing, which included the addition of the Oval Office.[40] In 1925, Congress enacted legislation allowing the White House to accept gifts of furniture and art for the first time.[47] The West Wing was damaged by fire in 1929, but rebuilt during the remaining years of the Herbert Hoover presidency. In the 1930s, a second story was added, as well as a larger basement for White House staff, and President Franklin Roosevelt had the Oval Office moved to its present location: adjacent to the Rose Garden.[17]\\r\\nDecades of poor maintenance, the construction of a fourth story attic during the Coolidge administration, and the addition of a second-floor balcony over the south portico for Harry S. Truman[48] took a great toll on the brick and sandstone structure built around a timber frame.[17] By 1948, the house was declared to be in imminent danger of collapse, forcing President Truman to commission a reconstruction and to live across the street at Blair House from 1949 to 1951.[49] The work, done by the firm of Philadelphia contractor John McShain, required the complete dismantling of the interior spaces, construction of a new load-bearing internal steel frame and the reconstruction of the original rooms within the new structure.[48] The total cost of the renovations was about $5.7 million (US$54 million in 2018).[50] Some modifications to the floor plan were made, the largest being the repositioning of the grand staircase to open into the Entrance Hall, rather than the Cross Hall.[48] Central air conditioning was added, as well as two additional sub-basements providing space for workrooms, storage, and a bomb shelter.[17] The Trumans moved back into the White House on March 27, 1952.[17] While the house's structure was kept intact by the Truman reconstruction, much of the new interior finishes were generic, and of little historic value. Much of the original plasterwork, some dating back to the 1814ÿ1816 rebuilding, was too damaged to reinstall, as was the original robust Beaux Arts paneling in the East Room. President Truman had the original timber frame sawed into paneling; the walls of the Vermeil Room, Library, China Room, and Map Room on the ground floor of the main residence were paneled in wood from the timbers.[51]\\r\\nJacqueline Kennedy, wife of President John F. Kennedy (1961ÿ63), directed a very extensive and historic redecoration of the house. She enlisted the help of Henry Francis du Pont of the Winterthur Museum to assist in collecting artifacts for the mansion, many of which had once been housed there.[52] Other antiques, fine paintings, and improvements of the Kennedy period were donated to the White House by wealthy philanthropists, including the Crowninshield family, Jane Engelhard, Jayne Wrightsman, and the Oppenheimer family.\\r\\nStphane Boudin of the House of Jansen, a Paris interior-design firm that had been recognized worldwide, was employed by Jacqueline Kennedy to assist with the decoration.[52] Different periods of the early republic and world history were selected as a theme for each room: the Federal style for the Green Room, French Empire for the Blue Room, American Empire for the Red Room, Louis XVI for the Yellow Oval Room, and Victorian for the President's study, renamed the Treaty Room. Antique furniture was acquired, and decorative fabric and trim based on period documents was produced and installed. The Kennedy restoration resulted in a more authentic White House of grander stature, which recalled the French taste of Madison and Monroe.[52] In the Diplomatic Reception Room, Mrs. Kennedy installed an antique \\"Vue de l'Amrique Nord\\" wallpaper which Zuber & Cie had designed in 1834. The wallpaper had hung previously on the walls of another mansion until 1961 when that house was demolished for a grocery store. Just before the demolition, the wallpaper was salvaged and sold to the White House.\\r\\nThe first White House guidebook was produced under the direction of curator Lorraine Waxman Pearce with direct supervision from Mrs. Kennedy.[53] Sale of the guidebook helped finance the restoration.\\r\\nKennedy showed her restoration of the White House to the public in a televised tour of the house on Valentine's Day in 1962.[54]\\r\\nCongress enacted legislation in September 1961 declaring the White House a museum. Furniture, fixtures, and decorative arts could now be declared either historic or of artistic interest by the President. This prevented them from being sold (as many objects in the executive mansion had been in the past 150 years). When not in use or display at the White House, these items were to be turned over to the Smithsonian Institution for preservation, study, storage, or exhibition. The White House retains the right to have these items returned.[55]\\r\\nOut of respect for the historic character of the White House, no substantive architectural changes have been made to the house since the Truman renovation.[56] Since the Kennedy restoration, every presidential family has made some changes to the private quarters of the White House, but the Committee for the Preservation of the White House must approve any modifications to the State Rooms. Charged with maintaining the historical integrity of the White House, the congressionally authorized committee works with each First Familyusually represented by the First Lady, the White House Curator, and the Chief Usherto implement the family's proposals for altering the house.[57]\\r\\nDuring the Nixon Administration (1969ÿ1974), First Lady Pat Nixon refurbished the Green Room, Blue Room, and Red Room, working with Clement Conger, the curator appointed by President Richard Nixon.[58] Mrs. Nixon's efforts brought more than 600 artifacts to the house, the largest acquisition by any administration.[59] Her husband created the modern press briefing room over Franklin Roosevelt's old swimming pool.[60] Nixon also added a single-lane bowling alley to the White House basement.[61]\\r\\nComputers and the first laser printer were added during the Carter administration, and the use of computer technology was expanded during the Reagan administration.[62] A Carter-era innovation, a set of solar water heating panels that were mounted on the roof of the White House, was removed during Reagan's presidency.[63][64] Redecorations were made to the private family quarters and maintenance was made to public areas during the Reagan years.[65] The house was accredited as a museum in 1988.[65]\\r\\nIn the 1990s, Bill and Hillary Clinton refurbished some rooms with the assistance of Arkansas decorator Kaki Hockersmith, including the Oval Office, the East Room, Blue Room, State Dining Room, Lincoln Bedroom, and Lincoln Sitting Room.[66] During the administration of George W. Bush, First Lady Laura Bush refurbished the Lincoln Bedroom in a style contemporary with the Lincoln era; the Green Room, Cabinet Room, and theater were also refurbished.[66]\\r\\nThe White House became one of the first wheelchair-accessible government buildings in Washington when modifications were made during the presidency of Franklin D. Roosevelt, who used a wheelchair because of his paralytic illness. In the 1990s, Hillary Clinton, at the suggestion of Visitors Office Director Melinda N. Bates, approved the addition of a ramp in the East Wing corridor. It allowed easy wheelchair access for the public tours and special events that enter through the secure entrance building on the east side.\\r\\nIn 2003, the Bush administration reinstalled solar thermal heaters.[64] These units are used to heat water for landscape maintenance personnel and for the presidential pool and spa. 167 solar photovoltaic grid-tied panels were installed at the same time on the roof of the maintenance facility. The changes were not publicized as a White House spokeswoman said the changes were an internal matter. The story was picked up by industry trade journals.[67] In 2013, President Barack Obama had a set of solar panels installed on the roof of the White House, making it the first time solar power would be used for the president's living quarters.[68][69]\\r\\nThe president usually travels to and from the White House grounds via official motorcade or helicopter. The journey by helicopter was inaugurated in the 1950s when President Dwight D. Eisenhower began traveling on Marine One to and from his official residence.[70]\\r\\nToday the group of buildings housing the presidency is known as the White House Complex. It includes the central Executive Residence flanked by the East Wing and West Wing. The Chief Usher coordinates day to day household operations. The White House includes: six stories and 55,000?ft2 (5,100 m2) of floor space, 132 rooms and 35 bathrooms, 412 doors, 147 windows, twenty-eight fireplaces, eight staircases, three elevators, five full-time chefs, a tennis court, a (single-lane) bowling alley, a movie theater (officially called the White House Family Theater[71]), a jogging track, a swimming pool, and a putting green.[27] It receives up to 30,000 visitors each week.[72]\\r\\nThe original residence is in the center. Two colonnadesone on the east and one on the westdesigned by Jefferson, now serve to connect the East and West Wings added later. The Executive Residence houses the president's dwelling, as well as rooms for ceremonies and official entertaining. The State Floor of the residence building includes the East Room, Green Room, Blue Room, Red Room, State Dining Room, Family Dining Room, Cross Hall, Entrance Hall, and Grand Staircase.[73] The Ground Floor is made up of the Diplomatic Reception Room, Map Room, China Room, Vermeil Room, Library, the main kitchen, and other offices.[74] The second floor family residence includes the Yellow Oval Room, East and West Sitting Halls, the White House Master Bedroom, President's Dining Room, the Treaty Room, Lincoln Bedroom and Queens' Bedroom, as well as two additional bedrooms, a smaller kitchen, and a private dressing room.[75] The third floor consists of the White House Solarium, Game Room, Linen Room, a Diet Kitchen, and another sitting room (previously used as President George W. Bush's workout room).[76]\\r\\nThe West Wing houses the President's office (the Oval Office) and offices of his senior staff, with room for about 50 employees. It also includes the Cabinet Room, where the president conducts business meetings and where the Cabinet meets,[77] as well as the White House Situation Room, James S. Brady Press Briefing Room, and Roosevelt Room.[78] In 2007, work was completed on renovations of the press briefing room, adding fiber optic cables and LCD screens for the display of charts and graphs.[79] The makeover took 11 months and cost of $8 million, out of which news outlets paid $2 million.[79] In September 2010, a two-year project began on the West Wing, creating a multistory underground structure;[80] this will be followed with additional renovation of the wing.[81]\\r\\nThe Oval Office, Roosevelt Room, and other portions of the West Wing were partially replicated on a sound stage and used as the setting for the popular television show The West Wing.[82]\\r\\nThe East Wing, which contains additional office space, was added to the White House in 1942. Among its uses, the East Wing has intermittently housed the offices and staff of the First Lady, and the White House Social Office. Rosalynn Carter, in 1977, was the first to place her personal office in the East Wing and to formally call it the \\"Office of the First Lady\\". The East Wing was built during World War II in order to hide the construction of an underground bunker to be used in emergencies. The bunker has come to be known as the Presidential Emergency Operations Center.\\r\\nThe White House and grounds cover just over 18 acres (about 7.3 hectares). Before the construction of the North Portico, most public events were entered from the South Lawn, which was graded and planted by Thomas Jefferson. Jefferson also drafted a planting plan for the North Lawn that included large trees that would have mostly obscured the house from Pennsylvania Avenue. During the mid-to-late 19th century a series of ever larger greenhouses were built on the west side of the house, where the current West Wing is located. During this period, the North Lawn was planted with ornate carpet-style flowerbeds. The general layout of the White House grounds today is based on the 1935 design by Frederick Law Olmsted Jr. of the Olmsted Brothers firm, commissioned by President Franklin D. Roosevelt. During the Kennedy administration, the White House Rose Garden was redesigned by Rachel Lambert Mellon. The Rose Garden borders the West Colonnade. Bordering the East Colonnade is the Jacqueline Kennedy Garden, which was begun by Jacqueline Kennedy but completed after her husband's assassination. On the weekend of June 23, 2006, a century-old American Elm (Ulmus americana L.) tree on the north side of the building, came down during one of the many storms amid intense flooding. Among the oldest trees on the grounds are several magnolias (Magnolia grandiflora) planted by Andrew Jackson, including the Jackson Magnolia, reportedly grown from a sprout taken from the favorite tree of Jackson's recently deceased wife, the sprout planted after Jackson moved into the White House. The tree stood for over 200 years; but in 2017, having become too weak to stand on its own, it was decided it should be removed and replaced with one of its offspring.[83][84] Michelle Obama planted the White House's first organic garden and installed beehives on the South Lawn of the White House, which will supply organic produce and honey to the First Family and for state dinners and other official gatherings.[85]\\r\\nThe Cross Hall, connecting the State Dining Room and the East Room on the State Floor\\r\\nMarine One prepares for landing on the South Lawn where State Arrival Ceremonies for visiting heads of state take place.\\r\\nThe White House and surrounding grounds\\r\\nThe White House with fountain and grounds\\r\\nWhite House from the north\\r\\nLike the English and Irish country houses it was modeled on, the White House was, from the start, open to the public until the early part of the 20th century. President Thomas Jefferson held an open house for his second inaugural in 1805, and many of the people at his swearing-in ceremony at the Capitol followed him home, where he greeted them in the Blue Room. Those open houses sometimes became rowdy: in 1829, President Andrew Jackson had to leave for a hotel when roughly 20,000 citizens celebrated his inauguration inside the White House. His aides ultimately had to lure the mob outside with washtubs filled with a potent cocktail of orange juice and whiskey. Even so, the practice continued until 1885, when newly elected Grover Cleveland arranged for a presidential review of the troops from a grandstand in front of the White House instead of the traditional open house. Jefferson also permitted public tours of his house, which have continued ever since, except during wartime, and began the tradition of annual receptions on New Year's Day and on the Fourth of July. Those receptions ended in the early 1930s, although President Bill Clinton briefly revived the New Year's Day open house in his first term.\\r\\nThe White House remained accessible in other ways; President Abraham Lincoln complained that he was constantly beleaguered by job seekers waiting to ask him for political appointments or other favors, or eccentric dispensers of advice like \\"General\\" Daniel Pratt, as he began the business day. Lincoln put up with the annoyance rather than risk alienating some associate or friend of a powerful politician or opinion maker.[citation needed]\\r\\nIn February 1974, a stolen army helicopter landed without authorization on the White House's grounds.[86] Twenty years later, in 1994, a light plane flown by Frank Eugene Corder crashed on the White House grounds, and he died instantly.[87]\\r\\nAs a result of increased security regarding air traffic in the capital, the White House was evacuated in May 2005 before an unauthorized aircraft could approach the grounds.[88]\\r\\nOn May 20, 1995, primarily as a response to the Oklahoma City bombing of April 19, 1995, the United States Secret Service closed off Pennsylvania Avenue to vehicular traffic in front of the White House from the eastern edge of Lafayette Park to 17th Street. Later, the closure was extended an additional block to the east to 15th Street, and East Executive Avenue, a small street between the White House and the Treasury Building.\\r\\nAfter September 11, 2001, this was made permanent in addition to closing E Street between the South Portico of the White House and the Ellipse.[89] In response to the Boston Marathon bombing the road was closed to the public in its entirety for a period of two days.\\r\\nThe Pennsylvania Avenue closing has been opposed by organized civic groups in Washington, D.C. They argue that the closing impedes traffic flow unnecessarily and is inconsistent with the well-conceived historic plan for the city. As for security considerations, they note that the White House is set much farther back from the street than numerous other sensitive federal buildings are.[90]\\r\\nPrior to its inclusion within the fenced compound that now includes the Old Executive Office Building to the west and the Treasury Building to the east, this sidewalk served as a queuing area for the daily public tours of the White House. These tours were suspended in the wake of the September 11 attacks. In September 2003, they resumed on a limited basis for groups making prior arrangements through their Congressional representatives or embassies in Washington for foreign nationals and submitting to background checks, but the White House remained closed to the public.[91] White House tours were suspended for most of 2013 due to budget constraints after sequestration.[92] The White House reopened to the public in November 2013.[93]\\r\\nThe White House Complex is protected by the United States Secret Service and the United States Park Police.\\r\\nNASAMS (Norwegian Advanced Surface to Air Missile System) were used to guard air space over Washington, D.C. during the 2005 presidential inauguration. The same NASAMS units have since been used to protect the president and all airspace around the White House, which is strictly prohibited to aircraft.[94][95]\\r\\nFor security reasons, the section of Pennsylvania Avenue on the north side of the White House is closed to all vehicular traffic, except government officials.\\r\\nWhite House at night\\r\\nNorth front of the White House on the reverse (back) of the U.S. $20 bill.","input":"Who was first president in the white house?"},{"output":"Dheeraj Dhoopar","context":"Dheeraj Dhoopar (born; 1984 in Delhi) is an Indian television actor, model.

The battle took place in the Atlantic Ocean off the southwest coast of Spain, just west of Cape Trafalgar, near the town of Los Ca?os de Meca. The Franco-Spanish fleet lost twenty-two ships and the British lost none. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe victory confirmed the naval supremacy Britain had established during the course of the eighteenth century and it was achieved in part through Nelson's departure from the prevailing naval tactical orthodoxy of the day.[4] Conventional practice at the time was for opposing fleets to engage each other in single parallel lines, in order to facilitate signalling and disengagement, and to maximise fields of fire and target areas. Nelson instead arranged his ships into two columns to sail perpendicularly into the enemy fleet's line.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the battle, Nelson was shot by a French musketeer and he died shortly before the battle ended. Villeneuve was captured, along with his ship Bucentaure. He later attended Nelson's funeral while a captive on parole in Britain. Admiral Federico Gravina, the senior Spanish flag officer, escaped with the remnant of the fleet. He died five months later from wounds sustained during the battle. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1805, the First French Empire, under Napoleon Bonaparte, was the dominant military land power on the European continent, while the British Royal Navy controlled the seas.[5] During the course of the war, the British imposed a naval blockade on France, which affected trade and kept the French from fully mobilising their naval resources.[6] Despite several successful evasions of the blockade by the French navy, it failed to inflict a major defeat upon the British, who were able to attack French interests at home and abroad with relative ease.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the Third Coalition declared war on France, after the short-lived Peace of Amiens, Napoleon was determined to invade Britain. To do so, he needed to ensure that the Royal Navy would be unable to disrupt the invasion flotilla, which would require control of the English Channel.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe main French fleets were at Brest in Brittany and at Toulon on the Mediterranean coast. Other ports on the French Atlantic coast harboured smaller squadrons. France and Spain were allied, so the Spanish fleet based in Cdiz and Ferrol was also available.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe British possessed an experienced and well-trained corps of naval officers.[10] By contrast, some of the best officers in the French navy had either been executed or had left the service during the early part of the French Revolution.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nVice-Admiral Pierre-Charles Villeneuve had taken command of the French Mediterranean fleet following the death of Latouche Treville. There had been more competent officers, but they had either been employed elsewhere or had fallen from Napoleon's favour.[12] Villeneuve had shown a distinct lack of enthusiasm for facing Nelson and the Royal Navy after the French defeat at the Battle of the Nile in 1798.[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nNapoleon's naval plan in 1805 was for the French and Spanish fleets in the Mediterranean and Cdiz to break through the blockade and join forces in the Caribbean. They would then return, assist the fleet in Brest to emerge from the blockade, and together clear the English Channel of Royal Navy ships, ensuring a safe passage for the invasion barges.[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nEarly in 1805, Vice Admiral Lord Nelson commanded the British fleet blockading Toulon. Unlike William Cornwallis, who maintained a close blockade off Brest with the Channel Fleet, Nelson adopted a loose blockade in the hope of luring the French out for a major battle.[14] However, Villeneuve's fleet successfully evaded Nelson's when the British were blown off station by storms. Nelson commenced a search of the Mediterranean, erroneously supposing that the French intended to make for Egypt. However, Villeneuve took his fleet through the Strait of Gibraltar, rendezvoused with the Spanish fleet, and sailed as planned for the Caribbean. Once Nelson realised that the French had crossed the Atlantic Ocean, he set off in pursuit.[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nVilleneuve returned from the Caribbean to Europe, intending to break the blockade at Brest,[13] but after two of his Spanish ships were captured during the Battle of Cape Finisterre by a squadron under Vice-Admiral Sir Robert Calder, Villeneuve abandoned this plan and sailed back to Ferrol in northern Spain.[16] There he received orders from Napoleon to return to Brest according to the main plan.[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nNapoleon's invasion plans for Britain depended on having a sufficiently large number of ships of the line before Boulogne in France. This would require Villeneuve's force of 33 ships to join Vice-Admiral Ganteaume's force of 21 ships at Brest, along with a squadron of five ships under Captain Allemand, which would have given him a combined force of 59 ships of the line.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Villeneuve set sail from Ferrol on 10 August, he was under orders from Napoleon to sail northward toward Brest. Instead, he worried that the British were observing his manoeuvres, so on 11 August, he sailed southward towards Cdiz on the southwestern coast of Spain.[18] With no sign of Villeneuve's fleet, on 25 August, the three French army corps' invasion force near Boulogne broke camp and marched into Germany, where it was later engaged. This ended the immediate threat of invasion.[19][20]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe same month, Nelson returned home to Britain after two years of duty at sea.[21] He remained ashore for 25?days and was warmly received by his countrymen.[22] Word reached Britain on 2 September about the combined French and Spanish fleet in Cadiz harbour.[23] Nelson had to wait until 15 September before his ship, HMS Victory, was ready to sail.[24]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 15 August, Cornwallis decided to detach 20 ships of the line from the fleet guarding the English Channel and to have them sail southward to engage the enemy forces in Spain.[25] This left the Channel drastically reduced of large vessels, with only 11 ships of the line present.[26] This detached force formed the nucleus of the British fleet that would fight at Trafalgar. This fleet, under the command of Vice-Admiral Calder, reached Cdiz on 15 September. Nelson joined the fleet on 28 September to take command.[27]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe British fleet used frigates (faster, but too fragile for the line of battle), to keep a constant watch on the harbour, while the main force remained out of sight, approximately 50?miles (80?km) west of the shore.[28] Nelson's hope was to lure the combined Franco-Spanish force out and engage it in a decisive battle. The force watching the harbour was led by Captain Blackwood, commanding HMS Euryalus.[28] His squadron of seven ships comprised five frigates, a schooner, and a brig.[29]\\r\\n\\r\\nAt this point, Nelson's fleet badly needed provisioning. On 2 October, five ships of the line, HMS Queen, Canopus, Spencer, Zealous, Tigre, and the frigate HMS Endymion were dispatched to Gibraltar under Rear-Admiral Sir Thomas Louis for supplies.[30]\\r\\n\\r\\nThese ships were later diverted for convoy duty in the Mediterranean, although Nelson had expected them to return. Other British ships continued to arrive, and by 15 October the fleet was up to full strength for the battle. Nelson also lost Calder's flagship, the 98-gun Prince of Wales, which he sent home as Calder had been recalled by the Admiralty to face a court martial for his apparent lack of aggression during the engagement off Cape Finisterre on 22 July.\\r\\n\\r\\nMeanwhile, Villeneuve's fleet in Cdiz was also suffering from a serious supply shortage that could not be easily rectified by the cash-poor French.[31] The blockade maintained by the British fleet had made it difficult for the Franco-Spanish allies to obtain stores, and their ships were ill-equipped. Villeneuve's ships were also more than two thousand men short of the force needed to sail. These were not the only problems faced by the Franco-Spanish fleet. The main French ships of the line had been kept in harbour for years by the British blockade with only brief sorties. The French crews included few experienced sailors, and, as most of the crew had to be taught the elements of seamanship on the few occasions when they got to sea, gunnery was neglected. The hasty voyage across the Atlantic and back used up vital supplies. Villeneuve's supply situation began to improve in October, but news of Nelson's arrival made Villeneuve reluctant to leave port. Indeed, his captains had held a vote on the matter and decided to stay in harbour.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 16 September, Napoleon gave orders for the French and Spanish ships at Cdiz to put to sea at the first favourable opportunity, join with seven Spanish ships of the line then at Cartagena, go to Naples and land the soldiers they carried to reinforce his troops there, then fight decisively if they met a numerically inferior British fleet.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 21 October, Admiral Nelson had 27 ships of the line under his command. Nelson's flagship, HMS Victory, captained by Thomas Masterman Hardy, was one of three 100-gun first rates in his fleet. He also had four 98-gun second rates and twenty third rates. One of the third rates was an 80-gun vessel, and sixteen were 74-gun vessels. The remaining three were 64-gun ships, which were being phased out of the Royal Navy at the time of the battle. Nelson also had four frigates of 38 or 36 guns, a 12-gun schooner and a 10-gun cutter.\\r\\n\\r\\nAgainst Nelson, Vice-Admiral Villeneuvesailing on his flagship Bucentaurefielded 33 ships of the line, including some of the largest in the world at the time. The Spanish contributed four first-rates to the fleet. Three of these ships, one at 130 guns (Santisima Trinidad) and two at 112 guns (Prncipe de Asturias, Santa Ana), were much larger than anything under Nelson's command. The fourth first-rate carried 100 guns. The fleet had six 80-gun third-rates, (four French and two Spanish), and one Spanish 64-gun third-rate. The remaining 22 third-rates were 74-gun vessels, of which fourteen were French and eight Spanish. In total, the Spanish contributed 15 ships of the line and the French 18. The fleet also included five 40-gun frigates and two 18-gun brigs, all French.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe prevailing tactical orthodoxy at the time involved manoeuvring to approach the enemy fleet in a single line of battle and then engaging broadside in parallel lines.[32] Before this time the fleets had usually been involved in a mixed mle. One reason for the development of the line of battle system was to facilitate control of the fleet: if all the ships were in line, signalling in battle became possible.[33] The line also allowed either side to disengage by breaking away in formation; if the attacker chose to continue, their line would be broken as well.[32] This often led to inconclusive battles, or allowed the losing side to minimise its losses; but Nelson wanted a conclusive action.[34]\\r\\n\\r\\nNelson's solution to the problem was to cut the opposing line in three. Approaching in two columns, sailing perpendicular to the enemy's line, one towards the centre of the opposing line and one towards the trailing end, his ships would break the enemy formation into three, surround one third, and force them to fight to the end.[35] Nelson hoped specifically to cut the line just in front of the French flagship, Bucentaure; the isolated ships in front of the break would not be able to see the flagship's signals, hopefully taking them out of combat while they re-formed. The intention of going straight at the enemy echoed the tactics used by Admiral Duncan at the Battle of Camperdown and Admiral Jervis at the Battle of Cape St Vincent, both in 1797.[36]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe plan had three principal advantages. First, the British fleet would close with the Franco-Spanish as quickly as possible, reducing the chance that they would be able to escape without fighting.[37] Second, it would quickly bring on a mle and frantic battle by breaking the Franco-Spanish line and inducing a series of individual ship-to-ship actions, in which the British were likely to prevail. Nelson knew that the superior seamanship, faster gunnery and better morale of his crews were great advantages.[38] Third, it would bring a decisive concentration on the rear of the Franco-Spanish fleet. The ships in the van of the enemy fleet would have to turn back to support the rear, which would take a long time.[35] Additionally, once the Franco-Spanish line had been broken, their ships would be relatively defenceless against powerful broadsides from the British fleet, and it would take them a long time to reposition to return fire.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe main drawback of attacking head-on was that as the leading British ships approached, the Franco-Spanish fleet would be able to direct raking broadside fire at their bows, to which they would be unable to reply. To lessen the time the fleet was exposed to this danger, Nelson had his ships make all available sail (including stuns'ls), yet another departure from the norm.[39] He was also well aware that French and Spanish gunners were ill-trained and would have difficulty firing accurately from a moving gun platform. The Combined Fleet was sailing across a heavy swell, causing the ships to roll heavily and exacerbating the problem. Nelson's plan was indeed a gamble, but a carefully calculated one.[40]\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the period of blockade off the coast of Spain in October, Nelson instructed his captains, over two dinners aboard Victory, on his plan for the approaching battle. The order of sailing, in which the fleet was arranged when the enemy was first sighted, was to be the order of the ensuing action so that no time would be wasted in forming a precise line.[41] The attack was to be made in two lines. One, led by his second-in-command Vice-Admiral Cuthbert Collingwood, was to sail into the rear of the enemy line, while the other, led by Nelson, was to sail into the centre and vanguard.[37] The intention was to split the enemy line and engage in close quarter action, a form of combat in which, Nelson believed, the British fleet would have the advantage. In preparation for the battle, Nelson ordered the ships of his fleet to be painted in a distinctive yellow and black pattern (later known as the Nelson Chequer) that would make them easy to distinguish from their opponents.[42]\\r\\n\\r\\nNelson was careful to point out that something had to be left to chance. Nothing is sure in a sea battle, so he left his captains free from all hampering rules by telling them that \\"No captain can do very wrong if he places his ship alongside that of the enemy.\\"[36] In short, circumstances would dictate the execution, subject to the guiding rule that the enemy's rear was to be cut off and superior force concentrated on that part of the enemy's line.\\r\\n\\r\\nAdmiral Villeneuve himself expressed his belief that Nelson would use some sort of unorthodox attack, stating specifically that he believedaccuratelythat Nelson would drive right at his line. But his long game of cat and mouse with Nelson had worn him down, and he was suffering from a loss of nerve. Arguing that the inexperience of his officers meant he would not be able to maintain formation in more than one group, he chose not to act on his assessment.[43]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Combined Fleet of French and Spanish warships anchored in Cdiz and under the leadership of Admiral Villeneuve was in disarray. On 16 September 1805 Villeneuve received orders from Napoleon to sail the Combined Fleet from Cdiz to Naples. At first, Villeneuve was optimistic about returning to the Mediterranean, but soon had second thoughts. A war council was held aboard his flagship, Bucentaure, on 8 October.[44] While some of the French captains wished to obey Napoleon's orders, the Spanish captains and other French officers, including Villeneuve, thought it best to remain in Cdiz.[45] Villeneuve changed his mind yet again on 18 October 1805, ordering the Combined Fleet to sail immediately even though there were only very light winds.[46]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe sudden change was prompted by a letter Villeneuve had received on 18 October, informing him that Vice-Admiral Fran?ois Rosily had arrived in Madrid with orders to take command of the Combined Fleet.[47] Stung by the prospect of being disgraced before the fleet, Villeneuve resolved to go to sea before his successor could reach Cdiz. At the same time, he received intelligence that a detachment of six British ships (Admiral Louis' squadron), had docked at Gibraltar, thus weakening the British fleet. This was used as the pretext for sudden change.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe weather, however, suddenly turned calm following a week of gales. This slowed the progress of the fleet leaving the harbour, giving the British plenty of warning. Villeneuve had drawn up plans to form a force of four squadrons, each containing both French and Spanish ships. Following their earlier vote on 8 October to stay put, some captains were reluctant to leave Cdiz, and as a result they failed to follow Villeneuve's orders closely and the fleet straggled out of the harbour in no particular formation.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt took most of 20 October for Villeneuve to get his fleet organised; it eventually set sail in three columns for the Straits of Gibraltar to the southeast. That same evening, Achille spotted a force of 18 British ships of the line in pursuit. The fleet began to prepare for battle and during the night, they were ordered into a single line. The following day, Nelson's fleet of 27 ships of the line and four frigates was spotted in pursuit from the northwest with the wind behind it. Villeneuve again ordered his fleet into three columns, but soon changed his mind and ordered a single line. The result was a sprawling, uneven formation.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt 5:40?a.m. on 21 October, the British were about 21?miles  (34?km) to the northwest of Cape Trafalgar, with the Franco-Spanish fleet between the British and the Cape. At circa 6?a.m., Nelson gave the order to prepare for battle.[48] At 8?am the British frigate Euryalus, which had been keeping watch on the Combined Fleet overnight, observed the British fleet still \\"forming the lines\\" in which it would attack.[49]\\r\\n\\r\\nAt 8?a.m., Villeneuve ordered the fleet to wear together (turn about) and return to Cdiz. This reversed the order of the allied line, placing the rear division under Rear-Admiral Pierre Dumanoir le Pelley in the vanguard. The wind became contrary at this point, often shifting direction. The very light wind rendered manoeuvring virtually impossible for all but the most expert seamen. The inexperienced crews had difficulty with the changing conditions, and it took nearly an hour and a half for Villeneuve's order to be completed. The French and Spanish fleet now formed an uneven, angular crescent, with the slower ships generally to leeward and closer to the shore.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy 11?a.m. Nelson's entire fleet was visible to Villeneuve, drawn up in two parallel columns. The two fleets would be within range of each other within an hour. Villeneuve was concerned at this point about forming up a line, as his ships were unevenly spaced and in an irregular formation. The Franco-Spanish fleet was drawn out nearly five miles (8?km) long as Nelson's fleet approached.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the British drew closer, they could see that the enemy was not sailing in a tight order, but rather in irregular groups. Nelson could not immediately make out the French flagship as the French and Spanish were not flying command pennants.\\r\\n\\r\\nNelson was outnumbered and outgunned, the enemy totalling nearly 30,000 men and 2,568 guns to his 17,000 men and 2,148 guns. The Franco-Spanish fleet also had six more ships of the line, and so could more readily combine their fire. There was no way for some of Nelson's ships to avoid being \\"doubled on\\" or even \\"trebled on\\".\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the two fleets drew closer, anxiety began to build among officers and sailors; one British sailor described the time before thus: \\"During this momentous preparation, the human mind had ample time for meditation, for it was evident that the fate of England rested on this battle\\".[50]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe battle progressed largely according to Nelson's plan. At 11:45, Nelson sent the famous flag signal, \\"England expects that every man will do his duty\\".[51]\\r\\n\\r\\nHis Lordship came to me on the poop, and after ordering certain signals to be made, about a quarter to noon, he said, \\"Mr. Pasco, I wish to say to the fleet, ENGLAND CONFIDES THAT EVERY MAN WILL DO HIS DUTY\\" and he added \\"You must be quick, for I have one more to make which is for close action.\\" I replied, \\"If your Lordship will permit me to substitute 'expects' for 'confides' the signal will soon be completed, because the word 'expects' is in the vocabulary, and 'confides' must be spelt,\\" His Lordship replied, in haste, and with seeming satisfaction, \\"That will do, Pasco, make it directly.\\"[52]\\r\\nThe term \\"England\\" was widely used at the time to refer to the United Kingdom; the British fleet included significant contingents from Ireland, Scotland, and Wales. Unlike the photographic depiction (right), this signal would have been shown on the mizzen mast only and would have required 12 lifts.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the battle opened, the French and Spanish were in a ragged curved line headed north. As planned, the British fleet was approaching the Franco-Spanish line in two columns. Leading the northern, windward column in Victory was Nelson, while Collingwood in the 100-gun Royal Sovereign led the second, leeward, column. The two British columns approached from the west at nearly a right angle to the allied line. Nelson led his column into a feint toward the van of the Franco-Spanish fleet and then abruptly turned toward the actual point of attack. Collingwood altered the course of his column slightly so that the two lines converged at this line of attack.\\r\\n\\r\\nJust before his column engaged the allied forces, Collingwood said to his officers: \\"Now, gentlemen, let us do something today which the world may talk of hereafter.\\" Because the winds were very light during the battle, all the ships were moving extremely slowly, and the foremost British ships were under heavy fire from several of the allied ships for almost an hour before their own guns could bear.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt noon, Villeneuve sent the signal \\"engage the enemy\\", and Fougueux fired her first trial shot at Royal Sovereign.[54][55][56] Royal Sovereign had all sails out and, having recently had her bottom cleaned, outran the rest of the British fleet. As she approached the allied line, she came under fire from Fougueux, Indomptable, San Justo, and San Leandro, before breaking the line just astern of Admiral Alava's flagship Santa Ana, into which she fired a devastating double-shotted raking broadside.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe second ship in the British lee column, Belleisle, was engaged by L'Aigle, Achille, Neptune, and Fougueux; she was soon completely dismasted, unable to manoeuvre and largely unable to fight, as her sails blinded her batteries, but kept flying her flag for 45?minutes until the following British ships came to her rescue.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor 40?minutes, Victory was under fire from Hros, Santsima Trinidad, Redoutable, and Neptune; although many shots went astray, others killed and wounded a number of her crew and shot her wheel away, so that she had to be steered from her tiller belowdecks. Victory could not yet respond. At 12:45, Victory cut the enemy line between Villeneuve's flagship Bucentaure and Redoutable; she came close to Bucentaure, firing a devastating raking broadside through her stern which killed and wounded many on her gundecks. Villeneuve thought that boarding would take place, and with the Eagle of his ship in hand, told his men, \\"I will throw it onto the enemy ship and we will take it back there!\\" However Victory engaged the 74-gun Redoutable; Bucentaure was left to be dealt with by the next three ships of the British windward column: Temeraire, Conqueror, and HMS?Neptune.\\r\\n\\r\\nA general mle ensued and, during that fight, Victory locked masts with the French Redoutable. The crew of Redoutable, which included a strong infantry corps (with three captains and four lieutenants), gathered for an attempt to board and seize Victory. A musket bullet fired from the mizzentop of Redoutable struck Nelson in the left shoulder, passed through his spine at the sixth and seventh thoracic vertebrae, and lodged two inches below his right scapula in the muscles of his back. Nelson exclaimed, \\"They finally succeeded, I am dead.\\" He was carried below decks.\\r\\n\\r\\nVictory's gunners were called on deck to fight boarders, and she ceased firing. The gunners were forced back below decks by French grenades. As the French were preparing to board Victory, Temeraire, the second ship in the British windward column, approached from the starboard bow of Redoutable and fired on the exposed French crew with a carronade, causing many casualties.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt 13:55, Captain Lucas, of Redoutable, with 99 fit men out of 643 and severely wounded himself, surrendered. The French Bucentaure was isolated by Victory and Temeraire, and then engaged by HMS Neptune, HMS?Leviathan, and Conqueror; similarly, Santsima Trinidad was isolated and overwhelmed, surrendering after three hours.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs more and more British ships entered the battle, the ships of the allied centre and rear were gradually overwhelmed. The allied van, after long remaining quiescent, made a futile demonstration and then sailed away. The British took 22 vessels of the Franco-Spanish fleet and lost none. Among the captured French ships were L'Aigle, Algsiras, Berwick, Bucentaure, Fougueux, Intrpide, Redoutable, and Swiftsure. The Spanish ships taken were Argonauta, Bahama, Monarca, Neptuno, San Agustn, San Ildefonso, San Juan Nepomuceno, Santsima Trinidad, and Santa Ana. Of these, Redoutable sank, and Santsima Trinidad and Argonauta were scuttled by the British. Achille exploded, Intrpide and San Augustn burned, and L'Aigle, Berwick, Fougueux, and Monarca were wrecked in a gale following the battle.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs Nelson lay dying, he ordered the fleet to anchor, as a storm was predicted. However, when the storm blew up, many of the severely damaged ships sank or ran aground on the shoals. A few of them were recaptured, some by the French and Spanish prisoners overcoming the small prize crews, others by ships sallying from Cdiz. Surgeon William Beatty heard Nelson murmur, \\"Thank God I have done my duty\\"; when he returned, Nelson's voice had faded, and his pulse was very weak.[57] He looked up as Beatty took his pulse, then closed his eyes. Nelson's chaplain, Alexander Scott, who remained by Nelson as he died, recorded his last words as \\"God and my country.\\"[58] It has been suggested by Nelson historian Craig Cabell that Nelson was actually reciting his own prayer as he fell into his death coma, as the words 'God' and 'my country' are closely linked therein. Nelson died at half-past four, three hours after being hit.[57]\\r\\n\\r\\n.\\r\\n\\r\\nTowards the end of the battle, and with the combined fleet being overwhelmed, the still relatively un-engaged portion of the van under Rear-Admiral Dumanoir Le Pelley tried to come to the assistance of the collapsing centre. After failing to fight his way through, he decided to break off the engagement, and led four French ships, his flagship the 80-gun Formidable, the 74-gun ships Scipion, Duguay Trouin and Mont Blanc away from the fighting. He headed at first for the Straits of Gibraltar, intending to carry out Villeneuve's original orders and make for Toulon.[59] On 22 October he changed his mind, remembering a powerful British squadron under Rear-Admiral Thomas Louis was patrolling the straits, and headed north, hoping to reach one of the French Atlantic ports. With a storm gathering in strength off the Spanish coast, he sailed westwards to clear Cape St Vincent, prior to heading north-west, swinging eastwards across the Bay of Biscay, and aiming to reach the French port at Rochefort.[59] These four ships remained at large until their encounter with and attempt to chase a British frigate brought them in range of a British squadron under Sir Richard Strachan, which captured them all on 4 November 1805 at the Battle of Cape Ortegal.[59]\\r\\n\\r\\nOnly eleven ships escaped to Cdiz, and, of those, only five were considered seaworthy. The seriously wounded Admiral Gravina passed command of the remainder of the fleet over to Captain Julien Cosmao on 23 October. From shore, the allied commanders could see an opportunity for a rescue mission existed. Cosmao claimed in his report that the rescue plan was entirely his idea, but Vice-Admiral Escano recorded a meeting of Spanish and French Commodores at which a planned rescue was discussed and agreed upon. Enrique MacDonell and Cosmao were of equal rank and both raised commodore's pennants before hoisting anchor.[60] Both sets of mariners were determined to make an attempt to recapture some of the prizes.[60] Cosmao ordered the rigging of his ship, the 74-gun Pluton, to be repaired and reinforced her crew (which had been depleted by casualties from the battle), with sailors from the French frigate Hermione. Taking advantage of a favourable northwesterly wind,[61] Pluton, the 80-gun Neptune and Indomptable, the Spanish 100-gun Rayo and 74-gun San Francisco de Ass, together with five French frigates and two brigs, sailed out of the harbour towards the British.[62][63]\\r\\n\\r\\nSoon after leaving port, the wind shifted to west-southwest, raising a heavy sea with the result that most of the British prizes broke their tow ropes, and drifting far to leeward, were only partially resecured. The combined squadron came in sight at noon, causing Collingwood to summon his most battle-ready ships to meet the threat. In doing so, he ordered them to cast off towing their prizes. He had formed a defensive line of ten ships by three o'clock in the afternoon and approached the Franco-Spanish squadron, covering the remainder of their prizes which stood out to sea.[63][64] The Franco-Spanish squadron chose not to approach within gunshot and then declined to attack.[65] Collingwood also chose not to seek action, and in the confusion of the powerful storm, the French frigates managed to retake two Spanish ships of the line which had been cast off by their British captors, the 112-gun Santa Ana and 80-gun Neptuno, taking them in tow and making for Cdiz.[66] On being taken in tow, the Spanish crews rose up against their British prize crews, putting them to work as prisoners.[56][67][68]\\r\\n\\r\\nDespite this initial success the Franco-Spanish force, hampered by battle damage, struggled in the heavy seas. Neptuno was eventually wrecked off Rota in the gale, while Santa Ana reached port.[69] The French 80-gun ship Indomptable was wrecked on the 24th or 25th off the town of Rota on the northwest point of the bay of Cdiz.[68] At the time Indomptable had 1,200 men on board, but no more than 100 were saved. San Francisco de Ass was driven ashore in Cdiz Bay, near Fort Santa-Catalina, although her crew was saved. Rayo, an old three-decker with more than 50 years of service, anchored off Sanl~car, a few leagues to the northwest of Rota. There, she lost her masts; they had been damaged by shot earlier.[68] Heartened by the approach of the squadron, the French crew of the former flagship Bucentaure also rose up and retook the ship from the British prize crew but she was wrecked later on 23 October. Aigle escaped from the British ship HMS Defiance, but was wrecked off the port of Santa Mara on 23 October; while the French prisoners on Berwick cut the tow cables, but caused her to founder off Sanl~car on 22 October. The crew of Algsiras rose up and managed to sail into Cdiz.[56]\\r\\n\\r\\nObserving that some of the leewardmost of the prizes were escaping towards the Spanish coast, Leviathan asked for and was granted permission by Collingwood to try to retrieve the prizes and bring them to anchor. Leviathan chased Monarca, but on 24 October she came across Rayo, dismasted but still flying Spanish colours, at anchor off the shoals of Sanl~car.[70] At this point the 74-gun HMS Donegal, en route from Gibraltar under Captain Pulteney Malcolm, was seen approaching from the south on the larboard tack with a moderate breeze from northwest-by-north and steered directly for the Spanish three-decker.[71] At about ten o'clock, just as Monarca had got within little more than a mile of Rayo, Leviathan fired a warning shot wide of Monarca, to oblige her to drop anchor. The shot fell between Monarca and Rayo. The latter, conceiving that it was probably intended for her, hauled down her colours, and was taken by HMS Donegal, who anchored alongside and took off the prisoners.[70] Leviathan resumed her pursuit of Monarca, eventually catching up and forcing her to surrender. On boarding her, her British captors found that she was in a sinking state, and so removed the British prize crew, and nearly all of her original Spanish crew members. The nearly empty Monarca parted her cable and was wrecked during the night. Despite the efforts of her British prize crew, Rayo was driven onshore on 26 October and wrecked, with the loss of twenty-five men. The remainder of the prize crew were made prisoners by the Spanish.[72]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the aftermath of the storm, Collingwood wrote:\\r\\n\\r\\nThe condition of our own ships was such that it was very doubtful what would be their fate. Many a time I would have given the whole group of our capture, to ensure our own... I can only say that in my life I never saw such efforts as were made to save these [prize] ships, and would rather fight another battle than pass through such a week as followed it.\\r\\nOn balance, the allied counter-attack achieved little. In forcing the British to suspend their repairs to defend themselves, it influenced Collingwood's decision to sink or set fire to the most damaged of his remaining prizes.[66] Cosmao retook two Spanish ships of the line, but it cost him one French and two Spanish vessels to do so. Fearing their loss, the British burnt or sank Santisima Trinidad, Argonauta, San Antonio and Intrepide.[56] Only four of the British prizes, the French Swiftsure and the Spanish Bahama, San Ildefonso and San Juan Nepomuceno survived to be taken to Britain.[66] After the end of the battle and storm only nine ships of the line were left in Cdiz.[62][74]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Rosily arrived in Cdiz, he found only five French ships, rather than the 18 he was expecting. The surviving ships remained bottled up in Cdiz until 1808 when Napoleon invaded Spain. The French ships were then seized by the Spanish forces and put into service against France.\\r\\n\\r\\nHMS Victory made her way to Gibraltar for repairs, carrying Nelson's body. She put into Rosia Bay, Gibraltar and after emergency repairs were carried out, returned to Britain. Many of the injured crew were brought ashore at Gibraltar and treated in the Naval Hospital. Men who subsequently died from injuries sustained at the battle are buried in or near the Trafalgar Cemetery, at the south end of Main Street, Gibraltar.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne Royal Marine officer was killed on board Victory; Captain Charles Adair. Royal Marine Lieutenant Lewis Buckle Reeve was seriously wounded and lay next to Nelson.[75]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe battle took place the day after the Battle of Ulm, and Napoleon did not hear about it for weeksthe Grande Arme had left Boulogne to fight Britain's allies before they could combine a huge force. He had tight control over the Paris media and kept the defeat a closely guarded secret for over a month, at which point newspapers proclaimed it to have been a tremendous victory.[76] In a counter-propaganda move, a fabricated text declaring the battle a \\"spectacular victory\\" for the French and Spanish was published in Herald and attributed to Le Moniteur Universel.[77][78]\\r\\n\\r\\nVice-Admiral Villeneuve was taken prisoner aboard his flagship and taken back to Britain. After his parole in 1806, he returned to France, where he was found dead in his inn room during a stop on the way to Paris, with six stab wounds in the chest from a dining knife. It was officially recorded that he had committed suicide.\\r\\n\\r\\nDespite the British victory over the Franco-Spanish navies, Trafalgar had negligible impact on the remainder of the War of the Third Coalition. Less than two months later, Napoleon decisively defeated the Third Coalition at the Battle of Austerlitz, knocking Austria out of the war and forcing the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire. Although Trafalgar meant France could no longer challenge Britain at sea, Napoleon proceeded to establish the Continental System in an attempt to deny Britain trade with the continent. The Napoleonic Wars continued for another ten years after Trafalgar.[79]\\r\\n\\r\\nNelson's body was preserved in a barrel of brandy for the trip home to a hero's funeral.[50]\\r\\n\\r\\nFollowing the battle, the Royal Navy was never again seriously challenged by the French fleet in a large-scale engagement. Napoleon had already abandoned his plans of invasion before the battle and they were never revived. The battle did not mean, however, that the French naval challenge to Britain was over. First, as the French control over the continent expanded, Britain had to take active steps with the Battle of Copenhagen in 1807 and elsewhere in 1808 to prevent the ships of smaller European navies from falling into French hands. This effort was largely successful, but did not end the French threat as Napoleon instituted a large-scale shipbuilding programme that produced a fleet of 80 ships of the line at the time of his fall from power in 1814, with more under construction. In comparison, Britain had 99 ships of the line in active commission in 1814, and this was close to the maximum that could be supported. Given a few more years, the French could have realised their plans to commission 150 ships of the line and again challenge the Royal Navy, compensating for the inferiority of their crews with sheer numbers.[80] For almost 10?years after Trafalgar, the Royal Navy maintained a close blockade of French bases and anxiously observed the growth of the French fleet. In the end, Napoleon's Empire was destroyed before the ambitious buildup could be completed.\\r\\n\\r\\nNelson became ÿ and remains ÿ Britain's greatest naval war hero, and an inspiration to the Royal Navy, yet his unorthodox tactics were seldom emulated by later generations. The first monument to be erected in Britain to commemorate Nelson may be that raised on Glasgow Green in 1806, albeit possibly preceded by a monument at Taynuilt, near Oban in Scotland dated 1805, both also commemorating the many Scots crew and captains at the battle.[81][82] The 144-foot-tall (44?m) Nelson Monument on Glasgow Green was designed by David Hamilton and paid for by public subscription. Around the base are the names of his major victories: Aboukir (1798), Copenhagen (1801) and Trafalgar (1805). In 1808, Nelson's Pillar was erected by leading members of the Anglo-Irish aristocracy in Dublin to commemorate Nelson and his achievements (between 10% and 20% of the sailors at Trafalgar had been from Ireland[83][84]), and remained until it was destroyed in a bombing by \\"Old IRA\\" members in 1966.[81] Nelson's Monument in Edinburgh was built between 1807 and 1815 in the form of an upturned telescope, and in 1853 a time ball was added which still drops at noon GMT to give a time signal to ships in Leith and the Firth of Forth. In summer this coincides with the one o'clock gun being fired. The Britannia Monument in Great Yarmouth was raised by 1819. Nelson's Column, Montreal began public subscriptions soon after news of the victory at Trafalgar arrived; the column was completed in the autumn of 1809 and still stands in Place Jacques Cartier.\\r\\n\\r\\nLondon's famous Trafalgar Square was named in honour of Nelson's victory, and his statue on Nelson's Column, finished in 1843, towers triumphantly over it. The statue of Lord Nelson in Bridgetown, Barbados, in what was also once known as Trafalgar Square, was erected in 1813.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe disparity in losses has been attributed by some historians less to Nelson's daring tactics than to the difference in fighting readiness of the two fleets.[85] Nelson's fleet was made up of ships of the line which had spent a considerable amount of sea time during the months of blockades of French ports, whilst the French fleet had generally been at anchor in port. However, Villeneuve's fleet had just spent months at sea crossing the Atlantic twice, which supports the proposition that the main difference between the two fleets' combat effectiveness was the morale of the leaders. The daring tactics employed by Nelson were to ensure a strategically decisive result. The results vindicated his naval judgement.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Royal Navy proceeded to dominate the sea until the Second World War.[86]\\r\\nAlthough the victory at Trafalgar was typically given as the reason at the time, modern historical analyses suggest that relative economic strength was an important underlying cause of British naval mastery.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1905, there were events up and down the country to commemorate the centenary, although none were attended by any member of the Royal Family, apparently to avoid upsetting the French, with whom the United Kingdom had recently entered the Entente cordiale.[87] King Edward VII did support the Nelson Centenary Memorial Fund of the British and Foreign Sailors Society, which sold Trafalgar centenary souvenirs marked with the Royal cypher. A gala was held on 21 October at the Royal Albert Hall in aid of the fund, which included a specially commissioned film by Alfred John West entitled \\"Our Navy\\".[88] The event ended with God Save the King and La Marseillaise[89] The first performance of Sir Henry Wood's Fantasia on British Sea Songs occurred on the same day at a special Promenade Concert.[90]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2005 a series of events around the UK, part of the Sea Britain theme, marked the bicentenary of the Battle of Trafalgar. The 200th anniversary of the battle was also commemorated on six occasions in Portsmouth during June and July, at St Paul's Cathedral (where Nelson is entombed), in Trafalgar Square in London in October (T Square 200), and across the UK.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 28 June, the Queen was involved in the largest Fleet Review in modern times in the Solent, in which 167 ships from 35 nations took part. The Queen inspected the international fleet from the Antarctic patrol ship HMS Endurance. The fleet included six aircraft carriers ÿ (modern capital ships): Charles De Gaulle, Illustrious, Invincible, Ocean, Prncipe de Asturias and Saipan. In the evening a symbolic re-enactment of the battle was staged with fireworks and various small ships playing parts in the battle.\\r\\n\\r\\nLieutenant John Lapenotire's historic voyage in HMS Pickle bringing the news of the victory from the fleet to Falmouth and thence by post chaise to the Admiralty in London was commemorated by the inauguration of The Trafalgar Way and further highlighted by the New Trafalgar Dispatch celebrations from July to September in which an actor played the part of Lapenotire and re-enacted parts of the historic journey.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the actual anniversary day, 21 October, naval manoeuvres were conducted in Trafalgar Bay near Cdiz involving a combined fleet from Britain, Spain, and France. Many descendants of people present at the battle, including members of Nelson's family, were at the ceremony.[91]\\r\\n\\r\\nAttribution:","input":"Who was involved in the battle of trafalgar?"},{"output":"Delivery date","context":"\\r\\nOffer and acceptance analysis is a traditional approach in contract law. The offer and acceptance formula, developed in the 19th century, identifies a moment of formation when the parties are of one mind. This classical approach to contract formation has been weakened by developments in the law of estoppel, misleading conduct, misrepresentation and unjust enrichment.\\r\\nTreitel defines an offer as \\"an expression of willingness to contract on certain terms, made with the intention that it shall become binding as soon as it is accepted by the person to whom it is addressed\\", the \\"offeree\\".[1] An offer is a statement of the terms on which the offeror is willing to be bound. It is the present contractual intent to be bound by a contract with definite and certain terms communicated to the offeree.\\r\\nThe expression of an offer may take different forms, such as a letter, newspaper advertisement, fax, email and even conduct, as long as it communicates the basis on which the offeror is prepared to contract.\\r\\nWhether the two parties have reached agreement on the terms or whether a valid offer has been made is an issue which is determined by the courts using criteria known as 'the objective test' which was explained in the leading English case of Smith v. Hughes.[2][3] In Smith v. Hughes, the court emphasised that the important thing in determining whether there has been a valid offer is not the party's own (subjective) intentions, but how a reasonable person would view the situation.\\r\\nUnless the offer included the key terms of the contract, it cannot be the basis of a binding contract. For example, as a minimum requirement for sale of goods contracts, a valid offer must include at least the following 4 terms: Delivery date, price, terms of payment that includes the date of payment and detail description of the item on offer including a fair description of the condition or type of service. Unless the minimum requirements are met, an offer of sale is not classified by the courts as a legal offer but is instead seen as an advertisement.\\r\\nA unilateral contract is created when someone offers to do something \\"in return for\\" the performance of the act stipulated in the offer.[4] In this regard, acceptance does not have to be communicated and can be accepted through conduct by performing the act.[5] Nonetheless, the person performing the act must do it in reliance on the offer.[6]\\r\\nA unilateral contract can be contrasted with a bilateral contract, where there is an exchange of promises between two parties. For example, when (A) promises to sell her car and (B) promises to buy the car.\\r\\nThe formation of a unilateral contract can be demonstrated in Carlill v Carbolic Smoke Ball Co.[5] In order to guarantee the effectiveness of the Smoke Ball remedy, the company offered a reward of 100 pounds to anyone who used the remedy and contracted the flu. Once aware of the offer, Carlill accepted the offer when he purchased the Smoke Ball remedy and completed the prescribed course. Upon contracting the flu, he became eligible for the reward. Therefore, the company's offer to pay 100 pounds \\"in return for\\" the use of the Smoke Ball remedy and guarantee not to contract the flu was performed by Carlill.\\r\\nAn invitation to treat is not an offer, but an indication of a person's willingness to negotiate a contract. It's a pre-offer communication. In Harvey v. Facey,[7] an indication by the owner of property that he or she might be interested in selling at a certain price, for example, has been regarded as an invitation to treat. Similarly in Gibson v Manchester City Council[8] the words \\"may be prepared to sell\\" were held to be a notification of price and therefore not a distinct offer, though in another case concerning the same change of policy (Manchester City Council underwent a change of political control and stopped the sale of council houses to their tenants) Storer v. Manchester City Council,[9] the court held that an agreement was completed by the tenant's signing and returning the agreement to purchase, as the language of the agreement had been sufficiently explicit and the signature on behalf of the council a mere formality to be completed. Statements of invitation are only intended to solicit offers from people and are not intended to result in any immediate binding obligation. The courts have tended to take a consistent approach to the identification of invitations to treat, as compared with offer and acceptance, in common transactions. The display of goods for sale, whether in a shop window or on the shelves of a self-service store, is ordinarily treated as an invitation to treat and not an offer.[10][11]\\r\\nThe holding of a public auction will also usually be regarded as an invitation to treat. Auctions are, however, a special case generally. The rule is that the bidder is making an offer to buy and the auctioneer accepts this in whatever manner is customary, usually the fall of the hammer.[12][13] A bidder may withdraw his or her bid at any time before the fall of the hammer, but any bid in any event lapses as an offer on the making of a higher bid, so that if a higher bid is made, then withdrawn before the fall of the hammer, the auctioneer cannot then purport to accept the previous highest bid. If an auction is without reserve then, whilst there is no contract of sale between the owner of the goods and the highest bidder (because the placing of goods in the auction is an invitation to treat), there is a collateral contract between the auctioneer and the highest bidder that the auction will be held without reserve (i.e., that the highest bid, however low, will be accepted).[14] The U.S. Uniform Commercial Code provides that in an auction without reserve the goods may not be withdrawn once they have been put up.[15]\\r\\nAn offeror may revoke an offer before it has been accepted, but the revocation must be communicated to the offeree (although not necessarily by the offeror,[16]). If the offer was made to the entire world, such as in Carlill's case,[5] the revocation must take a form that is similar to the offer. However, an offer may not be revoked if it has been encapsulated in an option (see also option contract), or if it is a \\"firm offer\\" in which case it is irrevocable for the period specified by the offeror.\\r\\nIf the offer is one that leads to a unilateral contract, the offer generally cannot be revoked once the offeree has begun performance.\\r\\nA promise or act on the part of an offeree indicating a willingness to be bound by the terms and conditions contained in an offer. Also, the acknowledgment of the drawee that binds the drawee to the terms of a draft.\\r\\nFor the acceptance, the essential requirement is that the parties had each from a subjective perspective engaged in conduct manifesting their assent. Under this meeting of the minds theory of contract, a party could resist a claim of breach by proving that he had not intended to be bound by the agreement, only if it appeared subjectively that he had so intended. This is unsatisfactory, as one party has no way to know another's undisclosed intentions. One party can only act upon what the other party reveals objectively (Lucy V Zehmer, 196 Va 493 84 S.E. 2d 516) to be his intent. Hence, an actual meeting of the minds is not required. Indeed, it has been argued that the \\"meeting of the minds\\" idea is entirely a modern error: 19th century judges spoke of \\"consensus ad idem\\" which modern teachers have wrongly translated as \\"meeting of minds\\" but actually means \\"agreement to the [same] thing\\".[17]\\r\\nThe requirement of an objective perspective is important in cases where a party claims that an offer was not accepted and seeks to take advantage of the performance of the other party. Here, we can apply the test of whether a reasonable bystander (a \\"fly on the wall\\") would have perceived that the party has impliedly accepted the offer by conduct.\\r\\nThere are several rules dealing with the communication of acceptance:\\r\\nThe \\"mirror image rule\\" states that if you are to accept an offer, you must accept an offer exactly, without modifications; if you change the offer in any way, this is a counter-offer that kills the original offer and the original offer cannot be accepted at a future time.[26]\\r\\nHowever, a mere request for information about the terms of the offer is not a counter-offer and leaves the offer intact.[27] It may be possible to draft an enquiry such that it adds to the terms of the contract while keeping the original offer alive.\\r\\nUnder the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) Sec. 2-207(1), a definite expression of acceptance or a written confirmation of an informal agreement may constitute a valid acceptance even if it states terms additional to or different from the offer or informal agreement. The additional or different terms are treated as proposals for addition into the contract under UCC Sec. 2-207(2). Between merchants, such terms become part of the contract unless:\\r\\nMaterial is defined as anything that may cause undue hardship/surprise, or is a significant element of the contract.\\r\\nIf there is no contract under 2-207(1), then under UCC Sec. 2-207(3), conduct by the parties that recognize there is a contract may be sufficient to establish a contract. The terms for this contract include only those that the parties agree on and the rest via gap fillers.\\r\\nOften when two companies deal with each other in the course of business, they will use standard form contracts. Often these standard forms contain terms which conflict (e.g. both parties include a liability waiver in their form). The 'battle of the forms' refers to the resulting legal dispute arising where both parties accept that a legally binding contract exists, but disagree about whose standard terms apply. Such disputes may be resolved by reference to the 'last document rule', i.e. whichever business sent the last document, or 'fired the last shot' (often the seller's delivery note) is held to have issued the final offer and the buyer's organisation is held to have accepted the offer by signing the delivery note or simply accepting and using the delivered goods.\\r\\nIn U.S. law, this principle is referred to as the last shot rule.\\r\\nUnder English law, the question was raised in Butler Machine Tool Co Ltd v Ex-Cell-O Corporation (England) Ltd,[28] as to which of the standard form contracts prevailed in the transaction. Lord Denning MR preferred the view that the documents were to be considered as a whole, and the important factor was finding the decisive document; on the other hand, Lawton and Bridge LJJ preferred traditional offer-acceptance analysis, and considered that the last counter-offer prior to the beginning of performance voided all preceding offers. The absence of any additional counter-offer or refusal by the other party is understood as an implied acceptance.\\r\\nIn Leicester Circuits Ltd. v. Coates Brothers plc (2002) and GHSP Incorporated v AB Electronic Ltd (2010) the English High Court has found that companies may have not agreed on any terms, and so the 'last document rule' may not apply. In the GHSP case, there was no situation where one company could have been said to have accepted the other's standard terms, as they remained in unresolved dispute. The court held that neither party's terms applied and therefore the contract was governed by the implied terms of the UK Sale of Goods Act 1979.\\r\\nAs a rule of convenience, if the offer is accepted by post, the contract comes into existence at the moment that the acceptance was posted.[29] This rule only applies when, impliedly or explicitly, the parties have post in contemplation as a means of acceptance.[30] It excludes contracts involving land, letters incorrectly addressed and instantaneous modes of communication. The relevance of this early 19th century rule to modern conditions, when many quicker means of communication are available has been questioned, but the rule remains good law for the time being.\\r\\nIn Australian law, there is a requirement that an acceptance is made in reliance or pursuance of an offer.[6]\\r\\nAn offer can be terminated on the grounds of rejection by the offeree, that is if the offeree does not accept the terms of the offer or makes a counter-offer as referred to above.\\r\\nAlso, upon making an offer, an offeror may include the period in which the offer will be available. If the offeree fails to accept the offer within this specific period, then the offer will be deemed as terminated.\\r\\nGenerally death (or incapacity) of the offeror terminates the offer. This does not apply to option contracts.\\r\\nThe offer cannot be accepted if the offeree knows of the death of the offeror.[31] In cases where the offeree accepts in ignorance of the death, the contract may still be valid, although this proposition depends on the nature of the offer. If the contract involves some characteristic personal to the offeror, the offer is destroyed by the death.\\r\\nAn offer is rendered invalid upon the death of the offeree.[32]\\r\\nA contract will be formed (assuming the other requirements for a legally binding contract are met) when the parties give objective manifestation of an intent to form the contract.\\r\\nBecause offer and acceptance are necessarily intertwined, in California, offer and acceptance are analyzed together as subelements of a single element, known either as consent of the parties or mutual assent.[33]\\r\\nThe attempt by the courts to analyse all contracts in terms of offer and acceptance has been the subject of some criticism.[34] In New Zealand Shipping Co Ltd v. A M Satterthwaite & Co Ltd (The Eurymedon) [1975] AC 154 Lord Wilberforce have said\\r\\n\\"It is only the precise analysis of this complex of relations into the classical offer and acceptance, with identifiable consideration, that seems to present difficulty, but this same difficulty exists in many situations of daily life, e.g. sales at action; supermarket purchases; boarding an omnibus; purchasing a train ticket; tenders for the supply of goods; offers of reward; acceptance by post; warranties of authority by agents; manufacturers; guarantees; gratuitous bailments; bankers' commercial credits. These are all examples which show that English law, having committed itself to a rather technical and schematic doctrine of contract, in application takes a practical approach, often at the cost of forcing the facts to fit uneasily into the marked slots of offer, acceptance and consideration.\\"\\r\\nSubsequently, Lord Denning has expressed his view in Gibson v. Manchester City Council [1978] 1 WLR 520, 523. Lord Denning stated that\\r\\n\\"To my mind it is a mistake to think that all contracts can be analysed into the form of offer and acceptance. I know in some textbooks it has been the custom to do so; but, as I understand the law, there is no need to look for a strict offer and acceptance. You should look at the correspondence as a whole and at the conduct of the parties and see therefrom whether the parties have come to an agreement on everything that was material. If by their correspondence and their conduct you can see an agreement on all material terms, which was intended thenceforward to be binding, then there is a binding contract in law even though all the formalities have not been gone through.\\"\\r\\nWhen the case was appealed to the House of Lords, Lord Diplock said in [1974] 1 WLR 294, 297\\r\\n\\"My Lords, there may be certain types of contract, though I think they are exceptional, which do not fit easily into the normal analysis of a contract as being constituted by offer and acceptance; but a contract alleged to have been made by an exchange of correspondence between the parties in which the successive communications other than the first are in reply to one another is not one of these. I can see no reason in the instant case for departing from the conventional approach of looking at the handful of documents relied on as constituting the contract sued on and seeing whether on their true construction there is to be found in them a contractual offer by the council to sell the house to Mr Gibson and an acceptance of that offer by Mr Gibson. I venture to think that it was by departing from this conventional approach that the majority of the Court of Appeal was led into error.\\"\\r\\nThese discussions all point to the fact that not all formation of contracts can be neatly analysed by using offer and acceptance.\\r\\nUnder the Principles of European Contract Law, Article 2:101 provides that:\\r\\n\\"A contract is concluded if:\\r\\na) the parties intend to be legally bound, and\\r\\nb) they reach a sufficient agreement\\r\\nwithout any further requirement\\"\\r\\nIn addition Article 2:211 provided that\\r\\n\\"The rules in this Section apply with appropriate adaptations even though the process of conclusion of a contract cannot be analysed into offer and acceptance.\\"\\r\\nThe case below considers the exception of offer and acceptance in English law.\\r\\nContracts can also be formed without offer and acceptance. The Satanita is one of the cases that cannot be analysed by offer and acceptance.\\r\\nThe case is about a yacht competition. There are certain rules in the competition. One of the rule is that the rule breakers are liable for all consequential loss. Lord Dunraven entered into the competition with the defendant owner of The Satanita. The Satanita crashed Lord Dunraven's yacht and sunk it.\\r\\nThe Court of Appeal held that there was a contract for the owner of The Satanita to pay Lord Dunraven's loss. None of the lords said how the contract was formed in terms of offer and acceptance.","input":"How long does an offer last contract law?"},{"output":"sixth","context":"Ray Donovan is an American television crime drama series created by Ann Biderman for Showtime.

The carriage is especially designed for private passenger use, though some are also used to transport goods. A public passenger vehicle would not usually be called a carriage ÿ terms for such include stagecoach, charabanc and omnibus. It may be light, smart and fast or heavy, large and comfortable or luxurious. Carriages normally have suspension using leaf springs, elliptical springs (in the 19th century) or leather strapping. Working vehicles such as the (four-wheeled) wagon and (two-wheeled) cart share important parts of the history of the carriage, as does too the fast (two-wheeled) chariot.[1][2]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe word carriage (abbreviated carr or cge) is from Old Northern French cariage, to carry in a vehicle.[3] The word car, then meaning a kind of two-wheeled cart for goods, also came from Old Northern French about the beginning of the 14th century;[3] it was also used for railway carriages, and was extended to cover automobile around the end of the nineteenth century, when early models were called horseless carriages.\\r\\nA carriage is sometimes called a team, as in \\"horse and team\\". A carriage with its horse is a rig. An elegant horse-drawn carriage with its retinue of servants is an equipage. A carriage together with the horses, harness and attendants is a turnout or setout. A procession of carriages is a cavalcade.\\r\\nSome horsecarts found in Celtic graves show hints that their platforms were suspended elastically.[4] Four-wheeled wagons were used in prehistoric Europe, and their form known from excavations suggests that the basic construction techniques of wheel and undercarriage (that survived until the age of the motor car) were established then.[5]\\r\\nThe earliest recorded sort of carriage was the chariot, reaching Mesopotamia as early as 1900 BC.[6] Used typically for warfare by Egyptians, the near Easterners and Europeans, it was essentially a two-wheeled light basin carrying one or two passengers, drawn by one to two horses. The chariot was revolutionary and effective because it delivered fresh warriors to crucial areas of battle with swiftness.\\r\\nFirst century BC Romans used sprung wagons for overland journeys.[7] It is likely that Roman carriages employed some form of suspension on chains or leather straps, as indicated by carriage parts found in excavations.\\r\\nIn the kingdom of the Zhou Dynasty the Warring States were also known to have used carriages as transportation. With the decline of these civilizations these techniques almost disappeared.\\r\\nThe medieval carriage was typically a four-wheeled wagon type, with a rounded top ('tilt') similar in appearance to the Conestoga Wagon familiar from the USA. Sharing the traditional form of wheels and undercarriage known since the Bronze Age, it very likely also employed the pivoting fore-axle in continuity from the ancient world. Suspension (on chains) is recorded in visual images and written accounts from the 14th century ('chars branlant' or rocking carriages), and was in widespread use by the 15th century.[8] Carriages were largely used by royalty, aristocrats (and especially by women), and could be elaborately decorated and gilded. These carriages were on four wheels often and were pulled by two to four horses depending on how they were decorated (elaborate decoration with gold lining made the carriage heavier). Wood and iron were the primary requirements needed to build a carriage and carriages that were used by non-royalty were covered by plain leather.\\r\\nAnother form of carriage was the pageant wagon of the 14th century. Historians debate on the structure and size of pageant wagons; however, they are generally miniature house-like structures that rest on four to six wheels depending on the size of the wagon. The pageant wagon is significant because up until the 14th century most carriages were on two or 3 wheels; the chariot, rocking carriage, and baby carriage are two examples of carriages which pre-date the pageant wagon. Historians also debate whether or not pageant wagons were built with pivotal axle systems, which allowed the wheels to turn. Whether it was a four- or six-wheel pageant wagon, most historians maintain that pivotal axle systems were implemented on pageant wagons because many roads were often winding with some sharp turns. Six wheel pageant wagons also represent another innovation in carriages; they were one of the first carriages to use multiple pivotal axles. Pivotal axles were used on the front set of wheels and the middle set of wheels. This allowed the horse to move freely and steer the carriage in accordance with the road or path.\\r\\nOne of the great innovations of the carriage was the invention of the suspended carriage or the chariot branlant (though whether this was a Roman or medieval innovation remains uncertain). The 'chariot branlant' of medieval illustrations was suspended by chains rather than leather straps as had been believed.[9][10] Chains provided a smoother ride in the chariot branlant because the compartment no longer rested on the turning axles. In the 15th century, carriages were made lighter and needed only one horse to haul the carriage. This carriage was designed and innovated in Hungary.[11] Both innovations appeared around the same time and historians believe that people began comparing the chariot branlant and the Hungarian light coach. However, the earliest illustrations of the Hungarian 'Kochi-wagon' do not indicate any suspension, and often the use of three horses in harness.\\r\\nUnder King Mathias Corvinus (1458ÿ90), who enjoyed fast travel, the Hungarians developed fast road transport, and the town of Kocs between Budapest and Vienna became an important post-town, and gave its name to the new vehicle type.[12] The Hungarian coach was highly praised because it was capable of holding 8 men, used light wheels, could be towed by only one horse (it may have been suspended by leather straps, but this is a topic of debate).[13] Ultimately it was the Hungarian coach that generated a greater buzz of conversation than the chariot branlant of France because it was a much smoother ride.[13] Henceforth, the Hungarian coach spread across Europe rather quickly, in part due to Ippolito d'Este of Ferrara (1479ÿ1529), nephew of Mathias' queen Beatrix of Aragon, who as a very junior Archbishopric of Esztergom developed a liking of Hungarian riding and took his carriage and driver back to Italy.[14] Around 1550 the 'coach' made its appearance throughout the major cities of Europe, and the new word entered the vocabulary of all their languages.[15] However, the new 'coach' seems to have been a concept (fast road travel for men) as much as any particular type of vehicle, and there is no obvious change that accompanied the innovation. As it moved throughout Europe in the late 16th century, the coachs body structure was ultimately changed, from a round-top to the 'four-poster' carriages that became standard by c.1600.[8]\\r\\nThe coach had doors in the side, with an iron step protected by leather that became the \\"boot\\" in which servants might ride. The driver sat on a seat at the front, and the most important occupant sat in the back facing forwards. The earliest coaches can be seen at Veste Coburg, Lisbon, and the Moscow Kremlin, and they become a commonplace in European art. It was not until the 17th century that further innovations with steel springs and glazing took place, and only in the 18th century, with better road surfaces, was there a major innovation with the introduction of the steel C-spring.[16]\\r\\nIt was not until the 18th century that steering systems were truly improved. Erasmus Darwin was a young English doctor who was driving a carriage about 10,000 miles a year to visit patients all over England. Darwin found two essential problems or shortcomings of the commonly used light carriage or Hungarian carriage. First, the front wheels were turned by a pivoting front axle, which had been used for years, but these wheels were often quite small and hence the rider, carriage and horse felt the brunt of every bump on the road. Secondly, he recognized the danger of overturning.\\r\\nA pivoting front axle changes a carriages base from a rectangle to a triangle because the wheel on the inside of the turn is able to turn more sharply than the outside front wheel. Darwin proposed to fix these insufficiencies by proposing a principle in which the two front wheels turn about a centre that lies on the extended line of the back axle. This idea was later patented as Ackerman Steering. Darwin argued that carriages would then be easier to pull and less likely to overturn.\\r\\nCarriage use in North America came with the establishment of European settlers. Early colonial horse tracks quickly grew into roads especially as the colonists extended their territories southwest. Colonists began using carts as these roads and trading increased between the north and south. Eventually, carriages or coaches were sought to transport goods as well as people. As in Europe, chariots, coaches and/or carriages were a mark of status. The tobacco planters of the South were some of the first Americans to use the carriage as a form of human transportation. As the tobacco farming industry grew in the southern colonies so did the frequency of carriages, coaches and wagons. Upon the turn of the 18th century wheeled vehicle use in the colonies was at an all-time high. Carriages, coaches and wagons were being taxed based on the number of wheels they had. These taxes were implemented in the South primarily as the South had superior numbers of horses and wheeled vehicles when compared to the North. Europe, however, still used carriage transportation far more often and on a much larger scale than anywhere else in the world.\\r\\nCarriages and coaches began to disappear as use of steam propulsion began to generate more and more interest and research. Steam power quickly won the battle against animal power as is evident by a newspaper article written in England in 1895 entitled \\"Horseflesh vs. Steam\\".[17] The article highlights the death of the carriage as the means of transportation.\\r\\nNowadays, carriages are still used for day-to-day transport in the United States by some minority groups such as the Amish. They are also still used in the tourism as vehicles for sightseeing in cities such as Bruges, Vienna, New Orleans, and Little Rock, Arkansas.\\r\\nThe most complete working collection of carriages can be seen at the Royal Mews in London where a large selection of vehicles is in regular use. These are supported by a staff of liveried coachmen, footmen and postillions. The horses earn their keep by supporting the work of the Royal Household, particularly during ceremonial events. Horses pulling a large carriage known as a \\"covered brake\\" collect the Yeoman of the Guard in their distinctive red uniforms from St James's Palace for Investitures at Buckingham Palace; High Commissioners or Ambassadors are driven to their audiences with The Queen in landaus; visiting heads of state are transported to and from official arrival ceremonies and members of the Royal Family are driven in Royal Mews coaches during Trooping the Colour, the Order of the Garter service at Windsor Castle and carriage processions at the beginning of each day of Royal Ascot.\\r\\nCarriages may be enclosed or open, depending on the type.[18] The top cover for the body of a carriage, called the head or hood, is often flexible and designed to be folded back when desired. Such a folding top is called a bellows top or calash. A hoopstick forms a light framing member for this kind of hood. The top, roof or second-story compartment of a closed carriage, especially a diligence, was called an imperial. A closed carriage may have side windows called quarter lights (British) as well as windows in the doors, hence a \\"glass coach\\". On the forepart of an open carriage, a screen of wood or leather called a dashboard intercepts water, mud or snow thrown up by the heels of the horses. The dashboard or carriage top sometimes has a projecting sidepiece called a wing (British). A foot iron or footplate may serve as a carriage step.\\r\\nA carriage driver sits on a box or perch, usually elevated and small. When at the front it is known as a dickey box, a term also used for a seat at the back for servants. A footman might use a small platform at the rear called a footboard or a seat called a rumble behind the body. Some carriages have a moveable seat called a jump seat. Some seats had an attached backrest called a lazyback.\\r\\nThe shafts of a carriage were called limbers in English dialect. Lancewood, a tough elastic wood of various trees, was often used especially for carriage shafts. A holdback, consisting of an iron catch on the shaft with a looped strap, enables a horse to back or hold back the vehicle. The end of the tongue of a carriage is suspended from the collars of the harness by a bar called the yoke. At the end of a trace, a loop called a cockeye attaches to the carriage.\\r\\nIn some carriage types the body is suspended from several leather straps called braces or thoroughbraces, attached to or serving as springs.\\r\\nBeneath the carriage body is the undergear or undercarriage (or simply carriage), consisting of the running gear and chassis.[19] The wheels and axles, in distinction from the body, are the running gear. The wheels revolve upon bearings or a spindle at the ends of a bar or beam called an axle or axletree. Most carriages have either one or two axles. On a four-wheeled vehicle, the forward part of the running gear, or forecarriage, is arranged to permit the front axle to turn independently of the fixed rear axle. In some carriages a 'dropped axle', bent twice at a right angle near the ends, allows a low body with large wheels. A guard called a dirtboard keeps dirt from the axle arm.\\r\\nSeveral structural members form parts of the chassis supporting the carriage body. The fore axletree and the splinter bar above it (supporting the springs) are united by a piece of wood or metal called a futchel, which forms a socket for the pole that extends from the front axle. For strength and support, a rod called the backstay may extend from either end of the rear axle to the reach, the pole or rod joining the hind axle to the forward bolster above the front axle.\\r\\nA skid called a drag, dragshoe, shoe or skidpan retards the motion of the wheels. A London patent of 1841 describes one such apparatus: An iron-shod beam, slightly longer than the radius of the wheel, is hinged under the axle so that when it is released to strike the ground the forward momentum of the vehicle wedges it against the axle. The original feature of this modification was that, instead of the usual practice of having to stop the carriage to retract the beam and so lose useful momentum, the chain holding it in place is released (from the driver's position) so that it is allowed to rotate further in its backwards direction, releasing the axle. A system of \\"pendant-levers\\" and straps then allows the beam to return to its first position and be ready for further use.[20]\\r\\nA catch or block called a trigger may be used to hold a wheel on a declivity.\\r\\nA horizontal wheel or segment of a wheel called a fifth wheel sometimes forms an extended support to prevent the carriage from tipping; it consists of two parts rotating on each other about the kingbolt above the fore axle and beneath the body. A block of wood called a headblock might be placed between the fifth wheel and the forward spring.\\r\\nA trap, pony trap or horse trap is a light, often sporty, two-wheeled or sometimes four-wheeled horse-drawn carriage, accommodating usually two to four persons in various seating arrangements, such as face-to-face or back-to-back.\\r\\nA tanga (Hindi: ?????, Urdu: ?????, Bengali: ??????) or Tonga is a light horse-drawn carriage used for transportation in India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh. Tangas are a popular mode of transportation because they are fun to ride in, and are usually cheaper to hire than a taxi or rickshaw. However, in many cities, tangas are not allowed to use highways because of their slow pace. In Pakistan, tangas are mainly found in the older parts of cities and towns, and are becoming less popular for utilitarian travel and more popular for pleasure. Tangas have become a traditional feature of weddings and other social functions in Pakistan, as well as in other nations. They are usually pulled by two horses, though some require only one. Others are designed for farm work. The room under the seats is sometimes used by the coachman (locally called \\"coach-waan\\") to keep his horse's food and sometimes to keep luggage if required.\\r\\nTangas are used for economic activity, mainly to carry heavy goods within the city limits.[21]\\r\\nTangas were the most common means of transport in urban India and Pakistan until the early 1980s. Although autorickshaws have overtaken them in popularity, tangas are still common today in many cities and villages.\\r\\nA volante is a two-wheeled, one- or two-passenger Spanish carriage formerly much used in Cuba. The axle was behind an open, hooded body. The carriage was driven by a rider on the horse.\\r\\nAn araba (from Arabic: ????, araba or Turkish: araba[22]) (also arba or aroba) is a carriage (such as a cabriolet or coach), wagon or cart drawn by horses or oxen, used in Turkey and neighboring Middle Eastern countries. It is usually heavy and without springs, and often covered.\\r\\nThe names of many of these have now passed into obscurity but some have been adopted to describe automotive car body styles: coup, victoria, brougham, landau and landaulet, cabriolet (giving us our cab), phaeton, and limousine ÿ all these once denoted particular types of carriages.\\r\\nA person whose business was to drive a carriage was a coachman. A servant in livery called a footman or piquer formerly served in attendance upon a rider or was required to run before his master's carriage to clear the way. An attendant on horseback called an outrider often rode ahead of or next to a carriage. A carriage starter directed the flow of vehicles taking on passengers at the curbside. A hackneyman hired out horses and carriages. When hawking wares, a hawker was often assisted by a carriage.\\r\\nUpper-class people of wealth and social position, those wealthy enough to keep carriages, were referred to as carriage folk or carriage trade.\\r\\nCarriage passengers often used a lap robe as a blanket or similar covering for their legs, lap and feet. A buffalo robe, made from the hide of an American bison dressed with the hair on, was sometimes used as a carriage robe; it was commonly trimmed to rectangular shape and lined on the skin side with fabric. A carriage boot, fur-trimmed for winter wear, was made usually of fabric with a fur or felt lining. A knee boot protected the knees from rain or splatter.\\r\\nA horse especially bred for carriage use by appearance and stylish action is called a carriage horse; one for use on a road is a road horse. One such breed is the Cleveland Bay, uniformly bay in color, of good conformation and strong constitution. Horses were broken in using a bodiless carriage frame called a break or brake.\\r\\nA carriage dog or coach dog is bred for running beside a carriage.\\r\\nA roofed structure that extends from the entrance of a building over an adjacent driveway and that shelters callers as they get in or out of their vehicles is known as a carriage porch or porte cochere. An outbuilding for a carriage is a coach house, which was often combined with accommodation for a groom or other servants.\\r\\nA livery stable kept horses and usually carriages for hire. A range of stables, usually with carriage houses (remises) and living quarters built around a yard, court or street, is called a mews.\\r\\nA kind of dynamometer called a peirameter indicates the power necessary to haul a carriage over a road or track.\\r\\nIn most European and English-speaking countries, driving is a competitive equestrian sport. Many horse shows host driving competitions for a particular style of driving, breed of horse, or type of vehicle. Show vehicles are usually carriages, carts, or buggies and, occasionally, sulkies or wagons. Modern high-technology carriages are made purely for competition by companies such as Bennington Carriages.[23] in England. Terminology varies: the simple, lightweight two- or four-wheeled show vehicle common in many nations is called a \\"cart\\" in the USA, but a \\"carriage\\" in Australia.\\r\\nInternationally, there is intense competition in the all-round test of driving: combined driving, also known as horse-driving trials, an equestrian discipline regulated by the Fdration questre Internationale (International Equestrian Federation) with national organizations representing each member country. World championships are conducted in alternate years, including single-horse, horse pairs and four-in-hand championships. The World Equestrian Games, held at four-year intervals, also includes a four-in-hand competition.\\r\\nFor pony drivers, the World Combined Pony Championships are held every two years and include singles, pairs and four-in-hand events.\\r\\nAn almost bewildering variety of horse-drawn carriages existed. Arthur Ingram's Horse Drawn Vehicles since 1760 in Colour lists 325 types with a short description of each. By the early 19th century one's choice of carriage was only in part based on practicality and performance; it was also a status statement and subject to changing fashions. The types of carriage included the following:","input":"When was the first horse drawn carriage invented?"},{"output":"the early modern period","context":"Coptic, or Coptic Egyptian (Bohairic: ????????????? ti.met.rem.?n.khmi and Sahidic: ?????????????? t.m?nt.r?m.?n.kme), is the latest stage of the Egyptian language, a northern Afro-Asiatic language spoken in Egypt until at least the 17th century.[2] Egyptian began to be written in the Coptic alphabet, an adaptation of the Greek alphabet with the addition of six or seven signs from Demotic to represent Egyptian sounds the Greek language did not have, in the 1st century AD.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nSeveral distinct Coptic dialects are identified, the most prominent of which are Sahidic, originating in parts of Upper Egypt, and Bohairic, originally from the western Nile Delta in Lower Egypt.\\r\\n\\r\\nCoptic and Demotic are grammatically closely related to Late Egyptian, which was written with Egyptian hieroglyphs. Coptic flourished as a literary language from the 2nd to 13th centuries, and its Bohairic dialect continues to be the liturgical language of the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria. It was supplanted by Egyptian Arabic as a spoken language toward the early modern period, but language revitalization efforts have been underway since the 19th century.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe native Coptic name for the language is ????????????? /ti-met-rem-en-k?e?-mi/ in the Bohairic (Delta) dialect, ?????????????? /t-ment-rem-en-ki?-me/ in the Sahidic (Valley) dialect. The particle prefix me(n)t- from the verb ???? mouti ('to speak') forms all abstract nouns in Coptic (not only those pertaining to \\"language\\"). The term remenkhmi/remenkme meaning 'Egyptian', literally 'person of Egypt', is a compound of rem-, which is the construct state of the Coptic noun ????/????, 'man, human being', + the genitive preposition (e)n- 'of' + the word for 'Egypt', ????/???? khmi/kme (cf. Kemet). Thus, the whole expression literally means 'language of the people of Egypt', or simply 'Egyptian language'.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother name by which the language has been called is ????????????? /timentkuptaion/ from the Copto-Greek form ?????????????? /timentaiguption/ ('Egyptian language'). The term logos ?n aiguptios ('Egyptian language') is also attested in Sahidic, but logos and aiguptios are both Greek in origin. In the liturgy of the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria, the name is more officially ????? ??????????? ti aspi ?n rem ?n kmi, 'the Egyptian language', aspi being the Egyptian word for language.\\r\\n\\r\\nCoptic is today spoken liturgically in the Coptic Orthodox and Coptic Catholic Church (along with Modern Standard Arabic). The language is spoken only in Egypt and historically has had little influence outside of the territory, except for monasteries located in Nubia. Coptic's most noticeable linguistic impact has been on the various dialects of Egyptian Arabic, which is characterized by a Coptic substratum in lexical, morphological, syntactical, and phonological features.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn addition to influencing the grammar, vocabulary and syntax of Egyptian Arabic, Coptic has lent to both Arabic and Biblical Hebrew such words as:\\r\\n\\r\\nA few words of Coptic origin are found in the Greek language; some of the words were later lent to various European languages (such as barge, from Coptic ????? bari, \\"small boat\\").\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, most words of Egyptian origin that entered into Greek and subsequently into other European languages came directly from Ancient Egyptian, often Demotic. An example is the Greek ?ϫ? oasis, which comes directly from Egyptian w??t or demotic w?j. However, Coptic reborrowed some words of Ancient Egyptian origin into its lexicon, via Greek. For example, both Sahidic and Bohairic use the word ebenos, which was taken directly from Greek ?ǚ? \\"ebony\\", originally from Egyptian hbnj.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nMany major cities' names in modern Egypt are Arabic adaptations of their former Coptic names: \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Coptic name ????????, papnoute (from Egyptian p?y-p?-n?r), means \\"belonging to God\\" or \\"he of God\\"[4][5][6].  It was adapted into Arabic as Babnouda, which remains a common name among Egyptian Copts to this day. It was also borrowed into Greek as the name ϫ?? (Paphnutius). That, in turn, is the source of the Russian name ҳ (Pafnuty), like the mathematician Pafnuty Chebyshev.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Old Nubian language and the modern Nobiin language borrowed many words of Coptic origin.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Egyptian language may have the longest documented history of any language, from Old Egyptian that appeared just before 3200 BC[7] to its final phases as Coptic in the Middle Ages. Coptic belongs to the Later Egyptian phase, which started to be written in the New Kingdom of Egypt. Later Egyptian represented colloquial speech of the later periods. It had analytic features like definite and indefinite articles and periphrastic verb conjugation. Coptic, therefore, is a reference to both the most recent stage of Egyptian after Demotic and the new writing system that was adapted from the Greek alphabet.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe earliest attempts to write the Egyptian language using the Greek alphabet are Greek transcriptions of Egyptian proper names, most of which date to the Ptolemaic Kingdom. Scholars frequently refer to this phase as pre-Coptic. However, it is clear that by the Late Period of ancient Egypt, demotic scribes regularly employed a more phonetic orthography, a testament to the increasing cultural contact between Egyptians and Greeks even before Alexander the Great's conquest of Egypt. Coptic itself, or Old Coptic, takes root in the first century. The transition from the older Egyptian scripts to the newly adapted Coptic alphabet was in part due to the decline of the traditional role played by the priestly class of ancient Egyptian religion, who unlike most ordinary Egyptians, were literate in the temple scriptoria. Old Coptic is represented mostly by non-Christian texts such as Egyptian pagan prayers and magical and astrological papyri. Many of them served as glosses to original hieratic and demotic equivalents. The glosses may have been aimed at non-Egyptian speakers.\\r\\n\\r\\n Under late Roman rule, Diocletian persecuted many Egyptian converts to the new Christian faith, which forced new converts to flee to the Egyptian deserts. In time, the growth of these communities generated the need to write Christian Greek instructions in the Egyptian language. The early Fathers of the Egyptian Church, such as Anthony the Great, Pachomius the Great, Macarius of Egypt and Athanasius of Alexandria, who otherwise usually wrote in Greek, addressed some of their works to the Egyptian monks in Egyptian. The Egyptian language, now written in the Coptic alphabet, flourished in the second and third centuries. However, it was not until Shenoute that Coptic became a fully standardized literary language based on the Sahidic dialect. Shenouda's native Egyptian tongue and knowledge of Greek and rhetoric gave him the necessary tools to elevate Coptic, in content and style, to a literary height nearly equal to the position of the Egyptian language in ancient Egypt.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Muslim conquest of Egypt by Arabs came with the spread of Islam in the seventh century. At the turn of the eighth century, Caliph Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan decreed that Arabic replace Koine Greek and Coptic as the sole administrative language. Literary Coptic gradually declined, and within a few hundred years, Egyptian bishop Severus Ibn al-Muqaffa? found it necessary to write his History of the Patriarchs in Arabic. However, the language ecclesiastically retained its important position, and many hagiographic texts were also composed during this period. Until the 10th century, Coptic remained the spoken language of the native population outside the capital.\\r\\n\\r\\nPersecutions under the Mamluk Sultanate (1250ÿ1517) led to the further decline of Coptic[citation needed] until it completely gave way to Egyptian Arabic around the 17th century[citation needed], though it may have survived in isolated pockets for a little longer. In the second half of the 19th century, Pope Cyril IV of Alexandria started a national Church-sponsored movement to revive Coptic. Several works of grammar were published, along with a more comprehensive dictionary than had been previously available. The scholarly findings of the field of Egyptology and the inauguration of the Institute of Coptic Studies further contributed to the renaissance. Efforts at language revitalization continue to be undertaken, both inside and outside the Church, and have attracted the interest of Copts and linguists in and outside of Egypt.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nCoptic uses a writing system almost wholly derived from the Greek alphabet, with the addition of a number of letters that have their origins in Demotic Egyptian. (That makes it comparable to the Latin-based Icelandic alphabet, which includes the runic letter thorn.)[8] There is some variation in the number and forms of these signs depending on the dialect. Some of the letters in the Coptic alphabet that are of Greek origin were normally reserved for words that are themselves Greek. Old Coptic texts employed several graphemes that were not retained in the literary Coptic orthography of later centuries.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Sahidic, syllable boundary may have been marked by a supralinear stroke, or the stroke may have tied letters together in one word, since Coptic texts did not otherwise indicate word divisions. Some scribal traditions use a diaeresis over /i/ and /u/ at the beginning of a syllable or to mark a diphthong. Bohairic uses a superposed point or small stroke known as a djinkim.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe oldest Coptic writings date to the pre-Christian era (Old Coptic), though Coptic literature consists mostly of texts written by prominent saints of the Coptic Church such as Anthony the Great, Pachomius the Great and Shenoute. Shenoute helped fully standardize the Coptic language through his many sermons, treatises and homilies, which formed the basis of early Coptic literature.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe core lexicon of Coptic is Egyptian, most closely related to the preceding Demotic phase of the language. Up to 40% of the vocabulary of literary Coptic is drawn from Greek, but borrowings are not always fully adapted to the Coptic phonological system and may have semantic differences as well. There are instances of Coptic texts having passages that are almost entirely composed from Greek lexical roots. However, that is likely due to the fact that the majority of Coptic religious texts are direct translations of Greek works.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat invariably attracts the attention of the reader of a Coptic text, especially if it is written in the Sa'idic dialect, is the very liberal use which is made of Greek loan words, of which so few, indeed, are to be found in the Ancient Egyptian language. There Greek loan words occur everywhere in Coptic literature, be it Biblical, liturgical, theological, or non-literary, i.e. legal documents and personal letters. Though nouns and verbs predominate, the Greek loan words may come from any other part of speech except pronouns.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nWords or concepts for which no adequate Egyptian translation existed were taken directly from Greek to avoid altering the meaning of the religious message. In addition, other Egyptian words that would have adequately translated the Greek equivalents were not employed as they were perceived as having overt pagan associations. Old Coptic texts employ many such words, phrases and epithets; for example, the word ??????? '(Who is) in (His) Mountain', is an epithet of Anubis.[10] There are also traces of some archaic grammatical features, such as residues of the Demotic relative clause, lack of an indefinite article and possessive use of suffixes.\\r\\n\\r\\nThus, the transition from the 'old' traditions to the new Christian religion also contributed to the adoption of Greek words into the Coptic religious lexicon. It is safe to assume that the everyday speech of the native population retained, to a greater extent, its indigenous Egyptian character, which is sometimes reflected in Coptic nonreligious documents such as letters and contracts.\\r\\n\\r\\nCoptic provides the clearest indication of Later Egyptian phonology from its writing system, which fully indicates vowel sounds and occasionally stress pattern. The phonological system of Later Egyptian is also better known than that of the Classical phase of the language because of a greater number of sources indicating Egyptian sounds, including cuneiform letters containing transcriptions of Egyptian words and phrases, and Egyptian renderings of Northwest Semitic names. Coptic sounds, in addition, are known from a variety of Coptic-Arabic papyri in which Arabic letters were used to transcribe Coptic and vice versa. They date to the medieval Islamic period, when Coptic was still spoken.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are some differences of opinion among Coptic language scholars on the correct phonetic interpretation of the writing system of Coptic. Differences centre on how to interpret the pairs of letters / and /. In Greek spelling, the first member of each pair is a short closed vowel /e, o/, and the second member is a long open vowel /??, ??/. In some interpretations of Coptic phonology,[12] it is assumed that the length difference is primary, with / e/e? and / is o/o?. Other scholars[13][14] argue for a different analysis in which / and / are interpreted as e/? and o/?.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese two charts show the two theories of Coptic vowel phonology:\\r\\n\\r\\nDialects vary in their realization. The difference between [o] and [u] seems to be allophonic. Evidence is not sufficient to demonstrate that these are distinct vowels, and if they are, the difference has a very low functional load. For dialects that use orthographic <> for a single vowel, there appears to be no phonetic difference from <>.\\r\\n\\r\\nDouble orthographic vowels are presumed here to be long, as that makes the morphology more straightforward. (Another common interpretation is that these represented glottal stop.) \\r\\n\\r\\nAkhmimic is conservative, close to what is reconstructed for Old Coptic. \\r\\n\\r\\nThere is no length distinction in final stressed position, but only those vowels that occur long appear there: <(), , ϫ, ~, >.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Sahidic, the letter  was used for short /e/ before back fricatives, and also for unstressed schwa. It's possible there was also a distinction between short /?/ and /a/, but if so the functional load was extremely low. \\r\\n\\r\\nAgain, length is neutralized in final stressed position: <(), , , ϫ, , ~>.\\r\\n\\r\\nBohairic did not have long vowels. /i/ was only written <>. As above, it's possible that /u/ and /o/ were distinct vowels rather than just allophones. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn Late Coptic (that is, Late Bohairic), the vowels were reduced to those found in Egyptian Arabic, /a, i, u/. <, > became /u/, <> became /a/, and <> became either /i/ or /a/. It's difficult to explain <>. However, it generally became /a/ in stressed monosyllables, /i/ in unstressed monosyllables, and in polysyllables, /a/ when followed by /i/, and /i/ when not. \\r\\n\\r\\nThere were no doubled orthographic vowels in Mesokemic. Some representative correspondences with Sahidic are,\\r\\n\\r\\nIt's not clear if these correspondences reflect distinct pronunciations in Mesokemic, or if they're an imitation of the long Greek vowels <, >.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs with the vowels, there are differences of opinion over the correct interpretation of the Coptic consonant letters, particular the letters ? and ?. ? is transcribed as ?j? in many older Coptic sources and ? as ??[12] or ???. Lambdin (1983) notes that the current conventional pronunciations are different from the probable ancient pronunciations: Sahidic ? was probably pronounced [t?] and ? was probably pronounced [k?]. Reintges (2004, p.?22) suggests that ? was pronounced [t?].\\r\\n\\r\\nThe following chart shows the consonants that are represented in Sahidic Coptic orthography. Consonants that are rare or found primarily in Greek loanwords are shown in parentheses:\\r\\n\\r\\nBeside being found in Greek loanwords, the letters ?, Ĳ, ? were used in native words for a sequence of /p, t, k/ plus /h/, as in ?? = ?-?? \\"the-way\\" (f.sg.) and ??? = ?-??? \\"the-snake\\" (m.sg). The letters did not have this use in Bohairic, which used them for single sounds. \\r\\n\\r\\nIt is possible that in addition there was a glottal stop, ?, that was not consistently written. Coptic does not seem to have had a glottal stop at the beginning of orthographically vowel-initial words. It's possible that vowels written double were an attempt to indicate glottal stop, rather than a long vowel, in the middle of a word. However, there is little evidence for this (e.g., Arabic loans with short vowels and glottal stop are not written with double vowels in Coptic, and Coptic words with double orthographic vowels are transcribed with long vowels rather than hamza in Arabic.)\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Late Coptic (ca. 14th century), Bohairic sounds that did not occur in Egyptian Arabic were lost. A possible shift from a tenuis-aspirate distinction to voiced-tenuis is only attested from the alveolars, the only place that Arabic has such a contrast. \\r\\n\\r\\nEarlier phases of Egyptian may have contrasted voiceless and voiced bilabial plosives, but the distinction seems to have been lost. Late Egyptian, Demotic and Coptic all interchangeably use their respective graphemes to indicate either sound; for example, Coptic for 'iron' appears alternately as ??????, ?????? and ??????. That probably reflects dialect variation. Both letters were interchanged with ? and ? to indicate /f/, and ? was also used in many texts to indicate the bilabial approximant /w/. Coptologists believe that Coptic ? was articulated as a voiced bilabial fricative []. In the present-day Coptic Church services, this letter is realized as /v/, but it is almost certainly a result of the pronunciation reforms instituted in the 19th century.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhereas Old Egyptian contrasts /s/ and /z/, the two sounds appear to be in free variation in Coptic, as they were since the Middle Egyptian period. However, they are contrasted only in Greek loans; for example, native Coptic ?????? (anzؐb?) and ?????? (ansؐb?) 'school' are homophonous. Other consonants that sometimes appear to be either in free variation or to have different distributions across dialects are [t] and [d], [r] and [l] (especially in the Fayyumic dialect, a feature of earlier Egyptian) and [k] and [], with the voiceless stop consonants being more common in Coptic words and the voiced ones in Greek borrowings. Apart from the liquid consonants, this pattern may indicate a sound change in Later Egyptian, leading to a neutralization of voiced alveolar and velar plosives. When the voiced plosives are realized, it is usually the result of consonant voicing in proximity to /n/.\\r\\n\\r\\nThough there is no clear evidence that Coptic had a glottal stop, different orthographic means have been posited for indicating one by those who believe that it did: with ? word-initially, with ? word-finally in monosyllabic words in northern dialects and ? in monosyllabic words in Akhmimic and Assiutic, by reduplication of a vowel's grapheme but mostly unwritten.\\r\\n\\r\\nA few early manuscripts have a letter ? or ? ? where Sahidic and Bohairic have ? ?. and Akhmimic has ? x. This sound seems to have been lost early on.\\r\\n\\r\\nCoptic is agglutinative with subjectÿverbÿobject word order but can be verbÿsubjectÿobject with the correct preposition in front of the subject. Number, gender, tense, and mood are indicated by prefixes that come from Late Egyptian. The earlier phases of Egyptian did this through suffixation. Some vestiges of the suffix inflection survive in Coptic, mainly to indicate inalienable possession and in some verbs. Compare the Middle Egyptian form *satpafa 'he chooses' (written stp.f in hieroglyphs) to Coptic (Sahidic) f.sotp ?????? 'he chooses'.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll Coptic nouns carry grammatical gender, either masculine or feminine, usually marked through a prefixed definite article as in the Romance languages. Masculine nouns are marked with the article /p?, pe?/ and feminine nouns with the article /t?, te?/[20] in the Sahidic dialect and /pi, ?p/ and /ti, ?t/ in the Bohairic dialect.\\r\\n\\r\\nBohairic: ?????? /pi-ro?mi/ - 'the man' / ???? /ti-d?ig/ - 'the hand'\\r\\n\\r\\nSahidic: ?????? /p?-ro?me/ - 'the man' / ????? /t?-ci?/ - 'the hand'\\r\\n\\r\\nThe definite and indefinite articles also indicate number; however, only definite articles mark gender. Coptic has a number of broken plurals, a vestige of Older Egyptian, but in the majority of cases, the article marks number. Generally, nouns inflected for plurality end in /w?/, but there are some irregularities. The dual was another feature of earlier Egyptian that survives in Coptic in only few words, such as ???? (snau) 'two'.\\r\\n\\r\\nWords of Greek origin keep their original grammatical gender, except for neuter nouns, which become masculine in Coptic.\\r\\n\\r\\nCoptic pronouns are of two kinds, dependent and independent. Independent pronouns are used when the pronoun is acting as the subject of a sentence, as the object of a verb, or with a preposition. Dependent pronouns are a series of prefixes and suffixes that can attach to verbs and other nouns. Coptic verbs can therefore be said to inflect for the person, number and gender of the subject and the object: a pronominal prefix marks the subject, and a pronominal suffix marks the object, e.g. \\"I I'have'it the ball.\\" When (as in this case) the subject is a pronoun, it normally isn't also expressed independently, unless for emphasis.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs in other Afroasiatic languages, gender of pronouns differ only in the second and third person singular. The following table shows the pronouns of the Sahidian dialect:\\r\\n\\r\\nMost Coptic adjectives are actually nouns that have the attributive particle n to make them adjectival. In all stages of Egyptian, this morpheme is also used to express the genitive; for example, the Bohairic word for 'Egyptian', ????????? /remenk?e?mi/, is a combination of the nominal prefix rem- (the reduced form of ???? rmi 'man'), followed by the genitive morpheme ?n ('of') and finally the word for Egypt, khmi.\\r\\n\\r\\nCoptic, like Ancient Egyptian and Semitic languages, has root-and-pattern or templatic morphology, and the basic meaning of a verb is contained in a root and various derived forms of root are obtained by varying the vowel pattern. For example, the root for 'build' is kt.  It has four derived forms: k?t (the absolute state grade); ket- (the nominal state grade), kot= (the pronominal state grade), and k?t (the stative grade).\\r\\n(The nominal state grade is also called the construct state in some grammars of Coptic.)\\r\\n\\r\\nThe absolute, nominal, and pronominal state grades are used in different syntactic contexts. The absolute state grade of a transitive verb is used before a direct object with the accusative preposition /?n, ?m/, and the nominal state grade is used before a direct object with no case-marking.  The pronominal state grade is used before a pronominal direct object enclitic. In addition, many verbs also have a neutral state grade, used to express a state resulting from the action of the verb. Compare the following forms:[21]\\r\\n\\r\\nAbsolute state grade\\r\\n\\r\\n??????\\r\\na-i-d?imi\\r\\nPFV-1SG-find.ABS\\r\\n???????\\r\\n?m-p-a-jo?t\\r\\nPREP-DEF:MASC:SG-1SG-father\\r\\n?????? ???????\\r\\na-i-d?imi ?m-p-a-jo?t\\r\\nPFV-1SG-find.ABS PREP-DEF:MASC:SG-1SG-father\\r\\n'I found my father.'\\r\\nNominal state grade\\r\\n\\r\\n?????\\r\\na-i-d?em\\r\\nPFV-1SG-find.NOM\\r\\n???????\\r\\n?m-p-a-jo?t[dubious  ÿ discuss]\\r\\nDEF:MASC:SG-1SG-father\\r\\n????? ???????\\r\\na-i-d?em ?m-p-a-jo?t[dubious  ÿ discuss]\\r\\nPFV-1SG-find.NOM DEF:MASC:SG-1SG-father\\r\\n'I found my father.'\\r\\nPronominal state grade\\r\\n\\r\\n???????\\r\\na-i-k??nt=f\\r\\nPFV-1SG-find.PRONOM=3MSG\\r\\n???????\\r\\na-i-k??nt=f\\r\\nPFV-1SG-find.PRONOM=3MSG\\r\\n'I found him.'\\r\\nFor most transitive verbs, both absolute and nominal state grade verbs are available for non-pronominal objects. However, there is one important restriction, known as Jernstedt's rule (or the Stern-Jernstedt rule) (Jernstedt 1927): present-tense sentences cannot be used in the nominal state grade. Thus sentences in the present tense always show a pattern like the first example above (absolute state), never the second pattern (nominal state).\\r\\n\\r\\nIn general, the four grades of Coptic verb are not predictable from the root, and are listed in the lexicon for each verb. The following chart shows some typical patterns of correspondence:\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is hazardous to make firm generalizations about the relationships between these grade forms, but the nominal state is usually shorter than the corresponding absolute and neutral forms. Absolute and neutral state forms are usually bisyllabic or contain a long vowel; the corresponding nominal state forms are monosyllabic or have short vowels.\\r\\n\\r\\nCoptic has a very large number of distinct tense/aspect/mood categories, expressed by particles which are either before the verb or before the subject.

However, literary Old and Middle (Classical) Egyptian represent the spoken dialect of Lower Egypt around the city of Memphis, the capital of Egypt in the Old Kingdom. Later Egyptian is more representative of the dialects spoken in Upper Egypt, especially around the area of Thebes as it became the cultural and religious center of the New Kingdom.\\r\\n\\r\\nCoptic more obviously displays a number of regional dialects that were in use from the coast of the Mediterranean Sea in northern Egypt, south into Nubia, and in the western oases. However, while many of these dialects reflect actual regional linguistic (namely phonological and some lexical) variation, they mostly reflect localized orthographic traditions with very little grammatical differences.\\r\\n\\r\\nSahidic (also known as Thebaic) is the dialect in which most known Coptic texts are written, and was the leading dialect in the pre-Islamic period. It is thought to have originally been a regional dialect from the area around Hermopolis (Coptic ???????? Shmounein). Around 300 it began to be written in literary form, including translations of major portions of the Bible (see Coptic versions of the Bible). By the 6th century, a standardized spelling had been attained throughout Egypt. Almost all native authors wrote in this dialect of Coptic. Sahidic was, beginning in the 9th century, challenged by Bohairic, but is attested as late as the 14th century.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile texts in other Coptic dialects are primarily translations of Greek literary and religious texts, Sahidic is the only dialect with a considerable body of original literature and non-literary texts. Because Sahidic shares most of its features with other dialects of Coptic with few peculiarities specific to itself, and has an extensive corpus of known texts, it is generally the dialect studied by learners of Coptic, particularly by scholars outside of the Coptic Church.\\r\\n\\r\\nAkhmimic was the dialect of the area around the town of Akhmim (Greek Panopolis). It flourished during the fourth and fifth centuries, after which no writings are attested. Akhmimic is phonologically the most archaic of the Coptic dialects. One characteristic feature is the retention of the phoneme /x/, which is realized as /?/ in most other dialects. Similarly, it uses an exceptionally conservative writing system strikingly similar to Old Coptic.\\r\\n\\r\\nLycopolitan (also known as Subakhmimic and Assiutic) is a dialect closely related to Akhmimic in terms of when and where it was attested, but manuscripts written in Lycopolitan tend to be from the area of Asyut. The main differences between the two dialects seem to be graphic in nature. The Lycopolitan variety was used extensively for translations of Gnostic and Manichaean works, including the texts of the Nag Hammadi library.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Bohairic (also known as Memphitic) dialect originated in the western Nile Delta. The earliest Bohairic manuscripts date to the 4th century, but most texts come from the 9th century and later; this may be due to poor preservation conditions for texts in the humid regions of northern Egypt. It shows several conservative features in lexicon and phonology not found in other dialects. Bohairic is the dialect used today as the liturgical language of the Coptic Orthodox Church, replacing Sahidic some time in the eleventh century. In contemporary liturgical use, there are two traditions of pronunciation, arising from successive reforms in the 19th and 20th centuries (see Coptic pronunciation reform). Modern revitalization efforts are based on this dialect.\\r\\n\\r\\nFayyumic (also written as Faiyumic; in older works it is often called Bashmuric) was spoken primarily in the Faiyum west of the Nile Valley. It is attested from the 3rd to the 10th centuries. It is most notable for writing ? (which corresponds to /l/), where other dialects generally use ? /r/ (probably corresponding to a flap [?]). In earlier stages of Egyptian, the liquids were not distinguished in writing until the New Kingdom, when Late Egyptian became the administrative language. Late Egyptian orthography utilized a grapheme that combined the graphemes for /r/ and /n/ in order to express /l/. Demotic for its part indicated /l/ using a diacritic variety of /r/.\\r\\n\\r\\nOxyrhynchite (also known as Mesokemic or [confusingly] Middle Egyptian) is the dialect of Oxyrhynchus and surrounding areas. It shows similarities with Fayyumic and is attested in manuscripts from the fourth and fifth centuries.","input":"When did arabic overtake coptic as the language most used in egypt?"},{"output":"agriculture","context":"","input":"What are the different sectors of indian economy?"},{"output":"around the 9th century AD","context":"A playing card is a piece of specially prepared heavy paper, thin cardboard, plastic-coated paper, cotton-paper blend, or thin plastic, marked with distinguishing motifs and used as one of a set for playing card games. Playing cards are typically palm-sized for convenient handling, and were first invented in China during the Tang dynasty.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPlaying cards may have been invented during the Tang dynasty around the 9th century AD as a result of the usage of woodblock printing technology and there were 30 cards in a deck.[2][3][4][5][6] The first possible reference to card games comes from a 9th-century text known as the Collection of Miscellanea at Duyang, written by Tang dynasty writer Su E. It describes Princess Tongchang, daughter of Emperor Yizong of Tang, playing the \\"leaf game\\" in 868 with members of the clan of Wei Baoheng, the family of the princess' husband.[4][7][8]:131 The first known book on the \\"leaf\\" game was called the Yezi Gexi and allegedly written by a Tang woman. It received commentary by writers of subsequent dynasties.[9] The Song dynasty (960ÿ1279) scholar Ouyang Xiu (1007ÿ1072) asserts that the \\"leaf\\" game existed at least since the mid-Tang dynasty and associated its invention with the development of printed sheets as a writing medium.[9][4] However, Ouyang also claims that the \\"leaves\\" were pages of a book used in a board game played with dice, and that the rules of the game were lost by 1067.[10]\\r\\nOther games revolving around alcoholic drinking involved using playing cards of a sort from the Tang dynasty onward. However, these cards did not contain suits or numbers. Instead, they were printed with instructions or forfeits for whoever drew them.[10]\\r\\nThe earliest dated instance of a game involving cards with suits and numerals occurred on 17 July 1294 when \\"Yan Sengzhu and Zheng Pig-Dog were caught playing cards [zhi pai] and that wood blocks for printing them had been impounded, together with nine of the actual cards.\\"[10]\\r\\nWilliam Henry Wilkinson suggests that the first cards may have been actual paper currency which doubled as both the tools of gaming and the stakes being played for,[3] similar to trading card games. Using paper money was inconvenient and risky so they were substituted by play money known as \\"money cards\\". One of the earliest games in which we know the rules is Madiao, a trick-taking game, which dates to the Ming Dynasty (1368ÿ1644). Fifteenth century scholar Lu Rong described it is as being played with 38 \\"money cards\\" divided into four suits: 9 in coins, 9 in strings of coins (which may have been misinterpreted as sticks from crude drawings), 9 in myriads (of coins or of strings), and 11 in tens of myriads (a myriad is 10,000). The two latter suits had Water Margin characters instead of pips on them [8]:132 with Chinese characters to mark their rank and suit. The suit of coins is in reverse order with 9 of coins being the lowest going up to 1 of coins as the high card.[11]\\r\\nDespite the wide variety of patterns, the suits show a uniformity of structure. Every suit contains twelve cards with the top two usually being the court cards of king and vizier and the bottom ten being pip cards. Half the suits use reverse ranking for their pip cards. There are many motifs for the suit pips but some include coins, clubs, jugs, and swords which resemble later Mamluk and Latin suits. Michael Dummett speculated that Mamluk cards may have descended from an earlier deck which consisted of 48 cards divided into four suits each with ten pip cards and two court cards.[12]\\r\\nBy the 11th century, playing cards were spreading throughout the Asian continent and later came into Egypt.[8]:309 The oldest surviving cards in the world are four fragments found in the Keir Collection and one in the Benaki Museum. They are dated to the 12th and 13th centuries (late Fatimid, Ayyubid, and early Mamluk periods).[13]\\r\\nA near complete pack of Mamluk playing cards dating to the 15th century and of similar appearance to the fragments above was discovered by Leo Aryeh Mayer in the Topkap? Palace, Istanbul, in 1939.[14] It is not a complete set and is actually composed of three different packs, probably to replace missing cards.[15] The Topkap? pack originally contained 52 cards comprising four suits: polo-sticks, coins, swords, and cups. Each suit contained ten pip cards and three court cards, called malik (king), n'ib malik (viceroy or deputy king), and thnؐ n'ib (second or under-deputy). The thnؐ n'ib is a non-existent title so it may not have been in the earliest versions; without this rank, the Mamluk suits would structurally be the same as a Ganjifa suit. In fact, the word \\"Kanjifah\\" appears in Arabic on the king of swords and is still used in parts of the Middle East to describe modern playing cards. Influence from further east can explain why the Mamluks, most of whom were Central Asian Turkic Kipchaks, called their cups tuman which means myriad in Turkic, Mongolian and Jurchen languages.[16] Wilkinson postulated that the cups may have been derived from inverting the Chinese and Jurchen ideogram for myriad ().\\r\\nThe Mamluk court cards showed abstract designs or calligraphy not depicting persons possibly due to religious proscription in Sunni Islam, though they did bear the ranks on the cards. N'ib would be borrowed into French (nahipi), Italian (naibi), and Spanish (naipes), the latter word still in common usage. Panels on the pip cards in two suits show they had a reverse ranking, a feature found in Madiao, Ganjifa, and old European card games like Ombre, Tarot, and Maw.[17]\\r\\nA fragment of two uncut sheets of Moorish-styled cards of a similar but plainer style were found in Spain and dated to the early 15th century.[18]\\r\\nExport of these cards (from Cairo, Alexandria, and Damascus), ceased after the fall of the Mamluks in the sixteenth century.[19] The rules to play these games are lost but they are believed to be plain trick games without trumps.[20]\\r\\nFour-suited playing cards are first attested in Southern Europe in 1365,[10] and are likely derived from the Mamluk suits of cups, coins, swords, and polo-sticks, which are still used in traditional Latin decks.[21] As polo was an obscure sport to Europeans then, the polo-sticks became batons or cudgels.[22] Their presence is attested in Catalonia in 1371, 1377 in Switzerland, and 1380 in many locations including Florence and Paris.[23][24][25] Wide use of playing cards in Europe can, with some certainty, be traced from 1377 onwards.[26]\\r\\nIn the account books of Johanna, Duchess of Brabant and Wenceslaus I, Duke of Luxembourg, an entry dated May 14, 1379 reads: \\"Given to Monsieur and Madame four peters, two forms, value eight and a half moutons, wherewith to buy a pack of cards\\". In his book of accounts for 1392 or 1393, Charles or Charbot Poupart, treasurer of the household of Charles VI of France, records payment for the painting of three sets of cards.[27]\\r\\nFrom about 1418 to 1450[28] professional card makers in Ulm, Nuremberg, and Augsburg created printed decks. Playing cards even competed with devotional images as the most common uses for woodcuts in this period. Most early woodcuts of all types were coloured after printing, either by hand or, from about 1450 onwards, stencils. These 15th-century playing cards were probably painted. The Flemish Hunting Deck, held by the Metropolitan Museum of Art is the oldest complete set of ordinary playing cards made in Europe from the fifteenth century.[29]\\r\\nAs cards spread from Italy to Germanic countries, the Latin suits were replaced with the suits of Leaves (or Shields), Hearts (or Roses), Bells, and Acorns, and a combination of Latin and Germanic suit pictures and names resulted in the French suits of trfles (clovers), carreaux (tiles), c?urs (hearts), and piques (pikes) around 1480. The trfle (clover) was probably derived from the acorn and the pique (pike) from the leaf of the German suits. The names pique and spade, however, may have derived from the sword (spade) of the Italian suits.[30] In England, the French suits were eventually used, although the earliest packs circulating may have had Latin suits.[31] This may account for why the English called the clovers \\"clubs\\" and the pikes \\"spades\\".\\r\\nIn the late 14th century, Europeans changed the Mamluk court cards to represent European royalty and attendants. In a description from 1377, the earliest courts were originally a seated \\"King\\", an upper marshal that held his suit symbol up, and a lower marshal that held it down.[32][33] The latter two correspond with the Ober and Unter cards found in German and Swiss playing cards. The Italians and Iberians replaced the Ober/Unter system with the \\"Knight\\" and \\"Fante\\" or \\"Sota\\" before 1390, perhaps to make the cards more visually distinguishable. In England, the lowest court card was called the \\"Knave\\" which originally meant male child (compare German Knabe), so in this context the character could represent the \\"prince\\", son to the King and Queen; the meaning servant developed later.[34][35] Queens appeared sporadically in packs as early as 1377, especially in Germany. Although the Germans abandoned the Queen before the 1500s, the French permanently picked it up and placed it under the King. Packs of 56 cards containing in each suit a King, Queen, Knight, and Knave (as in tarot) were once common in the 15th century.\\r\\nDuring the mid 16th century, Portuguese traders introduced playing cards to Japan. The first indigenous Japanese deck was the Tensh karuta named after the Tensh period.[36]\\r\\nPacks with corner and edge indices (i.e. the value of the card printed at the corner(s) of the card) enabled players to hold their cards close together in a fan with one hand (instead of the two hands previously used[citation needed]). The first such pack known with Latin suits was printed by Infirerra and dated 1693,[37] but this feature was commonly used only from the end of the 18th century. The first Anglo-American deck with this innovation was the Saladee's Patent, printed by Samuel Hart in 1864. In 1870, he and his cousins at Lawrence & Cohen followed up with the Squeezers, the first cards with indices that had a large diffusion.[38]\\r\\nThis was followed by the innovation of reversible court cards. This invention is attributed to a French card maker of Agen in 1745. But the French government, which controlled the design of playing cards, prohibited the printing of cards with this innovation. In central Europe (Trappola cards) and Italy (Tarocco Bolognese) the innovation was adopted during the second half of the 18th century. In Great Britain, the pack with reversible court cards was patented in 1799 by Edmund Ludlow and Ann Wilcox. The Anglo-American pack with this design was printed around 1802 by Thomas Wheeler.[39]\\r\\nSharp corners wear out more quickly, and could possibly reveal the card's value, so they were replaced with rounded corners. Before the mid-19th century, British, American, and French players preferred blank backs. The need to hide wear and tear and to discourage writing on the back led cards to have designs, pictures, photos, or advertising on the reverse.[40][41]\\r\\nThe United States introduced the Joker into the deck. It was devised for the game of Euchre, which spread from Europe to America beginning shortly after the American Revolutionary War. In Euchre, the highest trump card is the Jack of the trump suit, called the right bower (from the German Bauer); the second-highest trump, the left bower, is the Jack of the suit of the same color as trumps. The joker was invented c. 1860 as a third trump, the imperial or best bower, which ranked higher than the other two bowers.[42] The name of the card is believed to derive from juker, a variant name for Euchre.[43][44] The earliest reference to a Joker functioning as a wild card dates to 1875 with a variation of poker.[45]\\r\\nContemporary playing cards are grouped into three broad categories based on the suits they use: French, Latin, and Germanic. Latin suits are used in the closely related Spanish and Italian formats. The Swiss-German suits are distinct enough to merit their subcategory. Excluding Jokers and Tarot trumps, the French 52-card deck preserves the number of cards in the original Mamluk deck, while Latin and Germanic decks average fewer. Latin decks usually drop the higher-valued pip cards, while Germanic decks drop the lower-valued ones.\\r\\nWithin suits, there are regional or national variations called \\"standard patterns\\" because they are in the public domain, allowing multiple card manufacturers to copy them.[46] Pattern differences are most easily found in the face cards but the number of cards per deck, the use of numeric indices, or even minor shape and arrangement differences of the pips can be used to distinguish them. Some patterns have been around for hundreds of years. Jokers are not part of any pattern as they are a relatively recent invention and lack any standardized appearance so each publisher usually puts their own trademarked illustration into their decks. The wide variation of jokers has turned them into collectible items. Any card that bore the stamp duty like the ace of spades in England or the ace of clubs in France are also collectible as that is where the manufacturer's logo is usually placed.\\r\\nFrench decks come in a variety of patterns and deck sizes. The 52-card deck is the most popular deck and includes 13 ranks of each suit with reversible \\"court\\" or face cards. Each suit includes an Ace, depicting a single symbol of its suit, a King, Queen, and Jack, each depicted with a symbol of their suit; and ranks two through ten, with each card depicting that number of pips of its suit. As well as these 52 cards, commercial packs often include between one and four jokers, most often two.\\r\\nThe piquet pack has all values from 2 through 6 in each suit removed for a total of 32 cards. It is popular in France, the Low Countries, Central Europe and Russia and is used to play Piquet, Belote, Bezique and Skat. Forty-card French suited packs are common in northwest Italy; these remove the 8s through 10s like Latin suited decks. 24 card decks, removing 2s through 8s are also sold in Austria and Bavaria to play Schnapsen.\\r\\nA pinochle deck consists of two copies of each of the 9, 10, jack, queen, king, and ace cards of all four suits. It thus comprises just 48 cards per deck.\\r\\nThe 78 card Tarot Nouveau adds the Knight card between Queens and Jacks along with 21 numbered trumps and the unnumbered Fool.\\r\\nThe Unicode standard for text encoding on computers defines 8 characters for card suits in the Miscellaneous Symbols block, at U+2660ÿ2667. Unicode 7.0 added a unified pack for French-suited Tarot Nouveau's trump cards and the 52 cards of the modern French pack, with 4 Knights, together with a character for \\"Playing Card Back\\" and black, red, and white jokers in the block U+1F0A0ÿ1F0FF.[47]\\r\\nGeographic origin:\\r\\nTypes of decks:\\r\\nSpecific decks:\\r\\nUses:\\r\\nTerminology:\\r\\nSources for further information:\\r\\nPlaying card societies (collectors and researchers)\\r\\nHistory of playing cards\\r\\nPlaying card iconography\\r\\nMuseums, Institutes and Organisations\\r\\nPlaying card collections online\\r\\nManufacturers\\r\\nDesigning Playing cards","input":"When was the first pack of cards made?"},{"output":"October 1861","context":"","input":"When was great expectations published as a novel?"},{"output":"18.6 miles","context":"O'Hare Transfer is a commuter railroad station along Metra's North Central Service that serves Chicago's O'Hare International Airport.

It is mainly a folivore, but has been known to eat small mammals such as rats. In most Australian habitats, leaves of eucalyptus are a significant part of the diet but rarely the sole item eaten. The tail is prehensile and naked on its lower underside. There are four colour variations: silver-grey, brown, black, and gold.[4]\\r\\nIt is the Australian marsupial most often seen by city-dwellers, as it is one of few that thrives in cities, as well as a wide range of natural and human-modified environments. Around human habitations, common brushtails are inventive and determined foragers with a liking for fruit trees, vegetable gardens, and kitchen raids.\\r\\nThe common brushtail possum was introduced to New Zealand in 1837 to establish a fur industry, but in the mild subtropical climate of New Zealand, and with few to no natural predators, it thrived to the extent that it became a major agricultural and conservation pest.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe common brushtail possum has large and pointed ears. It has a bushy tail (hence its name) that is adapted to grasping branches, prehensile at the end with a hairless ventral patch.[5][6] Its forefeet have sharp claws and the first toe of each hind foot is clawless but has a strong grasp.[6] The possum grooms itself with the third and fourth toes which are fused together.[6] It has a thick and woolly pelage that varies in colour depending on the subspecies. Colour patterns tend to be silver-gray, brown, black, red or cream. The ventral areas are typically lighter and the tail is usually brown or black.[5][6] The muzzle is marked with dark patches.\\r\\nThe common brushtail possum has a head and body length of 32ÿ58?cm[5] with a tail length of 24ÿ40?cm.[6] It weighs 1.2-4.5?kg.[6] Males are generally larger than females. In addition, the coat of the male tends to be reddish at the shoulders. As with most marsupials, the female brushtail possum has a forward-opening, well-developed pouch.[5] The chest of both sexes has a scent gland that emits a reddish secretion which stains that fur around it. It marks its territory with these secretions.[7]\\r\\nThe common brushtail possum is perhaps the most widespread marsupial of Australia. It is found throughout the eastern and northern parts of the continent, as well as some western regions,[8] Tasmania[9] and a number of offshore islands, such as Kangaroo Island[10] and Barrow Island.[11][12] It is also widespread in New Zealand since its introduction in 1840. The common brushtail possum can be found in a variety of habitats, such as forests, semiarid areas and even cultivated or urban areas.[5][6] It is mostly a forest inhabiting species, however it is also found in treeless areas.[6] In New Zealand, possums favour broadleaf-podocarp near farmland pastures.[13] In southern beech forests and pine plantations, possums are less common.[13] Overall, brushtail possums are more densely populated in New Zealand than in their native Australia.[14] This may be because Australia has more fragmented eucalypt forests and more predators. In Australia, brushtail possums are threatened by humans, tiger quolls, dogs, foxes, cats, goannas, carpet snakes and powerful owls. In New Zealand, brushtail possums are threatened only by humans and cats.[14]\\r\\nThe common brushtail possum can adapt to numerous kinds of vegetation.[14] It prefers Eucalyptus leaves but will also eat flowers, shoots, fruits and seeds.[14] It may also consume animal matter such as insects, birds eggs and chicks, and other small vertebrates.[15] Brushtail possums may eat three or four different plant species during a foraging trip, unlike some other arboreal marsupials, such as the koala and the greater glider, which focus on single species. The brushtail possum's rounded molars cannot cut Eucalyptus leaves as finely as more specialised feeders. They are more adapted to crushing their food which enables them to chew fruit or herbs more effectively. The brushtail possums caecum lacks internal ridges and cannot separate coarse and fine particles as efficiently as some other arboreal marsupials.[14] The brushtail possum cannot rely on Eucalyptus alone to provide sufficient nitrogen.[16] Its more generalised and mixed diet, however, does provide adequate nitrogen.[17]\\r\\nThe common brushtail possum is largely arboreal and nocturnal. It has a mostly solitary lifestyle, and individuals keep their distance with scent markings (urinating) and vocalisations. Brushtail possums usually make their dens in natural places like tree hollows and caves but will also use spaces in the roofs of houses. While they sometimes share dens, brushtails normally sleep in separate dens. Individuals from New Zealand use many more den sites than those from Australia.[18] Brushtail possums compete with each other and other animals for den spaces and this contributes to their mortality. This is likely another reason why brushtail possum population densities are smaller in Australia than in New Zealand.[14] Brushtail possums are usually not aggressive towards each other and usually just stare with erect ears.[14] Brushtail possums vocalise with clicks, grunts, hisses, alarm chatters, guttural coughs and screeching.[5][6]\\r\\nThe common brushtail possum can breed at any time of the year, but breeding tends to peak in spring, from September to November, and in autumn, from March to May, in some areas. Mating is promiscuous and random; some males can sire several young in a season while over half sire none.[14] In one Queensland population, it apparently takes the males one month of consorting with females before they can mate with them.[19] Females have a gestation period of 16ÿ18 days, after which they give birth to single young.[5][6] A newborn brushtail possum is only 1.5?cm long and weighs only 2 g. As usual for marsupials, the newborn brushtail possum may climb, unaided, through the females fur and into the pouch and attach to a teat. The young develops and remains inside the mothers pouch for another four or five months. When older, the young is left in the den or rides on its mothers back until it is seven to nine months old.[5][6] Females reach sexual maturity when they are one year old, and males do so at the end of their second year.[5][6] Female young have a higher survival rate than their male counterparts due to establishing their home ranges closer to their mothers, while males travel farther in search of new nesting sites, encountering pre-established territories from which they may be forcibly ejected. In the Orongorongo population, female young have been found to continue to associate with their mothers after weaning, and some will inherit the prime den sites.[20] There is possible competition between mothers and daughters for dens, and daughters may be excluded from a den occupied by the mother.[21] In forests with shortages of den sites, females apparently produce more sons, which do not compete directly for den sites, while in forests with plentiful den sites, female young are greater in number.[21] Brushtail possums can live up to 13 years in the wild.[5][6]\\r\\nThe common brushtail possum is considered a pest in some areas as it is known to cause damage to pine plantations, regenerating forest, flowers, fruit trees and buildings.\\r\\nIts fur has been considered valuable and has been harvested. Although once hunted extensively for its fur in Australia, the common brushtail possum is now protected in mainland states, but only partially protected in Tasmania where there is an annual hunting season. In addition, Tasmania gives Crop Protection Permits to landowners whose property has been damaged.[7]\\r\\nWhile its populations are declining in some regional areas due to habitat loss, urban populations indicate an adaptation to the presence of humans.[22] In the mainland states, possum trapping is legal when attempting to evict possums from human residences (e.g. roofs), however possums must be released after dusk within 24 hours of capture, no more than 50 metres from the trapping site. In some states e.g. Victoria, trapped possums may be taken to registered veterinarians for euthanasia.[23] In South Australia, they are fully protected and permits are required for trapping possums in human residences[24] or for keeping or rescuing sick or injured wild possums and other native animals.[25]\\r\\nIn New Zealand, the common brushtail possum is considered a major threat to New Zealand native forests and birds. European settlers introduced the common brushtail possum from Australia in the 1850s, and by the 1980s the peak population had reached an estimated 60-70 million. It is now an estimated 30 million due to control measures. There are no restrictions on hunting but the population seems to be stable despite the annual killing of the animals in the thousands.[7] In New Zealand (but not Australia where the disease has been eradicated) it is a host for the highly contagious bovine tuberculosis.[7] The New Zealand Department of Conservation controls possum numbers in many areas via the aerial dropping of 1080-laced bait.[26]","input":"What is the favorite food of a possum?"},{"output":"Built as a monument to the westward expansion of the United States","context":"","input":"What does the gateway arch in st louis represent?"},{"output":"Kingdom of Kush","context":"","input":"Where did the first civilization in africa start?"},{"output":"the fifth most abundant element in Earth's crust","context":"Calcium is a chemical element with symbol Ca and atomic number 20. An alkaline earth metal, calcium is a reactive pale yellow metal that forms a dark oxide-nitride layer when exposed to air. Its physical and chemical properties are most similar to its heavier homologues strontium and barium. It is the fifth most abundant element in Earth's crust and the third most abundant metal, after iron and aluminium. The most common calcium compound on Earth is calcium carbonate, found in limestone and the fossilised remnants of early sea life; gypsum, anhydrite, fluorite, and apatite are also sources of calcium.\\r\\nThe name derives from Latin calx \\"lime\\", which was obtained from heating limestone. Its compounds were known to the ancients, though their chemistry was unknown until the seventeenth century. It was isolated by Humphry Davy in 1808 via electrolysis of its oxide, who named the element. While the pure metal does not have many applications due to its high reactivity, it is often used as an alloying component in small quantities in steelmaking, and calciumÿlead alloys are sometimes used in automotive batteries. Calcium compounds on the other hand are very widely used in many industries: for example, they are used in foods and pharmaceuticals for calcium supplementation, in the paper industry as bleaches, in cement, in the manufacture of soaps, and as electrical insulators.\\r\\nCalcium is the fifth most abundant element in the human body and the most abundant metal. Calcium ions play a vital role in the physiology and biochemistry of organisms and the cell as electrolytes. They play an important role in signal transduction pathways, where they act as a second messenger, in neurotransmitter release from neurons, in contraction of all muscle cell types, and in fertilization. Many enzymes require calcium ions as a cofactor. Calcium ions outside cells are also important for maintaining the potential difference across excitable cell membranes, as well as proper bone formation.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCalcium is a very ductile silvery metal with a pale yellow tint whose properties are very similar to the heavier elements in its group, strontium, barium, and radium. A calcium atom has twenty electrons, arranged in the electron configuration [Ar]4s2. Like the other elements placed in group 2 of the periodic table, calcium has two valence electrons in the outermost s-orbital, which are very easily lost in chemical reactions to form a dipositive ion with the stable electron configuration of a noble gas, in this case argon. Hence, calcium is almost always divalent in its compounds, which are usually ionic. Hypothetical univalent salts of calcium would be stable with respect to their elements, but not to disproportionation to the divalent salts and calcium metal, because the enthalpy of formation of MX2 is much higher than those of the hypothetical MX. This occurs because of the much greater lattice energy afforded by the more highly charged Ca2+ cation compared to the hypothetical Ca+ cation.[5]\\r\\nCalcium is considered to be an alkaline earth metal, along with these heavier elements and the lighter beryllium and magnesium. Nevertheless, there are significant differences in chemical and physical properties between beryllium and magnesium (which behave more like aluminium and zinc respectively and have some of the weaker metallic character of the post-transition metals) and the group members from calcium onwards, which traditionally led to \\"alkaline earth metal\\" only applying to the latter group.[6] This classification is mostly obsolete in English-language sources, but is still used in other countries such as Japan.[7] As a result, comparisons with strontium and barium are more germane to calcium chemistry than comparisons with magnesium.[5]\\r\\nCalcium metal melts at 842?C and boils at 1494?C, higher than its adjacent group 2 metals do. It crystallises in the face-centered cubic arrangement like strontium; above 450?C, it changes to an anisotropic hexagonal close-packed arrangement like magnesium. The density of 1.55?g{cm?3 is the lowest in its group, with others decreasing towards it.[5] Calcium can be cut with a knife with effort, although it is still harder than lead. While calcium is a poorer conductor of electricity than copper or aluminium by volume, it is a better conductor than both of them by mass due to its very low density.[8] Although it is infeasible for terrestrial applications as it reacts quickly with atmospheric oxygen, its use as a conductor in space has been considered.[9]\\r\\nThe chemistry of calcium is that of a typical heavy alkaline earth metal. For example, calcium spontaneously reacts with water more quickly than magnesium and less quickly than strontium to produce calcium hydroxide and hydrogen gas. It also reacts with the oxygen and nitrogen in the air to form a mixture of calcium oxide and calcium nitride.[10] When finely divided, it spontaneously burns in air to produce the nitride. In bulk, calcium is less reactive: it quickly forms a hydration coating in moist air, but below 30% relative humidity it may be stored indefinitely at room temperature.[11]\\r\\nBesides the simple oxide CaO, the peroxide CaO2 can be made by direct oxidation of calcium metal under a high pressure of oxygen, and there is some evidence for a yellow superoxide Ca(O2)2.[12] Calcium hydroxide, Ca(OH)2, is a strong base, though it is not as strong as the hydroxides of strontium, barium or the alkali metals.[13] All four dihalides of calcium are known.[14] Calcium carbonate (CaCO3) and calcium sulfate (CaSO4) are particularly abundant minerals.[15] Like strontium and barium, as well as the alkali metals and the divalent lanthanides europium and ytterbium, calcium metal dissolves directly in liquid ammonia to give a dark blue solution.[5]\\r\\nDue to the large size of the Ca2+ ion, high coordination numbers are common, up to 24 in some intermetallic compounds such as CaZn13.[16] Calcium is readily complexed by oxygen chelates such as EDTA and polyphosphates, which are useful in analytic chemistry and removing calcium ions from hard water. In the absence of steric hindrance, smaller group 2 cations tend to form stronger complexes, but when large polydentate macrocycles are involved the trend is reversed.[15]\\r\\nAlthough calcium is in the same group as magnesium and organomagnesium compounds are very commonly used throughout chemistry, organocalcium compounds are not similarly widespread because they are more difficult to make and more reactive, although they have recently been investigated as possible catalysts.[17][18][19][20][21] Organocalcium compounds tend to be more similar to organoytterbium compounds due to the similar ionic radii of Yb2+ (102?pm) and Ca2+ (100?pm). Most of these compounds can only be prepared at low temperatures; bulky ligands tend to favor stability. For example, calcium dicyclopentadienyl, Ca(C5H5)2, must be made by directly reacting calcium metal with mercurocene or cyclopentadiene itself; replacing the C5H5 ligand with the bulkier C5(CH3)5 ligand on the other hand increases the compound's solubility, volatility, and kinetic stability.[22]\\r\\nNatural calcium is a mixture of five stable isotopes (40Ca, 42Ca, 43Ca, 44Ca, and 46Ca) and one isotope with a half-life so long that it can be considered stable for all practical purposes (48Ca, with a half-life of about 4.3?G?1019?years). Calcium is the first (lightest) element to have six naturally occurring isotopes.[10]\\r\\nBy far the most common isotope of calcium in nature is 40Ca, which makes up 96.941% of all natural calcium. It is produced in the silicon-burning process from fusion of alpha particles and is the heaviest stable nuclide with equal proton and neutron numbers; its occurrence is also supplemented slowly by the decay of primordial 40K. Adding another alpha particle would lead to unstable 44Ti, which quickly decays via two successive electron captures to stable 44Ca; this makes up 2.806% of all natural calcium and is the second-most common isotope. The other four natural isotopes, 42Ca, 43Ca, 46Ca, and 48Ca, are significantly rarer, each comprising less than 1% of all natural calcium. The four lighter isotopes are mainly products of the oxygen-burning and silicon-burning processes, leaving the two heavier ones to be produced via neutron-capturing processes. 46Ca is mostly produced in a \\"hot\\" s-process, as its formation requires a rather high neutron flux to allow short-lived 45Ca to capture a neutron. 48Ca is produced by electron capture in the r-process in type Ia supernovae, where high neutron excess and low enough entropy ensures its survival.[23][24]\\r\\n46Ca and 48Ca are the first \\"classically stable\\" nuclides with a six-neutron or eight-neutron excess respectively. Although extremely neutron-rich for such a light element, 48Ca is very stable because it is a doubly magic nucleus, having 20 protons and 28 neutrons arranged in closed shells. Its beta decay to 48Sc is very hindered because of the gross mismatch of nuclear spin: 48Ca has zero nuclear spin, being evenÿeven, while 48Sc has spin 6+, so the decay is forbidden by the conservation of angular momentum. While two excited states of 48Sc are available for decay as well, they are also forbidden due to their high spins. As a result, when 48Ca does decay, it does so by double beta decay to 48Ti instead, being the lightest nuclide known to undergo double beta decay.[25][26] The heavy isotope 46Ca can also theoretically undergo double beta decay to 46Ti as well, but this has never been observed; the lightest and most common isotope 40Ca is also doubly magic and could undergo double electron capture to 40Ar, but this has likewise never been observed. Calcium is the only element to have two primordial doubly magic isotopes. The experimental lower limits for the half-lives of 40Ca and 46Ca are 5.9?G?1021?years and 2.8?G?1015?years respectively.[25]\\r\\nApart from the practically stable 48Ca, the longest lived radioisotope of calcium is 41Ca. It decays by electron capture to stable 41K with a half-life of about a hundred thousand years. Its existence in the early Solar System as an extinct radionuclide has been inferred from excesses of 41K: traces of 41Ca also still exist today, as it is a cosmogenic nuclide, continuously reformed through neutron activation of natural 40Ca.[24] Many other calcium radioisotopes are known, ranging from 34Ca to 57Ca: they are all much shorter-lived than 41Ca, the most stable among them being 45Ca (half-life 163?days) and 47Ca (half-life 4.54?days). The isotopes lighter than 42Ca usually undergo beta plus decay to isotopes of potassium, and those heavier than 44Ca usually undergo beta minus decay to isotopes of scandium, although near the nuclear drip lines proton emission and neutron emission begin to be significant decay modes as well.[25]\\r\\nLike other elements, a variety of processes alter the relative abundance of calcium isotopes.[27] The best studied of these processes is the mass-dependent fractionation of calcium isotopes that accompanies the precipitation of calcium minerals such as calcite, aragonite and apatite from solution. Lighter isotopes are preferentially incorporated into these minerals, leaving the surrounding solution enriched in heavier isotopes at a magnitude of roughly 0.025% per atomic mass unit (amu) at room temperature. Mass-dependent differences in calcium isotope composition are conventionally expressed by the ratio of two isotopes (usually 44Ca/40Ca) in a sample compared to the same ratio in a standard reference material. 44Ca/40Ca varies by about 1% among common earth materials.[28]\\r\\nCalcium compounds were known for millennia, although their chemical makeup was not understood until the 17th century.[29] Lime as a building material[30] and as plaster for statues was used as far back as around 7000?BC.[31] The first dated lime kiln dates back to 2500?BC and was found in Khafajah, Mesopotamia.[32][33] At about the same time, dehydrated gypsum (CaSO4{2H2O) was being used in the Great Pyramid of Giza; this material would later be used for the plaster in the tomb of Tutankhamun. The climate of present-day Italy being warmer than that of Egypt, the ancient Romans instead used lime mortars made by heating limestone (CaCO3); the name \\"calcium\\" itself derives from the Latin word calx \\"lime\\".[29] Vitruvius noted that the lime that resulted was lighter than the original limestone, attributing this to the boiling of the water; in 1755, Joseph Black proved that this was due to the loss of carbon dioxide, which as a gas had not been recognised by the ancient Romans.[34]\\r\\nIn 1787, Antoine Lavoisier suspected that lime might be an oxide of a fundamental chemical element. In his table of the elements, Lavoisier listed five \\"salifiable earths\\" (i.e., ores that could be made to react with acids to produce salts (salis = salt, in Latin): chaux (calcium oxide), magnsie (magnesia, magnesium oxide), baryte (barium sulfate), alumine (alumina, aluminium oxide), and silice (silica, silicon dioxide). About these \\"elements\\", Lavoisier speculated:\\r\\nWe are probably only acquainted as yet with a part of the metallic substances existing in nature, as all those which have a stronger affinity to oxygen than carbon possesses, are incapable, hitherto, of being reduced to a metallic state, and consequently, being only presented to our observation under the form of oxyds, are confounded with earths. It is extremely probable that barytes, which we have just now arranged with earths, is in this situation; for in many experiments it exhibits properties nearly approaching to those of metallic bodies. It is even possible that all the substances we call earths may be only metallic oxyds, irreducible by any hitherto known process.[35]\\r\\nCalcium, along with its congeners magnesium, strontium, and barium, was first isolated by Humphry Davy in 1808. Following the work of J?ns Jakob Berzelius and Magnus Martin af Pontin on electrolysis, Davy isolated calcium and magnesium by putting a mixture of the respective metal oxides with mercury(II) oxide on a platinum plate which was used as the anode, the cathode being a platinum wire partially submerged into mercury. Electrolysis then gave calciumÿmercury and magnesiumÿmercury amalgams, and distilling off the mercury gave the metal.[29][36] However, pure calcium cannot be prepared in bulk by this method and a workable commercial process for its production was not found until over a century later.[34]\\r\\nAt 3%, calcium is the fifth most abundant element in the Earth's crust, and the third most abundant metal behind aluminium and iron.[29] It is also the fourth most abundant element in the lunar highlands.[11] Sedimentary calcium carbonate deposits pervade the Earth's surface as fossilised remains of past marine life; they occur in two forms, the rhombohedral calcite (more common) and the orthorhombic aragonite (forming in more temperate seas). Minerals of the first type include limestone, dolomite, marble, chalk, and iceland spar; aragonite beds make up the Bahamas, the Florida Keys, and the Red Sea basins. Corals, sea shells, and pearls are mostly made up of calcium carbonate. Among the other important minerals of calcium are gypsum (CaSO4{2H2O), anhydrite (CaSO4), fluorite (CaF2), and apatite ([Ca5(PO4)3F]).[29]\\r\\nThe major producers of calcium are China (about 10000 to 12000 tonnes per year), Russia (about 6000 to 8000 tonnes per year), and the United States (about 2000 to 4000 tonnes per year). Canada and France are also among the minor producers. In 2005, about 24000 tonnes of calcium were produced; about half of the world's extracted calcium is used by the United States, with about 80% of the output used each year.[9] In Russia and China, Davy's method of electrolysis is still used, but is instead applied to molten calcium chloride.[9] Since calcium is less reactive than strontium or barium, the oxideÿnitride coating that results in air is stable and lathe machining and other standard metallurgical techniques are suitable for calcium.[37] In the United States and Canada, calcium is instead produced by reducing lime with aluminium metal at high temperatures.[9]\\r\\nCalcium provides a link between tectonics, climate, and the carbon cycle. In the simplest terms, uplift of mountains exposes calcium-bearing rocks to chemical weathering and releases Ca2+ into surface water. These ions are transported to the ocean where they react with dissolved CO2 to form limestone, which in turn settles to the sea floor where it is incorporated into new rocks. Dissolved CO2, along with carbonate and bicarbonate ions, are termed \\"dissolved inorganic carbon\\" (DIC).[38]\\r\\nThe actual reaction is more complicated and involves the bicarbonate ion (HCO?\\r\\n3) that forms when CO2 reacts with water at seawater pH:\\r\\nAt seawater pH, most of the CO2 is immediately converted back into HCO?\\r\\n3. The reaction results in a net transport of one molecule of CO2 from the ocean/atmosphere into the lithosphere.[39] The result is that each Ca2+ ion released by chemical weathering ultimately removes one CO2 molecule from the surficial system (atmosphere, ocean, soils and living organisms), storing it in carbonate rocks where it is likely to stay for hundreds of millions of years. The weathering of calcium from rocks thus scrubs CO2 from the ocean and atmosphere, exerting a strong long-term effect on climate.[38]\\r\\nThe largest use of calcium is in steelmaking, due to its strong chemical affinity for oxygen and sulfur. Its oxides and sulfides, once formed, give liquid lime aluminate and sulfide inclusions in steel which float out; on treatment, these inclusions disperse throughout the steel and became small and spherical, improving castability, cleanliness and general mechanical properties. Calcium is also used in maintenance-free automotive batteries, in which the use of 0.1% calciumÿlead alloys instead of the usual antimonyÿlead alloys leads to lower water loss and lower self-discharging. Due to the risk of expansion and cracking, aluminium is sometimes also incorporated into these alloys. These leadÿcalcium alloys are also used in casting, replacing leadÿantimony alloys.[40] Calcium is also used to strengthen aluminium alloys used for bearings, for the control of graphitic carbon in cast iron, and to remove bismuth impurities from lead.[37] Calcium metal is found in some drain cleaners, where it functions to generate heat and calcium hydroxide that saponifies the fats and liquefies the proteins (for example, those in hair) that block drains.[41] Besides metallurgy, the reactivity of calcium is exploited to remove nitrogen from high-purity argon gas and as a getter for oxygen and nitrogen. It is also used as a reducing agent in the production of chromium, zirconium, thorium, and uranium. It can also be used to store hydrogen gas, as it reacts with hydrogen to form solid calcium hydride, from which the hydrogen can easily be re-extracted.[37]\\r\\nCalcium isotope fractionation during mineral formation has led to several applications of calcium isotopes. In particular, the 1997 observation by Skulan and DePaolo[42] that calcium minerals are isotopically lighter than the solutions from which the minerals precipitate is the basis of analogous applications in medicine and in paleooceanography. In animals with skeletons mineralized with calcium, the calcium isotopic composition of soft tissues reflects the relative rate of formation and dissolution of skeletal mineral. In humans, changes in the calcium isotopic composition of urine have been shown to be related to changes in bone mineral balance. When the rate of bone formation exceeds the rate of bone resorption, the 44Ca/40Ca ratio in soft tissue rises and vice versa. Because of this relationship, calcium isotopic measurements of urine or blood may be useful in the early detection of metabolic bone diseases like osteoporosis.[43] A similar system exists in seawater, where 44Ca/40Ca tends to rise when the rate of removal of Ca2+ by mineral precipitation exceeds the input of new calcium into the ocean. In 1997 Skulan and DePaolo presented the first evidence of change in seawater 44Ca/40Ca over geologic time, along with a theoretical explanation of these changes. More recent papers have confirmed this observation, demonstrating that seawater Ca2+ concentration is not constant, and that the ocean is never in a \\"steady state\\" with respect to calcium input and output. This has important climatological implications, as the marine calcium cycle is closely tied to the carbon cycle.[44][45]\\r\\nMany calcium compounds are used in food, as pharmaceuticals, and in medicine, among others. For example, calcium and phosphorus are supplemented in foods through the addition of calcium lactate, calcium diphosphate, and tricalcium phosphate. The last is also used as a polishing agent in toothpaste and in antacids. Calcium lactobionate is a white powder that is used as a suspending agent for pharmaceuticals. In baking, calcium monophosphate is used as a leavening agent. Calcium sulfite is used as a bleach in papermaking and as a disinfectant, calcium silicate is used as a reinforcing agent in rubber, and calcium acetate is a component of liming rosin and is used to make metallic soaps and synthetic resins.[40]\\r\\nCalcium is an essential element needed in large quantities. The Ca2+ ion acts as an electrolyte and is vital to the health of the muscular, circulatory, and digestive systems; is indispensable to the building of bone; and supports synthesis and function of blood cells. For example, it regulates the contraction of muscles, nerve conduction, and the clotting of blood. As a result, intra- and extracellular calcium levels are tightly regulated by the body. Calcium can play this role because the Ca2+ ion forms stable coordination complexes with many organic compounds, especially proteins; it also forms compounds with a wide range of solubilities, enabling the formation of skeletons.[47]\\r\\nCalcium ions may be complexed by proteins through binding the carboxyl groups of glutamic acid or aspartic acid residues; through interacting with phosphorylated serine, tyrosine, or threonine residues; or by being chelated by -carboxylated amino acid residues. Trypsin, a digestive enzyme, uses the first method; osteocalcin, a bone matrix protein, uses the third. Some other bone matrix proteins such as osteopontin and bone sialoprotein use both the first and the second. Direct activation of enzymes by binding calcium is common; some other enzymes are activated by noncovalent association with direct calcium-binding enzymes. Calcium also binds to the phospholipid layer of the cell membrane, anchoring proteins associated with the cell surface.[47] As an example of the wide range of solubility of calcium compounds, monocalcium phosphate is very soluble in water, 85% of extracellular calcium is as dicalcium phosphate with a solubility of 2.0?mM and the hydroxyapatite of bones in an organic matrix is tricalcium phosphate at 100?M.[47]\\r\\nAbout three-quarters of dietary calcium is from dairy products and grains, the rest being accounted for by vegetables, protein-rich foods, fruits, sugar, fats, and oil. Calcium supplementation is controversial, as the bioavailability of calcium is strongly dependent on the solubility of the salt involved: calcium citrate, malate, and lactate are highly bioavailable while the oxalate is much less so. The intestine absorbs about one-third of calcium eaten as the free ion, and plasma calcium level is then regulated by the kidneys. Parathyroid hormone and vitamin D promote the formation of bone by allowing and enhancing the deposition of calcium ions there, allowing rapid bone turnover without affecting bone mass or mineral content. When plasma calcium levels fall, cell surface receptors are activated and the secretion of parathyroid hormone occurs; it then proceeds to stimulate the entry of calcium into the plasma pool by taking it from targeted kidney, gut, and bone cells, with the bone-forming action of parathyroid hormone being antagonised by calcitonin, whose secretion increases with increasing plasma calcium levels.[47]\\r\\nExcess intake of calcium may cause hypercalcaemia, but because of the inefficient absorption of calcium by the intestines a more likely cause is excessive vitamin D intake or excessive secretion of parathyroid hormone. It can also occur due to the bone destruction that occurs when tumours metastasise to bone. This results in deposition of calcium salts into the heart, the blood vessels, and the kidneys. Symptoms include anorexia, nausea, vomiting, memory loss, confusion, muscle weakness, increased urination, dehydration, and metabolic bone disease. Chronic hypercalcaemia may lead to soft tissue calcification, which can lead to serious consequences: for example, calcification of the vascular wall can lead to a loss of elasticity and the disruption of laminar blood flow, and thence to plaque rupture and thrombosis. Likewise, inadequate calcium or vitamin D intake results in hypocalcaemia, often caused by inadequate secretion of parathyroid hormone or defective receptors to it in cells. Symptoms include neuromuscular excitability, potentially causing tetany and defects in cardiac conduction.[47]\\r\\nAs calcium is heavily involved in bone manufacture, many bone diseases can be traced to problems with the organic matrix or the hydroxyapatite in molecular structure or organisation. For example, osteoporosis is a reduction in mineral content of bone per unit volume, and can be treated by supplementation of calcium, vitamin D, and biphosphates. Calcium supplements may benefit the serum lipids in women who have passed menopause as well as older men; in post-menopausal women calcium supplementation also appears to be inversely correlated with cardiovascular disease. Inadequate amounts of calcium, vitamin D, or phosphates can lead to the softening of bones, known as osteomalacia.[47]\\r\\nBecause calcium reacts exothermically with water and acids, contact of calcium metal with bodily moisture results in severe corrosive irritation.[48] When swallowed, calcium metal has the same effect on the mouth, oesophagus, and stomach, and can be fatal.[41] However, long-term exposure is not known to have distinct adverse effects.[48]\\r\\nBecause of concerns of long-term adverse side effects such as calcification of arteries and kidney stones, the U.S. Institute of Medicine (IOM) and the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) both set Tolerable Upper Intake Levels (ULs) for the combination of dietary and supplemental calcium. From the IOM, people ages 9-18 years are not supposed to exceed 3,000 mg/day; for ages 19-50 not to exceed 2,500 mg/day; for ages 51 and older, not to exceed 2,000 mg/day.[49] The EFSA set UL at 2,500 mg/day for adults but decided the information for children and adolescents was not sufficient to determine ULs.[50]","input":"How abundant is calcium in the earth's crust?"},{"output":"212,000","context":"","input":"How many farms are there in the uk?"},{"output":"June 1860","context":"The \\"Afghans\\" or \\"Ghans\\" were camel caravanners who worked in Outback Australia from the 1860s to the 1930s.

After their use was superseded by modern transport, some cameleers released their camels into the wild, and a large population of feral camels remains from this time. From 1850-1900, Afghani camel handlers played an important part in opening up Central Australia, helping in building of telegraph and railway lines. They also helped the growth of Muslims in Australia before 1850.\\r\\nEven though the Afghans' help was greatly appreciated they were also subject to discrimination because of their religion and appearance, and because of the competition they provided to European bullock teamsters.[2] Many of those European competitors were also cameleers and in 1903 a European camel train proprietor of Wilcannia replaced all of his Afghan camel drivers with Europeans.[4]\\r\\nThe passenger train which travels between Adelaide and Darwin is known as \\"The Ghan\\" (formerly The Afghan Express) as a reference to the service the Afghans provided to the areas through which the train travels.[5] The total number of Afghans to settle in Australia was approximately 3,000, with over 2,000 arriving between 1870 and 1900.[2]\\r\\nAt Marree, an important junction of the camel trade, the Afghan cameleers built the earliest mosque in Australia in 1861,[2] but this subsequently fell into disuse and was demolished.

To implement her idea, Hedgeman began recruiting interested classmates during the summer of 1907.[13]\\r\\nEventually, nine women including Hedgeman were instrumental in organizing Alpha Kappa Alpha in the fall of 1907.[11][13] With Hedgeman serving as the temporary chairperson,[12] the women wrote the sorority's constitution, devised the motto, chose the favorite colors, and named the sorority Alpha Kappa Alpha.[11] Later in 1908, seven sophomore honor students expressed interest in joining and were accepted without initiation.[11][14] The first initiation was held in a wing of Miner Hall on Howard University on February 11, 1909.[15][16] On May 25, 1909, Alpha Kappa Alpha held its first \\"Ivy Week,\\" a celebration that included planting ivy at Miner Hall.[17]\\r\\nAlpha Kappa Alpha continued to grow at Howard. By the end of the 1911ÿ12 school year, there were more than twenty members of the sorority and the organization had become an influential part of student life at Howard.[18] Following the annual celebration \\"Ivy Day\\" on Howard campus in Spring 1912, founder and former Basileus Nellie Quander learned that several other newly initiated members of the sorority planned to change the colors, letters, and constitution of the sorority, and to make it more active outside Howard University. On January 13, 1913, the entire twenty-two-member undergraduate chapter voted to transform the original Alpha Kappa Alpha into Delta Sigma Theta. Quander actively worked to maintain the integrity and tenets of Alpha Kappa Alpha. She, along with the women who had become ʽʽs during the four years of the sorority's existence who had since graduated, elected to remain Alpha Kappa Alpha. Quander set up a three-person committee that successfully petitioned to incorporate ʽʽ as a perpetual entity. Alpha Kappa Alpha was nationally incorporated on January 29, 1913.[19]\\r\\nAlpha Kappa Alpha continued to grow nationally. A second chapter at the University of Chicago was chartered in fall 1913.[21] In addition, Alpha Kappa Alpha helped to support members by providing scholarship funds for school and foreign studies.[22]\\r\\nAlpha Kappa Alpha began to unite members at the annual Boul, the sorority's governing body.[2] The sorority's pledge was written by Grace Edwards and was adopted by the 1920 Boul.[1] In addition, the sorority's crest was designed by Phyllis Wheatley Waters and accepted in the same Boul.[1] A year later, at the 1921 Boul, the Ivy Leaf was designated as \\"the official organ of Alpha Kappa Alpha,\\" and Founders' Week, paying honor to ?K?'s founders was established.[1][23] Pearls were first introduced to the sorority in the same year.[1] The sorority membership pin was accepted in the following Boul in Kansas City, Missouri.[24] At the 1947 Boul, pins for honorary members were designed and approved.[25]\\r\\nOn May 10, 1930, Alpha Kappa Alpha, along with the fraternities Kappa Alpha Psi and Omega Psi Phi and sororities Delta Sigma Theta and Zeta Phi Beta, formed the National Pan-Hellenic Council (NPHC) at Howard University.[26] Currently consisting of nine predominately black fraternities and sororities, NPHC promotes interaction through forums, meetings, and other mediums for the exchange of information, and engages in cooperative programming and initiatives through various activities and functions.[26]\\r\\nThroughout the Great Migration, members assisted the Travelers Aid Society, to help thousands of Southern Blacks adjust to Northern society, find housing and navigate around the city. They also volunteered at the Freedman's Hospital.[23]\\r\\nIn April 1933, during the Great Depression, International President Ida Jackson visited All Saints Industrial School in Lexington, Mississippi. She found difficult conditions in the Mississippi Delta. Some of the teachers did not have an education past the seventh grade. African Americans were trying to make a living sharecropping on plantation land as agricultural prices continued to fall.[27][28] In summer 1934, Ida Jackson initiated the Summer School for Rural Teachers to train future teachers. She worked with a total of 22 student teachers and 243 school children. In addition, she held night classes for 48 adults.[29] By obtaining 2600 books for the school's library, Jackson made it \\"the largest library owned by white or colored in all Holmes County.\\"[29]\\r\\nIn summer 1938, Ida Jackson focused on poverty and established a regional health clinic. She had acquired $1,000 from the Boul to fund the project in December 1935.[30] The clinic evolved into the Mississippi Health Project, with Dr. Dorothy Boulding Ferebee appointed as the director.[30]\\r\\nThe Mississippi Health Project brought primary medical care to the rural Black population across the state for six summers.[31][32] The program has been recognized as the first mobile health clinic in the United States, assisting approximately 15,000 people in the Mississippi Delta.[33] The project was noted for helping to decrease cases diphtheria and smallpox in the region and to improve nutritional and dental practices throughout rural Mississippi.[34][35]\\r\\nLed by incorporator Norma Elizabeth Boyd, the sorority created the National Non-Partisan Lobby on Civil and Democratic Rights (NPC) in 1938, later renamed the National Non-Partisan Council on Public Affairs. It was the first full-time congressional lobby for minority group civil rights.[36][37] Throughout the organization's life, the Non-Partisan Council worked with the NAACP, National Urban League, The United Office and Professional Workers of America, The National Association of Graduate Nurses, the American Federation of Churches, the Colored Women's Club, the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters and Auxiliary, and the New York Voter's League.[38] The NPC was dissolved on July 15, 1948, by twelfth Supreme Basileus Edna Over Gray-Campbell.[37][37] A year later, Alpha Kappa Alpha was the first sorority to apply for life membership in the NAACP.[39]\\r\\nTo replace the NPC, in August 1945, Alpha Kappa Alpha established the American Council on Human Rights (ACHR). The council made recommendations to the government concerning civil rights legislation.[40] The ACHR was proposed at the 1946 Boul.[40] In October 1946, Alpha Kappa Alpha was the first sorority to obtain observer status at the United Nations.[41] On January 25, 1948, Delta Sigma Theta, Zeta Phi Beta, Sigma Gamma Rho sororities and Alpha Phi Alpha and Phi Beta Sigma fraternities were charter members of the ACHR.[42] Kappa Alpha Psi later was included in March 1949.[43][44]\\r\\nOn September 1, 1945, Alpha Kappa Alpha established The National Health Office in New York City.[33] The National Health Office coordinated activities with local chapters and worked with the ACHC to promote health initiatives before Congress, increase the number of student nurses, and improve the state of health programs at historically Black Colleges and Universities.[45] The National Health Office was dissolved in 1951, as its goals were incorporated into the sorority's international program.[46]\\r\\nThroughout the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s, members helped to sponsor job training, reading enrichment, heritage and youth programs. By encouraging youth to improve math, science, and reading skills, the sorority continued a legacy of community service and pledged to enrich the lives of others. Financially, Alpha Kappa Alpha expanded funding for projects in 1953 through the creation and trademark of a fashion show called Fashionetta.[25][47] Politically, ACHR continued lobbying for equality concerning civil rights during the 1950s and 1960s. According to Collier-Thomas, the ACHR drew attention to legislation concerning education, transportation, employment, and improving equality in the armed forces and public places.[48] The ACHR participated in filing civil rights cases in amicus curiae with Bolling v. Sharpe and 1954's Brown v. Board of Education.[49] However, as a whole, ACHR voted to dissolve operations in 1963.[49]\\r\\nAlpha Kappa Alpha contributed programs for inner city youth by capitalizing on political gains in the White House. On August 20, 1964, President Lyndon Johnson signed the Economic Opportunity Act, which allowed the creation of the Job Corps.[50] The sorority wanted to operate a job training center for students. Led by president Julia Purnell, ?K? negotiated with the Office of Economic Opportunity to operate a women's center from October 1964 to January 1965.[50] Alpha Kappa Alpha was awarded a US$4 million grant to operate the Cleveland Job Corps on February 12, 1965, becoming the first sorority to operate a federal job training center.[32][50] Beginning in 1965, the Cleveland Job Corps trained female high school dropouts, aged 16 to 21, with job and educational skills. In 1976, the Cleveland Job Corps accepted males.[32] The sorority operated the Cleveland Job Corps until 1995.[51]\\r\\nThe sorority educated the community through highlighting the accomplishments of notable individuals by publishing The Heritage Series between 1968 and 1972.[16] These pamphlets were a series of biographies of top African-American women. Altogether, the entire collection contained \\"Women in the Judiciary,\\" \\"Women in Politics,\\" \\"Women in Medicine,\\" \\"Women in Business,\\" and \\"Women in Dentistry.\\"[52] Alpha Kappa Alpha also donated $20,000 for preserving Martin Luther King, Jr.'s birthplace in Atlanta, Georgia, in the early 1970s.[53] In 1978, during the sorority's seventieth anniversary, the Memorial Window at Howard University was dedicated to the founders of Alpha Kappa Alpha. Surviving founders Lavinia Norman and Norma Boyd attended the celebration of unveiling the Memorial Window, designed by Lois Mailou Jones.[54]\\r\\nSoon after the sorority's 75th anniversary, Alpha Kappa Alpha contributed funds to decrease Africa's poverty with the establishment of African Village Development Program (AVDP).[55] As a conjoint program with Africare, the sorority sought to decrease poverty in African villages.[32][55] In collaboration with the International Foundation for Education and Self-Help (IFESH), the sorority built ten schools in South Africa after apartheid ended, and it donated computer technology to the region.[32][56]\\r\\nThroughout the 1990s, the sorority continued to provide after-school mentoring programs, such as ON TRACK.[32] ON TRACK, an acronym which stands for \\"Organizing, Nurturing, Team building, Respecting, Achieving, Counseling and Knowing,\\" was designed to help the progress of 20,000 third graders who were at-risk of failing their education.[57] Sponsored by Daimler Chrysler, ON TRACK was designated to \\"improve communication, academics, physical and emotional health, peer leadership, etiquette, and interpersonal relationships.\\"[32][57] In addition, programs such as the Ivy Reading AKAdemy and Young Authors Program improved elementary reading comprehension skills, while P.I.M.S. highlighted programs in math and science.[32]\\r\\nThe sorority responded to the call for help in fall 2005 after Hurricane Katrina, by raising money for a disaster relief fund.[55] In July 2007, through Habitat for Humanity, the sorority helped build a house in New Orleans for a family that survived Hurricane Katrina.[60]\\r\\nIn addition to educational programs, Alpha Kappa Alpha contributed to drawing awareness to health-related issues, such as AIDS, sickle cell anemia, breast cancer, and the importance of staying in shape.[55][61][62] Recently, the sorority has supported the efforts of justice for the Jena Six.[63] Also, the sorority connects to the past by partnering with African Ancestry.[64] Sorority members may use African Ancestry's DNA testing to find genealogical data for themselves and their families. The purpose of the partnership is to help members trace family connections through the world as well as in Africa, to embrace African-American culture and the larger community.[65]\\r\\nAlpha Kappa Alpha celebrated its centenary with a year-long commemoration in 2008. The celebration coincided with the sorority's biennial Boul.[66] Internationally, some Alpha Kappa Alpha members began marking the festivities by making a pilgrimage to Howard University from January 12 to January 15, 2008.[66][67] The activities included sorority members financially donating $1 million in scholarship funds to Howard University,[68] contributing libraries for Middle School for Mathematics and Science and Asbury Dwelling for Senior Citizens, and unveiling a digital version of the entire Ivy Leaf publication.[69] In addition, sorority undergraduate and graduate members who were not available to attend ceremonies in Washington, D.C., held celebrations in local cities.[70][71] On July 11 to July 18, 2008, Alpha Kappa Alpha held their 63rd Boul. A town hall meeting with the public, a unity march in conjunction with other NPHC members, and a concert featuring R&B Grammy Award winning singer Patti LaBelle were some of the events which occurred at the centennial Boul.[72] On July 17, 2008, Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority set a Guinness World Record when 16,206 members set a record by having the largest-ever silver service sit-down dinner in a convention.[73]\\r\\nAlpha Kappa Alpha's accomplishments were heralded by the United States Congress, with U.S. Senator Hillary Clinton and sorority member U.S. Representative Sheila Jackson-Lee, who both agreed to pass legislation in both houses of the United States Congress to commemorate the sorority's founding.[74] In addition, the toy company Mattel designed a Barbie collectible doll fashioned with a pink and green evening gown.[75][76]\\r\\nOn June 20, 2009, eight Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority members filed a complaint in D.C. Superior Court demanding that International President Barbara McKinzie be fired for improper use of sorority funds and the money be returned to the sorority.[77] The lawsuit claimed that Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Incorporated's Executive Board approved the spending of substantial amounts on McKinzie's costs of living, including commissioning an expensive wax model of McKinzie, which cost $900,000. In response, McKinzie denied the allegations, describing them as \\"without merit.\\" The memberships of the eight AKAs who filed the complaint were revoked by the sorority in retaliation for the lawsuit but later forced to be reinstated by a judge.[78][79][80][81]\\r\\nIn February 2010, the Superior Court of the District of Columbia dismissed the lawsuit.[82][83] On August 18, 2011, the District of Columbia Court of Appeals reversed the previous decision.[84][85]\\r\\nOn March 22, 2012, a forensic audit of Alpha Kappa Alpha's 2010 financial records revealed troubling concerns with past president, Barbara McKinzie's development and access to a \\"secret\\" bank account. The audit of the sorority led to findings that supported the claims in the previous lawsuit. The audit also found two former officials continued to use sorority credit cards after their service ended, failing to appropriately document charges. Another lawsuit against the organization, the former president McKinzie and other officials contained similar allegations. The audit found that McKinzie and the other officials secretly created a second set of financial books to get around the sorority's accounting policies. According to the audit, \\"(n)early $1.7 million in payments were made to the former president, Barbara McKinzie, without authorization. Approximately $282,000 in credit card charges on a second set of books appear to be fraudulent, including personal charges the sorority wasn't reimbursed for.\\"[86] The sorority later expelled McKinzie[87] and won an arbitration award of $ 1.6 million against her, which (as of January 2017) was challenged by McKinzie in court.[88]\\r\\nAlso the sorority's tax returns were audited by the Internal Revenue Service. As of December 2010[update] the audit was expected to be concluded sometime in January 2012.[86]\\r\\nOn September 9, 2002, pledges Kristin High (22 years old mother of one) and Kenitha Saafir (24 years old) from California State University ÿ Los Angeles (CSULA), were pronounced dead as a result of an illegal and dangerous pledging ritual. The women were instructed by members of Alpha Kappa Alpha to perform a series of activities blindfolded on Dockweiler State Beach when a high tide came and eventually drowned both of them. The next day when sorority members brought Kristin's car and cellphone to her mother, she noticed Kristin's pledge journal always kept in her car suddenly missing and numbers deleted from her cellphone. Prior to Kristin's death, Kristin's mother encouraged her to fully disassociate herself from the sorority after Kristin discussed unsisterly behavior displayed by members of AKA such as disrespecting pledges and forcing them to run late night errands for AKA members. A year after the tragic incident, the families of the deceased settled with Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority Incorporated after filing a $100 million wrongful death lawsuit. The sorority initially denied having an active chapter at CSULA in an effort to deny responsibility for the deaths but evidence and sworn testimonies proved otherwise so the court dismissed their claim and held the whole sorority accountable.[89]\\r\\nTwo Howard University seniors filed a lawsuit against Alpha Kappa Alpha Incorporated in 2013. The women accused the sorority of barring them from membership through the most prestigious chapter of the sorority, Alpha Chapter, despite being \\"legacies\\" (their mothers are Alpha Chapter initiates) and in retaliation for exposing illegal hazing. The mothers initially had their AKA memberships revoked for supporting their daughters in the litigation process against the sorority, months later a judge reinstated their memberships citing that it was illegal for AKA to revoke their paid memberships for simply filing a lawsuit against their own sorority. In the lawsuit, the two students stated as prospective members of the Alpha Chapter they were verbally abused by women of the sorority, could not wear sorority colors or any colors that could be blended into pink or green, they could not wear pearls, they were forced to run errands and buy items for sorority members, they could not publicly socialize with their non-AKA affiliated friends, they were often humiliated in front of other students, they could not eat at a popular lunch spot on campus, they could not use the same doors as sorority members, and at one point they had to call their designated \\"big sisters\\" daily or suffer some type of consequence. The women were denied their only opportunity to join the Alpha Chapter before they graduated because the chapter was suspended from bringing in new members following an investigation of hazing allegations their previous eligible years.[90]In 2015, a federal judge denied the plaintiffs' request for equitable remedies and dismissed the lawsuit.[91]\\r\\nAlpha Kappa Alpha reports a membership of over 283,000 women internationally. The sorority has over 65,000 active members with many different backgrounds and professions.[3] Graduate members constitute the largest percentage of membership.[6] Alpha Kappa Alpha has 992 chapters, located in the United States, the Caribbean, Canada, and South Africa.[92]\\r\\nThe term soror, derived from the Latin for \\"sister\\",[93] is used between members of the sorority. Membership of the Directorate includes the Board of Directors. For graduate chapters, \\"Omega\\" is added to distinguish those which consist of college graduates from undergraduate chapters. \\"Supreme,\\" as a term, is preposed to the title of an international officeholder, such as Supreme Basileus.[2] Deceased members are referred to as \\"Ivies Beyond the Wall\\".[2]\\r\\nHonorary membership[94] is Alpha Kappa Alpha's highest honor.[6] For example, Jane Addams, winner of the Nobel Peace Prize, is among the first honorary members.[95] Eleanor Roosevelt, a former First Lady and wife of President Franklin D. Roosevelt, was made an honorary member. United States Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, former Senator and First Lady, and wife of President Bill Clinton, accepted honorary membership into Alpha Kappa Alpha.[96] However, Clinton later declined initiation into the organization due to the sorority's exclusive requirement preventing acceptance into other Pan-Hellenic organizations, and desired her membership in Alpha Kappa Alpha to be \\"non-exclusive.\\"[96][97]\\r\\nThe Ivy Leaf Pledge Club was the official pledge club of Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Incorporated.[98] Potential candidates who were interested in joining the sorority would join the pledge club before being inducted into the sorority.[99]\\r\\nIn Our Kind of People: Inside America's Upper Class, Lawrence Otis Graham tells of his aunt's experience in joining the Ivy Pledge Club:\\r\\nIn addition, according to Graham, the sorority would have \\"Pledge Week\\", a period where a candidate's grades and behavior were reviewed by chapter members. Candidates who withstood this period were initiated into the sorority.[100] Membership interest is processed by an interest meeting, known as a \\"rush\\". After the candidate receives an official letter from the sorority, she can participate in the membership intake process. Prospective members must have a C+ average or better prior to their membership submission, as well as a record of community service. If a prospective member has graduated, that member could be invited to join the sorority at the discretion of the graduate chapter.[101]\\r\\nThe leadership of the sorority in the early years was derived from three separate groupsthe original group, the sophomores and the incorporators, who together were known as \\"The Twenty Pearls.\\"[2][102] The Executive Director position has been held by eight members since the office's creation on October 9, 1949.[103]\\r\\nOriginal group of 1908:\\r\\nSophomores of 1910:[14]\\r\\nIncorporators of 1913:[104]\\r\\nExecutive Directors:[105]\\r\\nListed below are the twenty-nine International Presidents since the 1913 institution of the office.[106]\\r\\nThe Boul[A] is the regulating institution of the sorority and currently meets every two years.[2] Throughout the years, notable individuals such as civil rights activists Martin Luther King, Jr. and Roy Wilkins were speakers at past Boul conferences.[16]\\r\\nAfter the establishment of 32 graduate and undergraduate chapters in 1924, Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority organized chapters according to their regions in the United States and abroad. The Boul determines the boundaries of the regions.[110] The ten regions are each led by a regional director, where she serves a member of the sorority's Board of Directors. In addition to serving on the sorority's Board of Directors, the regional director also follows guidelines, program targets set by the International President, as well as procedures.[110] Almost two-thirds of the sorority's regional directors have been elected international presidents.[110] A comprehensive list of regions is shown below:\\r\\nAlpha Kappa Alpha's Educational Advancement Foundation (EAF) is a separate and tax-exempt branch of the sorority, which \\"provide[s] financial support to individuals and organizations engaged in lifelong learning.\\"[111] The foundation awards academic scholarships (for undergraduate members of the sorority, as well as non-members), fellowships, and grants for community service.[112]\\r\\nThe foundation was the brainchild of Constance Holland, the sister of former Alpha Kappa Alpha International President Dr. Barbara Phillips, in 1978. The foundation had official beginnings in 1980 and the sorority donated US$10,000 for the project. Eight years later, the organization first awarded $10,000 to fourteen students. In 1991, EAF first awarded mini-grants to community organizations. In 1998, EAF provided the first Youth Partners Accessing Capital (PAC) award to an undergraduate member.\\r\\nAt the organization's twentieth anniversary in 2000, EAF published Perpetuating Our Posterity: A Blueprint for Excellence. The book served as a comprehensive history of the organization and as a source of advice for other beginning philanthropies. EAF went online with a website in 2003.\\r\\nThe organization celebrated a silver anniversary in Nassau, Bahamas, in 2005. EAF is incorporated into International President Barbara A. McKinzie's centennial program for funding under Excellent Scholarly Performance. Overall, EAF has donated more than $200,000 in grants and awarded 1,400 students with scholarships.[113] Other major donors to EAF include Continental Airlines and Northern Trust.[114]\\r\\nIvy Acres will be a retirement center located in Winston-Salem, North Carolina. The retirement center is sponsored by Senior Residences, Incorporated, a subsidiary of Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority.[119] Ivy Acres will be one of the first retirement centers founded by African-Americans and minorities in the United States. It will offer assisted or individual living for individuals who are over fifty-five, regardless of background, ethnicity or religion.[119][120] Barbara K. Phillips, former Vice-President and Project Coordinator for Senior Residences, Incorporated, explains the purpose of Ivy Acres, \\"We determined that there is a need out there, but this will be open to all. We want to be diverse, we want to be multicultural. Anyone who wants to come will be welcome.\\"[119]\\r\\nThe gated community will be located on a 48-acre (190,000?m2) site. The planning for Ivy Acres cost approximately $32 million USD.[119] In addition, according to Business Wire, Ivy Acres will comprise \\"188 independent residential units, which will be both apartments and cottages, forty assisted-living apartments and twenty private accommodations for skilled nursing care.\\"[119] Residents are expected to pay $1,890 to $2,890 per month for services.[119]\\r\\nThe Ivy Reading AKAdemy provides programs that encourage the entire community to become involved. The concept serves as an educational and human resource center for programs provided by Alpha Kappa Alpha. Working with No Child Left Behind in mind, \\"The Ivy Reading AKAdemy,\\" a reading initiative, focuses on early learning and mastery of basic reading skills by the end of third grade. The Ivy Reading AKAdemy has a $1.5 million proposal pending with the United States Department of Education to fund a three-year nationwide after-school demonstration project in low-performing, economically deprived inner city schools in 16 sites within the continental United States.[32]\\r\\nThe Leadership Fellows Program is a fully funded event in which thirty Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority sophomore and junior undergraduate members worldwide are individually trained for professional leadership roles. In addition, the fellows contribute to community service for one week. One of the selection criteria is that members must have at least a 3.0 GPA.[121] The program initially was planned in 1978. In the following year, the first program was held in Indiana with twenty-nine students.[32] Various cities around the United States have held the Leadership Fellows Program. In the past, Alpha Kappa Alpha has sponsored the event through the Educational Advancement Foundation. Also, the program has been financed by Pillsbury, Tyson Foods, Johnson & Johnson, and most recently General Electric.[122][123][124]\\r\\nPartnerships in Mathematics and Science (PIMS) began in Eva Evans's administration in 1994, and was a part of the SPIRIT program during the Linda White administration.[125] Eva Evans mentioned the need for a math and science program, \\"As a college sorority, we've always advanced an educational agenda. We always had high GPA requirements. And more than ever, we're pushing the importance of math and science for our girls. We need more black women in those fields.\\"[126] The program's purpose is to increase the successes of youth in mathematics and science, as well as technology. Campaigns to highlight the program's importance were sponsored by the National Science Foundation and historically black colleges from across the country.[125] Several chapters provided two-week math and science summer camps on college and day school campuses, which consisted of hands-on-learning through laboratory interactions, field trips to important sites, youth camps, and speeches from influential experts in specific areas of studies.[32][57] For example, a PIMS program at Park Street Elementary School in Marietta, Georgia, consisted of third through fifth grade girls and provided educational field trips in order to stimulate involvement in math and science.[115][127] Also, a national P.I.M.S. Olympiad, deriving from knowledge of math and science, in conjunction with the PIMS Community Parade was held at the 58th Boul in Dallas, Texas.[32][57]\\r\\nIn Linda White's administrations, the Young Authors Program was born. The purpose of the program is to encourage and raise involvement in reading and writing in kindergarten through third grade school children. Each of the ten regions in the sorority had the opportunity to choose a child's story to be published in a two volume anthology entitled, The Spirit Within: Voices of Young Authors.[32] In 2004, twenty children were honored in the first anthology.[128] The authors were recognized and performed book signings in the 2004 and 2006 Bouls.[32] At the 2004 Boul in Nashville, Tennessee, former Department of Education Secretary Rod Paige attended. On July 15, 2004, First Lady Laura Bush spoke on the Ivy AKAdemy's dedication to reading initiatives, \\"Teaching our children to read is the most critical educational priority facing our country. Children who do not learn to read by third grade continue to find reading a challenge throughout their lives. These expectations increase in amount and complexity each year.\\"[128][129]","input":"Who are the founders of alpha kappa alpha?"},{"output":"a quiet hissing sound","context":"A dog whistle (also known as silent whistle or Galton's whistle) is a type of whistle that emits sound in the ultrasonic range, which people cannot hear but some other animals can, including dogs and domestic cats, and is used in their training. It was invented in 1876 by Francis Galton and is mentioned in his book Inquiries into Human Faculty and its Development,[1] in which he describes experiments to test the range of frequencies that could be heard by various animals, such as a house cat.\\r\\nThe maximum upper range of human hearing is about 20?kHz for children, declining to 15ÿ17?kHz for middle-age adults.[2] The top end of a dog's hearing range is about 45?kHz, while a cat's is 64?kHz.[3][4] It is thought that the wild ancestors of cats and dogs evolved this higher hearing range in order to hear high-frequency sounds made by their preferred prey, small rodents.[3] The frequency of most dog whistles is within the range of 23 to 54?kHz,[5] so they are above the range of human hearing, although some are adjustable down into the audible range.\\r\\nTo human ears, a dog whistle makes only a quiet hissing sound.[6] The advantage of the dog whistle is that it doesn't produce a loud irritating noise for humans that a normal whistle would produce, so it can be used to train or command animals without disturbing nearby people. Some dog whistles have adjustable sliders for active control of the frequency produced. Trainers may use the whistle simply to gather a dog's attention, or to inflict pain for the purpose of behaviour modification.\\r\\nIn addition to lung-powered whistles, there are also electronic dog whistle devices that emit ultrasonic sound via piezoelectric emitters.[3] The electronic variety are sometimes coupled with bark-detection circuits in an effort to curb barking behaviour. This kind of whistle can also be used to determine the hearing range for people and for physics demonstrations requiring ultrasonic sounds.[citation needed]","input":"What does a silent dog whistle sound like?"},{"output":"December 15, 2017","context":"","input":"When was the new star wars movie released?"},{"output":"synovial joint","context":"The atlanto-occipital joint (articulation between the atlas and the occipital bone) consists of a pair of condyloid joints.

The Lumberjacks basketball team has made five[5] appearances in the NCAA Division I Tournament, with two upset first-round wins in 2014 and 2016.\\r\\n\\r\\nThough the university is located in the rural East Texas college town of Nacogdoches, the vast majority of SFA students come from Greater Houston, the DallasÿFort Worth metroplex, and other cities throughout Texas.  SFA has also served students from 46 states outside Texas and 42 countries outside the United States.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nStephen F. Austin offers more than 120 areas of study, including more than 80 undergraduate majors, nearly 60 graduate degrees, and three doctoral programs. Stephen F. Austin offers classes through six colleges and one independent school.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Arthur Temple College of Forestry and Agriculture is nationally recognized, and houses one of only two schools of forestry in the State of Texas (and the only forestry college in the timber-producing East Texas region).\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the 2014ÿ2015 academic year, there were 2,690 degrees awarded. Of those degrees, 2,108 (78%) were undergraduate, 558 were post-graduate (21%), and 24 (1%) were doctoral.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn addition to the main campus which is located on 430 acres, the university maintains a 642-acre (2.60?km2) agricultural research center for beef, poultry, and swine production and an equine center; an observatory for astronomy research, a 1,072-hectare (approximately 2,649-acre) experimental forest in southwestern Nacogdoches County and a 25.3-acre (102,000?m2) forestry field station on the Sam Rayburn Reservoir.\\r\\n\\r\\nSince 2007, Stephen F. Austin has served as the headquarters of the Association for Business Communication. It is also the home of the National Center for Pharmaceutical Crops, which in 2011 discovered a potential cancer-fighting agent from the extract of giant salvinia, one of the world's most notorious invasive species.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn tribute to the forestry industry, which is a major component of the area's economy, the men's athletic teams are called Lumberjacks, and women's teams are known as Ladyjacks.

The celebration honors African heritage in African-American culture and is observed from December 26 to January 1, culminating in a feast and gift-giving.[1] Kwanzaa has seven core principles (Nguzo Saba). It was created by Maulana Karenga and was first celebrated in 1966ÿ67.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMaulana Karenga, also known as Ronald McKinley Everett, created Kwanzaa in 1966, as the first specifically African-American holiday,[2] (but see also Juneteenth). According to Karenga, the name Kwanzaa derives from the Swahili phrase matunda ya kwanza, meaning \\"first fruits of the harvest\\",[3] although a more conventional translation would simply be \\"first fruits\\". The choice of Swahili, an East African language, reflects its status as a symbol of Pan-Africanism, especially in the 1960s, although most of the Atlantic slave trade that brought African people to America originated in West Africa.[4][5] First fruits festivals exist in Southern Africa, celebrated in December/January with the southern solstice, and Karenga was partly inspired by an account he read of the Zulu festival Umkhosi Wokweshwama.[6] It was decided to spell the holiday's name with an additional \\"a\\" so that it would have a symbolic seven letters.[7]\\r\\nKwanzaa is a celebration with its roots in the black nationalist movement of the 1960s. Karenga established it to help African Americans reconnect with their African cultural and historical heritage by uniting in meditation and study of African traditions and Nguzo Saba, the \\"seven principles of African Heritage,\\" which Karenga said \\"is a communitarian African philosophy.\\" For Karenga, a major figure in the Black Power movement of the 1960s and 1970s, the creation of such holidays also underscored an essential premise \\"you must have a cultural revolution before the violent revolution. The cultural revolution gives identity, purpose and direction.\\"[8]\\r\\nDuring the early years of Kwanzaa, Karenga said it was meant to be an alternative to Christmas. He believed Jesus was psychotic and Christianity was a \\"white\\" religion black people should shun.[9] However, as Kwanzaa gained mainstream adherents, Karenga altered his position so practicing Christians would not be alienated, then stating in the 1997, Kwanzaa: A Celebration of Family, Community, and Culture, \\"Kwanzaa was not created to give people an alternative to their own religion or religious holiday.\\"[10] Many African Americans who celebrate Kwanzaa do so in addition to observing Christmas.[11]\\r\\nKwanzaa celebrates what its founder called the seven principles of Kwanzaa, or Nguzo Saba (originally Nguzu Sabathe seven principles of African Heritage), which Karenga said \\"is a communitarian African philosophy,\\" consisting of what Karenga called \\"the best of African thought and practice in constant exchange with the world.\\" These seven principles comprise Kawaida, a Swahili word meaning \\"common\\". Each of the seven days of Kwanzaa is dedicated to one of the following principles, as follows:[12]\\r\\nKwanzaa celebratory symbols include a mat (Mkeka) on which other symbols are placed: a Kinara (candle holder), Mishumaa Saba (seven candles), mazao (crops), Muhindi (corn), a Kikombe cha Umoja (unity cup) for commemorating and giving shukrani (thanks) to African Ancestors, and Zawadi (gifts). Supplemental representations include a Nguzo Saba poster,[13] the black, red, and green bendera (flag), and African books and artworks ÿ all to represent values and concepts reflective of African culture and contribution to community building and reinforcement.[14] Corn is the primary symbol for both decoration and celebratory dining.\\r\\nFamilies celebrating Kwanzaa decorate their households with objects of art, colorful African cloth such as kente, especially the wearing of kaftans by women, and fresh fruits that represent African idealism. It is customary to include children in Kwanzaa ceremonies and to give respect and gratitude to ancestors. Libations are shared, generally with a common chalice, Kikombe cha Umoja, passed around to all celebrants. Non-African Americans also celebrate Kwanzaa.[15] The holiday greeting is \\"Joyous Kwanzaa\\".[16][17][18]\\r\\nA Kwanzaa ceremony may include drumming and musical selections, libations, a reading of the African Pledge and the Principles of Blackness, reflection on the Pan-African colors, a discussion of the African principle of the day or a chapter in African history, a candle-lighting ritual, artistic performance, and, finally, a feast (karamu). The greeting for each day of Kwanzaa is Habari Gani?[19] which is Swahili for \\"How are you?\\"[20]\\r\\nAt first, observers of Kwanzaa avoided the mixing of the holiday or its symbols, values, and practice with other holidays, as doing so would violate the principle of kujichagulia (self-determination) and thus violate the integrity of the holiday, which is partially intended as a reclamation of important African values. Today, many African American families celebrate Kwanzaa along with Christmas and New Year's.[21] Frequently, both Christmas trees and kinaras, the traditional candle holder symbolic of African American roots, share space in Kwanzaa-celebrating households. For people who celebrate both holidays, Kwanzaa is an opportunity to incorporate elements of their particular ethnic heritage into holiday observances and celebrations of Christmas.\\r\\nCultural exhibitions include the Spirit of Kwanzaa, an annual celebration held at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts featuring interpretive dance, African dance, song and poetry.[22][23][24]\\r\\nThe National Retail Federation has sponsored a marketing survey on winter holidays since 2004, and in 2015 found that 1.9% of those polled planned to celebrate Kwanzaa ÿ about six million people.[25] In a 2006 speech, Maulana Karenga asserted that 28 million people celebrate Kwanzaa. He has always claimed it is celebrated all over the world.[1] Lee D. Baker puts the number at 12 million.[26] The African American Cultural Center claimed 30 million in 2009.[27][28]\\r\\nAccording to University of Minnesota Professor Keith Mayes, the author of Kwanzaa: Black Power and the Making of the African-American Holiday Tradition, the popularity within the U.S. has \\"leveled off\\" as the black power movement there has declined, and as of 2009 between 500 thousand and two million Americans celebrated Kwanzaa, or between one and five percent of African Americans. Mayes added that white institutions now celebrate it.[15]\\r\\nStarting in the 1990s, the holiday became increasingly commercialized, with the first Hallmark Card being sold in 1992,[29] and there has been concern about this damaging the holiday's values.[30] The holiday also saw a greater public recognition as the first Kwanzaa stamp, designed by Synthia Saint James, was issued by the United States Post Office in 1997, and in the same year Bill Clinton gave the first presidential declaration marking the holiday.[31][32]\\r\\nThe holiday has also spread to Canada and is celebrated by Black Canadians in a similar fashion as in the United States.[33] According to the Language Portal of Canada, \\"this fairly new tradition has [also] gained in popularity in France, Great Britain, Jamaica and Brazil\\".[34]\\r\\nIn Brazil, in recent years the term Kwanzaa has been applied by a few institutions as a synonym for the festivities of the Black Awareness Day, commemorated on November 20 in honor of Zumbi dos Palmares,[35][36] having little to do with the celebration as it was originally conceived.\\r\\nStjepan Me?trovi?, a sociology professor at the Texas A&M University, sees Kwanzaa as an example of postmodernism. According to Me?trovi?, modern society has discarded ancient traditions as racist, sexist or otherwise oppressive, but since living in a world where nothing is true is too terrifying to most people, \\"nice\\" and \\"synthetic\\" traditions like Kwanzaa have been created to cope with the nihilistic, individualistic modern society.[37]\\r\\nMaya Angelou narrated a documentary film about Kwanzaa, The Black Candle, written and directed by M.K. Asante, Jr. and featuring Chuck D.[38][39]\\r\\n(federal) = federal holidays, (state) = state holidays, (religious) = religious holidays, (week) = weeklong holidays, (month) = monthlong holidays, (36) = Title 36 Observances and Ceremonies\\r\\nBold indicates major holidays commonly celebrated in the United States, which often represent the major celebrations of the month.","input":"When was the kwanzaa festival created and by who?"},{"output":"\\"the Constitution is silent on the subject of banks.\\" It was Maryland's contention that because the Constitution did not specifically state that the federal government was authorized to charter a bank, the Bank of the United States was unconstitutional","context":"McCulloch v. Maryland, 17 U.S. (4 Wheat.) 316 (1819)[1], was a landmark decision by the Supreme Court of the United States. The state of Maryland had attempted to impede operation of a branch of the Second Bank of the United States by imposing a tax on all notes of banks not chartered in Maryland. Though the law, by its language, was generally applicable to all banks not chartered in Maryland, the Second Bank of the United States was the only out-of-state bank then existing in Maryland, and the law was recognized in the court's opinion as having specifically targeted the Bank of the United States. The Court invoked the Necessary and Proper Clause of the Constitution, which allowed the Federal government to pass laws not expressly provided for in the Constitution's list of express powers, provided those laws are in useful furtherance of the express powers of Congress under the Constitution.\\r\\nThis case established two important principles in constitutional law. First, the Constitution grants to Congress implied powers for implementing the Constitution's express powers, in order to create a functional national government. Second, state action may not impede valid constitutional exercises of power by the Federal government.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOn April 10, 1816, the Congress of the United States passed an act titled \\"An Act to Incorporate the Subscribers to the Bank of the United States\\", which provided for the incorporation of the Second Bank of the United States. The Bank first went into full operation in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. In 1817, the Bank opened a branch in Baltimore, Maryland, and transacted and carried on business as a branch of the Bank of the United States by issuing bank notes, discounting promissory notes, and performing other operations usual and customary for banks to do and perform. Both sides of the litigation admitted that the President, directors, and company of the Bank had no authority to establish the Baltimore branch, or office of discount and deposit, other than the fact that Maryland had adopted the Constitution of the United States.\\r\\nOn February 11, 1818, the General Assembly of Maryland passed an act titled, \\"an act to impose a tax on all banks, or branches thereof, in the State of Maryland, not chartered by the legislature\\":\\r\\nBe it enacted by the General Assembly of Maryland that if any bank has established or shall, without authority from the State first had and obtained establish any branch, office of discount and deposit, or office of pay and receipt in any part of this State, it shall not be lawful for the said branch, office of discount and deposit, or office of pay and receipt to issue notes, in any manner, of any other denomination than five, ten, twenty, fifty, one hundred, five hundred and one thousand dollars, and no note shall be issued except upon stamped paper of the following denominations; that is to say, every five dollar note shall be upon a stamp of ten cents; every ten dollar note, upon a stamp of twenty cents; every twenty dollar note, upon a stamp of thirty cents; every fifty dollar note, upon a stamp of fifty cents; every one hundred dollar note, upon a stamp of one dollar; every five hundred dollar note, upon a stamp of ten dollars; and every thousand dollar note, upon a stamp of twenty dollars; which paper shall be furnished by the Treasurer of the Western Shore, under the direction of the Governor and Council, to be paid for upon delivery; provided always that any institution of the above description may relieve itself from the operation of the provisions aforesaid by paying annually, in advance, to the Treasurer of the Western Shore, for the use of State, the sum of $15,000.\\r\\nAnd be it enacted that the President, cashier, each of the directors and officers of every institution established or to be established as aforesaid, offending against the provisions aforesaid shall forfeit a sum of $500 for each and every offence, and every person having any agency in circulating any note aforesaid, not stamped as aforesaid directed, shall forfeit a sum not exceeding $100, every penalty aforesaid to be recovered by indictment or action of debt in the county court of the county where the offence shall be committed, one-half to the informer and the other half to the use of the State...\\r\\nJames William McCulloch, head of the Baltimore Branch of the Second Bank of the United States, refused to pay the tax and the bank was represented by Daniel Webster. The lawsuit was filed by John James, an informer who sought to collect one half of the fine as provided for by the statute. The case was appealed to the Maryland Court of Appeals where the state of Maryland argued that \\"the Constitution is silent on the subject of banks.\\" It was Maryland's contention that because the Constitution did not specifically state that the federal government was authorized to charter a bank, the Bank of the United States was unconstitutional. The court upheld Maryland. The case was then appealed to the Supreme Court.\\r\\nThe Court determined that Congress did have the power to create the Bank. Chief Justice Marshall supported this conclusion with four main arguments.[2] First, he argued that historical practice established Congress' power to create the Bank. Marshall invoked the first Bank of the United States history as authority for the constitutionality of the second bank.[2] The first Congress enacted the bank after great debate and that it was approved by an executive \\"with as much persevering talent as any measure has ever experienced, and being supported by arguments which convinced minds as pure and as intelligent as this country can boast.\\"[3]\\r\\nSecond, Chief Justice Marshall refuted the argument that states retain ultimate sovereignty because they ratified the constitution. \\"The powers of the general government, it has been said, are delegated by the states, who alone are truly sovereign; and must be exercised in subordination to the states, who alone possess supreme dominion.\\"[4] Marshall contended that it was the people who ratified the Constitution and thus the people are sovereign, not the states.[2]\\r\\nThird, Marshall addressed the scope of congressional powers under Article I. The Court broadly described Congress' authority before addressing the necessary and proper clause.[2] Marshall admitted that the Constitution does not enumerate a power to create a central Bank but said that this is not dispositive as to Congress's power to establish such an institution.[2] Chief Justice Marshall wrote, \\"In considering this question, then, we must never forget, that it is a constitution we are expounding.\\"[5]\\r\\nFourth, Marshall supported the Court's opinion textually by invoking the Necessary and Proper Clause, which permits Congress to seek an objective while exercising its enumerated powers so long as the objective is not forbidden by the Constitution. In liberally interpreting the Necessary and Proper Clause, the Court rejected Maryland's narrow interpretation of the clause, which purported that the word \\"necessary\\" in the Necessary and Proper Clause meant that Congress could only pass those laws that were absolutely essential in the execution of its enumerated powers. The Court rejected this argument, on the grounds that many of the enumerated powers of Congress under the Constitution would be useless if only those laws deemed essential to a power's execution could be passed. Marshall also noted that the Necessary and Proper Clause is listed within the powers of Congress, not the limitations.\\r\\nThe Court held that for these reasons, the word \\"necessary\\" in the Necessary and Proper Clause (elastic clause) does not refer to the only way of doing something, but rather applies to various procedures for implementing all constitutionally established powers. \\"Let the end be legitimate, let it be within the scope of the constitution, and all means which are appropriate, which are plainly adapted to that end, which are not prohibited, but consist with the letter and spirit of the constitution, are constitutional.\\"\\r\\nThis principle had been established many years earlier by Alexander Hamilton:[6]\\r\\n[A] criterion of what is constitutional, and of what is not so ... is the end, to which the measure relates as a mean. If the end be clearly comprehended within any of the specified powers, and if the measure have an obvious relation to that end, and is not forbidden by any particular provision of the Constitution, it may safely be deemed to come within the compass of the national authority. There is also this further criterion which may materially assist the decision: Does the proposed measure abridge a pre-existing right of any State, or of any individual? If it does not, there is a strong presumption in favour of its constitutionality....\\r\\nChief Justice Marshall also determined that Maryland may not tax the bank without violating the Constitution. The Court voided the tax on the grounds that it was unconstitutional. The opinion stated that Congress has implied powers that need to be related to the text of the Constitution, but need not be enumerated within the text. This case was a seminal moment in the formation of a balance between federalism, federal power, and states' powers. Chief Justice Marshall also explained in this case that the Necessary and Proper Clause does not require that all federal laws be necessary and proper and that federal laws that are enacted directly pursuant to one of the express, enumerated powers granted by the Constitution need not comply with the Necessary and Proper Clause, holding that the clause \\"purport[s] to enlarge, not to diminish the powers vested in the government. It purports to be an additional power, not a restriction on those already granted.\\"\\r\\nThough Marshall rejected the 10th amendment's provision of states rights arguing that it did not include the word \\"expressly\\" unlike the Articles of Confederation, which was replaced by the Constitution,[7] controversy over the authority of the amendment being violated by the decision has existed. Compact theory also argues that the federal government is a creation of the states where the states maintain superiority. Unlike Marshall, his successor, Roger B. Taney, established Dual federalism, where separate but equal branches of government were believed to be a better option.[8]\\r\\nMcCulloch v. Maryland was cited in the first substantial constitutional case presented before the High Court of Australia in D'Emden v Pedder (1904), which dealt with similar issues in the Australian Federation. While recognizing American law as not binding on them, the Australian Court nevertheless determined that the McCulloch decision provided the best guideline for the relationship between the Commonwealth federal government, and the Australian States, owing in large part to strong similarities between the American and Australian constitutions.","input":"N mcculloch v. maryland what did the state of maryland argue?"},{"output":"the mid-1950s","context":"","input":"When did the civil rights movement gain momentum?"},{"output":"Sachin Tendulkar","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nTest cricket is played between international cricket teams who are Full Members of the International Cricket Council (ICC).[1] Unlike One Day Internationals, Test matches consist of two innings per team, with no limit in the number of overs.[2] Test cricket is first-class cricket, so statistics and records set in Test matches are also counted toward first-class records. The duration of Tests, currently limited to five days, has varied through Test history, ranging from three days to timeless matches.[3][4] The earliest match now recognised as a Test was played between England and Australia in March 1877;[5] since then there have been over 2,000 Tests played by 13 teams. The frequency of Tests has steadily increased partly because of the increase in the number of Test-playing countries, and partly as cricket boards seek to maximise their revenue.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nCricket is, by its nature, capable of generating large numbers of records and statistics.[7] This list details the most significant team and individual records in Test cricket.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs of August 2018, the most successful team in Test cricket, in terms of both wins and win percentage, is Australia, having won 383 of their 812 Tests (47.16%). Excluding teams who have only played a single Test (the ICC World XI, a rest of world team who played a single Test against Australia in 2005, and recent Test newcomers Ireland and Afghanistan) the least successful team are Bangladesh who have struggled since their introduction to Test cricket in 2000, leading to questioning of their Test status.[8][9][10]\\r\\n\\r\\nAustralian Donald Bradman, widely considered the greatest batsman of all time,[11][12] holds several personal and partnership records. He scored the most runs in a series, has the most double centuries and was a part of the record 5th wicket partnership. His most significant record is his batting average of 99.94. One of cricket's most famous statistics,[13][14] it stands almost 40 runs higher than any other batsman's average. Don Bradman is the only player in the world to have scored 5000 runs against a single opposition: 5028 runs against England.[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the Manchester Test of 1956, England spin bowler Jim Laker took 19 wickets for 90 runs (19ÿ90) which set not only the Test record for best match figures but also the first-class one.[16] In taking 10ÿ53 in the second innings he became the first bowler to capture all ten wickets in a Test match innings, and his analysis remains the best innings figures. Indian Leg-spinner Anil Kumble is the only other bowler to have taken 10 wickets in an innings, claiming 10ÿ74 against Pakistan in 1999.[17] West Indies batsman Brian Lara has the highest individual score in Test cricket: he scored 400 not out against England in 2004 to surpass the innings of 380 by Matthew Hayden six months earlier. Lara had held the record before Hayden, with a score of 375 against England 10 years earlier.[18] Pakistan's Misbah-ul-Haq holds the record of the fastest test half century scoring 50 runs from 21 balls. The record for the fastest test century is held by New Zealand's Brendon McCullum who scored 100 runs from 54 balls in his final test match.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe trend of countries to increase the number of Test matches they play means that the aggregate lists are dominated by modern players. Sri Lankan spinner Muttiah Muralitharan became the highest Test wicket-taker in December 2007, when he passed Shane Warne's total of 708 wickets.[19] Within a year, the equivalent batting record of highest run-scorer had also changed hands: Sachin Tendulkar surpassed the tally of 11,953 runs by Brian Lara.[20] The record for most dismissals by a wicket-keeper is held by Mark Boucher of South Africa[21] while the record for most catches by a fielder is held by Rahul Dravid.[22]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn general the top five are listed in each category (except when there is a tie for the last place among the five, when all the tied record holders are noted).\\r\\n\\r\\nLast updated: 11 September 2018[24]\\r\\n\\r\\nLast updated: 12 December 2016[25]\\r\\n\\r\\nLast updated: 3 April 2018[26]\\r\\n\\r\\nLast updated: 15 June 2016[27][28][29]\\r\\n\\r\\nLast updated: 15 June 2016[30]\\r\\n\\r\\nLast updated: 15 June 2016[31]\\r\\n\\r\\nLast updated: 15 June 2016[32]\\r\\n\\r\\nLast updated: 15 June 2016[33]\\r\\n\\r\\nLast updated: 14 September 2017[34]\\r\\n\\r\\nLast updated: 14 September 2017[35]\\r\\n\\r\\nLast updated: 14 September 2017[36]\\r\\n\\r\\nLast updated: 11 September 2018[37]\\r\\n\\r\\nLast updated: 15 June 2016[38]\\r\\n\\r\\nNotes:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLast updated: 11 September 2018[39]\\r\\n\\r\\nQualification: 20 innings.\\r\\n\\r\\nNote: If the qualification is removed, the record Test batting average is  Andy Ganteaume's 112.00; Ganteaume was dismissed for 112 runs in his only Test innings.[40] A very few one-Test wonders have never been dismissed, leaving them without a defined Test batting average.

The Warsaw Pact was the military complement to the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance (CoMEcon), the regional economic organization for the socialist states of Central and Eastern Europe. The Warsaw Pact was created in reaction to the integration of West Germany into NATO[2][3][4][5] in 1955 per the London and Paris Conferences of 1954,[6][7][8][9][10] but it is also considered to have been motivated by Soviet desires to maintain control over military forces in Central and Eastern Europe.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Warsaw Pact was established as a balance of power[12] or counterweight[13] to NATO; there was no direct confrontation between them. Instead, the conflict was fought on an ideological basis and in proxy wars. Both NATO and the Warsaw Pact led to the expansion of military forces and their integration into the respective blocs.[13] Its largest military engagement was the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia in August 1968 (with the participation of all Pact nations except Albania, Romania and East Germany),[12] which, in part, resulted in Albania withdrawing from the pact less than a month later. The Pact began to unravel in its entirety with the spread of the Revolutions of 1989 through the Eastern Bloc, beginning with the Solidarity movement in Poland[14] and its electoral success in June 1989.\\r\\n\\r\\nEast Germany withdrew from the Pact following reunification with West Germany in 1990. On 25 February 1991, the Pact was declared at an end at a meeting of defence and foreign ministers from the six remaining member states in Hungary. The USSR itself was dissolved in December 1991, although most of the former Soviet republics formed the Collective Security Treaty Organization shortly thereafter. Throughout the following 20 years, the seven Warsaw Pact countries outside the USSR each joined NATO (East Germany through its reunification with West Germany; and the Czech Republic and Slovakia as separate countries).\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the Western Bloc, the Warsaw Treaty Organization of Friendship, Cooperation and Mutual Assistance is often called the Warsaw Pact military allianceabbreviated WAPA, Warpac and WP. Elsewhere, in the former member states, the Warsaw Treaty is known as:\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Warsaw Treaty's organization was two-fold: the Political Consultative Committee handled political matters, and the Combined Command of Pact Armed Forces controlled the assigned multi-national forces, with headquarters in Warsaw, Poland. Furthermore, the Supreme Commander of the Unified Armed Forces of the Warsaw Treaty Organization which commanded and controlled all the military forces of the member countries was also a First Deputy Minister of Defence of the USSR, and the Chief of Combined Staff of the Unified Armed Forces of the Warsaw Treaty Organization was also a First Deputy Chief of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of the USSR. Therefore, although ostensibly an international collective security alliance, the USSR dominated the Warsaw Treaty armed forces.[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe strategy behind the formation of the Warsaw Pact was driven by the desire of the Soviet Union to dominate Central and Eastern Europe. The Soviets wanted to keep their part of Europe theirs and not let the Americans take it from them. This policy was driven by ideological and geostrategic reasons. Ideologically, the Soviet Union arrogated the right to define socialism and communism and act as the leader of the global socialist movement. A corollary to this idea was the necessity of intervention if a country appeared to be violating core socialist ideas and Communist Party functions, which was explicitly stated in the Brezhnev Doctrine.[16] Geostrategic principles also drove the Soviet Union with the desire to create a buffer zone to prevent invasion of its territory by Western European powers.\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore the creation of the Warsaw Pact, Czechoslovak leadership, fearful of a rearmed Germany, sought to create a security pact with East Germany and Poland.[9] These states protested strongly against the re-militarization of West Germany.[17] The Warsaw Pact was primarily put in place as a consequence of the rearming of West Germany inside NATO. Soviet leaders, like many European countries on both sides of the Iron Curtain, feared Germany being once again a military power and a direct threat. The terrible consequences of German militarism remained a fresh memory among the Soviets and Eastern Europeans.[3][4][18][19][20] As the Soviet Union already had bilateral treaties with all of its eastern satellites, the Pact has been long considered 'superfluous',[21] and because of the rushed way in which it was conceived, NATO officials labeled it as a 'cardboard castle'.[22]\\r\\nPreviously, in March 1954, the USSR, fearing the restoration of German militarism in West Germany, requested admission to NATO.[23][24][25]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Soviet request to join NATO arose in the aftermath of the Berlin Conference of JanuaryÿFebruary 1954. Soviet foreign minister Molotov made proposals to have Germany reunified[26] and elections for a pan-German government,[27] under conditions of withdrawal of the four powers' armies and German neutrality,[28] but all were refused by the other foreign ministers, Dulles (USA), Eden (UK) and Bidault (France).[29] Proposals for the reunification of Germany were nothing new: earlier on 20 March 1952, talks about a German reunification, initiated by the so-called 'Stalin Note', ended after the United Kingdom, France and the United States insisted that a unified Germany should not be neutral and should be free to join the European Defence Community and rearm. James Dunn (USA), who met in Paris with Eden, Adenauer and Robert Schuman (France), affirmed that \\"the object should be to avoid discussion with the Russians and to press on the European Defense Community\\".[30]\\r\\nAccording to John Gaddis \\"there was little inclination in Western capitals to explore this offer\\" from USSR.[31]\\r\\nWhile historian Rolf Steininger asserts that Adenauer's conviction that \\"neutralization means sovietization\\" was the main factor in the rejection of the Soviet proposals,[32]  Adenauer also feared that German unification might have resulted in the end of the CDU's dominance in the West German Bundestag.[33]\\r\\n\\r\\nConsequently, Molotov, fearing that the EDC would be directed in the future against the USSR and \\"seeking to prevent the formation of groups of European States directed against other European States\\",[34] made a proposal for a General European Treaty on Collective Security in Europe \\"open to all European States without regard as to their social systems\\"[34] which would have included the unified Germany (thus making the EDC ÿ perceived by the USSR as a threat ÿ unusable). But Eden, Dulles and Bidault opposed the proposal.[35]\\r\\n\\r\\nOne month later, the proposed European Treaty was rejected not only by supporters of the EDC but also by Western opponents of the European Defence Community (like French Gaullist leader Palewski) who perceived it as \\"unacceptable in its present form because it excludes the USA from participation in the collective security system in Europe\\".[36] The Soviets then decided to make a new proposal to the governments of the USA, UK and France to accept the participation of the USA in the proposed General European Agreement.[36] And considering that another argument deployed against the Soviet proposal was that it was perceived by Western powers as \\"directed against the North Atlantic Pact and its liquidation\\",[36][37] the Soviets decided to declare their \\"readiness to examine jointly with other interested parties the question of the participation of the USSR in the North Atlantic bloc\\", specifying that \\"the admittance of the USA into the General European Agreement should not be conditional on the three Western powers agreeing to the USSR joining the North Atlantic Pact\\".[36]\\r\\n\\r\\nAgain all proposals, including the request to join NATO, were rejected by the UK, US and French governments shortly after.[25][38] Emblematic was the position of British General Hastings Ismay, supporter of NATO expansion, who said that NATO \\"must grow until the whole free world gets under one umbrella.\\"[39][incomplete short citation] He opposed the request to join NATO made by the USSR in 1954[40] saying that \\"the Soviet request to join NATO is like an unrepentant burglar requesting to join the police force\\".[41]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn April 1954 Adenauer made his first visit to the USA meeting Nixon, Eisenhower and Dulles. Ratification of EDC was delaying but the US representatives made it clear to Adenauer that EDC would have to become a part of NATO.[42]\\r\\n\\r\\nMemories of the Nazi occupation were still strong, and the rearmament of Germany was feared by France too.[4][43] On 30 August 1954 French Parliament rejected the EDC, thus ensuring its failure[44] and blocking a major objective of US policy towards Europe: to associate Germany militarily with the West.[45] The US Department of State started to elaborate alternatives: Germany would be invited to join NATO or, in the case of French obstructionism, strategies to circumvent a French veto would be implemented in order to obtain a German rearmament outside NATO.[46]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 23 October 1954 ÿ only nine years after Allies (UK, USA and USSR) defeated Nazi Germany ending World War II in Europe ÿ the admission of the Federal Republic of Germany to the North Atlantic Pact was finally decided. The incorporation of West Germany into the organization on 9 May 1955 was described as \\"a decisive turning point in the history of our continent\\" by Halvard Lange, Foreign Affairs Minister of Norway at the time.[47] In November  1954, the USSR requested a new European Security Treaty,[48] in order to make a final attempt to not have a remilitarized West Germany potentially opposed to the Soviet Union, with no success.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 14 May 1955, the USSR and other seven European countries \\"reaffirming their desire for the establishment of a system of European collective security based on the participation of all European states irrespective of their social and political systems\\"[49] established the Warsaw Pact in response to the integration of the Federal Republic of Germany into NATO,[3][5] declaring that: \\"a remilitarized Western Germany and the integration of the latter in the North-Atlantic bloc [...] increase the danger of another war and constitutes a threat to the national security of the peaceable states; [...] in these circumstances the peaceable European states must take the necessary measures to safeguard their security\\".[49]\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of the founding members, East Germany was allowed to re-arm by the Soviet Union and the National People's Army was established as the armed forces of the country to counter the rearmament of West Germany.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe eight member countries of the Warsaw Pact pledged the mutual defence of any member who would be attacked. Relations among the treaty signatories were based upon mutual non-intervention in the internal affairs of the member countries, respect for national sovereignty, and political independence. However, almost all governments of those member states were indirectly controlled by the Soviet Union.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe founding signatories to the Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation and Mutual Assistance consisted of the following communist governments:\\r\\n\\r\\n?Mongolia: In July 1963 the Mongolian People's Republic asked to join the Warsaw Pact under Article 9 of the treaty.  Due to the emerging Sino-Soviet split, Mongolia remained on observer status. The Soviet Government agreed to station troops in Mongolia in 1966.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nFor 36 years, NATO and the Warsaw Pact never directly waged war against each other in Europe; the United States and the Soviet Union and their respective allies implemented strategic policies aimed at the containment of each other in Europe, while working and fighting for influence within the wider Cold War on the international stage. These included the Korean War, Vietnam War, Bay of Pigs invasion, Dirty War, CambodianÿVietnamese War and the others.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1956, following the declaration of the Imre Nagy government of withdrawal of Hungary from the Warsaw Pact, Soviet troops entered the country and removed the government. Soviet forces crushed the nationwide revolt, leading to the death of an estimated 2,500 Hungarian citizens.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe multi-national Communist armed forces' sole joint action was the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia in August 1968. All member countries, with the exception of the Socialist Republic of Romania and the People's Republic of Albania, participated in the invasion. The German Democratic Republic provided only minimal support, however.\\r\\n\\r\\nBeginning at the Cold War's conclusion, in late 1989, popular civil and political public discontent forced the Communist governments of the Warsaw Treaty countries from power, while independent national politics made feasible with the perestroika and glasnost induced institutional collapse of Communist government in the USSR.[50]\\r\\n\\r\\nBetween 1989 and 1991, Communist governments were overthrown in Albania, Poland, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, East Germany, Romania, Bulgaria and the Soviet Union.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the last acts of the Cold War, several Warsaw Pact states of Poland, Czechoslovakia and Hungary participated in the U.S.-led coalition during the Gulf War.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 25 February 1991, the Warsaw Pact was declared disbanded at a meeting of defence and foreign ministers from remaining Pact countries meeting in Hungary.[51] On 1 July 1991, in Prague, the Czechoslovak President Vclav Havel formally ended the 1955 Warsaw Treaty Organization of Friendship, Cooperation and Mutual Assistance and so disestablished the Warsaw Treaty after 36 years of military alliance with the USSR.[52] In fact, the treaty was de facto disbanded in December 1989 during the violent revolution in Romania, which toppled the communist government, without military intervention from other member states.[citation needed] The USSR disestablished itself in December 1991.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 12 March 1999, the Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland joined NATO; Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania and Slovakia joined in March 2004; Albania joined on 1 April 2009.\\r\\n\\r\\nRussia and some other post-USSR states joined in the Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO) in 1992, or the Shanghai Five in 1996 (renamed the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) after Uzbekistan's addition in 2001).\\r\\n\\r\\nIn November 2005, the Polish government opened its Warsaw Treaty archives to the Institute of National Remembrance, who published some 1,300 declassified documents in January 2006. Yet the Polish government reserved publication of 100 documents, pending their military declassification. Eventually, 30 of the reserved 100 documents were published; 70 remained secret and unpublished. Among the documents published is the Warsaw Treaty's nuclear war plan, Seven Days to the River Rhine ÿ a short, swift counter-attack capturing Austria, Denmark, Germany and Netherlands east of River Rhine, using nuclear weapons, in self-defence, after a NATO first strike. The plan originated as a 1979 field training exercise war game and metamorphosed into official Warsaw Treaty battle doctrine, until the late 1980s ÿ which is why the People's Republic of Poland was a nuclear weapons base, first, to 178, then, to 250 tactical-range rockets. Doctrinally, as a Soviet-style (offensive) battle plan, Seven Days to the River Rhine gave commanders few defensive-war strategies for fighting NATO in Warsaw Treaty territory.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nBadge Warsaw Pact.

It is produced by Rajan Shahi's Director's Kut Productions, and is the third longest-running Indian television series based on episode count.[citation needed] The show's lead characters are Naira (Shivangi Joshi) and Kartik (Mohsin Khan). The series initially focused on Naira's parents Akshara (Hina Khan) and Naitik (Karan Mehra).\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nYeh Rishta Kya Kehlata Hai was initially the story of a young couple, Akshara and Naitik Singhania, who lived in a Marwari joint family in Udaipur. The story showcases their journey as a married couple going through adjustment issues, as parents of young children, and how they learn to love each other as their extended families mature. Now the story focuses on Naira and Kartik Goenka facing the same journey as Naira's parents, with a youthful twist.\\r\\nAfter an accident, Naitik falls into a coma. Naksh (Akshara and Naitik's son) is now 5 and doesn't know about his father. One day, Naitik comes back and although at first Naksh doesn't welcome his father, he later accepts him into his life. Soon the family travels and Gayatri (Naitik's mother) dies. Now Rajsekhar (Naitik's dad) is asked to marry someone, and he marries Devyani, who comes with her two children from a divorced marriage. Later, Bhabimaa's husband dies, and Bhabimaa (Naitik's aunt) blames it on Akshara and kicks her out of the house, after Akshara's daughter Naira is born. Akshara, Naitik, Naksh, and Naira leave the house.\\r\\nNaksh is now a mature adult and Naira is a diva teenager. Akshara and Naitik, along with Naksh and Naira, live in Cape Town. Naksh returns to Udaipur. He tries to clear up the misunderstanding with Bhabimaa. After many days, Akshara is forgiven and is allowed to return. The story then focuses on Naksh. He falls in love with Tara, and preparations for their wedding are made. Just minutes before the ceremony, she breaks up with him.\\r\\nThe show focuses on teenage Naira, who flees from her house and now lives in Rishikesh, harboring animosity toward her mother. After finding Naira, the story takes a new twist: a love triangle that forms between Kartik (Naitik's employee), Naira and Gayu (Naitik's niece). Naira and Kartik have feelings for each other but don't know that it's love. Meanwhile, Gayu loves Kartik, unaware that Kartik doesn't love her back. When Kartik proposes to Naira, she initially rejects him, but by the time she realizes that Gayu also loves him, she thinks of sacrificing her happiness in favor of Gayu. When Mishti (Naira's cousin) reveals that Kartik loves only Naira, Kartik and Naira confess their love for each other; Gayatri understands. Kartik doesn't want to talk about his family because he hates them. Meanwhile, on Akshara's birthday, everyone goes for a veneration, but Akshara dies in a car accident. The Singhanias blame Kartik for Akshara's death as Kartik was found drunk and injured at the accident site. Kartik's family shows up and supports Kartik. Later, Naira finds that Kartik is not the culprit. She proves Kartik's innocence by finding the real culprit. Kartik doesn't like his father and stepmother as he thinks they were responsible for his mother's death. Seeing Kartik's feelings towards the Singhanias, his family approves of their relationship in spite of not being much in favor of it.\\r\\nThe two families (Goenka and Singhania) start making preparations for their wedding. Just before the wedding, Kartik discovers the real culprit who ran Akshara over and yearns to tell Naira, but his uncle convinces him that he will tell her. He reneges and tells Naira only that Kartik is missing his mother. Finally, the wedding takes place. A few days later, Naira meets the man whose brother is in jail for killing her mother and learns that Akshara's accident was caused by Mansi (Kartik's cousin). The news reaches the Singhanias and they are heartbroken. The Goenkas come to apologize. Naira is initially very hurt and angry with Kartik, but she understands that it's not his fault. She takes Akshara's accident case back and forgives Mansi. On Kartik's birthday, he comes to know that Aditya (Kartik's brother in law) tortures Keerti (Kartik's sister) and, along with Naira, decides to expose him. Eventually, Aditya's truth comes out and Keerti and Aditya get divorced.\\r\\nSuhasini Goenka (Kartik's grandmother) wants to find a suitable match for Keerti and later forces Naira to get Naksh and Keerti married. Naksh accepts the proposal for the sake of Naira.\\r\\nAnother parallel story about Manish and Saumya Goenka (Kartik's mother) is revealed. Saumya was a mental patient and committed suicide a long time ago. Manish (Kartik's father) kept the fact hidden keeping his promise to Saumya. Later, Kartik learns the truth and his misunderstandings regarding Manish get cleared up.\\r\\nNaksh and Keerti marry.\\r\\nParallel with Akshara and Naitik's stories, the stories of their respective siblings also form significant story arcs in the series. Past plots have been built around the lives of Naitik's sisters Nandini and Rashmi. The series has also focused on Naitik's step-siblings. The series also paralleled the story of Akshara-Naitik with that of Varsha-Shaurya. Varsha is Akshara's best friend, and Shaurya is Akshara's older brother.\\r\\nAfter several leaps, Naira and Kartik became the leads of the show. Parallel with Kartik and Naira's story, the series also focusses on the story of their siblings - Naksh, Gayu, Keerti and Shubham.\\r\\nYeh Rishta Kya Kehlata Hai has had several crossover episodes with various shows.

For Saint Thomas Aquinas, the dove signifies by its properties each gift of the Holy Spirit.[15]\\r\\nAlthough the New Testament does not refer to Isaiah 11:1-2 regarding these gifts,[16][17] Roman Catholicism teaches that initiates receive them at Baptism, and that they are strengthened at Confirmation, so that one can proclaim the truths of the faith:\\r\\nAccording to the Catechism of the Catholic Church, these gifts \\"...complete and perfect the virtues of those who receive them.\\"[19]\\r\\nSaint Thomas Aquinas says that four of these gifts (wisdom, understanding, knowledge, and counsel) direct the intellect, while the other three gifts (fortitude, piety, and fear of the Lord) direct the will toward God.[29]\\r\\nIn some respects, the gifts are similar to the virtues, but a key distinction is that the virtues operate under the impetus of human reason (prompted by grace), whereas the gifts operate under the impetus of the Holy Spirit; the former can be used when one wishes, but the latter operate only when the Holy Spirit wishes. In the case of Fortitude, the gift has, in Latin and English, the same name as a virtue, which it is related to but from which it must be distinguished.\\r\\nIn Summa Theologica II.II, Thomas Aquinas asserts the following correspondences between the seven Capital Virtues and the seven Gifts of the Holy Spirit:[30]\\r\\nTo the virtue of temperance, no Gift is directly assigned; but the gift of fear can be taken as such, since fear drives somebody to restrict himself from forbidden pleasures.\\r\\nThe Rev. Brian Shanley contrasts the gifts to the virtues this way: \\"What the gifts do over and above the theological virtues (which they presuppose) is dispose the agent to the special promptings of the Holy Spirit in actively exercising the life of the virtues; the gifts are necessary for the perfect operations of the virtues, especially in the face of our human weakness and in difficult situations.\\"[31]\\r\\nSt. Augustine drew a connection between the gifts of the Holy Spirit and the Beatitudes (Matt.5:3-12).\\r\\n?This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain:?Herbermann, Charles, ed.

On the plus side, however, it's used so often that the reader almost becomes desensitized and learns to ignore it.\\"","input":"What is the maze runner book series about?"},{"output":"masonry refers to individual units that are placed in a mortar bed, making a distinction with panelized products","context":"Masonry veneer walls consist of a single non-structural external layer of masonry, typically made of brick, stone or manufactured stone.[1] Masonry veneer can have an air space behind it and is technically called \\"anchored veneer\\". A masonry veneer attached directly to the backing is called \\"adhered veneer\\". The innermost element is usually structural wall, and may consist of concrete masonry (often called a Cavity wall where inner and outer layers are both structural), concrete, wood or metal frame.[2]\\r\\nBecause brick itself isn't waterproof, the airspace also functions as a drainage plane, allowing any water that has penetrated the veneer to drain to the bottom of the air space, where it encounters flashing (weatherproofing) and is directed to the outside through weep holes, rather than entering the building.\\r\\nOther advantages of a masonry veneer include:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBecause the masonry veneer is non-structural, it must be tied back to the building structure to prevent movement under wind and earthquake loads. Brick ties are used for this purpose, and may take the form of corrugated metal straps nailed or screwed to the structural framing, or as wire extensions to horizontal joint reinforcement in a fully masonry veneer or cavity wall. Although the veneer is vertically self-supporting, shelf angles are often used in multi-story buildings, typically at floor edges, to provide a horizontal expansion joint that allows expansion of the brick and potential shrinkage of the frame. In multi-story buildings, such a system may be called a curtain wall. Adhered masonry veneer is bonded to the backing so it does not typically need a shelf angle.\\r\\nMasonry veneers can be made of brick, concrete, natural stone or manufactured stone product. Typically, masonry refers to individual units that are placed in a mortar bed, making a distinction with panelized products.\\r\\nA variant on masonry veneer is the rain screen veneer. Rain screens are ventilated at the top and bottom of the cavity to prevent wind-driven rain from being driven into the building by unbalanced pressure. Such systems are typically encountered in areas where blowing rain is a significant concern.\\r\\nMasonry has high thermal mass, so masonry is slower to heat up, and can continue to release heat long into the night; without insulation half of that heat will be released into the building. Masonry with a dark external surface absorbs more heat than with a lighter external surface, especially if exposed to sunlight. Reverse masonry veneer walls have the brickwork inside and the lightweight frame and cladding outside; this has the advantage of providing the thermal mass on the inside of a building.\\r\\nMasonry itself provides very little insulation, however:\\r\\nDifferent configurations of such foil(s), air-space(s), and/or insulating material(s) can perform significantly better at excluding heat during summer and/or retaining heat during winter; these configurations often perform in counter-intuitive ways. Because of the enormous long-term potential for reducing energy requirements and improving occupant comfort, building designers should consult engineers or adopt configurations with known performances.","input":"What is the difference between masonry and masonry veneer?"},{"output":"The British government","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Koh-i-Noor (/?ko???n??r/;[8] Persian: ???? ????), also spelt Kohinoor and Koh-i-Nur, is one of the largest cut diamonds in the world, weighing 105.6 carats (21.12?g),[a] and part of the British Crown Jewels.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe diamond was originally owned by the Kakatiya dynasty.[9] Probably mined in Golconda, India, there is no record of its original weight, but the earliest well-attested weight is 186 old carats (191 metric carats or 38.2?g). Koh-i-Noor is Persian for \\"Mountain of Light\\"; it has been known by this name since the 18th?century. It changed hands between various factions in modern-day India, Pakistan, Iran, and Afghanistan, until being ceded to Queen Victoria after the British conquest of the Punjab in 1849.\\r\\n\\r\\nOriginally, the stone was of a similar cut to other Mughal era diamonds which are now in the Iranian Crown Jewels. In 1851, it went on display at the Great Exhibition in London, but the lacklustre cut failed to impress viewers. Prince Albert, husband of Queen Victoria, ordered it to be re-cut as an oval brilliant by Coster Diamonds. By modern standards, the culet is unusually broad, giving the impression of a black hole when the stone is viewed head-on; it is nevertheless regarded by gemmologists as \\"full of life\\".[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nBecause its history involves a great deal of fighting between men, the Koh-i-Noor acquired a reputation within the British royal family for bringing bad luck to any man who wears it. Since arriving in the UK, it has only been worn by female members of the family.[11] Victoria wore the stone in a brooch and a circlet. After she died in 1901, it was set in the Crown of Queen Alexandra, wife of Edward VII. It was transferred to the Crown of Queen Mary in 1911, and finally to the Crown of Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother in 1937.\\r\\n\\r\\nToday, the diamond is on public display in the Jewel House at the Tower of London, where it is seen by millions of visitors each year. The governments of India, Pakistan, Iran, and Afghanistan have all claimed rightful ownership of the Koh-i-Noor and demanded its return ever since India gained independence from the UK in 1947. The British government insists the gem was obtained legally under the terms of the Last Treaty of Lahore and has rejected the claims.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe diamond is widely believed to have come from Kollur Mine,[12][13] a series of 4-metre (13?ft) deep gravel-clay pits on the banks of Krishna River in the Golconda (present-day Andhra Pradesh), India.[14] It is impossible to know exactly when or where it was found, and many unverifiable theories exist as to its original owner.[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nBabur, the Turco-Mongol founder of the Mughal Empire, wrote about a \\"famous\\" diamond that weighed just over 187 old carats ÿ?approximately the size of the 186-carat Koh-i-Noor.[16] Some historians think Babur's diamond is the earliest reliable reference to the Koh-i-Noor.[17] According to his diary, it was acquired by Alauddin Khalji, second ruler of the Khalji dynasty of the Delhi Sultanate, when he invaded the kingdoms of southern India at the beginning of the 14th?century. It later passed to succeeding dynasties of the Sultanate, and Babur received the diamond in 1526 as a tribute for his conquest of Delhi and Agra at the Battle of Panipat.[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nShah Jahan, the fifth Mughal emperor, had the stone placed into his ornate Peacock Throne. In 1658, his son and successor, Aurangzeb, confined the ailing emperor to Agra Fort. While in the possession of Aurangzeb, it was allegedly cut by Hortenso Borgia, a Venetian lapidary, reducing the weight of the large stone to 186 carats (37.2?g).[18] For this carelessness, Borgia was reprimanded and fined 10,000 rupees.[19] According to recent research the story of Borgia cutting the diamond is not correct, and most probably mixed up with the Orlov, part of Catherine the Great's imperial Russian sceptre in the Kremlin.[20]\\r\\n\\r\\nFollowing the 1739 invasion of Delhi by Nader Shah, the Afsharid Shah of Persia, the treasury of the Mughal Empire was looted by his army in an organised and thorough acquisition of the Mughal nobility's wealth.[22] Along with millions of rupees and an assortment of historic jewels, the Shah also carried away the Koh-i-Noor.[23] He exclaimed Koh-i-Noor!, Persian for \\"Mountain of Light\\", when he obtained the famous stone.[24] One of his consorts said, \\"If a strong man were to throw four stones ÿ one north, one south, one east, one west, and a fifth stone up into the air ÿ and if the space between them were to be filled with gold, all would not equal the value of the Koh-i-Noor\\".[25]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter Nader Shah was killed and his empire collapsed in 1747, the Koh-i-Noor fell to his grandson, who in 1751 gave it to Ahmad Shah Durrani, founder of the Afghan Empire, in return for his support.[23] One of Ahmed's descendants, Shuja Shah Durrani, wore a bracelet containing the Koh-i-Noor on the occasion of Mountstuart Elphinstone's visit to Peshawar in 1808.[26] A year later, Shujah formed an alliance with the United Kingdom to help defend against a possible invasion of Afghanistan by Russia.[27] He was quickly overthrown, but fled with the diamond to Lahore, where Ranjit Singh, founder of the Sikh Empire, in return for his hospitality, insisted upon the gem being given to him, and he took possession of it in 1813.[22]\\r\\n\\r\\nIts new owner, Ranjit Singh, willed the diamond to the East India Company administered Hindu Jagannath Temple in Puri, in modern-day Odisha, India.[28] However, after his death in 1839, his will was not executed.[29] On 29 March 1849, following the conclusion of the Second Anglo-Sikh War, the Kingdom of Punjab was formally annexed to Company rule, and the Last Treaty of Lahore was signed, officially ceding the Koh-i-Noor to Queen Victoria and the Maharaja's other assets to the company. Article III of the treaty read: \\"The gem called the Koh-i-Noor, which was taken from Shah Sooja-ool-moolk by Maharajah Ranjeet Singh, shall be surrendered by the Maharajah of Lahore to the Queen of England (sic)\\".[30]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Governor-General in charge of the ratification of this treaty was the Marquess of Dalhousie. The manner of his aiding in the transfer of the diamond was criticized even by some of his contemporaries in Britain. Although some thought it should have been presented as a gift to Queen Victoria by the East India Company, it is clear that Dalhousie believed the stone was a spoil of war, and treated it accordingly, ensuring that it was officially surrendered to her by Duleep Singh, the youngest son of Ranjit Singh.[31] The presentation of the Koh-i-Noor by the East India Company to the queen was the latest in a long history of transfers of the diamond as a coveted spoil of war.[32] Duleep Singh had been placed in the guardianship of Dr John Login, a surgeon in the British Army serving in the Presidency of Bengal. Duleep Singh would move to England in 1854.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn due course, the Governor-General received the Koh-i-Noor from Dr Login, who had been appointed Governor of the Citadel, on 6 April 1848 under a receipt dated 7 December 1849, in the presence of members of the Board of Administration for the affairs of the Punjab: Sir Henry Lawrence (President), C. G. Mansel, John Lawrence and Sir Henry Elliot (Secretary to the Government of India).\\r\\n\\r\\nLegend in the Lawrence family has it that before the voyage, John Lawrence left the jewel in his waistcoat pocket when it was sent to be laundered, and was most grateful when it was returned promptly by the valet who found it.[34]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 1 February 1850, the jewel was sealed in a small iron safe inside a red dispatch box, both sealed with red tape and a wax seal and kept in a chest at Bombay Treasury awaiting a steamer ship from China. It was then sent to England for presentation to Queen Victoria in the care of Captain J. Ramsay and Brevet Lt. Col F. Mackeson under tight security arrangements, one of which was the placement of the dispatch box in a larger iron safe. They departed from Bombay on 6 April on board HMS Medea, captained by Captain Lockyer.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe ship had a difficult voyage: an outbreak of cholera on board when the ship was in Mauritius had the locals demanding its departure, and they asked their governor to open fire on the vessel and destroy it if there was no response. Shortly afterwards, the vessel was hit by a severe gale that blew for some 12 hours.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn arrival in Britain on 29 June, the passengers and mail were unloaded in Plymouth, but the Koh-i-Noor stayed on board until the ship reached Spithead, near Portsmouth, on 1 July. The next morning, Ramsay and Mackeson, in the company of Mr Onslow, the private secretary to the Chairman of the Court of Directors of the British East India Company, proceeded by train to East India House in the City of London and passed the diamond into the care of the chairman and deputy chairman of the East India Company.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Koh-i-Noor was formally presented to Queen Victoria on 3 July 1850 at Buckingham Palace by the deputy chairman of the East India Company.[32] The date had been chosen to coincide with the Company's 250th anniversary.[35]\\r\\n\\r\\nMembers of the public were given a chance to see the Koh-i-Noor when The Great Exhibition was staged at Hyde Park, London, in 1851. It represented the might of the British Empire and took pride of place in the eastern part of the central gallery.[36]\\r\\n\\r\\nIts mysterious past and advertised value of S1ÿ2 million drew large crowds.[37] At first, the stone was put inside a gilded birdcage, but after complaints about its dull appearance, the Koh-i-Noor was moved to a case with black velvet and gas lamps in the hope that it would sparkle better.[38] Despite this, the flawed and asymmetrical diamond still failed to please viewers.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nOriginally, the diamond had 169 facets and was 4.1 centimetres (1.6?in) long, 3.26 centimetres (1.28?in) wide, and 1.62 centimetres (0.64?in) deep. It was high-domed, with a flat base and both triangular and rectangular facets, similar in overall appearance to other Mughal era diamonds which are now in the Iranian Crown Jewels.[39]\\r\\n\\r\\nDisappointment in the appearance of the stone was not uncommon. After consulting various mineralogists, including Sir David Brewster, it was decided by Prince Albert, the husband of Queen Victoria, with the consent of the government, to polish the Koh-i-Noor. One of the largest and most famous Dutch diamond merchants, Mozes Coster, was employed for the task. He sent to London one of his most experienced artisans, Levie Benjamin Voorzanger, and his assistants.[22]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 17 July 1852, the cutting began at the factory of Garrard & Co. in Haymarket, using a steam-powered mill built specially for the job by Maudslay, Sons and Field.[40] Under the supervision of Prince Albert and the Duke of Wellington, and the technical direction of the queen's mineralogist, James Tennant, the cutting took thirty-eight days. Albert spent a total of S8,000 on the operation,[41]  which reduced the weight of the diamond from 186 old carats (191 modern carats or 38.2?g) to its current 105.6 carats (21.12?g).[42] The stone measures 3.6?cm (1.4?in) long, 3.2?cm (1.3?in) wide, and 1.3?cm (0.5?in) deep.[43] Brilliant-cut diamonds usually have fifty-eight facets, but the Koh-i-Noor has eight additional \\"star\\" facets around the culet, making a total of sixty-six facets.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe great loss of weight is to some extent accounted for by the fact that Voorzanger discovered several flaws, one especially big, that he found it necessary to cut away.[22] Although Prince Albert was dissatisfied with such a huge reduction, most experts agreed that Voorzanger had made the right decision and carried out his job with impeccable skill.[41] When Queen Victoria showed the re-cut diamond to the young Maharaja Duleep Singh, the Koh-i-Noor's last non-British owner, he was apparently unable to speak for several minutes afterwards.[42]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe much lighter but more dazzling stone was mounted in a honeysuckle brooch and a circlet worn by the queen.[3] At this time, it belonged to her personally, and was not yet part of the Crown Jewels.[22] Although Victoria wore it often, she became uneasy about the way in which the diamond had been acquired. In a letter to her eldest daughter, Victoria, Princess Royal, she wrote in the 1870s: \\"No one feels more strongly than I do about India or how much I opposed our taking those countries and I think no more will be taken, for it is very wrong and no advantage to us. You know also how I dislike wearing the Koh-i-Noor\\".[44]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter Queen Victoria's death, the Koh-i-Noor was set in the Crown of Queen Alexandra, the wife of Edward VII, that was used to crown her at their coronation in 1902. The diamond was transferred to Queen Mary's Crown in 1911,[45] and finally to The Queen Mother's Crown in 1937.[46] When The Queen Mother died in 2002, the crown was placed on top of her coffin for the lying-in-state and funeral.[47]\\r\\n\\r\\nAll these crowns are on display in the Jewel House at the Tower of London with crystal replicas of the diamond set in the older crowns.[48] The original bracelet given to Queen Victoria can also be seen there. A glass model of the Koh-i-Noor shows visitors how it looked when it was brought to the United Kingdom. Replicas of the diamond in this and its re-cut forms can also be seen in the 'Vault' exhibit at the Natural History Museum in London.[49]\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the Second World War, the Crown Jewels were moved from their home at the Tower of London to Windsor Castle.[50] In 1990, The Sunday Telegraph, citing a biography of the French army general, Jean de Lattre de Tassigny, by his widow, Simonne, reported that George VI hid the Koh-i-Noor at the bottom of a pond or lake near Windsor Castle, about 32?km (20?miles) outside London, where it remained until after the war. The only people who knew of the hiding place were the king and his librarian, Sir?Owen Morshead, who apparently revealed the secret to the general and his wife on their visit to England in 1949.[51]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Koh-i-Noor has long been a subject of diplomatic controversy, with India, Pakistan, Iran, and Afghanistan all demanding its return from the UK at various points.[52]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Government of India, believing the gem was rightfully theirs, first demanded the return of the Koh-i-Noor as soon as independence was granted in 1947. A second request followed in 1953, the year of the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II. Each time, the British government rejected the claims, saying that ownership was non-negotiable.[41]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2000, several members of the Indian Parliament signed a letter calling for the diamond to be given back to India, claiming it was taken illegally.[29] British officials said that a variety of claims meant it was impossible to establish the diamond's original owner,[53] and that it had been part of Britain's heritage for more than 150 years.[54]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn July 2010, while visiting India, David Cameron, the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, said of returning the diamond, \\"If you say yes to one you suddenly find the British Museum would be empty. I am afraid to say, it is going to have to stay put\\".[41] On a subsequent visit in February 2013, he said, \\"They're not having that back\\".[55]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn April 2016, the Indian Culture Ministry stated it would make \\"all possible efforts\\" to arrange the return of the Koh-i-Noor to India.[56] It was despite the Indian Government earlier conceding that the diamond was a gift. The Solicitor General of India had made the announcement before the Supreme Court of India due to public interest litigation by a campaign group.[57] He said \\"It was given voluntarily by Ranjit Singh to the British as compensation for help in the Sikh wars. The Koh-i-Noor is not a stolen object\\".[58]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1976, Pakistan asserted its ownership of the diamond, saying its return would be \\"a convincing demonstration of the spirit that moved Britain voluntarily to shed its imperial encumbrances and lead the process of decolonisation\\". In a letter to the Prime Minister of Pakistan, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, James Callaghan, wrote, \\"I need not remind you of the various hands through which the stone has passed over the past two centuries, nor that explicit provision for its transfer to the British crown was made in the peace treaty with the Maharajah of Lahore in 1849. I could not advise Her Majesty that it should be surrendered\\".[59]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2000, the Taliban's foreign affairs spokesman, Faiz Ahmed Faiz, said the Koh-i-Noor was the legitimate property of Afghanistan, and demanded for it to be handed over to the regime. \\"The history of the diamond shows it was taken from us (Afghanistan) to India, and from there to Britain. We have a much better claim than the Indians\\", he said.[53] The Afghan claim derives from Shah Shuja Durrani memoirs, which states he surrendered the diamond to Ranjit Singh while Singh was having his son tortured in front of him, so argue the Maharajah of Lahore acquired the stone illegitimately.[60]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Koh-i-Noor made its first appearance in popular culture in The Moonstone (1868), a 19th-century British epistolary novel by Wilkie Collins, generally considered to be the first full length detective novel in the English language. In his preface to the first edition of the book, Collins says that he based his eponymous \\"Moonstone\\" on the histories of two stones: the Orlov, a 189.62-carat (37.9?g) diamond in the Russian Imperial Sceptre, and the Koh-i-Noor.[61] In the 1966 Penguin Books edition of The Moonstone, J. I. M. Stewart states that Collins used G. C. King's The Natural History, Ancient and Modern, of Precious Stones  (1865) to research the history of the Koh-i-Noor.[62] The Koh-i-Noor also features in Agatha Christie's 1925 novel The Secret of Chimneys where it is hidden somewhere inside a large country house and is discovered at the end of the novel. The diamond had been stolen from the Tower of London by a Parisian gang leader called King Victor who replaced it with a replica stone.[63] In the Assassin's Creed saga the Koh-i-Noor is described as a copy of the original, an ancient artifact from a pre-human civilization with great powers.[64]","input":"Which country has the world famous kohinoor diamond?"},{"output":"about 26,400","context":"Subway is an American privately held fast food restaurant franchise that primarily sells submarine sandwiches (subs) and salads.

However, with 26,744 locations, it remained the most ubiquitous restaurant chain in the U.S. (with McDonald's in the #2 spot).[25] Also in 2016, Subway announced a new logo for the franchise, to be implemented in 2017.[26] On July 17, 2017, Subway unveiled redesigned restaurants, dubbed \\"Fresh Forward.\\" Features include self-order kiosks; USB charging ports at tables; and new menu items, including additional condiments, and bread made without gluten. The company is piloting the changes at 12 locations across the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom, with many features expected to be implemented into stores worldwide by the end of 2017.[27]\\r\\nIn 2017, the chain closed more than 800 of its U.S. locations. In April 2018, the chain announced it would close about 500 more that year. According Abha Bhattarai of The Washington Post, this is a result of three consecutive years of falling profits, and foot traffic in Subway stores reduced by 25 percent since 2012. Franchisees also complained that the company's deep promotions further ate away at profits. Industry analysts like Bob Phibbs, chief executive of the New York-based consulting firm Retail Doctor, say changing tastes on the part of consumers, who more frequently prefer locally sourced produce and hormone-free meat served by regional start-ups like Sweetgreen, especially in Metropolitan areas, are the cause of the drop in Subway's sales, as well as loss of market share to competitors. These include fast-casual eateries and sandwich shops like Panera Bread, Au Bon Pain and Firehouse Subs, as well as food trucks, and grocery stores that offer freshly made meals at competitive prices.

In 2006, \\"personal pizzas\\" debuted in some US markets. These are made to order (like the subs) and heated for 85 seconds. Breakfast and pizza items are only available in some stores. In November 2009, Subway signed a deal to serve exclusively Seattle's Best Coffee coffee as part of its breakfast menu in the US.[31]\\r\\nA 2009 Zagat survey named Subway the best provider of \\"Healthy Options\\" (in the \\"Mega Chain\\" category).

It placed second in \\"Top Overall\\", behind Wendy's.[32]\\r\\nOn April 18, 2017, Subway announced the addition of paninis to its menu. Chipotle Steak & Cheese, Triple Cheese, Chicken Cordon Bleu, and Italian B.M.T. Melt were the four variations announced.[33]\\r\\nSubway's menu varies between countries, most significantly where there are religious requirements relating to the meats served.\\r\\nIn 2006, the first kosher Subway restaurant in the United States opened, in a suburb of Cleveland, Ohio in the Mandel JCC of Cleveland. Former Subway spokesman Jared Fogle attended the opening. A press release stated, \\"With slight modifications, such as no pork-based products, and the use of soy-based cheese product, the menu is virtually identical to that of any other Subway restaurant.\\"[34] Other openings soon followed, briefly making Subway one of the largest U.S. kosher restaurant chains.[35] At their peak, twelve kosher Subway locations were open in the U.S, including Kansas City and 5 in New York. As of 2011, only five remain, in Cleveland, Miami, Los Angeles and two stores in Maryland.[36] Franchisees who failed noted a lack of support from the parent location in advertising, higher costs of kosher food and supervision, the inability to remain open on Saturdays, and that customers who do not keep kosher prefer the original menu and prices.[36]\\r\\nSubway opened its first restaurant in India in 2001 in New Delhi. Subway restaurants in India do not serve beef and pork products in deference to Hindu and Muslim beliefs respectively and sell an extended vegetarian range due to the large number of vegetarians in the country. There are 591 Subway restaurants in 68 cities of India as of January 2017.[37] On September 4, 2012, Subway opened its first all-vegetarian outlet on the campus of Lovely Professional University (LPU) in Jalandhar, Punjab.[38] On March 6, 2013, Subway opened its second all-vegetarian outlet also offering Jain food in Paldi, Ahmedabad.[39]\\r\\nIn 2011, Subway introduced gluten-free bread and brownies to some locations in Texas.[40] It also cut the salt content of its sandwiches by 15 percent.[41]\\r\\nIn the United Kingdom and Ireland, Subway has reduced salt content across its entire range by 33% and has committed to further reductions, in line with government targets.[42] Subway's range of \\"Low Fat\\" subs is endorsed by the charity Heart Research UK.[43]\\r\\nSubway is the second-biggest fast food advertiser in the United States, behind only McDonald's. It spent US$516,000,000 on measurable advertising in 2011.[44]\\r\\nSubway used the advertising slogan \\"Eat Fresh\\", and focused on how its sandwiches were made from freshly baked bread and fresh ingredients, in front of customers to their exact specifications, by employees which Subway called \\"Subway Sandwich Artists\\".\\r\\nIn 2005, Subway scrapped its \\"Sub Club\\" stamp promotion, citing a growing number of counterfeit stamps due to online auction sites and the increasing availability of high-quality printers.[45][46]\\r\\nIn November 2007, Subway's US commercials featured the cartoon character Peter Griffin (from FOX's Family Guy) promoting its new Subway Feast sandwich.[47] Subway has also used \\"instant win\\" games, based on the game Scrabble.\\r\\nSubway ran a product placement campaign in the US TV series Chuck since its first season. As ratings dwindled in the second season, a campaign to \\"save Chuck\\" was launched for fans, encouraging them to purchase a footlong sub from Subway on April 27, 2009, the date of the season finale. Tony Pace, Subway's marketing officer, called it the best product placement the restaurant chain has done \\"in several years.\\"[48]\\r\\nTo celebrate National Sandwich Day on November 3, 2015, Subway offered a Buy One sandwich, Give One sandwich free promotion.[49]\\r\\nSubway has sponsored a number of sports events, particularly NASCAR races, including the Subway 400 (2002ÿ2004), Subway 500 (2003ÿ2007), Subway Fresh 500 (2005ÿ2013) and the Subway Firecracker 250 (2009ÿ2016). Subway sponsored the Subway Super Series ice hockey tournament from 2009ÿ2014.\\r\\nJared Fogle was a national spokesman for the company in the US starting in January 2000, giving talks on healthy living and appearing in advertisements. Fogle first came to attention in his native Indiana by claiming that he lost over 200 pounds in part by eating at Subway. From 2008, he was featured less often as the company marketed with more emphasis on its \\"5 dollar footlong\\" campaign.[50] Subway attributed between one-third and one-half of its growth from 1998 to 2011 to Fogle, the equivalent of a tripling in size.[51] Subway cut ties with Fogle on August 18, 2015, amid expectations that he would plead guilty to child pornography and child molestation charges,[52] which were confirmed the following day.[53] In November 2015, he was sentenced to more than 15 years in federal prison.[54]\\r\\nIn December 2015, following the removal of Fogle from its marketing, Subway introduced a new marketing campaign, \\"Founded on Fresh\\". The campaign focuses on Subway's establishment and early history, and features Fred DeLuca, as played by his son, Jonathon. The new campaign downplays the use of jingles and celebrity endorsements (besides \\"targeted\\" sports marketing), in favor of focusing upon the qualities of its products, and specific products. Chief advertising officer Chris Carroll explained that the focus on fat, calories, and weight loss were \\"what fresh used to be\\", and that the new campaign would focus more on the sourcing of Subway's ingredients, such as its phase-out of antibiotic-treated meat. Carroll also explained that the new strategy was being developed prior to the controversy involving Fogle.[55]\\r\\nIn 2008, Subway began to offer all foot-long submarine sandwiches (excluding premium and double-meat varieties) for five dollars, in the continental United States and Canada, as a \\"limited time only\\" promotion. \\"Five Dollar Footlongs\\" quickly became the company's most successful promotion ever.[56] Upon the initial promotion's completion, customer response prompted Subway to create a permanent \\"$5 Footlong Everyday Value Menu\\" that offered some footlong sandwiches for $5. As of 2011, there has been a monthly rotating $5 footlong.[57]\\r\\nIn October 2011, a similar promotion was launched in the United Kingdom. Customers can buy one of nine subs and any drink for S3 (for a six-inch sub) or S5 (for a footlong).[58]\\r\\nIn 2012, San Francisco discontinued the five-dollar footlong promotion due to the higher cost of doing business in the city.[59] From June 2014 to the end of that year, some Subway locations began discontinuing the $5 dollar promotion.[60] On November 1, 2014, Subway discontinued the five-dollar footlong promotion, replacing it with the Simple $6 Menu which included a six-inch select with a drink and a choice of cookies or chips.[61][62]\\r\\nOn February 4, 2016, all classic footlongs were declared to be set at a new cost of $6 each.[63]\\r\\nOn January 1, 2018, the $5 promotion returned with a $4.99 footlong menu of five subs, at participating locations.[64][65][66]\\r\\nIn early 2017, Subway introduced its Italian Hero, and advertised it with a campaign describing it as an authentic Italian[-American] sandwich. Two comedic spots feature stereotypical Italian-American characters on and around the stoop of a New York / New Jersey tenement building, one including a cameo by sportscaster Dick Vitale. Another ad features Food Network's Jeff Mauro, the \\"Sandwich King\\", who is Italian-American,[67] discussing the nature and role of the different Italian meats and other ingredients.[68][69][70][71][72][73]\\r\\nOn December 28, 2015, Subway released a commitment to transition to a 100% cage-free egg supply chain by 2025.[74]\\r\\nOn April 28, 2017, Subway released a chicken welfare policy[75] that states that by 2024 or sooner, 100% of its U.S. chicken products will be produced in alignment with Global Animal Partnership (GAP) standards for higher welfare breeds, enhanced living environments (including lighting, litter, and enrichment), increased activity levels and optimized stocking density, and improved slaughter methods. To ensure compliance, Subways chicken suppliers will be third-party audited with updates communicated annually.[76]\\r\\nThe policy announcement followed a nationwide campaign led by high school animal activist Lia Hyman in coordination with the animal protection NGO The Humane League.[77] On April 20, 2017, Hyman and a group of activists traveled to Subways global headquarters in Connecticut to deliver more than 53,000 signatures from campaign supporters and held a demonstration outside the building after they were denied entry.[78]\\r\\nIn September 1999, at least 32 customers in the north Seattle area contracted hepatitis A after eating food contaminated with the virus at two Subway outlets.[79] The virus, which is spread by eating or drinking food or water contaminated with infected feces, infects the liver causing nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, fatigue, and fever.[80] Subsequent investigations found that staff failed to adhere to thorough hand washing and the use of plastic gloves during food preparation.[81] A class-action lawsuit on behalf of 31 victims was resolved for $1.6 million.[82][83] The most seriously affected victima 6-year-old boysuffered acute liver failure and required a liver transplant. He was awarded $10 million in an out-of-court settlement in 2001.[81] A previous outbreak of hepatitis A in 1996 had also involved a Subway outlet in the Seattle area, although no legal action had resulted.[79]\\r\\nIn April 2015, the Arkansas Department of Health issued a warning to the public that customers who had eaten at the Subway outlet in Morrilton, Arkansas, may have been exposed to infection after an employee tested positive for the virus.[84][85]\\r\\nOn February 2, 2007, KNXV-TV (with the help of the Arizona Department of Weights and Measures) reported that three of Subway's \\"Giant Sub\\" sandwiches, nominally each 3-foot (91?cm) long, were actually 2?feet 8?inches (81?cm), 2?feet 8.25?inches (81.92?cm), and 2?feet 8.5?inches (82.6?cm) long. The maximum variance in length allowed in Arizona is 3% (1.08 inches (2.7?cm), for a three-foot sub). The report also showed the boxes designed to store these sandwiches were 2?feet 10.75?inches (88.27?cm) in length; shorter than the maximum allowable variance. In response to the report, Subway said it was reevaluating its advertising, training and packaging materials with regard to the specific or implied length of Giant Subs, and was advising its franchisees to only discuss with customers the approximate number of expected servings and not a specific length of measurement.[86]\\r\\nIn January 2013, an Australian teen, Matt Corby, complained on Facebook that Subway's \\"footlong\\" sandwich was only 11 inches (28?cm) long, rather than 1 foot (30?cm). Subway responded by saying, \\"With regards to the size of the bread and calling it a footlong, 'Subway Footlong' is a registered trademark as a descriptive name for the sub sold in Subway Restaurants and not intended to be a measurement of length.\\"[87] Discovery during a subsequent class-action lawsuit revealed that most Subway sandwiches were the advertised length. A $530,000 settlement was thrown out of court in 2017 for being \\"utterly worthless\\" to consumers.[88][89]\\r\\nIn 1995, Subway Sandwich Shops, Fred DeLuca, Peter Buck, and Doctor's Associates Inc. were held liable for breach of contract. An Illinois jury awarded more than $10 million in damages to Nicholas and Victoria Jannotta after finding lease and contract violations. The plaintiffs claimed the defendants had misrepresented the asset value of Subway Sandwich Shops (a leasing company used by Doctor's Associates for franchising purposes) while negotiating a 1985 lease agreement.[90]\\r\\nThe U.S. House of Representatives' small business committee studied the franchise industry from 1992 to 1998. Dean Sagar noted, \\"Subway is the biggest problem in franchising and emerges as one of the key examples of every abuse you can think of.\\"[91] In 1989, the U.S. Small Business Administration refused small business loans to Subway franchise owners until Subway removed a contract clause which gave it the power to seize and purchase any franchise without cause. The Dallas Morning News reported Subway had seized American soldier Leon Batie Jr.'s Subway stores in 2006 while he was serving in Afghanistan.[92] He had been deployed to support Operation Enduring Freedom in March 2005, three years after buying his first restaurant.[92] Batie alleged Subway had violated the U.S. Servicemembers Civil Relief Act. He filed a federal lawsuit against Subway, which was dismissed. He then filed suit in state court, in Dallas County, Texas. Both parties settled on \\"mutually agreeable\\" and confidential terms in January 2010.[93]\\r\\nIn October 2010, Subway franchisees in the United Kingdom lost a high court appeal, against paying standard VAT on all toasted subs, as required by HM Revenue and Customs. Thus, in the United Kingdom, a toasted sub attracts VAT, whereas a cold sub, eaten off the premises, does not. Competitors such as Quiznos & McDonald's do not pay VAT on similar food.[94][95][96]\\r\\nIn March 2012, Chancellor of the Exchequer, George Osborne announced plans to close the loophole that allows Subway competitors to offer hot food without paying VAT. This legislation was expected to come into force from October 2012 onward,[97] but the government withdrew plans to charge VAT on originally hot food being allowed to cool naturally on May 28, 2012.[98] In June 2012, Subway launched the \\"Toast the Tax\\" campaign to put pressure on the government to drop VAT on toasted sandwiches, as it has done for hot savouries.[99]\\r\\nOn January 31, 2011, Subway lawyer Valerie Pochron, wrote to Casey's General Stores, a chain of Iowa-based convenience stores, demanding the small chain to cease using the term \\"footlong\\" in advertisements for its 12-inch sandwiches. Subway threatened to sue. Consequently, in February 2011, Casey's General Stores Inc. filed a petition in a U.S. District Court in Des Moines, seeking a legal declaration that the word \\"footlong\\" does not violate Subway's rights.[100] Casey's further sought a declaration that the word \\"footlong\\" is a generic description of a sandwich measuring one foot.[101][102] Before serving its complaint on Subway, Casey's voluntarily dismissed its action, ending the litigation.[103]\\r\\nSubway's trademark application for \\"footlong\\" has yet to be approved by the federal government. Subway has attempted to register it with the United States Patent and Trademark Office twice. It filed on November 8, 2007,[104] and June 4, 2009.[105] Yum Brands (KFC, Pizza Hut, Taco Bell and non-Canadian A&W locations), Long John Silver's and other competitors are opposing that application.[100]\\r\\nSubway made alterations to its bread after food blogger and activist Vani Hari gathered more than 50,000 signatures in a petition drive. Subway removed azodicarbonamide from its bread.[106] Before Vani Hari's petition, Subway had used azodicarbonamide as a bread conditioner, to whiten the dough and allow sandwich bread to bake more quickly. The ingredient is still used by other fast food restaurants.[107]\\r\\nIn August 2015, Vani Hari again petitioned Subway in conjunction with Natural Resources Defense Council, Friends of the Earth, the Center for Food Safety, U.S. Public Interest Research Group to commit to buying meat produced without the routine use of antibiotics and to provide a timeline for doing so.[108] In October 2015, Subway announced it would transition to chicken raised without antibiotics in 2016 and turkey within the following 2ÿ3 years, and would also transition beef and pork raised without antibiotics by 2025.[109][110]\\r\\nIn an investigation by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC)'s consumer affairs television series Marketplace aired in February 2017, chicken from five fast food restaurants were lab-tested to determine constituents. While DNA testing found between 84.9% and 89.4% of the DNA from other restaurants' chicken products to be chicken DNA, with the remaining being unidentifiable plant DNA, on the two Subway chicken items tested, 53.6% and 42.8% of the DNA was found to be chicken, with the remainder being mostly soy. Although ingredients listings did show soy protein to be a constituent of both of the chicken products, Subway states that the proportion is less than or equal to 1%, and that the finding of about 50% soy DNA is not representative of the actual amount of soy in the product. Subway has called CBC's report \\"absolutely false and misleading\\" and demanded that it be retracted, a demand the CBC had not acceded to as of July?2017[update]. Meanwhile, however, Subway Canada stated that it was investigating with its supplier to ensure that the proportion of soy protein was as per expectations.[111][112][113][114][115]\\r\\nAccording to Subway's website, ingredients in U.S. stores may differ from ingredients in Canadian stores. Both countries include soy protein in chicken strips, but only the U.S. version states that it is present in quantities of 2% or less. The Canadian version includes soy as an ingredient in its chicken patty, but the United States version does not.[116]\\r\\nIn April 2017, Subway sued the CBC, as well as the reporter and two producers, for $210 million, alleging the CBC acted \\"recklessly and maliciously\\", and that \\"these false statements... were published and republished, maliciously and without just cause or excuse, to a global audience, which has resulted in pecuniary loss to the plaintiffs.\\" The CBC stood by its reports, stating that the DNA tests were done by independent and credible experts.[117] The CBC's Emma Bdard stated that Subway has not provided any alternative explanation for the DNA test results obtained by the CBC.[118]","input":"How many subway are there in the us?"},{"output":"Rogue One: A Star Wars Story","context":"","input":"What is the last two star wars movies?"},{"output":"since the mid-18th century","context":"","input":"When was pi first used in its present form?"},{"output":"DeVoe","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe fourth season of the American television series The Flash, which is based on the DC Comics character Barry Allen / Flash, premiered on The CW on October 10, 2017, and ran for 23 episodes until May 22, 2018. The season follows a crime scene investigator with superhuman speed who fights criminals, including others who have also gained superhuman abilities. It is set in the Arrowverse, sharing continuity with the other television series of the universe, and is a spin-off of Arrow. The season is produced by Berlanti Productions, Warner Bros. Television, and DC Entertainment, with Andrew Kreisberg and Todd Helbing serving as showrunners.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe season was ordered in January 2017, and filming began that July. Grant Gustin stars as Barry, with principal cast members Candice Patton, Danielle Panabaker, Carlos Valdes, Keiynan Lonsdale, Tom Cavanagh, and Jesse L. Martin also returning from previous seasons, and are joined by Neil Sandilands.\\r\\n\\r\\nBarry, Oliver, Sara, Alex, Martin and Jax wake up in a Nazi concentration camp on Earth-X wearing power dampeners. The arriving SS Sturmbannfhrer is revealed to be the Earth-X doppelg?nger of Quentin Lance, who plans to execute them, but they are saved by Citizen Cold (the Earth-X doppelg?nger of Leonard Snart) and Ray Terrill. Snart and Terrill take them to the headquarters of the Freedom Fighters, where the team meets the resistance movement's leader, General Schott (Winn Schott's Earth-X doppelg?nger). They learn that the only way back to Earth-1 is through a temporal gateway in a research facility, which Schott plans to blow up to strand Dark Arrow (Oliver's Earth-X doppelg?nger) on Earth-1. Oliver disguises himself as Dark Arrow to infiltrate the facility and discovers the Nazi doomsday device against parallel Earths is a militarized timeship called Wellenreiter. Barry and Ray battle the Freedom Fighters' Red Tornado to stop it from destroying the gateway while the rest of the team enters the facility to reactivate its portal, during which Stein is shot and gravely wounded. On Earth-1, Eobard Thawne prepares to perform surgery on Kara to save Overgirl. Felicity and Iris try to stop him, but are captured.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe series was renewed for a fourth season on January 8, 2017,[54] earlier than usual for the series. Executive producer Andrew Kreisberg said on this, \\"The great thing about our dear friends at The CW and Mark Pedowitz picking the shows up as early as they did has allowed us to start building the schedules for next season.\\"[55] In May 2017, it was announced that Aaron Helbing would not return as an executive producer for season four, with only Greg Berlanti, Andrew Kreisberg, Sarah Schechter, and Todd Helbing returning from previous seasons.[56] Todd Helbing and Kreisberg were slated to serve as the season's showrunners.[57][58] In November 2017, Kreisberg was suspended from his role as executive producer and showrunner on The Flash over allegations of sexual harassment.[59][60] By the end of the month, he had been fired, with his name eventually being removed from the credits from all shows he worked on. In addition, Berlanti would take additional responsibilities working with Helbing to co-showrun the season.[61]\\r\\n\\r\\nGrant Gustin on the rebirth of Barry in season four.[62]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn March 2017, Kreisberg  confirmed that the main villain for the fourth season would not be a speedster, like the previous three seasons.[63] Executive producers Aaron and Todd Helbing also mentioned that there would be less time travel in the season, with Aaron saying, \\"We like playing with the timelines and the different time periods and future and past. For now, I think we're going to focus on the present.\\"[64]  In June 2017, Clifford DeVoe / Thinker was reported to be the main antagonist of the season. He was first hinted in the third season episode \\"Abra Kadabra\\" when the titular villain mentions him among the Flash's greatest enemies, and again in the season finale \\"Finish Line\\" when Savitar mentions facing DeVoe but states that the Flash has not dealt with him yet.[65] At the series' San Diego Comic-Con panel, the speculation was confirmed, with Todd Helbing saying, \\"With three Speedsters in a row, this year it's the fastest man alive against the fastest mind alive.\\"[27] He added that the writers were \\"making a conscious effort this year to get the fun quotient back up\\".[66]\\r\\n\\r\\nRegarding the possibility of Wally West taking on the mantle of the Flash in Barry's absence, Keiynan Lonsdale said that \\"It's not something that's on my radar. I feel as though there is so much story to tell and Wally has so much growing to do... We need to see how these character realistically get to where they are headed for.\\"[67] With the action picking up six months after season three, Kid Flash and Vibe are left to protect Central City, with Carlos Valdes saying \\"the team is sort of clutching at straws to keep the city together,... there is a unanimous feeling amongst the remaining members that it's just not the same without Barry... So in light of that, Cisco does whatever it takes to get his friends back.\\"[68] Valdes also confirmed the return of Cisco's more lighthearted joking manner.[68]\\r\\nCandice Patton explained Iris West's larger role within Team Flash as \\"a way of distracting herself,\\"[68] adding that \\"[Iris] is forced to deal with that anger and resentment and abandonment by kind of focusing on protecting Central City... We're seeing a very different Iris, almost a very hardened Iris.\\"[69] Kreisberg also hinted at some major growth for Iris this season, and noted that \\"the season premiere is all about Iris and Cisco, not Barry\\".[70]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn July 2017, Sterling Gates, DC Comics comic book writer, joined as a member of the fourth season's writing staff.[71] At the Television Critics Association press tour in August 2017, Pedowitz stated that the fourth season of The Flash is \\"going to try to find the lightness... of the Barry Allen of the first two seasons,\\"[72] and said that the show was likely \\"done with Speedster villains\\".[73] Later in the month, Kreisberg confirmed the return of Harry Wells from Earth-2, saying that \\"season 4 for Harry is really realizing what he's missing in his life and what it is he needs to become a better, more complete person, and so he's going to be going on a fairly epic emotional journey this season that is tied to the Thinker's plan,\\" in addition to confirming the introduction of a new version of the Wells character.[74]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn September 2017, Helbing noted \\"There's a lot of love in the air this season,\\" and compared Barry and Iris' reunion to \\"somebody going off to war for six months and coming back. There's a lot that Iris experienced that Barry didn't when he was gone, and it's really [about] the fun and the emotional component of making up that time when they weren't together.\\" Helbing also explained that the Speed Force \\"let [Barry] deal with all of the baggage [from the past three seasons]. When he comes out, he's sort of left that all behind.\\"[75] That month, Kreisberg also confirmed that Barry and Iris will be getting married this season,[76] while also revealing that the pair will be going to couples therapy since \\"[they] keep comically clashing inadvertently because [both are] used to being in charge, and so they wind up going... to work through it.\\" He added, \\"The two of them with the therapist is some of the funniest stuff we have ever done on this show, but it also leads to a deepening of their relationship.\\"[77]\\r\\n\\r\\nMain cast members Grant Gustin, Candice Patton, Danielle Panabaker, Carlos Valdes, Keiynan Lonsdale, Tom Cavanagh, and Jesse L. Martin return from previous seasons as Barry Allen / The Flash, Iris West, Caitlin Snow / Killer Frost, Cisco Ramon / Vibe, Wally West / Kid Flash, Harrison Wells, and Joe West, respectively.[24] Cavanagh primarily portrayed Harry Wells from Earth-2 in the season,[68] in addition to several other versions of Wells in smaller roles: Herr Wells of Earth-12, Wells 2.0 of Earth-22, H. Lothario Wells of Earth-47, Wells the Grey of Earth-13,[78] Sonny Wells of Earth-24 and H.P. Wells of Earth-25.[79] Also returning from earlier in the series is Jessica Camacho as Gypsy.[28] It was revealed that Tom Felton, who joined the cast as Julian Albert in the third season, would not be a series regular in the fourth season, and that there were no plans for him to appear.[80] Julian's absence will be addressed \\"pretty quickly? there's a reason why he's no longer with the team,\\" said Helbing.[81] In the season premiere, it is revealed that Julian has returned to London.[82] Kreisberg also confirmed that he had put on hold the planned return of Violett Beane as Jesse Quick due to the high number of speedsters on the show, but did not rule out a possible return in the future.[83] Beane eventually appeared as Jesse on the episode \\"Luck Be a Lady\\".[40] Britne Oldford, who previously appeared as Shawna Baez / Peek-a-Boo in the first season and the web series The Chronicles of Cisco, reprised her role in the season premiere.[35]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn July 2017, Neil Sandilands was announced to be cast as Clifford DeVoe, a metahuman genius who embarks on a seasonlong battle with the Flash in order to fix all that he deems wrong with humanity; while Kim Engelbrecht was announced as The Mechanic, DeVoe's right hand and a highly intelligent engineer who designs devices for him; and Danny Trejo as Breacher, a bounty hunter from Earth-19 and the father of Gypsy.[26] Also in June, the series was looking to cast a role that \\"should put the visual effects department to the test\\",[84] with the role later revealed to be Ralph Dibny / Elongated Man, a metahuman with the ability to stretch his body to superhuman lengths and sizes.[85] Hartley Sawyer was cast in the recurring role that July as the fast-talking private investigator who after discovering his abilities will help Team Flash solve one of Central City's greatest mysteries.[32] The character was previously mentioned in the first season, as one of the fourteen people who seemingly died as a result of the particle accelerator explosion.[86] The next month, Katee Sackhoff was announced in the recurring role of Amunet Black / Blacksmith, who operates an underground black market of metahuman supervillains.[33]\\r\\n\\r\\nFilming for the season began on July 4, 2017,[87] in Vancouver, British Columbia, and concluded on April 21, 2018.[88] Kevin Smith returned to direct an episode in January 2018.[89]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn August 2017, series composer Blake Neely and Nathaniel Blume began to compose the music for the fourth season.[90]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn May 2017, The CW president Mark Pedowitz officially announced plans for a four-show Arrowverse crossover event, crossing over episodes of the television series Supergirl, The Flash, Legends of Tomorrow, and Arrow.[91] The crossover, Crisis on Earth-X, began with Supergirl and a special airing of Arrow on November 27, 2017, and concluded on The Flash and Legends of Tomorrow on November 28.[92] In August 2017, Berlanti noted that it would be \\"a big life event for a few different people\\" that would bring them all together for the crossover, adding \\"There are many life events that happen.\\"[93] Prior to that, Arrow actress Emily Bett Rickards appears as Felicity Smoak in the fifth episode of the season.[33] Following the crossover, Katie Cassidy (who has previously appeared on The Flash as both Laurel Lance and Black Siren) appears in the nineteenth episode as Siren-X, an alternate version of Laurel from Earth-X. Arrow actor David Ramsey appears as John Diggle, as well as DeVoe's Diggle disguise earlier in the twenty-second episode.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe season began airing on October 10, 2017, on The CW in the United States,[94] and on CTV in Canada.[95] The season concluded on May 22, 2018.[96] Sky One acquired the rights to air the season in the UK & Ireland, airing it alongside the other Arrowverse shows. The season premiered October 17.[97][98]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn July 2017, cast from the series appeared at San Diego Comic-Con International to promote the season, where exclusive footage was shown.[99] During the panel, a trailer for the season was shown, with James Whitbrook at io9 feeling that despite the \\"grim\\" tone, there was \\"some fun signs of the team coming together to protect the city without [Barry],...

Ohio's swallowtail flag is the only non-rectangular U.S. state flag. Its red, white, and blue elements symbolize the state's natural features and order of admission into the Union. A prominent disc in the flag's triangular canton is suggestive of the state's name.\\r\\nThe flag was designed in 1901 by John Eisenmann for the Pan-American Exposition and adopted in 1902. Before that, for nearly a century after statehood, Ohio did not have a legally-authorized state flag. One unsuccessful proposal called for a design based on the state seal.\\r\\nOhio has adopted an official salute to the flag and a 17-step procedure for folding it. The Ohio flag has influenced a number of logos and municipal flags within the state. A scarlet-colored gubernatorial flag is based on the state seal.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Ohio state flag's design is defined in the Ohio Revised Code, section 5.01:\\r\\nThe flag of the state shall be burgee-shaped. It shall have three red and two white horizontal stripes that represent the roads and waterways of the state. The union of the flag shall be seventeen five-pointed stars, white in a blue triangular field that represents the state's hills and valleys, the base of which shall be the staff end or vertical edge of the flag, and the apex of which shall be the center of the middle red stripe. The stars shall be grouped around a red disc superimposed upon a white circular \\"O.\\" The thirteen stars grouped around the \\"O\\" represent the original states of the United States and the four stars added to the peak of the triangle symbolize that Ohio was the seventeenth state admitted to the union. The \\"O\\" represents the \\"O\\" in \\"Ohio\\" and suggests the state's nickname, the buckeye state. The proportional dimensions of the flag and of its various parts shall be according to the official design on file in the office of the secretary of state.[1]\\r\\nIn addition to resembling the letter O and a buckeye nut, the flag's annulus also represents \\"the original territory of Ohio\\" in the Northwest Territory.[2]\\r\\nOhio's flag is the only non-rectangular U.S. state flag. It is a rare example of a non-quadrilateral civil flag, another well-known example being the flag of Nepal. According to vexillologist Whitney Smith, it may be loosely based upon cavalry flags of the Civil War and SpanishÿAmerican War.[3][4] The flag has been officially defined as a \\"burgee\\" since 2002,[5][6] even though burgees are typically used as maritime flags. Its shape, lack of text, and mirror symmetry allow it to be flown or hung in various orientations without affecting legibility.[7] On account of the flag's uncommon shape, foreign manufacturers have occasionally set the entire design against a white, rectangular field.[3]\\r\\nFor nearly a century after statehood, Ohio had no legally authorized state flag. The state militia carried regimental colors based on the Stars and Stripes, with the addition of \\"a large eagle, with the number of the regiment and the prescribed number of stars above\\".[8]\\r\\nBy the early 1850s, Ohioans expressed interest in adopting a state flag, as several other states had already done. In late 1860, Qtr. Mr. Gen. David L. Wood and Adj. Gen. Henry B. Carrington devised a flag consisting of the state seal upon a white field. They had it flown above the Ohio State Arsenal in Columbus, in hopes that it might someday become the state flag. On January 17, 1861, at a banquet organized by the Columbus Typographical Union Local #5, future U.S. President James A. Garfield gave a speech defending the national flag as the only flag Ohio's soldiers would march to battle under. The generals, in attendance, were moved to set aside their proposal and hoist the Stars and Stripes in its place.[11] Later that year, Wood and Carrington joined fellow Ohioans in battle under the 34-star Union flag, which would serve as the inspiration for a state banner decades later.[12]\\r\\nIn 1901, Cleveland architect John Eisenmann was commissioned to design an exhibition hall for his state at the Pan-American Exposition in Buffalo, New York. He developed a distinctive flag to fly over each corner of the Ohio Building.[5] The wool flags officially represented the Ohio Pan-American Exposition Commission rather than the state. On July 18, Governor George K. Nash visited the exposition, where he was presented with one of the flags,[3] which is now held in the Ohio History Connection collections.[13] Eisenmann secured a U.S. design patent for his design, which he described as \\"a triangular forked or swallow-tailed flag corresponding to the shape generally known as a 'cavalry-guidon' or 'broad pennant.'\\"[14]\\r\\nIn 1902, State Representative William S. McKinnon, a member of the Ohio Pan-American Exposition Commission, introduced House Bill 213 designating Eisenmann's design as the official flag. It became law on May 9,[15] making it the 20th U.S. state flag or banner.[3] (Eisenmann had assigned his patent, which had a term of three and a half years, to the State of Ohio on April 24.[16])\\r\\nBecause Eisenmann's design deviated from the \\"seal on a bedsheet\\" design then nearly universal among state flags, the press looked overseas for precedents: the layout was likened to either the flag of Cuba[17] or of the Philippines,[18] while the red and white annulus was derided for its similarity to the sun on the Japanese flag.[15]\\r\\nInitially, Ohio's flag was seldom used, in part due to the prevailing opinion that the Stars and Stripes should hold a monopoly on patriotic displays. Similar sentiment hindered the adoption of municipal flags in Cleveland and Cincinnati, to the extent that both were downplaced as mere \\"banners\\" for promotional purposes.[3][19] In 1903, it was reported that, among state politicians, only Governor Nash displayed the guidon.[18]\\r\\nIn the century following its adoption, the guidon gained significant popularity, being flown not only by the state but frequently also by its residents and businesses.[3] In 2001, the North American Vexillological Association surveyed its members on the best design among the 72 official flags of the U.S. states and territories and Canadian provinces. Ohio's ranked 15th.[20]\\r\\nIn 2002, the Ohio General Assembly commemorated the 100th anniversary of the state flag's adoption by adopting a salute to the flag, to be recited after the Pledge of Allegiance:\\r\\nI salute the flag of the state of Ohio and pledge to the Buckeye State respect and loyalty.\\r\\nA method of folding the flag of Ohio was created by Alex Weinstock, an Ohio Boy Scout, for his Eagle Scout service project. It requires two people. The procedure was passed by the 125th Ohio General Assembly as House Bill 552 and signed into law by Governor Bob Taft on February 15, 2005:[21]\\r\\nThe general assembly hereby establishes a recommended procedure for the folding of the state flag by two people. The procedure is as follows:\\r\\nWith the flag unfolded, fold the flag in half lengthwise so that the points of the flag are aligned. Fold the flag in half lengthwise a second time to form a long strip with the red disc facing the ground. Next, fold the pointed end back onto itself to form a rectangle. These steps entail three folds.\\r\\nStarting on the end formed by the fold of the pointed end back onto itself, fold two inches of the flag onto itself for a flag with a three-foot hoist and a five-foot fly, or another appropriate width of fold for a flag of a different size. Repeat the folds a total of fourteen times, alternating the folds in a fan-like manner.\\r\\nOhio is not the only state that has designated a folding procedure for its flag;[22] however, Ohio's procedure takes on special importance due to the flag's irregular shape. A flag vendor in Arkansas has described the procedure as \\"quite a challenge\\".[23]\\r\\nOhio's flag is regularly flown during football games by The Ohio State University Marching Band's \\"JI-Row\\" as the percussion section's row mascot.[24] The Columbus Blue Jackets logo[25] and Cincinnati Bengals fan flag[26] are both based on the state flag.\\r\\nA number of municipalities and counties in Ohio have adopted pennants and swallowtails based on the state burgee. The city of Mentor and Adams County have flags that essentially replace the annulus with a seal and modify the pattern of stars in the triangular union.[3][27]\\r\\nThe flag of the Governor of Ohio consists of the Great Seal of Ohio encircled with 13 white stars on a scarlet field, with a five-point star in each corner. Like the state flag, it has 17 stars in total.\\r\\nThe Adjutant General's office adopted this design in 1905 to represent the Governor on official occasions.[28][29] One such flag hangs in the Rutherford B. Hayes Center Library, a memorial to the 32nd Ohio Governor and 19th U.S. President.[30] The design was officially recognized by the 96th General Assembly effective October 3, 1945:[28]\\r\\nIt shall have a white star in each of the four corners on an oblong scarlet background with the official seal of the state of Ohio in the center surrounded by thirteen white stars. The proportional dimensions of the flag and of its various parts shall be according to a design approved by the adjutant general and in accordance with the governor's flag used by the adjutant general's office for over thirty years.\\r\\nSince September 30, 1963, the flag has been defined in greater detail:[29]\\r\\nThe flag of the governor of this state will be of scarlet wool bunting, six feet eight inches hoist by ten feet six inches fly. In each of the four corners will be a white five-pointed star with one point upward. The centers of these stars will be twelve inches from the long edges and seventeen inches from the short edges of the flag. In the center of the flag will be a reproduction of the great seal of Ohio in proper colors, three feet in diameter, surrounded by thirteen white stars equally spaced with their centers on an imaginary circle four feet three inches in diameter. All stars shall be of such size that their points would lie on the circumference of an imaginary circle ten inches in diameter.\\r\\nThe Ohio Revised Code also specifies smaller versions of this design to be used as the governor's naval flag and automobile flag.","input":"What is the shape of the ohio flag called?"},{"output":"China","context":"Tobacco is a product prepared from the leaves of the tobacco plant by curing them. The plant is part of the genus Nicotiana and of the Solanaceae (nightshade) family. While more than 70 species of tobacco are known, the chief commercial crop is N. tabacum. The more potent variant N. rustica is also used around the world.\\r\\nTobacco contains the alkaloid nicotine, which is a stimulant, and harmala alkaloids.[2] Dried tobacco leaves are mainly used for smoking in cigarettes, cigars, pipe tobacco, and flavored shisha tobacco. They can also be consumed as snuff, chewing tobacco, dipping tobacco and snus.\\r\\nTobacco use is a risk factor for many diseases, especially those affecting the heart, liver, and lungs, as well as many cancers. In 2008, the World Health Organization named tobacco as the world's single greatest preventable cause of death.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe English word \\"tobacco\\" originates from the Spanish and Portuguese word \\"tabaco\\". The precise origin of this word is disputed, but it is generally thought to have derived at least in part, from Taino, the Arawakan language of the Caribbean. In Taino, it was said to mean either a roll of tobacco leaves (according to Bartolom de las Casas, 1552) or to tabago, a kind of Y-shaped pipe used for sniffing tobacco smoke (according to Oviedo; with the leaves themselves being referred to as cohiba).[4][5]\\r\\nHowever, perhaps coincidentally, similar words in Spanish, Portuguese and Italian were used from 1410 to define medicinal herbs believed to have originated from the Arabic ?????? ?ubbq (also ????? ?ubq), a word reportedly dating to the 9th century, as a name for various herbs.[6][7]\\r\\nTobacco has long been used in the Americas, with some cultivation sites in Mexico dating back to 1400ÿ1000 BC.[8] Many Native American tribes have traditionally grown and used tobacco. Eastern North American tribes historically carried tobacco in pouches as a readily accepted trade item, as well as smoking it, both socially and ceremonially, such as to seal a peace treaty or trade agreement.[9][10] In some populations, tobacco is seen as a gift from the Creator, with the ceremonial tobacco smoke carrying one's thoughts and prayers to the Creator.[11]\\r\\nFollowing the arrival of the Europeans to the Americas, tobacco became increasingly popular as a trade item. Hernndez de Boncalo, Spanish chronicler of the Indies, was the first European to bring tobacco seeds to the Old World in 1559 following orders of King Philip II of Spain. These seeds were planted in the outskirts of Toledo, more specifically in an area known as \\"Los Cigarrales\\" named after the continuous plagues of cicadas (cigarras in Spanish). Before the development of the lighter Virginia and white burley strains of tobacco, the smoke was too harsh to be inhaled. Small quantities were smoked at a time, using a pipe like the midwakh or kiseru or smoking newly invented waterpipes such as the bong or the hookah (see thu?c lo for a modern continuance of this practice). Tobacco became so popular that the English colony of Jamestown used it as currency and began exporting it as a cash crop; tobacco is often credited as being the export that saved Virginia from ruin.[12]\\r\\nThe alleged benefits of tobacco also account for its considerable success. The astronomer Thomas Harriot, who accompanied Sir Richard Grenville on his 1585 expedition to Roanoke Island, explains that the plant \\"openeth all the pores and passages of the body\\" so that the natives \\"bodies are notably preserved in health, and know not many grievous diseases, wherewithall we in England are often times afflicted.\\" [13]\\r\\nTobacco smoking, chewing, and snuffing became a major industry in Europe and its colonies by 1700.[14][15]\\r\\nTobacco has been a major cash crop in Cuba and in other parts of the Caribbean since the 18th century. Cuban cigars are world-famous.[16]\\r\\nIn the late 19th century, cigarettes became popular. James Bonsack created a machine that automated cigarette production. This increase in production allowed tremendous growth in the tobacco industry until the health revelations of the late-20th century.[17][18]\\r\\nFollowing the scientific revelations of the mid-20th century, tobacco became condemned as a health hazard, and eventually became encompassed as a cause for cancer, as well as other respiratory and circulatory diseases. In the United States, this led to the Tobacco Master Settlement Agreement, which settled the lawsuit in exchange for a combination of yearly payments to the states and voluntary restrictions on advertising and marketing of tobacco products.\\r\\nIn the 1970s, Brown & Williamson cross-bred a strain of tobacco to produce Y1. This strain of tobacco contained an unusually high amount of nicotine, nearly doubling its content from 3.2-3.5% to 6.5%. In the 1990s, this prompted the Food and Drug Administration to use this strain as evidence that tobacco companies were intentionally manipulating the nicotine content of cigarettes.[citation needed]\\r\\nIn 2003, in response to growth of tobacco use in developing countries, the World Health Organization[19] successfully rallied 168 countries to sign the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control. The convention is designed to push for effective legislation and its enforcement in all countries to reduce the harmful effects of tobacco. This led to the development of tobacco cessation products.\\r\\nMany species of tobacco are in the genus of herbs Nicotiana. It is part of the nightshade family (Solanaceae) indigenous to North and South America, Australia, south west Africa, and the South Pacific.[20]\\r\\nMost nightshades contain varying amounts of nicotine, a powerful neurotoxin to insects. However, tobaccos tend to contain a much higher concentration of nicotine than the others. Unlike many other Solanaceae species, they do not contain tropane alkaloids, which are often poisonous to humans and other animals.\\r\\nDespite containing enough nicotine and other compounds such as germacrene and anabasine and other piperidine alkaloids (varying between species) to deter most herbivores,[21] a number of such animals have evolved the ability to feed on Nicotiana species without being harmed. Nonetheless, tobacco is unpalatable to many species due to its other attributes. For example, although the cabbage looper is a generalist pest, tobacco's gummosis and trichomes can harm early larvae survival.[22] As a result, some tobacco plants (chiefly N. glauca) have become established as invasive weeds in some places.\\r\\nThe types of tobacco include:\\r\\nTobacco is cultivated similarly to other agricultural products. Seeds were at first quickly scattered onto the soil. However, young plants came under increasing attack from flea beetles (Epitrix cucumeris or E. pubescens), which caused destruction of half the tobacco crops in United States in 1876. By 1890, successful experiments were conducted that placed the plant in a frame covered by thin cotton fabric. Today, tobacco is sown in cold frames or hotbeds, as their germination is activated by light.[citation needed]\\r\\nIn the United States, tobacco is often fertilized with the mineral apatite, which partially starves the plant of nitrogen, to produce a more desired flavor.\\r\\nAfter the plants are about 8 inches (20?cm) tall, they are transplanted into the fields. Farmers used to have to wait for rainy weather to plant. A hole is created in the tilled earth with a tobacco peg, either a curved wooden tool or deer antler. After making two holes to the right and left, the planter would move forward two feet, select plants from his/her bag, and repeat. Various mechanical tobacco planters like Bemis, New Idea Setter, and New Holland Transplanter were invented in the late 19th and 20th centuries to automate the process: making the hole, watering it, guiding the plant in  all in one motion.[24]\\r\\nTobacco is cultivated annually, and can be harvested in several ways. In the oldest method still used today, the entire plant is harvested at once by cutting off the stalk at the ground with a tobacco knife. It is then speared onto sticks, four to six plants a stick and hung in a curing barn. In the 19th century, bright tobacco began to be harvested by pulling individual leaves off the stalk as they ripened. The leaves ripen from the ground upwards, so a field of tobacco harvested in this manner involves the serial harvest of a number of \\"primings\\", beginning with the volado leaves near the ground, working to the seco leaves in the middle of the plant, and finishing with the potent ligero leaves at the top. Before this, the crop must be topped when the pink flowers develop. Topping always refers to the removal of the tobacco flower before the leaves are systematically removed, and eventually, entirely harvested. As the industrial revolution took hold, harvesting wagons used to transport leaves were equipped with man-powered stringers, an apparatus that used twine to attach leaves to a pole. In modern times, large fields are harvested mechanically, although topping the flower and in some cases the plucking of immature leaves is still done by hand. Most tobacco in the U.S. is grown in North Carolina, Kentucky, and Virginia.[25]\\r\\nCuring and subsequent aging allow for the slow oxidation and degradation of carotenoids in tobacco leaf. This produces certain compounds in the tobacco leaves, and gives a sweet hay, tea, rose oil, or fruity aromatic flavor that contributes to the \\"smoothness\\" of the smoke. Starch is converted to sugar, which glycates protein, and is oxidized into advanced glycation endproducts (AGEs), a caramelization process that also adds flavor. Inhalation of these AGEs in tobacco smoke contributes to atherosclerosis and cancer.[26] Levels of AGEs are dependent on the curing method used.\\r\\nTobacco can be cured through several methods, including:\\r\\nSome tobaccos go through a second stage of curing, known as fermenting or sweating.[28] Cavendish undergoes fermentation pressed in a casing solution containing sugar and/or flavoring.[29]\\r\\nProduction of tobacco leaf increased by 40% between 1971, when 4.2 million tons of leaf were produced, and 1997, when 5.9 million tons of leaf were produced.[30] According to the Food and Agriculture organization of the UN, tobacco leaf production was expected to hit 7.1 million tons by 2010. This number is a bit lower than the record-high production of 1992, when 7.5 million tons of leaf were produced.[31] The production growth was almost entirely due to increased productivity by developing nations, where production increased by 128%.[32] During that same time, production in developed countries actually decreased.[31] China's increase in tobacco production was the single biggest factor in the increase in world production. China's share of the world market increased from 17% in 1971 to 47% in 1997.[30] This growth can be partially explained by the existence of a high import tariff on foreign tobacco entering China. While this tariff has been reduced from 64% in 1999 to 10% in 2004,[33] it still has led to local, Chinese cigarettes being preferred over foreign cigarettes because of their lower cost.\\r\\nEvery year, about 6.7 million tons of tobacco are produced throughout the world. The top producers of tobacco are China (39.6%), India (8.3%), Brazil (7.0%) and the United States (4.6%).[35]\\r\\nAround the peak of global tobacco production, 20 million rural Chinese households were producing tobacco on 2.1 million hectares of land.[36] While it is the major crop for millions of Chinese farmers, growing tobacco is not as profitable as cotton or sugarcane, because the Chinese government sets the market price. While this price is guaranteed, it is lower than the natural market price, because of the lack of market risk. To further control tobacco in their borders, China founded a State Tobacco Monopoly Administration (STMA) in 1982. The STMA controls tobacco production, marketing, imports, and exports, and contributes 12% to the nation's national income.[37] As noted above, despite the income generated for the state by profits from state-owned tobacco companies and the taxes paid by companies and retailers, China's government has acted to reduce tobacco use.[38]\\r\\nIndia's Tobacco Board is headquartered in Guntur in the state of Andhra Pradesh.[39] India has 96,865 registered tobacco farmers[40] and many more who are not registered. In 2010, 3,120 tobacco product manufacturing facilities were operating in all of India.[41] Around 0.25% of India's cultivated land is used for tobacco production.[42]\\r\\nSince 1947, the Indian government has supported growth in the tobacco industry. India has seven tobacco research centers, located in Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Punjab, Bihar, Mysore, and West Bengal houses the core research institute.\\r\\nIn Brazil, around 135,000 family farmers cite tobacco production as their main economic activity.[36] Tobacco has never exceeded 0.7% of the country's total cultivated area.[43] In the southern regions of Brazil, Virginia, and Amarelinho, flue-cured tobacco, as well as burley and Galp?o Comum air-cured tobacco, are produced. These types of tobacco are used for cigarettes. In the northeast, darker, air- and sun-cured tobacco is grown. These types of tobacco are used for cigars, twists, and dark cigarettes.[43] Brazil's government has made attempts to reduce the production of tobacco, but has not had a successful systematic antitobacco farming initiative. Brazil's government, however, provides small loans for family farms, including those that grow tobacco, through the Programa Nacional de Fortalecimento da Agricultura Familiar.[44]\\r\\nThe International Labour Office reported that the most child-laborers work in agriculture, which is one of the most hazardous types of work.[45][not in citation given (See discussion.)] The tobacco industry houses some of these working children. Use of children is widespread on farms in Argentina, Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, Malawi, and Zimbabwe.[46] While some of these children work with their families on small, family-owned farms, others work on large plantations. In late 2009, reports were released by the London-based human-rights group Plan International, claiming that child labor was common on Malawi (producer of 1.8% of the world's tobacco[30]) tobacco farms. The organization interviewed 44 teens, who worked full-time on farms during the 2007-8 growing season. The child-laborers complained of low pay and long hours, as well as physical and sexual abuse by their supervisors.[47] They also reported suffering from Green tobacco sickness, a form of nicotine poisoning. When wet leaves are handled, nicotine from the leaves gets absorbed in the skin and causes nausea, vomiting, and dizziness. Children were exposed to 50-cigarettes-worth of nicotine through direct contact with tobacco leaves. This level of nicotine in children can permanently alter brain structure and function.[45][not in citation given (See discussion.)]\\r\\nMajor tobacco companies have encouraged global tobacco production. Philip Morris, British American Tobacco, and Japan Tobacco each own or lease tobacco-manufacturing facilities in at least 50 countries and buy crude tobacco leaf from at least 12 more countries.[48] This encouragement, along with government subsidies, has led to a glut in the tobacco market. This surplus has resulted in lower prices, which are devastating to small-scale tobacco farmers. According to the World Bank, between 1985 and 2000, the inflation-adjusted price of tobacco dropped 37%.[49] Tobacco is the most widely smuggled legal product.[50]\\r\\nTobacco production requires the use of large amounts of pesticides. Tobacco companies recommend up to 16 separate applications of pesticides just in the period between planting the seeds in greenhouses and transplanting the young plants to the field.[51] Pesticide use has been worsened by the desire to produce larger crops in less time because of the decreasing market value of tobacco. Pesticides often harm tobacco farmers because they are unaware of the health effects and the proper safety protocol for working with pesticides. These pesticides, as well as fertilizers, end up in the soil, waterways, and the food chain.[52] Coupled with child labor, pesticides pose an even greater threat. Early exposure to pesticides may increase a child's lifelong cancer risk, as well as harm his or her nervous and immune systems.[53]\\r\\nTobacco crops extract nutrients (such as phosphorus, nitrogen, and potassium) from soil, decreasing its fertility.[54]\\r\\nFurthermore, the wood used to cure tobacco in some places leads to deforestation. While some big tobacco producers such as China and the United States have access to petroleum, coal, and natural gas, which can be used as alternatives to wood, most developing countries still rely on wood in the curing process.[54] Brazil alone uses the wood of 60 million trees per year for curing, packaging, and rolling cigarettes.[51]\\r\\nIn 2017 WHO released a study on the environmental effects of tobacco.[55]\\r\\nSeveral tobacco plants have been used as model organisms in genetics. Tobacco BY-2 cells, derived from N. tabacum cultivar 'Bright Yellow-2', are among the most important research tools in plant cytology.[56] Tobacco has played a pioneering role in callus culture research and the elucidation of the mechanism by which kinetin works, laying the groundwork for modern agricultural biotechnology. The first genetically modified plant was produced in 1982, using Agrobacterium tumefaciens to create an antibiotic-resistant tobacco plant.[57] This research laid the groundwork for all genetically modified crops.[58]\\r\\nBecause of its importance as a research tool, transgenic tobacco was the first GM crop to be tested in field trials, in the United States and France in 1986; China became the first country in the world to approve commercial planting of a GM crop in 1993, which was tobacco.[59]\\r\\nMany varieties of transgenic tobacco have been intensively tested in field trials. Agronomic traits such as resistance to pathogens (viruses, particularly to the tobacco mosaic virus (TMV); fungi; bacteria and nematodes); weed management via herbicide tolerance; resistance against insect pests; resistance to drought and cold; and production of useful products such as pharmaceuticals; and use of GM plants for bioremediation, have all been tested in over 400 field trials using tobacco.[60]\\r\\nCurrently, only the US is producing GM tobacco.[59][60] The Chinese virus-resistant tobacco was withdrawn from the market in China in 1997.[61]:3 In the US, cigarettes made with GM tobacco with reduced nicotine content are available under the market name Quest.[60]\\r\\nTobacco is consumed in many forms and through a number of different methods. Some examples are:\\r\\nSmoking in public was, for a long time, reserved for men, and when done by women was sometimes associated with promiscuity; in Japan, during the Edo period, prostitutes and their clients often approached one another under the guise of offering a smoke. The same was true in 19th-century Europe.[65]\\r\\nFollowing the American Civil War, the use of tobacco, primarily in cigars, became associated with masculinity and power. Today, tobacco use is often stigmatized; this has spawned quitting associations and antismoking campaigns.[66][67] Bhutan is the only country in the world where tobacco sales are illegal.[68] Due to its propensity for causing detumescence and erectile dysfunction, some studies have described tobacco as an anaphrodisiacal substance.[69]\\r\\nResearch on tobacco use is limited mainly to smoking, which has been studied more extensively than any other form of consumption. An estimated 1.1?billion people, and up to one-third of the adult population, use tobacco in some form.[70] Smoking is more prevalent among men[71] (however, the gender gap declines with age),[72][73] the poor, and in transitional or developing countries[74]\\r\\nRates of smoking continue to rise in developing countries, but have leveled off or declined in developed countries.[75] Smoking rates in the United States have dropped by half from 1965 to 2006, falling from 42% to 20.8% in adults.[76] In the developing world, tobacco consumption is rising by 3.4% per year.[77]\\r\\nTobacco smoking poses a risk to health due to the inhalation of poisonous chemicals in tobacco smoke such as carbon monoxide, cyanide, and carcinogens which have been proven to cause heart and lung diseases and Cancer. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), tobacco is the single greatest cause of preventable death globally.[78] The WHO estimates that tobacco caused 5.4 million deaths in 2004[79] and 100 million deaths over the course of the 20th century.[80] Similarly, the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention describe tobacco use as \\"the single most important preventable risk to human health in developed countries and an important cause of premature death worldwide.\\"[81]\\r\\nThe harms caused by inhalation of poisonous chemicals such as carbon monoxide in tobacco smoke include diseases affecting the heart and lungs, with smoking being a major risk factor for heart attacks, strokes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (emphysema), and cancer (particularly lung cancer, cancers of the larynx and mouth, and pancreatic cancers). Cancer is caused by inhaling carcinogenic substances present in tobacco smoke.\\r\\nInhaling secondhand tobacco smoke can cause lung cancer in nonsmoking adults. In the United States, about 3,000 adults die each year due to lung cancer from secondhand smoke exposure. Heart disease caused by secondhand smoke kills around 46,000 nonsmokers every year.[82]\\r\\nThe addictive alkaloid nicotine is a stimulant, and popularly known as the most characteristic constituent of tobacco. Nicotine is known to produce conditioned place preference, a sign of enforcement value.[83] Nicotine scores almost as highly as opioids on drug effect questionnaire liking scales, which are a rough indicator of addictive potential.[84] Users may develop tolerance and dependence.[85][86] Thousands of different substances in cigarette smoke, including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (such as benzopyrene), formaldehyde, cadmium, nickel, arsenic, tobacco-specific nitrosamines, and phenols contribute to the harmful effects of smoking.[87] Tobacco's overall harm to user and self score as determined by a multi-criteria decision analysis was determined at 3 percent below cocaine, and 13 percent above amphetamines, ranking 6th most harmful of the 20 drugs assessed.[88]\\r\\nPolonium 210 is a natural contaminant of tobacco, providing additional evidence for the link between smoking and bronchial cancer.[89] It is also extremely toxic, with one microgram being enough to kill the average adult (250,000 times more toxic than hydrogen cyanide by weight).[90]\\r\\nThinkers such as Noam Chomsky often describe tobacco as the second most lethal substance consumed by humans, the most lethal being sugar. This is primarily due to their long term impact on general health, the abundance in which they are consumed, and their legality which facilitates and promotes consumption.[91]\\r\\nTobacco has a significant economic impact. The global tobacco market has been approximated to be US$760 billion (excluding China).[92] Statistica estimates that in the U.S. alone the tobacco industry has a market of US$121 billion[93] despite the fact the CDC reports that US smoking rates are declining steadily.[94] In the US, the decline in the number of smokers, the end of the Tobacco Transition Payment Program in 2014, and competition from growers in other countries, made tobacco farming economics more challenging.[95]\\r\\n\\"Much of the disease burden and premature mortality attributable to tobacco use disproportionately affect the poor\\", and of the 1.22 billion smokers, 1 billion of them live in developing or transitional economies.[74]\\r\\nSmoking of tobacco is practised worldwide by over one billion people. However, while smoking prevalence has declined in many developed countries, it remains high in others and is increasing among women and in developing countries. Between one-fifth and two-thirds of men in most populations smoke. Women's smoking rates vary more widely but rarely equal male rates.[96]\\r\\nIn Indonesia, the lowest income group spends 15% of its total expenditures on tobacco. In Egypt, more than 10% of households' expenditure in low-income homes is on tobacco. The poorest 20% of households in Mexico spend 11% of their income on tobacco.[97]\\r\\nTobacco advertising of tobacco products by the tobacco industry is through a variety of media, including sponsorship, particularly of sporting events. It is now one of the most highly regulated forms of marketing. Some or all forms of tobacco advertising are banned in many countries.","input":"Where is the most tobacco grown in the world?"},{"output":"Urban Meyer","context":"The Ohio State Buckeyes college football team represents the Ohio State University in the East Division of the Big Ten Conference.

The Soviet Union launched it into an elliptical low Earth orbit on 4 October 1957, orbiting for three weeks before its batteries died, then silently for two more months before falling back into the atmosphere. It was a 58?cm (23?in) diameter polished metal sphere, with four external radio antennas to broadcast radio pulses. Its radio signal was easily detectable even by radio amateurs,[6] and the 65 inclination and duration of its orbit made its flight path cover virtually the entire inhabited Earth. This surprise success precipitated the American Sputnik crisis and triggered the Space Race, a part of the Cold War. The launch ushered in new political, military, technological, and scientific developments.[7][8]\\r\\nTracking and studying Sputnik 1 from Earth provided scientists with valuable information. The density of the upper atmosphere could be deduced from its drag on the orbit, and the propagation of its radio signals gave data about the ionosphere.\\r\\nSputnik 1 was launched during the International Geophysical Year from Site No.1/5, at the 5th Tyuratam range, in Kazakh SSR (now known as the Baikonur Cosmodrome). The satellite travelled at about 29,000 kilometres per hour (18,000?mph; 8,100?m/s), taking 96.2 minutes to complete each orbit. It transmitted on 20.005 and 40.002 MHz,[9] which were monitored by radio operators throughout the world. The signals continued for 21 days until the transmitter batteries ran out on 26 October 1957.[4] Sputnik burned up on 4 January 1958 while reentering Earth's atmosphere, after three months, 1440 completed orbits of the Earth,[1] and a distance travelled of about 70?million?km (43?million?mi).[10]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 17 December 1954, chief Soviet rocket scientist Sergei Korolev proposed a developmental plan for an artificial satellite to Minister of Defence Industry Dimitri Ustinov. Korolev forwarded a report by Mikhail Tikhonravov with an overview of similar projects abroad.[11] Tikhonravov had emphasized that the launch of an orbital satellite was an inevitable stage in the development of rocket technology.[12]\\r\\nOn 29 July 1955, U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower announced through his press secretary that the United States would launch an artificial satellite during the International Geophysical Year (IGY).[13] A week later, on 8 August, the Politburo of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union approved the proposal to create an artificial satellite.[14] On 30 August Vasily Ryabikov ÿ the head of the State Commission on R-7 rocket test launches ÿ held a meeting where Korolev presented calculation data for a spaceflight trajectory to the Moon. They decided to develop a three-stage version of the R-7 rocket for satellite launches.[15]\\r\\nOn 30 January 1956 the Council of Ministers approved practical work on an artificial Earth-orbiting satellite. This satellite, named Object D, was planned to be completed in 1957ÿ58; it would have a mass of 1,000 to 1,400?kg (2,200 to 3,100?lb) and would carry 200 to 300?kg (440 to 660?lb) of scientific instruments.[16] The first test launch of \\"Object D\\" was scheduled for 1957.[12] Work on the satellite was to be divided among institutions as follows:[17]\\r\\nPreliminary design work was completed by July 1956 and the scientific tasks to be carried out by the satellite were defined. These included measuring the density of the atmosphere and its ion composition, the solar wind, magnetic fields, and cosmic rays. These data would be valuable in the creation of future artificial satellites. A system of ground stations was to be developed to collect data transmitted by the satellite, observe the satellite's orbit, and transmit commands to the satellite. Because of the limited time frame, observations were planned for only 7 to 10 days and orbit calculations were not expected to be extremely accurate.[18]\\r\\nBy the end of 1956 it became clear that the complexity of the ambitious design meant that 'Object D' could not be launched in time because of difficulties creating scientific instruments and the low specific impulse produced by the completed R-7 engines (304 sec instead of the planned 309 to 310 sec). Consequently, the government rescheduled the launch for April 1958.[12] Object D would later fly as Sputnik 3.[19]\\r\\nFearing the U.S. would launch a satellite before the USSR, OKB-1 suggested the creation and launch of a satellite in AprilÿMay 1957, before the IGY began in July 1957. The new satellite would be simple, light (100?kg or 220?lb), and easy to construct, forgoing the complex, heavy scientific equipment in favour of a simple radio transmitter. On 15 February 1957 the Council of Ministers of the USSR approved this simple satellite, designated 'Object PS'.[20] This version allowed the satellite to be tracked visually by Earth-based observers, and it could transmit tracking signals to ground-based receiving stations.[20] The launch of two satellites, PS-1 and PS-2, with two R-7 rockets (8K71) was approved, provided that the R-7 completed at least two successful test flights.[20]\\r\\nThe R-7 Semyorka was initially designed as an ICBM by OKB-1. The decision to build it was made by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Council of Ministers of the USSR on 20 May 1954.[21] The R-7 was also known by its GRAU (later GURVO) designation 8K71.[22] At the time, the R-7 was known to NATO sources as the T-3 or M-104,[23] and Type A.[24] A special reconnaissance commission selected Tyuratam for the construction of a rocket proving ground (the 5th Tyuratam range, usually referred to as \\"NIIP-5\\", or \\"GIK-5\\" in the post-Soviet time). The selection was approved on 12 February 1955 by the Council of Ministers of the USSR, but the site would not be completed until 1958.[25] Actual work on the construction of the site began on 20 July by military building units. On 14 June 1956 Sergei Korolev decided to adapt the R-7 rocket to the 'Object D',[26] that would later be replaced by the much lighter 'Object PS'.\\r\\nThe first launch of an R-7 rocket (8K71 No.5L) occurred on 15 May 1957. A fire began in the Blok D strap-on almost immediately at liftoff, but the booster continued flying until T+98 seconds when the strap-on broke away and the vehicle crashed some 400?km downrange.[27] Three attempts to launch the second rocket (8K71 No.6) were made on 10ÿ11 June, but an assembly defect prevented launch.[28] The unsuccessful launch of the third R-7 rocket (8K71 No.7) took place on 12 July.[27] An electrical short caused the vernier engines to put the missile into an uncontrolled roll which resulted in all of the strap-ons separating 33 seconds into the launch. The R-7 crashed about 7?km from the pad.[29]\\r\\nThe launch of the fourth rocket (8K71 No.8), on 21 August at 15:25 Moscow Time,[27] was successful. The rocket's core boosted the dummy warhead to the target altitude and velocity, reentered the atmosphere, and broke apart at a height of 10?km (6.2?mi) after traveling 6,000?km. On 27 August TASS issued a statement on the successful launch of a long-distance multistage ICBM. The launch of the fifth R-7 rocket (8K71 No.9), on 7 September[27] was also successful, but the dummy was also destroyed on atmospheric re-entry,[29] and hence needed a redesign to completely fulfill its military purpose. The rocket, however, was deemed suitable for satellite launches, and Korolev was able to convince the State Commission to allow the use of the next R-7 to launch PS-1,[30] allowing the delay in the rocket's military exploitation to launch the PS-1 and PS-2 satellites.[31][32]\\r\\nOn 22 September a modified R-7 rocket, named Sputnik and indexed as 8K71PS,[33] arrived at the proving ground and preparations for the launch of PS-1 began.[34] Compared to the military R-7 test vehicles, the mass of 8K71PS was reduced from 280 tonnes to 272 tonnes; its length with PS-1 was 29.167 metres (95?ft 8.3?in) and the thrust at lift off was 3.90?MN (880,000?lbf).[35] These weight reductions were accomplished by deleting the inertial guidance system, several telemetry measurements, and assorted hardware designed to support a warhead.\\r\\nPS-1 was not designed to be controlled, it could only be observed. Initial data at the launch site would be collected at six separate observatories and telegraphed to NII-4.[31] Located back in Moscow (at Bolshevo), NII-4 was a scientific research arm of the Ministry of Defence dedicated to missile development.[36] The six observatories, designated IP-1 through IP-6, were clustered around the launch site, with the closest (IP-1) situated at a distance of 1?km (0.62?mi) from the launch pad.[31]\\r\\nA second, nationwide observation complex was established to track the satellite after its separation from the rocket. Called the Command-Measurement Complex, it consisted of the coordination center in NII-4 and seven distant stations situated along the line of the satellite's ground track.[37] These tracking stations were located at Tyuratam; Sary-Shagan; Yeniseysk; Klyuchi; Yelizovo; Makat in Guryev Oblast; and Ishkup in Krasnoyarsk Krai.[31][37] Stations were equipped with radar, optical instruments, and communications systems. Data from stations were transmitted by telegraphs into NII-4 where ballistics specialists calculated orbital parameters. The complex became an early prototype of the Soviet Mission Control Center.[38]\\r\\nThe observatories used a trajectory measurement system called \\"Tral,\\" developed by OKB MEI, by which they received and monitored data from transponders mounted on the R-7 rocket's core stage.[39] The data was useful even after the satellite's separation from the second stage of the rocket; Sputnik's location was calculated from the data on the second stage's location which followed Sputnik at a known distance.[40] Tracking of the booster during launch had to be accomplished through purely passive means such as visual coverage and radar detection. R-7 test launches demonstrated that the tracking cameras were only good up to an altitude of 200?km (120?mi) but radar could track it for almost 400?km (250?mi).\\r\\nOutside the Soviet Union, the satellite was tracked by amateur radio operators in many countries.[41] The US government followed it from the Central Radio Propagation Laboratory of the National Bureau of Standards.[42] The booster rocket was located and tracked by the British using the Lovell Telescope at the Jodrell Bank Observatory, the only telescope in the world able to do so by radar.[41] Canada's Newbrook Observatory was the first facility in North America to photograph Sputnik 1.[43]\\r\\nThe chief constructor of Sputnik 1 at OKB-1 was Mikhail S. Khomyakov.[44] The satellite was a 585-millimetre (23.0?in) diameter sphere, assembled from two hemispheres that were hermetically sealed with o-rings and connected by 36 bolts. It had a mass of 83.6 kilograms (184?lb).[45] The hemispheres were 2?mm thick,[46] and were covered with a highly polished 1?mm-thick heat shield[47] made of aluminium-magnesium-titanium AMG6T alloy (\\"AMG\\" is an abbreviation for \\"aluminium-magnesium\\" and \\"T\\" stands for \\"titanium\\"; the alloy is 6% magnesium and 0.2% titanium[48]). The satellite carried two pairs of antennas designed by the Antenna Laboratory of OKB-1 led by Mikhail V. Krayushkin.[17] Each antenna was made up of two whip-like parts: 2.4 and 2.9 meters (7.9 and 9.5?ft) in length,[49] and had an almost spherical radiation pattern,[50] so that the satellite beeps were transmitted with equal power in all directions, making reception of the transmitted signal independent of the satellite's rotation.\\r\\nThe power supply, with a mass of 51?kg (112?lb),[51] was in the shape of an octagonal nut with the radio transmitter in its hole.[52] It consisted of three silver-zinc batteries, developed at the All-Union Research Institute of Current Sources (VNIIT) under the leadership of Nikolai S. Lidorenko. Two of these batteries powered the radio transmitter and one powered the temperature regulation system.[51] The batteries had an expected lifetime of two weeks, and operated for 22 days. The power supply was turned on automatically at the moment of the satellite's separation from the second stage of the rocket.[53]\\r\\nThe satellite had a one-watt, 3.5?kg (7.7?lb)[31] radio transmitting unit inside, developed by Vyacheslav I. Lappo from NII-885, the Moscow Electronics Research Institute,[53][54] that worked on two frequencies, 20.005 and 40.002?MHz. Signals on the first frequency were transmitted in 0.3 sec pulses (under normal temperature and pressure conditions on-board), with pauses of the same duration filled by pulses on the second frequency.[55] Analysis of the radio signals was used to gather information about the electron density of the ionosphere. Temperature and pressure were encoded in the duration of radio beeps. A temperature regulation system contained a fan, a dual thermal switch, and a control thermal switch.[53] If the temperature inside the satellite exceeded 36?C (97?F) the fan was turned on and when it fell below 20?C (68?F) the fan was turned off by the dual thermal switch.[50] If the temperature exceeded 50?C (122?F) or fell below 0?C (32?F), another control thermal switch was activated, changing the duration of the radio signal pulses.[53] Sputnik 1 was filled with dry nitrogen, pressurized to 1.3 atm.[33] The satellite had a barometric switch, activated if the pressure inside the satellite fell below 130 kPa, which would have indicated failure of the pressure vessel or puncture by a meteor, and would have changed the duration of radio signal impulse.[56]\\r\\nWhile attached to the rocket, Sputnik 1 was protected by a cone-shaped payload fairing, with a height of 80?cm (31.5?in).[31] The fairing separated from both Sputnik and the spent R-7 second stage at the same time as the satellite was ejected.[53] Tests of the satellite were conducted at OKB-1 under the leadership of Oleg G. Ivanovsky.[44]\\r\\nThe control system of the Sputnik rocket was adjusted to an intended orbit of 223 by 1,450?km (139 by 901?mi), with an orbital period of 101.5 min.[57] The trajectory had been calculated earlier by Georgi Grechko, using the USSR Academy of Sciences' mainframe computer.[31][58]\\r\\nThe Sputnik rocket was launched on 4 October 1957 at 19:28:34?UTC (5 October at the launch site[1]) from Site No.1 at NIIP-5.[59] Telemetry indicated that the strap-ons separated 116 seconds into the flight and the core stage engine shut down 295.4 seconds into the flight.[57] At shut down, the 7.5 tonne core stage with PS-1 attached had attained an altitude of 223?km (139?mi) above sea level, a velocity of 7,780?m/s (25,500?ft/s) and velocity vector inclination to the local horizon of 0 degrees 24 minutes. This resulted in an initial orbit of 223 kilometres (139?mi) by 950 kilometres (590?mi), with an apogee approximately 500 kilometres (310?mi) lower than intended, and an inclination of 65.1 degrees and a period of 96.2 minutes.[57]\\r\\nThe launch came very close to failurea postflight examination of telemetry data found that the Blok G strap-on had not attained full power at ignition and the resulting imbalanced thrust caused the booster to pitch over about 2 six seconds after liftoff. Two seconds later, the flight control system tried to compensate by rapidly moving the vernier engines and stabilizer fins. The Blok G strap-on finally reached 100% thrust only one second before the pitch angle would have been great enough to trigger an automatic shutdown command, which would have terminated the launch and sent the R-7 and Sputnik 1 crashing to the ground in a fireball only a short distance from the pad.\\r\\nA fuel regulator in the booster also failed around 16 seconds into launch, which resulted in excessive RP-1 consumption for most of powered flight and engine thrust 4% above nominal. Core stage cutoff was intended for T+296 seconds, but the premature propellant depletion caused thrust termination to occur one second earlier when a sensor detected overspeed of the empty RP-1 turbopump. There were 375 kilograms (827?lb) of LOX remaining at cutoff.[60]\\r\\nAt 19.9 seconds after engine cut-off, PS-1 separated from the second stage[1] and the satellite's transmitter was activated. These signals were detected at the IP-1 station by Junior Engineer-Lieutenant V.G. Borisov, where reception of Sputnik 1's \\"beep-beep-beep\\" tones confirmed the satellite's successful deployment. Reception lasted for two minutes, until PS-1 fell below the horizon.[31][61] The Tral telemetry system on the R-7 core stage continued to transmit and was detected on its second orbit.[1]\\r\\nThe designers, engineers and technicians who developed the rocket and satellite watched the launch from the range.[62] After the launch they drove to the mobile radio station to listen for signals from the satellite.[62] They waited about 90 minutes to ensure that the satellite had made one orbit and was transmitting, before Korolev called Soviet premier Nikita Khrushchev.[63]\\r\\nOn the first orbit the Telegraph Agency of the Soviet Union (TASS) transmitted: \\"As result of great, intense work of scientific institutes and design bureaus the first artificial Earth satellite has been built\\".[64] The R-7 core stage, with a mass of 7.5 tonnes and a length of 26 meters, also reached Earth orbit and was visible from the ground at night as a first magnitude object following the satellite. Deployable reflective panels were placed on the booster in order to increase its visibility for tracking.[63] The satellite, a small, highly polished sphere, was barely visible at sixth magnitude, and thus more difficult to follow optically. A third object, the payload fairing, also achieved orbit.\\r\\nThe core stage of the R-7 remained in orbit for two months until 2 December 1957, while Sputnik 1 orbited for three months, until 4 January 1958, having completed 1,440 orbits of the Earth.[1]\\r\\nOur movies and television programs in the fifties were full of the idea of going into space. What came as a surprise was that it was the Soviet Union that launched the first satellite. It is hard to recall the atmosphere of the time.\\r\\nThe Soviets provided details of Sputnik 1 before the launch but few outside the Soviet Union noticed. After reviewing information publicly available before the launch, the science writer Willy Ley wrote in 1958:\\r\\nIf somebody tells me that he has the rockets to shoot  which we know from other sources, anyway  and tells me what he will shoot, how he will shoot it, and in general says virtually everything except for the precise date  well, what should I feel like if I'm surprised when the man shoots?[66]\\r\\nOrganized through the citizen science project Operation Moonwatch, teams of visual observers at 150 stations in the United States and other countries were alerted during the night to watch for the Soviet sphere at dawn and during the evening twilight through binoculars or telescopes as it passed overhead.[67] The USSR asked radio amateurs and commercial stations to record the sound of the satellite on magnetic tape.[67]\\r\\nNews reports at the time pointed out that \\"anyone possessing a short wave receiver can hear the new Russian earth satellite as it hurtles over this area of the globe\\".[69] Directions, provided by the American Radio Relay League were to \\"Tune in 20 megacycles sharply, by the time signals, given on that frequency. Then tune to slightly higher frequencies. The 'beep, beep' sound of the satellite can be heard each time it rounds the globe.\\"[70] The first recording of Sputnik 1's signal was made by RCA engineers near Riverhead, Long Island. They then drove the tape recording into Manhattan for broadcast to the public over NBC radio. However, as Sputnik rose higher over the East Coast, its signal was picked up by W2AEE, the ham radio station of Columbia University. Students working in the university's FM station, WKCR, made a tape of this, and were the first to rebroadcast the Sputnik signal to the American public (or whoever could receive the FM station).\\r\\nAt first the Soviet Union agreed to use equipment \\"compatible\\" with that of the United States, but later announced the lower frequencies.[67] The White House declined to comment on military aspects of the launch, but said \\"it did not come as a surprise.\\"[71] On 5 October the Naval Research Laboratory announced it had recorded four crossings of Sputnik 1 over the United States.[67] The USAF Cambridge Research Center collaborated with Bendix-Friez, Westinghouse Broadcasting Co., and the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory to obtain a motion picture of Sputnik's rocket body crossing the pre-dawn sky of Baltimore, broadcast on 12 October by WBZ-TV in Boston.[72] U.S. President Eisenhower obtained photographs of the Soviet facilities from Lockheed U-2 flights conducted since 1956.[73]\\r\\nThe success of Sputnik 1 seemed to have changed minds around the world regarding a shift in power to the Soviets.[74]\\r\\nThe USSR's launch of Sputnik 1 spurred the United States to create the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA, later DARPA) in February 1958 to regain a technological lead.[75][76][77]\\r\\nIn Britain the media and population initially reacted with a mixture of fear for the future, but also amazement about humankind's progress. Many newspapers and magazines heralded the arrival of the Space Age. However, when the Soviet Union launched a second craft containing the dog Laika, the media narrative returned to one of anti-communism and many people sent protests to the Russian embassy and the RSPCA.[78]\\r\\nSputnik 1 was not immediately used for Soviet propaganda. The Soviets had kept quiet about their earlier accomplishments in rocketry, fearing that it would lead to secrets being revealed and failures being exploited by the West.[79] When the Soviets began using Sputnik in their propaganda, they emphasized pride in the achievement of Soviet technology, arguing that it demonstrated the Soviets' superiority over the West. People were encouraged to listen to Sputnik's signals on the radio[79] and to look out for Sputnik in the night sky. While Sputnik itself had been highly polished, its small size made it barely visible to the naked eye. What most watchers actually saw was the much more visible 26 meter core stage of the R-7.[79] Shortly after the launch of PS-1, Khrushchev pressed Korolev to launch another satellite in time for the 40th anniversary of the October Revolution on 7 November 1957.[80]\\r\\nThe launch of Sputnik 1 surprised the American public and shattered the perception, furthered by American propaganda, of the United States as the technological superpower and the Soviet Union as a backward country.[81] Privately, however, the CIA and President Eisenhower were aware of progress being made by the Soviets on Sputnik from secret spy plane imagery.[82] Together with the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), the Army Ballistic Missile Agency built Explorer 1, and launched it on 31 January 1958. Before work was completed, however, the Soviet Union launched a second satellite, Sputnik 2, on 3 November 1957. Meanwhile, the televised failure of Vanguard TV3 on 6 December 1957 deepened American dismay over the country's position in the Space Race. The Americans took a more aggressive stance in the emerging space race,[83] resulting in an emphasis on science and technological research and reforms in many areas from the military to education systems.[84] The federal government began investing in science, engineering and mathematics at all levels of education.[81][85] An advanced research group was assembled for military purposes.[81] These research groups developed weapons such as ICBMs and missile defense systems, as well as spy satellites for the U.S.[81]\\r\\nOn Friday, 4 October 1957, the Soviets had orbited the world's first artificial satellite. Anyone who doubted its existence could walk into the backyard just after sunset and see it.\\r\\nInitially U.S. President Eisenhower was not surprised by Sputnik 1. He had been forewarned of the R-7's capabilities by information derived from U-2 spy plane overflight photos, as well as signals and telemetry intercepts.[87][88] The Eisenhower administration's first response was low-key and almost dismissive.[89] Eisenhower was even pleased that the USSR, not the U.S., would be the first to test the waters of the still-uncertain legal status of orbital satellite overflights.[90] Eisenhower had suffered the Soviet protests and shoot-downs of Project Genetrix (Moby Dick) balloons[91] and was concerned about the probability of a U-2 being shot down.[92] To set a precedent for \\"freedom of space\\" before the launch of America's secret WS-117L spy satellites,[93] the U.S. had launched Project Vanguard as its own \\"civilian\\" satellite entry for the International Geophysical Year.[94] Eisenhower greatly underestimated the reaction of the American public, who were shocked by the launch of Sputnik and by the televised failure of the Vanguard Test Vehicle 3 launch attempt. The sense of fear was inflamed by Democratic politicians and professional cold warriors, who portrayed the United States as woefully behind.[95] One of the many books that suddenly appeared for the lay-audience noted seven points of \\"impact\\" upon the nation: Western leadership, Western strategy and tactics, missile production, applied research, basic research, education, and democratic culture.[23]\\r\\nThe U.S. soon had a number of successful satellites, including Explorer 1, Project SCORE, and Courier 1B. However, public reaction to the Sputnik crisis spurred America to action in the Space Race, leading to the creation of both the Advanced Research Projects Agency (renamed the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency or DARPA in 1972),[96] and NASA (through the National Aeronautics and Space Act),[97] as well as an increase in U.S. government spending on scientific research and education.\\r\\nSputnik also contributed directly to a new emphasis on science and technology in American schools. With a sense of urgency, Congress enacted the 1958 National Defense Education Act, which provided low-interest loans for college tuition to students majoring in math and science.[98][99] After the launch of Sputnik, a poll conducted and published by the University of Michigan showed that 26% of Americans surveyed thought that Russian sciences and engineering were superior to that of the United States. (A year later, however, that figure had dropped to 10% as the U.S. began launching its own satellites into space.)[100]\\r\\nOne consequence of the Sputnik shock was the perception of a \\"missile gap.\\"[101] This became a dominant issue in the 1960 Presidential campaign.\\r\\nOne irony of the Sputnik event was the initially low-key response of the Soviet Union. The Communist Party newspaper Pravda only printed a few paragraphs about Sputnik 1 on 4 October.[102] In the days following the world's startled response, the Soviets started celebrating their great accomplishment.\\r\\nSputnik also inspired a generation of engineers and scientists. Harrison Storms, the North American designer who was responsible for the X-15 rocket plane, and went on to head the effort to design the Apollo Command/Service Module and Saturn V launch vehicle's second stage was moved by the launch of Sputnik to think of space as being the next step for America.[103] Astronauts Alan Shepard, who was the first American in space, and Deke Slayton later wrote of how the sight of Sputnik I passing overhead inspired them to their new careers.[104] Homer Hickam's memoir Rocket Boys and the movie October Sky tell the story of how a coal miner's son, inspired by Sputnik, started building rockets in the mining town where he lived.\\r\\nThe launch of Sputnik 1 inspired United States writer Herb Caen to coin the term \\"beatnik\\" in an article about the Beat Generation in the San Francisco Chronicle on 2 April 1958[105].\\r\\nThe flag of the Russian city of Kaluga, which, due to its importance as Konstantin Tsiolkovsky's birthplace, is very focused on space, features a small Sputnik in the left section.\\r\\nAt least two vintage duplicates of Sputnik 1 exist, built apparently as backup units. One resides just outside Moscow in the corporate museum of Energia, the modern descendant of Korolev's design bureau, where it is on display by appointment only.[106][107] Another is in the Museum of Flight in Seattle, Washington. Unlike Energia's unit, it has no internal components, but it does have casings and molded fittings inside (as well as evidence of battery wear), which suggest it was built as more than just a model. Authenticated by the Memorial Museum of Cosmonautics in Moscow, the unit was auctioned in 2001 and purchased by an anonymous private buyer who donated it to the museum.[106] Two more Sputnik backups are said to be in the personal collections of American entrepreneurs Richard Garriott[106] and Jay S. Walker.[108]\\r\\nIn 1959, the Soviet Union donated a replica of Sputnik to the United Nations.[109] There are dozens of other full-size Sputnik replicas, more or less accurate, on display in locations around the world, including the National Air and Space Museum in Washington, D.C.;[106] the Frontiers of Flight Museum and the Fort Worth Museum of Science and History, both in Texas;[106][110] the Armstrong Air and Space Museum and the National Museum of the United States Air Force, both in Ohio; the Cosmosphere in Hutchinson, Kansas; the California Science Center in Los Angeles; the Science Museum, London; the World Museum in Liverpool; the Powerhouse Museum in Sydney, Australia and outside the Russian embassy in Madrid, Spain.\\r\\nThree one-third scale student-built replicas of Sputnik 1 were deployed from the Mir space station between 1997 and 1999. The first, named Sputnik 40 to commemorate the fortieth anniversary of the launch of Sputnik 1, was deployed in November 1997.[73] Sputnik 41 was launched a year later, and Sputnik 99 was deployed in February 1999. A fourth replica was launched, but never deployed, and was destroyed when Mir was deorbited.[106][111]","input":"Who built the first satellite to orbit earth?"},{"output":"The New Zealand dollar","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\n?New Zealand\\r\\n\\r\\nThe New Zealand dollar (sign: $; code: NZD, also abbreviated NZ$) (Mori: Tra o Aotearoa) is the official currency and legal tender of New Zealand, the Cook Islands, Niue, the Ross Dependency, Tokelau, and a British territory, the Pitcairn Islands.[1] Within New Zealand, it is almost always abbreviated with the dollar sign ($), with \\"NZ$\\" sometimes used to distinguish it from other dollar-denominated currencies. In the context of currency trading, it is often informally called the \\"Kiwi\\" or \\"Kiwi dollar\\",[2] since New Zealand is commonly associated with the indigenous bird and the one-dollar coin depicts a kiwi.\\r\\n\\r\\nIntroduced in 1967, the dollar is subdivided into 100 cents. Altogether there are ten denominationsfive coins and five banknoteswith the smallest being the 10-cent coin. Formerly there were lower denominations, but those were discontinued due to inflation and production costs.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe New Zealand dollar is consistently one of the 10 most traded currencies in the world, being approximately 2.0% of global foreign exchange market daily turnover in 2013.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nPrior to the introduction of the New Zealand dollar in 1967, the New Zealand pound was the currency of New Zealand, which had been distinct from the pound sterling since 1933. The pound used the Ssd system, in which the pound was divided into 20 shillings and one shilling was divided into 12 pence, which by the 1950s was considered complicated and cumbersome.\\r\\n\\r\\nSwitching to decimal currency had been proposed in New Zealand since the 1930s, although only in the 1950s did any plans come to fruition. In 1957, a committee was set up by the Government to investigate decimal currency. The idea fell on fertile ground, and in 1963, the Government decided to decimalise New Zealand currency.[4] The Decimal Currency Act was passed in 1964, setting the date of transition to 10 July 1967.[5] Words such as \\"fern\\", \\"kiwi\\" and \\"zeal\\" were proposed to avoid confusion with the word \\"dollar\\", which many people at the time associated with the United States dollar.[6][7] In the end, the word \\"dollar\\" was chosen anyway, and an anthropomorphic dollar note cartoon character called \\"Mr. Dollar\\" became the symbol of transition in a huge publicity campaign.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn Monday 10 July 1967 (\\"Decimal Currency Day\\"), the New Zealand dollar was introduced to replace the pound at a rate of two dollars to one pound (one dollar to ten shillings, ten cents to one shilling, ?5?6 cent to a penny).[9] Some 27 million new banknotes were printed and 165 million new coins were minted for the changeover.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe New Zealand dollar was initially pegged to the US dollar at US$1.43 = NZ$1. This rate changed on 21 November of the same year to US$1.12 = NZ$1 after the devaluation of the British pound (see Bretton Woods system), although New Zealand devalued more than the UK.[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1971 the US devalued its dollar relative to gold, leading New Zealand on 23 December to peg its dollar at US$1.216 with a 4.5% fluctuation range, keeping the same gold value. From 9 July 1973 to 4 March 1985 the dollar's value was determined from a trade-weighted basket of currencies.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe NZ$ was floated on 4 March 1985 at the initial rate of US$0.4444. Since then the dollar's value has been determined by the financial markets, and has been in the range of about US$0.39 to 0.88.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe dollar's post-float low was US$0.3922 on 22 November 2000, and it reached a post-float high on 9 July 2014 of US$0.8821. Much of this medium-term variation in the exchange rate has been attributed to differences in interest rates.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe New Zealand dollar's value is often strongly affected by currency trading,[citation needed] and is among the 10 most-traded currencies.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 11 June 2007 the Reserve Bank sold an unknown worth of New Zealand dollars for nine billion USD in an attempt to drive down its value. This is the first intervention in the markets by the Bank since the float in 1985.\\r\\n\\r\\nTwo suspected interventions followed, but they were not as successful as the first: the first appeared to be initially effective, with the dollar dropping to approximately US$0.7490 from near US$0.7620. However, within little more than a month it had risen to new post-float highs, reaching US$0.8103 on 23 July 2007.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter reaching its post-float record high in early 2008, the value of the NZ$ plummeted throughout much of the 2nd half of 2008 and the first quarter of 2009 as a response to the global economic downturn and flight by investors away from \\"riskier\\" currencies such as the NZ$. The NZ$ bottomed out at approximately US$0.50 on 6 March 2009.[12] However, it rebounded strongly as the year progressed, reaching the US$0.75 range by November 2009.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nBy late 2012, the dollar was holding above 80 US cents, occasionally reaching 85S, prompting calls from the Green Party for quantitative easing.[13][14] Unions also called on the Government and the Reserve Bank to take action, but as of February 2013 both had declined.[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs of early June, 2017, the NZD was trading at approximately US$0.71.[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the introduction of the dollar, coins came in denominations of 1c, 2c, 5c, 10c, 20c and 50c. The 1c and 2c coins were bronze, the others were cupro-nickel.[17] To ease transition, the 5c, 10c and 20c were the same size as the sixpence, shilling and florin that they respectively replaced. Until 1970 the ten-cent coin bore the additional legend \\"One Shilling\\". The obverse designs of all the coins featured Arnold Machin's portrait of Queen Elizabeth II, with the legend ELIZABETH II NEW ZEALAND [date]. The reverse sides of coins introduced in 1967 did not follow the designs that were originally intended for them. Those modern art and sculpture themed designs were leaked to a newspaper and met a very negative public reaction. The final releases were given more conservative designs in line with public expectations.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1986, New Zealand adopted Raphael Maklouf's new portrait of the Queen. The 1c and 2c coins were last minted for circulation in 1987, with collector coins being made for 1988. The coins were demonetised on 30 April 1990.[17] The lack of 1c and 2c coins meant that cash transactions were normally rounded to the nearest 5c (10c from 2006), a process known as Swedish rounding.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 11 February 1991, aluminium-bronze $1 and $2 coins were introduced to replace existing $1 and $2 notes.[17] In 1999, Ian Rank-Broadley's portrait of the Queen was introduced and the legend rearranged to read NEW ZEALAND ELIZABETH II.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 11 November 2004 the Reserve Bank announced that it proposed to take the 5c coin out of circulation and to make the 50c, 20c and 10c coins smaller and use plated steel to make them lighter. After a three-month public submission period that ended on 4 February 2005, the Reserve Bank announced on 31 March that it would go ahead with the proposed changes. The changeover period started on 31 July 2006, with the old coins usable until 31 October 2006.[17] The old 50c, 20c, 10c and 5c pieces are now no longer legal tender, but are still redeemable at the Reserve Bank. Prior to the change over, these coins were similar, same for the legend and reverse artwork, to international (mainly Commonwealth) coins of the same British-derived sizes, which led to coins from other currencies, particularly older coins, being accepted by vending machines and many retailers.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1967, notes were introduced in denominations of $1, $2, $5, $10, $20 and $100, with all except the $5 replacing their pound predecessors. The original series of dollar notes featured on the obverse a portrait of Queen Elizabeth II wearing Queen Alexandra's Kokoshnik tiara, King George's VI festoon necklace, and Queen Mary's floret earrings, while the reverse featured native birds and plants.[19] The notes were changed slightly in 1981 due to a change of printer (from De La Rue to Bradbury, Wilkinson & Co.)the most noticeable difference being the portrait based upon a photograph by Peter Grugeon, in which Queen Elizabeth II is wearing Grand Duchess Vladimir's tiara and Queen Victoria's golden jubilee necklace.[19] The $50 note was added in 1983 to fill the long gap between the $20 and the $100 notes. $1 and $2 notes were discontinued in 1991 after being replaced with coins.\\r\\n\\r\\nA new series of notes was introduced in 1992. The obverse of each note featured a notable New Zealander, while the reverse featured a native New Zealand bird and New Zealand scenery. In 1999, polymer notes replaced the paper notes. The designs remained much the same, but were changed slightly to accommodate new security features, with the most obvious changes being the two transparent windows.\\r\\n\\r\\nNew banknotes are being printed in New Zealand at the moment. The new notes are the same sizes and denominations as the older banknotes, and they will continue to be made of the same flexible plastic material. The themes of the notes remain the same, with the same respected New Zealanders, the Queen, and flora and fauna remaining central to the designs.\\r\\nThe $5 and $10 notes were released in October 2015, with the $20, $50 and $100 notes set to release in April 2016. The old New Zealand banknotes and the new 'Brighter Money' banknotes can be used interchangeably for the time being.[20]\\r\\n\\r\\nSince the older banknotes were first issued in 1999, security features and the technology for designing and printing banknotes have all advanced considerably. And while counterfeiting rates in New Zealand are low compared to the rest of the world, the New Zealand public and government agree that it is in the best interest to \\"stay one step ahead of the game\\", hence the new notes.[20]\\r\\n\\r\\nNew Zealand $10 note (sixth-issue)\\r\\n\\r\\nNew Zealand $20 note (sixth-issue)\\r\\n\\r\\nNew Zealand's five-dollar note was named the banknote of the year for 2015,[21] a \\"clear winner\\" among nearly 40 eligible designs from a record 20 countries. The Reserve Bank of New Zealand released the new $5 and $10 notes in October as part of its Brighter Money range. The $5 shows mountaineer Sir Edmund Hillary facing the South Island's Aoraki/Mount Cook, and, on the other side, a rare yellow-eyed penguin and local flora.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith the breakdown of the Bretton Woods system in 1971, both Australia and New Zealand converted the mostly-fixed foreign exchange regimes to a moving peg against the US dollar.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn September 1974, Australia moved to a peg against a basket of currencies called the trade weighted index (TWI) in an effort to reduce fluctuations associated with its peg to the US dollar. The peg to the TWI was changed to a moving peg in November 1976, causing the actual value of the peg to be periodically adjusted.\\r\\n\\r\\nSince the late 1990s, and certainly since the end of the Cold War the US dollar has had less and less overall influence over the value of both the NZ$ and A$ against other currencies.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe New Zealand dollar contributes greatly to the total global exchange marketfar in excess of New Zealand's relative share of population or global GDP.\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to the Bank for International Settlements, the New Zealand dollar's share of global foreign exchange market daily turnover in 2016 was 2.1% (up from 1.6% in 2010) giving it a rank of 11th.[3] Trading in the currency has climbed steadily since the same survey in 1998 when the NZD's ranking was 17th and the share of turnover was just 0.2%.","input":"What kind of money does new zealand use?"},{"output":"in 1967","context":"Chick-fil-A (/t??kf??le?/ chik-fil-AY, a play on the American English pronunciation of \\"fillet\\") is an American fast food restaurant chain headquartered in the city of College Park, Georgia, specializing in chicken sandwiches.[3][4] Founded in May 1946, it operates more than 2,200 restaurants, primarily in the United States. The restaurant serves breakfast before transitioning to its lunch and dinner menu. Chick-fil-A also offers customers catered selections from its menu for special events.[5]\\r\\nMany of the company's values are influenced by its founder's Southern Baptist beliefs;[6] most notably, all Chick-fil-A restaurants are closed for business on Sundays, as well as on Thanksgiving and Christmas.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe chain's origin can be traced to the Dwarf Grill (now the Dwarf House), a restaurant opened by S. Truett Cathy, the chain's former chairman and CEO, in 1946. The restaurant is located in Hapeville, Georgia, a suburb of Atlanta,[3] and is near the location of the now-demolished Ford Motor Company Atlanta Assembly Plant, for many years a source of many of the restaurant's patrons.\\r\\nIn 1961, after 15 years in the fast food business, Cathy found a pressure-fryer that could cook the chicken sandwich in the same amount of time it took to cook a fast-food hamburger.[7] Following this discovery, he registered the name Chick-fil-A, Inc. The company's trademarked slogan, \\"We Didn't Invent the Chicken, Just the Chicken Sandwich,\\"[8] refers to their flagship menu item, the Chick-fil-A chicken sandwich.\\r\\nThe first Chick-fil-A opened in 1967, in the food court of the Greenbriar Mall, in a suburb of Atlanta.[3] During the 1970s and early 1980s, the chain expanded by opening new franchises in suburban malls' food courts.[9] The first freestanding franchise was opened April 16, 1986, on North Druid Hills Road in Atlanta, Georgia,[10] and the company began to focus more on this type of franchise than on the food court type. Although it has expanded outward from its original geographic base, most new restaurants are located in Southern suburban areas.[3] In October 2015, the company opened a three-story 5,000-square-foot restaurant in Manhattan that became the largest free-standing Chick-fil-A in the country at that time.[11][12] As of 2016, the chain has approximately 1,950 locations.[3] It also has 31 drive-through-only locations.[3] Chick-fil-A also can be found at universities, hospitals, and airports through licensing agreements.[3]\\r\\nSince 1997, the Atlanta-based company has been the title sponsor of the Peach Bowl, an annual college football bowl game played in Atlanta on New Year's Eve. Chick-fil-A also is a key sponsor of the SEC and the ACC of college athletics.[13][14]\\r\\nThe company expanded for the first time outside of the United States by opening an outlet at the Calgary International Airport in Calgary, Alberta, Canada in May 2014.[15][16] This restaurant is located near the departure area for flights bound for the United States.[15] However, as with its American locations, it is closed Sundays and Christmas Day (it is, however, open on what would be Thanksgiving Day in America; as Thanksgiving Day is an American holiday).\\r\\nChick-fil-A retains ownership of each restaurant. Chick-fil-A selects the restaurant location and builds it.[17] Chick-fil-A franchisees need only a $10,000 initial investment to become an operator.[18] Each operator is handpicked and goes through a rigorous training program; the interviews plus training can take months and is not an easy process. Chick-fil-A states on their site:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\"This is not the right opportunity for you if you:\\r\\n- Are seeking a passive investment in a business.\\r\\n- Want to sell property to Chick-fil-A, Inc.\\r\\n- Are requesting that Chick-fil-A, Inc. build at a specified location.\\r\\n- Are seeking multi-unit franchise opportunities.\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThis goes to show how vastly different it is to be a Chick-fil-A store operator rather than being part of a regular franchise opportunity.[19] Since 2010, Chick-fil-A has led the fast food industry in average sales per restaurant, despite being open only six days a week,[20] earning an average $4.8 million per restaurant in 2016 (Whataburger was second with $2.7 million per restaurant).[21]\\r\\n\\"Eat Mor Chikin\\" is the chain's most prominent advertising slogan, created by The Richards Group in 1995. The slogan is often seen in advertisements, featuring Holstein dairy cows[22] that are often seen wearing (or holding) signs that (usually) read: \\"Eat Mor Chikin\\" in all capital letters. The ad campaign was temporarily halted during a mad cow disease scare on January 1, 2004, so as not to make the chain seem insensitive or appear to be taking advantage of the scare to increase its sales. Two months later, the cows were put up again. The cows replaced the chain's old mascot, Doodles, an anthropomorphized chicken who still appears as the C on the logo.[23]\\r\\nChick-fil-A vigorously protects its intellectual property, sending cease and desist letters to those they think have infringed on their trademarks.[24] The corporation has successfully protested at least 30 instances of the use of an \\"eat more\\" phrase, saying that the use would cause confusion of the public, dilute the distinctiveness of their intellectual property, and diminish its value.[25]\\r\\nA 2011 letter to Vermont artist Bo Muller-Moore who screen prints T-shirts reading: \\"Eat More Kale\\" demanded that he cease printing the shirts and turn over his website.[26] The incident drew criticism from Vermont governor Peter Shumlin, and created backlash against what he termed Chick-fil-A's \\"corporate bullying.\\"[27] On December 11, 2014, Bo Muller-Moore announced that the U.S. Patent Office granted his application to trademark his \\"Eat More Kale\\" phrase. A formal announcement of his victory took place on December 12, 2014, with Shumlin and other supporters on the Statehouse steps. His public fight drew regional and national attention, the support of Shumlin, and a team of pro-bono law students from the University of New Hampshire legal clinic.[28]\\r\\nAfter 22 years with The Richards Group, Chick-fil-A switched to McCann New York in 2016. Along with the cows, ads included famous people in history in a campaign called \\"Chicken for Breakfast. It's not as crazy as you think.\\"[29]\\r\\nTruett Cathy opened his first restaurant, The Dwarf Grill?ÿ later renamed the Dwarf House?ÿ in Hapeville, Georgia, in 1946, and developed the pressure-cooked chicken breast sandwich there.[3] At the original Chick-fil-A Dwarf Grill, in addition to the full-size entrances, there is also an extra small-sized front door.[32] The original Dwarf House in Hapeville, Georgia is open 24 hours a day, six days a week, except on Sundays, Thanksgiving, and Christmas. The store closes at 10:00?p.m. on Saturday nights, and the day before Thanksgiving and Christmas and reopens at 6?a.m. on Monday mornings and day after Thanksgiving and Christmas. It has a larger dine-in menu than the other Dwarf House locations as well as an animated seven dwarfs display in the back of the restaurant.[32] It was across the street from the former Ford Motor Company factory called Atlanta Assembly.\\r\\nTruett's original, full-service restaurants offer a substantial menu and provide customers a choice of table service, walk-up counter service or a drive-thru window. As of 2012[update], 13 Chick-fil-A Dwarf House restaurants were operating in the metro Atlanta area.[3]\\r\\nIn 1996, the first Truett's Grill was opened in Morrow, Georgia. The second location opened in 2003 in McDonough, Georgia, and a third location opened in 2006 in Griffin, Georgia.[33] Similar to the Chick-fil-A Dwarf Houses, these independently owned restaurants offer traditional, sit-down dining and expanded menu selections in a diner-themed dinner.[34][35][36] In 2017, Chick-fil-A demolished several Dwarf House locations to replace them with Truett's Grill locations.[37][38]\\r\\nS. Truett Cathy was a devout Southern Baptist; his religious beliefs had a major impact on the company.[39] The company's official statement of corporate purpose says that the business exists \\"To glorify God by being a faithful steward of all that is entrusted to us. To have a positive influence on all who come in contact with Chick-fil-A.\\"[40]\\r\\nCathy's beliefs are also responsible for the chain's most well-known and distinctive feature: all Chick-fil-A locations (both corporate owned and franchised) are closed on Sundays,[41] as well as on Thanksgiving and Christmas.[42] Cathy states as the final step in his Five-Step recipe for Business Success \\"I was not so committed to financial success that I was willing to abandon my principles and priorities. One of the most visible examples of this is our decision to close on Sunday. Our decision to close on Sunday was our way of honoring God and of directing our attention to things that mattered more than our business.\\"[43]\\r\\nIn an interview with ABC News's Nightline, Truett's son Dan T. Cathy told reporter Vicki Mabrey that the company is also closed on Sundays because \\"by the time Sunday came, he was just worn out. And Sunday was not a big trading day, anyway, at the time. So he was closed that first Sunday and we've been closed ever since. He figured if he didn't like working on Sundays, that other people didn't either.\\" The younger Cathy also quoted his father as saying, \\"I don't want to ask people to do that what I am not willing to do myself.\\"[44]\\r\\nTheir website states, \\"The Chick-fil-A culture and service tradition in our Restaurants is to treat every person with honor, dignity and respect ÿregardless of their belief, race, creed, sexual orientation or gender.\\"[45]\\r\\nChick-fil-A's reputation on being closed on Sundays extends to non-traditional locations. In addition to countless shopping malls and airports, a Chick-fil-A location at Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta will be closed on Sundays despite its main tenant, the Atlanta Falcons, playing most of their home games on Sundays. The location will be open when the Falcons have a Monday night, Thursday night or Saturday home game, as well as non-Sunday home games of Atlanta United FC and other events at the stadium. On Sundays, the digital signs will be flipped and concessionaire Levy Restaurants will sell nonbranded food and drinks at the location.[46]\\r\\nIn January 2011, the media reported that Chick-fil-A was co-sponsoring a marriage conference with the Pennsylvania Family Institute (PFI), an organization that has opposed same-sex marriage legislation.[47][48][49][50][51] Chick-fil-A clarified that \\"one of our independent Restaurant Operators in Pennsylvania was asked to provide sandwiches to two Art of Marriage video seminars\\".[52] The WinShape Foundation, a charitable organization founded by Truett and his wife, also stated that it would not allow same-sex couples to participate in its marriage retreats.[53]\\r\\nChick-fil-A has donated over $5?million, via WinShape, to groups that oppose same-sex marriage. Of this, more than $3?million was donated primarily to Christian organizations whose agendas included positions that oppose same-sex marriage,[54] with the money donated between 2003 and 2009.[55][56][57][58][59][60][61][62] A total of $1.9?million was donated in 2010 to groups such as the Marriage & Family Foundation, Exodus International, and the Family Research Council (FRC).[63] That year, the FRC, which received $1,000[55][56][57][58][59][60][61][62] was listed as an anti-gay[64] hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center.[65][66][67] WinShape has also contributed to Christian groups including the Fellowship of Christian Athletes and Exodus International, the latter is noted for supporting ex-gay conversion therapy.[63] In response, students at several colleges and universities worked to ban or remove the company's restaurants from their campuses. On January 28, 2013, Shane L. Windmeyer, the leader of Campus Pride, suspended their campaign.[68][69][70]\\r\\nIn June and July 2012, Chick-fil-A's chief operating officer Dan T. Cathy made several public statements about same-sex marriage, saying that those who \\"have the audacity to define what marriage is about\\" were \\"inviting God's judgment on our nation\\".[71][72][73][74][75] Several prominent politicians expressed disapproval.[76] Boston Mayor Thomas Menino and Chicago Alderman Proco \\"Joe\\" Moreno said they hoped to block franchise expansion into their areas.[77][78][79] The proposed bans drew criticism from liberal pundits, legal experts, and the American Civil Liberties Union.[80][81][82] The Jim Henson Company, which had a Pajanimals kids' meal toy licensing arrangement with Chick-fil-A, said it would cease its business relationship, and donate the payment to the Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation.[83][84][85] Chick-fil-A stopped distributing the toys, claiming that unrelated safety concerns that had arisen prior to the controversy.[86] Chick-fil-A released a statement on July 31, 2012, saying, \\"We are a restaurant company focused on food, service, and hospitality; our intent is to leave the policy debate over same-sex marriage to the government and political arena.\\"[87]\\r\\nIn response to the controversy, former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee initiated a Chick-fil-A Appreciation Day movement to counter a boycott of Chick-fil-A launched by same-sex marriage activists.[88][89][90] More than 600,000 people RSVPed on Facebook for Huckabee's appreciation event.[89] On August 1, Chick-fil-A restaurants experienced a large show of public support across the nation with the company reporting record-breaking sales.[88][89][90] A consulting firm estimated that the average Chick-fil-A restaurant had 29.9 percent more sales and 367 more customers than it did on a typical Wednesday.[18]\\r\\nIn September 2012, The Civil Rights Agenda (TCRA) announced that Chick-fil-A had \\"ceased donating to organizations that promote discrimination, specifically against LGBT civil rights.\\" Chick-fil-A officials did state in an internal document that they \\"will treat every person equally, regardless of sexual orientation.\\"[91] In a letter from Chick-fil-A's Senior Director of Real Estate, the company states, \\"The WinShape Foundation is now taking a much closer look at the organizations it considers helping, and in that process will remain true to its stated philosophy of not supporting organizations with political agendas.\\"[92][93]\\r\\nAccording to Chicago Alderman Proco \\"Joe\\" Moreno, Chick-fil-A has a statement of respect for all people regardless of sexual orientation in an internal document called Chick-fil-A: Who We Are. A document released by Chick-fil-A on September 20, 2012, does not mention any organizations opposed to same-sex marriage as being part of Chick-fil-A's donation base. WinShape Marriage will continue to be supported financially, with a stated focus on couple retreats to strengthen marriages.[94]\\r\\nAccording to Focus on the Family's website, CitizenLink.com, \\"Chick-fil-A and its charitable-giving arm, the WinShape Foundation, did not agree to stop making donations to groups that support the Biblical definition of marriage in exchange for being allowed to open a franchise in Chicago.\\"[95] Mike Huckabee stated that he \\"talked earlier today personally with Dan Cathy, CEO of Chick Fil-A about the new reports that Chick Fil-A had capitulated to demands of the supporters of same sex marriage. This is not true. The company continues to focus on the fair treatment of all of its customers and employees, but to end confusion gave me this statement.\\" The statement provided by Chick-fil-A was posted on Huckabee's website.[96][97]\\r\\nThough Chick-fil-A has always used trans-fat free processes in its chicken sandwiches, anticipating the dietary concerns of consumers, in 2008, it became the first fast-food restaurant to become completely trans-fat free.[98]\\r\\nIn 2011, food blogger and activist Vani Hari wrote a post titled \\"Chick-fil-A or Chemical Fil-A?\\" on her website, FoodBabe.com. She noted that Chick-fil-A sandwiches contained nearly 100 ingredients, including peanut oil with TBHQ.[99] In October 2012, Chick-fil-A invited Hari to meet with company executives at its Atlanta, GA headquarters.[100] In December 2013, Chick-fil-A notified Hari that it had eliminated the dye Yellow No. 5 and had reduced the sodium content in its chicken soup. The company also said that it is testing a peanut oil that does not contain TBHQ and that it would start testing sauces and dressings made without high-fructose corn syrup in 2014.[100]\\r\\nAccording to the Food and Drug Administration, antibiotics used in livestock, many of which are also used to treat humans, have contributed to the rise of dangerous bacteria. In December 2012, the FDA announced plans to phase out certain antibiotics in the food production industry.[101]\\r\\nIn February 2014, Chick-fil-A announced plans to serve chicken raised without antibiotics in its restaurants nationwide within five years. Chick-fil-A is the first quick service restaurant to set forth a plan and commit to serving only poultry raised without antibiotics.[102]","input":"When was the first chick fil a opened?"},{"output":"Star Trek","context":"Star Trek and Star Wars are American media franchises which present alternative scenarios of space adventure. The two franchises are dominant in this setting of storytelling and have offered various forms of media productions for decades that manage billions of dollars of intellectual property, providing employment and entertainment for billions of people around the world.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nStar Trek was introduced as a live-action television series in 1966 that lasted three years. Star Trek: The Animated Series commenced in 1973 (based directly on the original series) but lasted only two seasons with a combined total of 22 episodes.[2] With the subsequent publication of novels, comics, animated series, toys and feature films, Star Trek grew into a popular media franchise.[3]\\r\\nStar Wars was introduced as a feature film, A New Hope (1977). A novelization titled Star Wars: From the Adventures of Luke Skywalker, based on the original script of the film, was published about a year earlier. Upon the release of the first film, Star Wars quickly grew into a popular media franchise.[2]\\r\\nStar Trek debuted in television. The franchise was conceived in the style of the television Western Wagon Train and the adventure stories of Horatio Hornblower, but evolved into an idealistic, utopian prospect of future human society. Inspired by Gulliver's Travels,[4][5] Star Trek's main focus is of space exploration and a galactic society consisting of multiple planets and species, where conflict occasionally occurs. Star Trek occurs in the relatively distant future, specifically the 22nd through 24th centuries, with occasional time travel and interdimensional travel. The Earth of the Star Trek universe shares most of its history with the real world.\\r\\nStar Wars debuted in film, despite the novel based on the film's original script having been published a year before the film itself. Star Wars mainly belongs to the space opera subgenre of science fiction that was inspired by works such as Beowulf, King Arthur[6] and other mythologies, world religions, as well as ancient and medieval history.[7] It depicts a galactic society in constant conflict. Though there are periods of peace, these are only documented in novels, comics, video games, non-feature films and other spin-off media. Star Wars is set \\"a long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away\\", although many characters are human, occasionally use Earth metaphors and exhibit human character traits.[citation needed]\\r\\nAlthough both Star Trek and Star Wars populate various forms of media, not all types have been produced that are mutual to both franchises. Star Wars has not produced any live-action television series while Star Trek has produced six live-action television series.\\r\\nStar Trek likewise has not produced any television films; whereas Star Wars has produced at least three live-action television films outside the Star Wars film saga. The Star Wars Holiday Special, Ewoks: Caravan of Courage and Ewoks: Battle for Endor are all live-action television spin-off films set in the Star Wars universe, but not considered part of the official Star Wars canon.\\r\\nAside from having the word 'Star' in their respective titles, the two franchises share many similarities and commonalities. Both franchises have their origins in the space western subgenre.[citation needed]\\r\\nBoth stories depict societies consisting of multiple planets and species. The main galaxy in Star Trek consists of various planets, each inhabited by different species, united into a single state, the United Federation of Planets. Star Wars depicts a galaxy that is mostly part of a single state known as the Old Republic, inhabited by humans and countless other species, which later became the Galactic Empire and was again later reformed into a new society called the New Republic after a series of wars.\\r\\nBoth franchises promote philosophical and political messages.\\r\\nThe primary philosophies of Star Trek convey the morals of exploration and interference and how to properly confront and ethically resolve a new situation. Creator Gene Roddenberry was inspired by morality tales such as Gulliver's Travels.[4][5]\\r\\nThe primary philosophical messages of Star Wars are the ethics of good against evil and how to distinguish them from one another.[8] Star Wars preaches against totalitarian systems and favors societies that offer equality.[9] In an interview on the Star Wars 20th Anniversary UK Programme aired in 1997 referring to the mythology of the original Star Wars trilogy, Patrick Stewart stated \\"A belief in one's own powers; especially one's own powers to do good because the underlying morality of Star Wars is a very very positive one.\\"\\r\\nThere have been actors from both franchises who have appeared on common television series such as The Outer Limits and Seaquest.\\r\\nBoth franchises also derive significantly from history and ancient mythology, including Greco-Roman mythology. Many planets and alien species in Star Trek, for instance, are named after ancient Roman deities. Several episodes from various Star Trek television series, such as \\"Who Mourns for Adonais\\", are directly based on ancient Greek-Roman themes and settings.[10] The series also make references to Ancient Babylon and its mythic folklore.[11] The Klingons and their warrior culture are a representation of the 12th century Mongols.[12]\\r\\nMuch of Star Wars' story plots and character developments are based on ancient history, including classical Greece and Rome, such as the fall of the Old Republic in Star Wars, followed by the rise of the Galactic Empire, which parallels the fall of the ancient Roman Republic followed by the rise of the Roman Empire.[7]\\r\\nA 1983 documentary on the making of Star Wars Episode VI: Return of the Jedi was hosted by Leonard Nimoy, who also made mention of Lucas's original plan to do two other trilogies preceding and proceeding the original trilogy.[13]\\r\\nJ. J. Abrams, director and producer of Star Trek (2009) and Star Trek Into Darkness (2013) and producer of Star Trek Beyond (2016), directed and produced Star Wars: The Force Awakens (2015). Star Trek (2009) and Star Wars: The Force Awakens (2015) are each the first entries in expected trilogies. These films received favorable critical and commercial response and revived interest for both franchises. In addition to Abrams, actors such as Simon Pegg starred in both series.\\r\\nStar Trek: Nemesis (2002) was poorly received and Star Wars: Episode III ÿ Revenge of the Sith (2005) had capped off the prequel trilogy, which overall had a mixed to positive reception.\\r\\nThe newer films of the two franchises filmed major scenes in the United Arab Emirates. The desert scenes on the planet Jakku in Star Wars: The Force Awakens (2015) were filmed in the Emirate of Abu Dhabi,[14] while scenes for cities in the film Star Trek Beyond (2016) were filmed in the Emirate of Dubai.[15]\\r\\nThe two franchises now offer almost all forms of media ranging from novels, television series, comic books, toys for younger audience, magazines, themed merchandise, board games and video games, as well as fan works. These include canonical and non-canonical works, including works made both by series producers and fans jointly.\\r\\nDespite the difference in the numbers of films, the profit made by the Star Wars film series exceed the profit of the Star Trek film series by almost five times, while the entire franchise outgrosses the other by four times. It is difficult to accurately judge the total worth of each franchise as television series, memorabilia and video games must be taken into account.\\r\\nScience fiction writer David Brin criticized Star Wars at the time of the release of The Phantom Menace, arguing that while the Star Wars movies provide special effects and action/adventure, audiences are not encouraged to engage with their overriding themes. Among his issues with Star Wars and George Lucas, whom he accused of \\"having an agenda\\", is that the Star Wars galaxy is too \\"elitist\\", with arbitrary rulers on both the evil and good sides, replacing one another without any involvement of the population. He criticizes both sides of the Galactic Civil War as part of the \\"same genetically superior royal family\\".[18] He finds the Star Wars universe flawed with additional forms of absolutism, such as justified emotions leading a good person to evil - for example citing the idea that Luke Skywalker killing Palpatine would somehow turn him to the dark side, despite the act potentially saving millions of lives.[18]\\r\\nAmong the many other flaws he sees with Star Wars is that Anakin Skywalker becomes a hero in the ending of Return of the Jedi simply because he saved his son's life, while the atrocities he committed during his time in power go largely ignored. In contrast, he argues that, despite its flaws, Star Trek is \\"democratic\\" and follows genuine issues and strong questioning.[18]\\r\\nWilliam Shatner argues that Star Trek is superior to Star Wars. According to him, \\"Star Trek had relationships and conflict among the relationships and stories that involved humanity and philosophical questions.\\"[19] Shatner believes that Star Wars was only better than Star Trek in terms of special effects, and that once J.J. Abrams became involved, Star Trek was able to \\"supersede Star Wars on every level\\".[19]\\r\\nTim Russ, who played Tuvok on Star Trek: Voyager, claims that it is difficult to find common enough elements to be able to compare the two. Among those common elements are their similar settings of unique characters and technologies. He echoed Shatner that Star Trek reflects common human issues, the morals of exploration and considers ethical questions. Star Wars in his view is a classic medieval tale dressed up as action-adventure, and that embraces the Eastern philosophy of inner-strength. Russ concludes that despite both their success and popularity, Star Trek comes out as the better of the two, as it is set in \\"our\\" galaxy and therefore people can relate better to it, whereas Star Wars takes place in another galaxy. He acknowledged that he could be biased.[2]\\r\\nJeremy Bulloch is best known for his role as Boba Fett in the original Star Wars trilogy. He is a huge fan of Star Trek: The Original Series. He argued that while both franchises are popular, Star Wars comes out as the superior, for its soundtracks and special effects.[2]\\r\\nContrasting the focus of the two franchises, contributor J.C. Herzthe of The New York Times argued, \\"Trek fandom revolves around technology because the Star Trek universe was founded on ham-fisted dialogue and Gong Show-caliber acting. But the fictional science has always been brilliant. The science in Star Wars is nonsense, and everyone knows it. But no one cares because Star Wars isn't about science. It's epic drama. It's about those incredibly well-developed characters and the moral decisions they face. People don't get into debates about how the second Death Star works. They get into debates about the ethics of blowing it up.\\"[20]\\r\\nJohn Wenzel of The Denver Post highlighted two differences in approach, noting the \\"swashbuckling\\" and \\"gunslinger\\" style of Star Wars compared with Star Trek's \\"broader themes of utopian living, justice and identity\\" and that the spiritual aspect of Star Wars contrasts with the balance of emotion and logic seen in Star Trek.[21]\\r\\nBillionaire Peter Thiel told Dowd \\"I'm a capitalist. Star Wars is the capitalist show. Star Trek is the communist one\\". He further stated \\"There is no money in Star Trek because you just have the transporter machine that can make anything you need. The whole plot of Star Wars starts with Han Solo having this debt that he owes and so the plot in Star Wars is driven by money.\\"[22]\\r\\nArchived footage in Trek Nation showed Gene Roddenberry saying, \\"I like Star Wars. It was young King Arthur growing up, slaying the evil emperor finally. There's nothing wrong with that kind of entertainment - everything doesn't have to create a philosophy for you - for your whole life. You can also have fun.\\"[23]\\r\\nThe two franchises have a \\"symbiotic relationship\\" stated Shatner, who credits Star Wars for launching the Star Trek films.[24] He repeated this sentiment at a 2016 Star Trek fan convention in Las Vegas by stating \\"Star Wars created Star Trek\\". He clarified this statement by explaining that at the time of the release of the first Star Wars film (A New Hope), Paramount, then under new management, was struggling to come up with something that could compete with it. A Star Trek relaunch was the choice. Since then, public interest has returned to Star Trek.[25] \\"It was Star Wars that thrust Star Trek into the people of Paramount's consciousness\\" Shatner stated.[26][27]\\r\\nThe documentary Trek Nation features interviews where both Lucas and Roddenberry praise each other's respective franchises, with the former stating that Star Trek was an influence while writing the original screenplay for Star Wars.[23] He explained that while both franchises were so \\"far out\\", Star Trek produced a fanbase that \\"softened up the entertainment arena\\" so that Star Wars could \\"come along and stand on its shoulders.\\"[28] This is also acknowledged by Shatner, who went as far as to call Star Wars a \\"derivative\\" of Star Trek.[19]\\r\\nA few references to Star Wars have been inserted into Star Trek films. For fleeting moments, one can see ships and droids from Star Wars in both Star Trek (2009) and Star Trek Into Darkness (2013).[29] Some Star Trek films and television episodes used the Star Wars animation shop, Industrial Light & Magic, for their special effects.[30]\\r\\nWhen Roddenberry was honored at a Star Trek convention late in life, a congratulatory letter from Lucas was presented by an actor dressed as Darth Vader. A few years earlier, Roddenberry had contributed an entry in honor of Star Wars and Lucas at a convention honoring the latter.[citation needed]\\r\\nWilliam Shatner was a presenter at Lucas' American Film Institute Lifetime Achievement Award ceremony in 2007 and did a comical stage performance honoring Lucas.[31]\\r\\nAt a live concert, Shatner dressed as an imperial stormtrooper singing 'Girl Crush' alongside Carrie Underwood and Brad Paisley.[32]\\r\\nIn 2011, Shatner and Carrie Fisher posted a series of humorous YouTube videos satirizing each other's franchises.\\r\\nIn a 2016 interview, Shatner commented that Captain Kirk and Princess Leia eloping and running off into the sunset would be the \\"perfect union\\" between Star Trek and Star Wars.[19]\\r\\nShatner has also posted a number of humorous tweets on his Twitter account mocking Star Wars. Amongst them were commemorating the 35th anniversary of the poorly received Star Wars Holiday Special. It was then that Star Wars actor Peter Mayhew posted a \\"retaliation\\" tweet congratulating Shatner for the directing of Star Trek V: The Final Frontier, another poorly received film.[33]\\r\\nBoth franchises are set to grow throughout the next decade.\\r\\nStar Trek was rebooted with a series of feature films starting with the Star Trek reboot (2009), which was followed by Star Trek Into Darkness (2013) and Star Trek Beyond (2016) and a number of sequels are set to follow. A new television series based in the original timeline, subtitled Discovery, serving as a prequel to the original series, debuted on CBS All Access, an online streaming platform, in 2017.[34]\\r\\nStar Wars picked up from where Return of the Jedi left off, with The Force Awakens the first in the new trilogy, and The Last Jedi following two years later. Additionally, more spin-off media is also underway after the debut of Star Wars Rebels, a television series set in between the Star Wars prequels and the original trilogy, and an anthology of stand-alone Star Wars films, starting with Rogue One, which was released in December 2016, and Solo following in May 2018.[35]\\r\\nAside from official works by the producers of Star Trek and Star Wars, many fan films and webisodes set in the two universes of the franchises are also constantly produced and posted on the Internet by fans, but are not officially considered canon in relation to either franchise.","input":"What was made first star wars or star trek?"},{"output":"November 1983","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nJon Krakauer (born April 12, 1954) is an American writer and mountaineer, primarily known for his writings about the outdoors, especially mountain climbing. He is the author of best-selling non-fiction booksInto the Wild, Into Thin Air, Under the Banner of Heaven, and Where Men Win Glory: The Odyssey of Pat Tillmanas well as numerous magazine articles. He was a member of an ill-fated expedition to summit Mount Everest in 1996, one of the deadliest disasters in the history of climbing Everest.\\r\\n\\r\\nKrakauer was born in Brookline, Massachusetts, as the third of five children of Carol Ann (ne Jones) and Lewis Joseph Krakauer. His father was Jewish and his mother was a Unitarian, of Scandinavian descent.[1][2] He was raised in Corvallis, Oregon, from the age of two. His father introduced the young Krakauer to mountaineering at the age of eight. He competed in tennis at Corvallis High School, and graduated in 1972. He went on to study at Hampshire College in Massachusetts, where in 1976 he received his degree in Environmental Studies. In 1977, he met former climber Linda Mariam Moore, and they married in 1980. They lived in Seattle, Washington, but moved to Boulder, Colorado after the release of Krakauer's book Into Thin Air.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter graduating from college, Krakauer spent three weeks alone in the wilderness of the Stikine Icecap region of Alaska and climbed a new route on the Devils Thumb, an experience he described in Eiger Dreams and in Into the Wild.  In 1992, he made his way to Cerro Torre in the Andes of Patagoniaa sheer granite peak considered to be one of the most difficult technical climbs in the world.\\r\\n\\r\\nKrakauer's most recognized climb was a guided ascent of Mount Everest that became known as the 1996 Mount Everest disaster. Soon after summitting the peak, Krakauer's team met with disaster as four of his teammates (including group leader Rob Hall) perished while making their descent in the middle of a storm.\\r\\n\\r\\nA candid recollection of the event was published in Outside magazine and, later, in the book Into Thin Air. By the end of the 1996 climbing season, fifteen people had died on the mountain, making it the deadliest single year in Everest history to that point. This has been exceeded by the sixteen deaths in the 2014 Mount Everest avalanche, and the 2015 earthquake avalanche disaster in which nineteen people were killed. Krakauer publicly criticized the commercialization of Mount Everest following this tragedy.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nMuch of Krakauer's popularity as a writer came from his work as a journalist for Outside. In November 1983, he was able to give up his part-time work as a fisherman and carpenter to become a full-time writer. In addition to his work on mountain climbing, the topics he covered as a freelance writer varied greatly; his writing has also appeared in Architectural Digest, National Geographic Magazine, Rolling Stone, and Smithsonian. Krakauer's 1992 book Eiger Dreams collects some of his articles written between 1982 and 1989.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn assignment for Outside, Krakauer wrote an article focusing on two parties during his ascent of Mt. Everest: the one he was in, led by Rob Hall, and the one led by Scott Fischer, both of which successfully guided clients to the summit but experienced severe difficulty during the descent. The storm, and, in his estimation, irresponsible choices by guides of both parties, led to a number of deaths, including both head guides. Krakauer felt the short account did not accurately cover the event, and clarified his initial statementsespecially those regarding the death of Andy Harrisin Into Thin Air, which also includes extensive interviews with fellow survivors.\\r\\n\\r\\nEiger Dreams: Ventures Among Men and Mountains (1992) is a non-fiction collection of articles and essays by Jon Krakauer on mountaineering and rock climbing. It concerns a variety of topics, from ascending the Eiger Nordwand in the Swiss Alps, Denali in Alaska or K2 in the Karakoram, to the well-known rock climbers Krakauer has met on his trips, such as John Gill.\\r\\n\\r\\nInto the Wild was published in 1996 and spent two years on The New York Times Best Seller List. The book employs a non-linear narrative that documents the travels of Christopher McCandless, a young man from a well-to-do East Coast family who, in 1990, after graduating from Emory University, donated all of the money ($24,000) in his bank account to the humanitarian charity Oxfam, renamed himself \\"Alexander Supertramp\\", and began a journey in the American West. McCandless' remains were found in August 1992; he had died of starvation near Lake Wentitika in Denali National Park and Preserve. In the book, Krakauer draws parallels between McCandless' experiences and his own, and the experiences of other adventurers. Into The Wild was adapted into a film of the same name, which was released on September 21, 2007.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1997, Krakauer expanded his September 1996 Outside article into what has become his best-known book, Into Thin Air. The book describes the climbing parties' experiences and the general state of Everest mountaineering at the time. Hired as a journalist by the magazine, Krakauer had participated as a client of the 1996 Everest climbing team led by Rob Hallthe team which ended up suffering the greatest casualties in the 1996 Mount Everest disaster.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe book reached the top of The New York Times' non-fiction bestseller list, was honored as \\"Book of the Year\\" by Time magazine, and was among three books considered for the General Non-Fiction Pulitzer Prize in 1998. The American Academy of Arts and Letters gave Krakauer an Academy Award in Literature in 1999 for his work, commenting that the writer \\"combines the tenacity and courage of the finest tradition of investigative journalism with the stylish subtlety and profound insight of the born writer. His account of an ascent of Mount Everest has led to a general reevaluation of climbing and of the commercialization of what was once a romantic, solitary sport.\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nKrakauer has contributed royalties from this book to the Everest '96 Memorial Fund at the Boulder Community Foundation, which he founded as a tribute to his deceased climbing partners.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a TV-movie version of the book, Krakauer was played by Christopher McDonald. Everest, a feature film based on the events of the disaster directed by Baltasar Kormkur, was released in 2015.[4] In the film, Krakauer is portrayed by Michael Kelly. Krakauer denounced the movie, saying some of its details were fabricated and defamatory. He also expressed regret regarding Sony's rapid acquisition of the rights to the book. Director Baltasar Kormkur responded, claiming Krakauer's first-person account was not used as source material for the film, and alleged that his version of events conflicted with the plot.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the book, Krakauer noted that Russian-Kazakhstani guide Anatoli Boukreev, Scott Fischer's top guide on the expedition, ascended the summit without supplemental oxygen, \\"which didn't seem to be in [the] clients' best interest\\".[6] He also wrote that Boukreev descended from the summit several hours ahead of his clients, and that this was \\"extremely unorthodox behavior for a guide\\".[7] He noted however that, once he had descended to the top camp, Boukreev was heroic in his tireless rescue attempts of the missing climbers. Five months after Into Thin Air was published, Boukreev gave his own account of the Everest disaster in the book The Climb, co-written with G. Weston DeWalt.\\r\\n\\r\\nDifferences centered on what experienced mountaineers thought about the facts of Boukreev's performance. As Galen Rowell from the American Alpine Journal wrote to Krakauer, \\"the fact that every one of Boukreev's clients survived without major injuries while the clients who died or received major injuries were members of your party. Could you explain how Anatoli [Boukreev]'s shortcomings as a guide led to the survival of his clients?\\"[8] Conversely, Scott Fischer, the leader of Boukreev's team who died on the mountain, had complained continuously about Boukreev's shirking responsibility and his inability to meet the demands put upon him as the top guidecomplaints documented in transcripts of radio transmissions between Fischer and his base-camp managers[citation needed]. After the publication of Into Thin Air and The Climb, DeWalt, Boukreev, and Krakauer became embroiled in disagreements about Krakauer's portrayal of Boukreev. Krakauer had reached a dtente with Boukreev in November 1997, but the Russian climber was killed by an avalanche only a few weeks later while climbing Annapurna.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2003, Under the Banner of Heaven became Krakauer's third non-fiction bestseller. The book examines extremes of religious belief, specifically fundamentalist offshoots of Mormonism. Krakauer looks at the practice of polygamy in these offshoots and scrutinizes it in the context of the Latter Day Saints religion throughout history. Much of the focus of the book is on the Lafferty brothers, who murdered in the name of their fundamentalist faith.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2006, Tom Elliott and Pawel Gula produced a documentary inspired by the book, Damned to Heaven.\\r\\n\\r\\nRobert Millet, Professor of Religious Understanding at Brigham Young University, an LDS institution, reviewed the book and described it as confusing, poorly organized, misleading, erroneous, prejudicial and insulting.[10] Mike Otterson, Director of Media Relations for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS), told the Associated Press, \\"This book is not history, and Krakauer is no historian. He is a storyteller who cuts corners to make the story sound good. His basic thesis appears to be that people who are religious are irrational, and that irrational people do strange things.\\"[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn response, Krakauer criticized the LDS Church hierarchy, citing the opinion of D. Michael Quinn, a historian who was excommunicated in 1993, who wrote that \\"The tragic reality is that there have been occasions when Church leaders, teachers, and writers have not told the truth they knew about difficulties of the Mormon past, but have offered to the Saints instead a mixture of platitudes, half-truths, omissions, and plausible denials\\". Krakauer wrote, \\"I happen to share Dr. Quinn's perspective\\".[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the October 25, 2007 season premiere of Iconoclasts on the Sundance Channel, Krakauer mentioned being deeply embroiled in the writing of a new book, but did not reveal the title, subject, or expected date of completion. Doubleday Publishing originally planned to release the book in the fall of 2008, but postponed the launch in June of that year, announcing that Krakauer was \\"unhappy with the manuscript\\".[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe book, Where Men Win Glory: The Odyssey of Pat Tillman, was released by Doubleday on September 15, 2009. It draws on the journals and letters of Pat Tillman, an NFL professional football player and U.S. Army Ranger whose death in Afghanistan made him a symbol of American sacrifice and heroism, though it also became a subject of controversy about the handling of the announcement of his death by the U.S. Army. The book draws on the journals and letters of Tillman, interviews with his wife and friends, conversations with the soldiers who served alongside him, and research Krakauer performed in Afghanistan.

The book follows several case studies of women raped in Missoula, Montana, many of them linked in some way to the University of Montana. Krakauer attempts to illuminate why many victims do not want to report their rapes to the police, and he criticizes the justice system for giving the benefit of the doubt to assailants but not to victims. Krakauer was inspired[14] to write the book when a friend of his, a young woman, revealed to him that she had been raped.\\r\\n\\r\\nEmily Bazelon, writing for the New York Times Book Review, gave the book a lukewarm review, criticizing it for not fully exploring its characters or appreciating the difficulty colleges face in handling and trying to prevent sexual assault.[14] \\"Instead of delving deeply into questions of fairness as universities try to fulfill a recent government mandate to conduct their own investigations and hearings ÿ apart from the police and the courts ÿ Krakauer settles for bromides,\\" Bazelon wrote. \\"University procedures should 'swiftly identify student offenders and prevent them from reoffending, while simultaneously safeguarding the rights of the accused,' he writes, asserting that this 'will be difficult, but it's not rocket science\\".\\r\\n\\r\\nAs of  2004[update], Krakauer edits the Exploration series of the Modern Library.\\r\\n\\r\\nKrakauer was featured during a CBS 60 Minutes report on April 17, 2011 where 60 Minutes reporter Steve Kroft raised questions about humanitarian Greg Mortenson and the non-profit Central Asia Institute (CAI). Krakauer questioned the accuracy of events in Mortenson's book Three Cups of Tea and whether Mortenson was kidnapped by the Taliban in 1996 as described in his second book, Stones into Schools. Krakauer went on to question Mortenson's credibility through the financial practices of CAI. Krakauer had been a financial supporter of Mortenson's work and had previously donated $75,000 before becoming disillusioned with him and his management of CAI.[15] The 60 Minutes story largely retraced the conclusions Krakauer came to as described in his e-book, Three Cups of Deceit ÿ How Greg Mortenson, Humanitarian Hero, Lost His Way.[16] The e-book was released the day after the 60 Minutes piece aired.\\r\\n\\r\\nScott Darsney, a respected mountaineer and friend of Greg Mortenson, wrote a response to Krakauer's allegations that was published as an exclusive article in Outside magazine's online version.[17] Darnsey's response questioned the accuracy and fairness of both the Krakauer piece and the 60 Minutes report. He further stated that Krakauer either misquoted or misunderstood what he said when interviewed by the author.  Darnsey went on to say that Krakauer took Mortenson's experiences in Afghanistan and Pakistan out of context and added, \\"If Jon Krakauer and some of Greg's detractors had taken the time to have three or more cups of tea with Greg and othersinstead of one cup of tea with a select few who would discredit himthey would have found some minor problems and transgressions. But to the extent to call it all 'lies' and 'fraud'? No way.\\" Darnsey stated in reference to the possibility that Mortenson has been dishonest in his financial dealings through CAI, \\"If Greg is misappropriating funds, then show me the luxury cars, fancy boats, and closets full of shoes. This is not a \\"ministry\\" or a business gone corrupt.\\" The Outside article also touched on the allegations that Mortenson lied about being held captive by the Taliban. In light of that controversy, Darnsey stated, \\"Greg recounted to me his imprisonment in Waziristan when I met him in Beijing. I don't doubt that he was held against his will.\\" Darnsey's article went on to say that Krakauer is a respected journalist and a \\"stickler for details and getting the facts straight\\", but that he felt \\"the research needs to continue\\".\\r\\n\\r\\nIn February 2012, it was reported that an investigation by the Montana Attorney General was underway.[18]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn April 5, 2012, the Montana Attorney General's office released a report noting financial \\"missteps\\" by CAI and Greg Mortenson. The Attorney General reached a settlement for restitution from Mortenson to CAI in excess of $1?million.[19]\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to the May 3, 2013 issue of The Los Angeles Times, the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco upheld the 2012 federal dismissal by Judge Samuel Haddon in Montana, stating he had ruled in accordance to the laws and rules governing class action suits.[20] Haddon ruled correctly that readers were not entitled to financial compensation based on any of the arguments presented by the plaintiffs. The suit was filed days after the publication of the above titled book, as well as the \\"60 Minutes\\" presentation.[20]\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to Central Asia Institute's Board chairman, Steve Barrett, announced on October 9, 2013, that the CAI and Mortenson have fully complied with all the specific actions and repayments as negotiated by the settlement with then Attorney General (now Governor) Steve Bullock.[21]\\r\\n\\r\\nJournalists Jennifer Jordan and Jeff Rhoads began investigating the claims against Mortenson and made a 2016 documentary 3000 Cups of Tea.

Jordan said in 2014: \\"We are still investigating this story. So far, our findings are indicating that the majority of the allegations are grossly misrepresented to make him appear in the worst possible light, or are outright false. Yes, Greg is a bad manager and accountant, and he is the first to admit that, but he is also a tireless humanitarian with a crucially important mission.\\"[22][23]","input":"When was krakauer considered a success as a writer?"},{"output":"in May","context":"The Neutrality Acts were passed by the United States Congress in the 1930s, in response to the growing turmoil in Europe and Asia that eventually led to World War II. They were spurred by the growth in isolationism and non-interventionism in the US following its costly involvement in World War I, and sought to ensure that the US would not become entangled again in foreign conflicts.\\r\\nThe legacy of the Neutrality Acts is widely regarded as having been generally negative: they made no distinction between aggressor and victim, treating both equally as \\"belligerents\\"; and they limited the US government's ability to aid Britain and France against Nazi Germany. The acts were largely repealed in 1941, in the face of German submarine attacks on U.S. vessels and the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Nye Committee hearings between 1934 and 1936 and several best-selling books of the time, like H. C. Engelbrecht's The Merchants of Death (1934), supported the conviction of many Americans that the U.S. entry into World War I had been orchestrated by bankers and arms dealers for profit reasons. This strengthened the position of isolationists and non-interventionists in the country.\\r\\nPowerful forces in United States Congress pushing for non-interventionism and strong Neutrality Acts were the Republican Senators William Edgar Borah, Arthur H. Vandenberg, Gerald P. Nye and Robert M. La Follette, Jr.,[1] but support of non-interventionism was not limited to the Republican party. The Ludlow Amendment, requiring a public referendum before any declaration of war except in cases of defense against direct attack, was introduced several times without success between 1935 and 1940 by Democratic Representative Louis Ludlow.\\r\\nDemocratic President Roosevelt and especially his Secretary of State Cordell Hull were critical of the Neutrality Acts, fearing that they would restrict the administration's options to support friendly nations. Even though both the House and Senate had large Democratic majorities throughout these years, there was enough support for the Acts among Democrats (especially those representing Southern states) to ensure their passage. Although Congressional support was insufficient to override a presidential veto, Roosevelt felt he could not afford to snub the South and anger public opinion, especially while facing re-election in 1936 and needing Congressional co-operation on domestic issues. With considerable reluctance, the president signed the Neutrality Acts into law.[2]\\r\\nRoosevelt's State Department had lobbied for embargo provisions that would allow the President to impose sanctions selectively. This was rejected by Congress. The 1935 act,[3] signed on August 31, 1935, imposed a general embargo on trading in arms and war materials with all parties in a war. It also declared that American citizens traveling on warring ships traveled at their own risk. The act was set to expire after six months.\\r\\nWhen Congress passed the Neutrality Act of 1935, the State Department established an office to enforce the provisions of the Act. The Office of Arms and Munitions Control, renamed the Division of Controls in 1939 when the office was expanded, consisted of Joseph C. Green and Charles W. Yost.\\r\\nRoosevelt invoked the act after Italy's invasion of Ethiopia in October 1935, preventing all arms and ammunition shipments to Italy and Ethiopia. He also declared a \\"moral embargo\\" against the belligerents, covering trade not falling under the Neutrality Act.[4]\\r\\nThe Neutrality Act of 1936,[5] passed in February of that year, renewed the provisions of the 1935 act for another 14 months. It also forbade all loans or credits to belligerents.\\r\\nHowever, this act did not cover \\"civil wars\\", such as that in Spain (1936ÿ1939), nor did it cover materials such as trucks and oil. U.S. companies such as Texaco, Standard Oil, Ford, General Motors, and Studebaker exploited this loophole to sell such items to General Franco on credit. By 1939, Franco owed these and other companies more than $100,000,000.[6]\\r\\nIn January 1937, the Congress passed a joint resolution outlawing the arms trade with Spain. The Neutrality Act of 1937[7] was passed in May and included the provisions of the earlier acts, this time without expiration date, and extended them to cover civil wars as well.[8] Furthermore, U.S. ships were prohibited from transporting any passengers or articles to belligerents, and U.S. citizens were forbidden from traveling on ships of belligerent nations.\\r\\nIn a concession to Roosevelt, a \\"cash-and-carry\\" provision that had been devised by his advisor Bernard Baruch was added: the President could permit the sale of materials and supplies to belligerents in Europe as long as the recipients arranged for the transport and paid immediately with cash, with the argument that this would not draw the U.S. into the conflict. Roosevelt believed that cash-and-carry would aid France and Great Britain in the event of a war with Germany, since they were the only countries that controlled the seas and were able to take advantage of the provision.[2] The cash-and-carry clause was set to expire after two years.\\r\\nJapan invaded China in July 1937, starting the Second Sino-Japanese War. President Roosevelt, who supported the Chinese side, chose not to invoke the Neutrality Acts since the parties had not formally declared war. In so doing, he ensured that China's efforts to defend itself would not be hindered by the legislation: China was dependent on arms imports and only Japan would have been able to take advantage of cash-and-carry. This outraged the isolationists in Congress who claimed that the spirit of the law was being undermined. Roosevelt stated that he would prohibit American ships from transporting arms to the belligerents, but he allowed British ships to transport American arms to China.[9] Roosevelt gave his Quarantine Speech in October 1937, outlining a move away from neutrality and toward \\"quarantining\\" all aggressors. He then imposed a \\"moral embargo\\" on exports of aircraft to Japan.[4]\\r\\nEarly in 1939, after Nazi Germany had invaded Czechoslovakia, Roosevelt lobbied Congress to have the cash-and-carry provision renewed. He was rebuffed, the provision lapsed, and the mandatory arms embargo remained in place.\\r\\nIn September 1939, after Germany had invaded Poland, Great Britain and France declared war on Germany. Roosevelt invoked the provisions of the Neutrality Act but came before Congress and lamented that the Neutrality Acts may give passive aid to an aggressor country.[10] Congress was divided. Nye wanted to broaden the embargo, and other isolationists like Vandenberg and Hiram Johnson vowed to fight \\"from hell to breakfast\\" Roosevelt's desire to loosen the embargo. An \\"outstanding Republican leader\\" who supported helping nations under attack, however, told H. V. Kaltenborn that the embargo was futile because a neutral country like Italy could buy from the US and sell its own weapons to Germany, while US companies would relocate factories to Canada.[11]\\r\\nRoosevelt prevailed over the isolationists, and on November 4 the Neutrality Act of 1939 was passed,[12] allowing for arms trade with belligerent nations (Great Britain and France) on a cash-and-carry basis, thus in effect ending the arms embargo. Furthermore, the Neutrality Acts of 1935 and 1937 were repealed, American citizens and ships were barred from entering war zones designated by the President, and the National Munitions Control Board (which had been created by the 1935 Neutrality Act) was charged with issuing licenses for all arms imports and exports. Arms trade without a license became a federal crime,[13] with a penalty of up to two years in prison.\\r\\nThe end of neutrality policy came with the Lend-Lease Act of March 1941, which allowed the U.S. to sell, lend or give war materials to nations the US administration wanted to support.\\r\\nAfter repeated attacks by German submarines on U.S. ships, Roosevelt announced on September 11, 1941, that he had ordered the U.S. Navy to attack German and Italian war vessels in the \\"waters which we deem necessary for our defense\\". Following the sinking of the U.S. destroyer Reuben James on October 31, many of the provisions of the Neutrality Acts were repealed on November 17, 1941: merchant vessels were allowed to be armed and to carry any cargoes to belligerent nations. The U.S. formally declared war on Japan on December 8, 1941 following the attack on Pearl Harbor of the previous day; Germany and Italy declared war on the U.S. on December 11, 1941, and the U.S. responded with a declaration of war on the same day.\\r\\nThe provision against unlicensed arms trades of the 1939 act remains in force.[14]\\r\\nIn 1948, Charles Winters, Al Schwimmer and Herman Greenspun were convicted under the 1939 Act after smuggling B-17 Flying Fortress bombers from Florida to the nascent state of Israel during the 1948 ArabÿIsraeli War.[15] All three received Presidential pardons in subsequent decades.[16]","input":"When was the neutrality act of 1937 passed?"},{"output":"late 5th to early 6th century","context":"King Arthur is a legendary British leader who, according to medieval histories and romances, led the defence of Britain against Saxon invaders in the late 5th and early 6th centuries AD. The details of Arthur's story are mainly composed of folklore and literary invention, and his historical existence is debated and disputed by modern historians.[2] The sparse historical background of Arthur is gleaned from various sources, including the Annales Cambriae, the Historia Brittonum, and the writings of Gildas. Arthur's name also occurs in early poetic sources such as Y Gododdin.[3]\\r\\nArthur is a central figure in the legends making up the Matter of Britain. The legendary Arthur developed as a figure of international interest largely through the popularity of Geoffrey of Monmouth's fanciful and imaginative 12th-century Historia Regum Britanniae (History of the Kings of Britain).[4] In some Welsh and Breton tales and poems that date from before this work, Arthur appears either as a great warrior defending Britain from human and supernatural enemies or as a magical figure of folklore, sometimes associated with the Welsh Otherworld, Annwn.[5] How much of Geoffrey's Historia (completed in 1138) was adapted from such earlier sources, rather than invented by Geoffrey himself, is unknown.\\r\\nAlthough the themes, events and characters of the Arthurian legend varied widely from text to text, and there is no one canonical version, Geoffrey's version of events often served as the starting point for later stories. Geoffrey depicted Arthur as a king of Britain who defeated the Saxons and established an empire over Britain, Ireland, Iceland, Norway and Gaul. Many elements and incidents that are now an integral part of the Arthurian story appear in Geoffrey's Historia, including Arthur's father Uther Pendragon, the wizard Merlin, Arthur's wife Guinevere, the sword Excalibur, Arthur's conception at Tintagel, his final battle against Mordred at Camlann, and final rest in Avalon. The 12th-century French writer Chrtien de Troyes, who added Lancelot and the Holy Grail to the story, began the genre of Arthurian romance that became a significant strand of medieval literature. In these French stories, the narrative focus often shifts from King Arthur himself to other characters, such as various Knights of the Round Table. Arthurian literature thrived during the Middle Ages but waned in the centuries that followed until it experienced a major resurgence in the 19th century. In the 21st century, the legend lives on, not only in literature but also in adaptations for theatre, film, television, comics and other media.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe historical basis for the King Arthur legend has long been debated by scholars. One school of thought, citing entries in the Historia Brittonum (History of the Britons) and Annales Cambriae (Welsh Annals), sees Arthur as a genuine historical figure, a Romano-British leader who fought against the invading Anglo-Saxons some time in the late 5th to early 6th century. The Historia Brittonum, a 9th-century Latin historical compilation attributed in some late manuscripts to a Welsh cleric called Nennius, contains the first datable mention of King Arthur, listing twelve battles that Arthur fought. These culminate in the Battle of Badon, where he is said to have single-handedly killed 960 men. Recent studies, however, question the reliability of the Historia Brittonum.[7]\\r\\nThe other text that seems to support the case for Arthur's historical existence is the 10th-century Annales Cambriae, which also link Arthur with the Battle of Badon. The Annales date this battle to 516ÿ518, and also mention the Battle of Camlann, in which Arthur and Medraut (Mordred) were both killed, dated to 537ÿ539. These details have often been used to bolster confidence in the Historia's account and to confirm that Arthur really did fight at Badon. Problems have been identified, however, with using this source to support the Historia Brittonum's account. The latest research shows that the Annales Cambriae was based on a chronicle begun in the late 8th century in Wales. Additionally, the complex textual history of the Annales Cambriae precludes any certainty that the Arthurian annals were added to it even that early. They were more likely added at some point in the 10th century and may never have existed in any earlier set of annals. The Badon entry probably derived from the Historia Brittonum.[8]\\r\\nThis lack of convincing early evidence is the reason many recent historians exclude Arthur from their accounts of sub-Roman Britain. In the view of historian Thomas Charles-Edwards, \\"at this stage of the enquiry, one can only say that there may well have been an historical Arthur [but ...] the historian can as yet say nothing of value about him\\".[9] These modern admissions of ignorance are a relatively recent trend; earlier generations of historians were less sceptical. The historian John Morris made the putative reign of Arthur the organising principle of his history of sub-Roman Britain and Ireland, The Age of Arthur (1973). Even so, he found little to say about a historical Arthur.[10]\\r\\nPartly in reaction to such theories, another school of thought emerged which argued that Arthur had no historical existence at all. Morris's Age of Arthur prompted the archaeologist Nowell Myres to observe that \\"no figure on the borderline of history and mythology has wasted more of the historian's time\\".[11] Gildas' 6th-century polemic De Excidio et Conquestu Britanniae (On the Ruin and Conquest of Britain), written within living memory of Badon, mentions the battle but does not mention Arthur.[12] Arthur is not mentioned in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle or named in any surviving manuscript written between 400 and 820.[13] He is absent from Bede's early-8th-century Ecclesiastical History of the English People, another major early source for post-Roman history that mentions Badon.[14] The historian David Dumville has written: \\"I think we can dispose of him [Arthur] quite briefly. He owes his place in our history books to a 'no smoke without fire' school of thought?... The fact of the matter is that there is no historical evidence about Arthur; we must reject him from our histories and, above all, from the titles of our books.\\"[15]\\r\\nSome scholars argue that Arthur was originally a fictional hero of folkloreor even a half-forgotten Celtic deitywho became credited with real deeds in the distant past. They cite parallels with figures such as the Kentish Hengist and Horsa, who may be totemic horse-gods that later became historicised. Bede ascribed to these legendary figures a historical role in the 5th-century Anglo-Saxon conquest of eastern Britain.[16] It is not even certain that Arthur was considered a king in the early texts. Neither the Historia nor the Annales calls him \\"rex\\": the former calls him instead \\"dux bellorum\\" (leader of battles) and \\"miles\\" (soldier).[17]\\r\\nHistorical documents for the post-Roman period are scarce, so a definitive answer to the question of Arthur's historical existence is unlikely. Sites and places have been identified as \\"Arthurian\\" since the 12th century,[18] but archaeology can confidently reveal names only through inscriptions found in secure contexts. The so-called \\"Arthur stone\\", discovered in 1998 among the ruins at Tintagel Castle in Cornwall in securely dated 6th-century contexts, created a brief stir but proved irrelevant.[19] Other inscriptional evidence for Arthur, including the Glastonbury cross, is tainted with the suggestion of forgery.[20] Although several historical figures have been proposed as the basis for Arthur,[21] no convincing evidence for these identifications has emerged.\\r\\nThe origin of the Welsh name \\"Arthur\\" remains a matter of debate. Some suggest it is derived from the Roman nomen gentile (family name) Artorius, of obscure and contested etymology[22] (but possibly of Messapian[23][24][25] or Etruscan origin).[26][27][28] Some scholars have suggested it is relevant to this debate that the legendary King Arthur's name only appears as Arthur, or Arturus, in early Latin Arthurian texts, never as Artrius (though it should be noted that Classical Latin Artrius became Arturius in some Vulgar Latin dialects). However, this may not say anything about the origin of the name Arthur, as Artrius would regularly become Art(h)ur when borrowed into Welsh.[29]\\r\\nAnother possibility is that it is derived from a Brittonic patronym *Arto-rؐg-ios (the root of which, *arto-rؐg- \\"bear-king\\" is to be found in the Old Irish personal name Art-ri) via a Latinized form Artrius.[30] Less likely is the commonly proposed derivation from Welsh arth \\"bear\\" + (g)wr \\"man\\" (earlier *Arto-uiros in Brittonic); there are phonological difficulties with this theorynotably that a Brittonic compound name *Arto-uiros should produce Old Welsh *Artgur and Middle/Modern Welsh *Arthwr and not Arthur (in Welsh poetry the name is always spelled Arthur and is exclusively rhymed with words ending in -ur ÿ never words ending in -wr ÿ which confirms that the second element cannot be [g]wr \\"man\\").[31][32]\\r\\nAn alternative theory, which has gained only limited acceptance among professional scholars, derives the name Arthur from Arcturus, the brightest star in the constellation Bo?tes, near Ursa Major or the Great Bear.[33] Classical Latin Arcturus would also have become Art(h)ur when borrowed into Welsh, and its brightness and position in the sky led people to regard it as the \\"guardian of the bear\\" (which is the meaning of the name in Ancient Greek) and the \\"leader\\" of the other stars in Bo?tes.[34]\\r\\nA similar first name is Old Irish Art~r, which is believed to be derived directly from an early Old Welsh or Cumbric Artur.[35] The earliest historically attested bearer of the name is a son or grandson of edn mac Gabrin (d. AD 609).[36]\\r\\nThe creator of the familiar literary persona of Arthur was Geoffrey of Monmouth, with his pseudo-historical Historia Regum Britanniae (History of the Kings of Britain), written in the 1130s. The textual sources for Arthur are usually divided into those written before Geoffrey's Historia (known as pre-Galfridian texts, from the Latin form of Geoffrey, Galfridus) and those written afterwards, which could not avoid his influence (Galfridian, or post-Galfridian, texts).\\r\\nThe earliest literary references to Arthur come from Welsh and Breton sources. There have been few attempts to define the nature and character of Arthur in the pre-Galfridian tradition as a whole, rather than in a single text or text/story-type. A 2007 academic survey that does attempt this by Thomas Green identifies three key strands to the portrayal of Arthur in this earliest material.[37] The first is that he was a peerless warrior who functioned as the monster-hunting protector of Britain from all internal and external threats. Some of these are human threats, such as the Saxons he fights in the Historia Brittonum, but the majority are supernatural, including giant cat-monsters, destructive divine boars, dragons, dogheads, giants, and witches.[38] The second is that the pre-Galfridian Arthur was a figure of folklore (particularly topographic or onomastic folklore) and localised magical wonder-tales, the leader of a band of superhuman heroes who live in the wilds of the landscape.[39] The third and final strand is that the early Welsh Arthur had a close connection with the Welsh Otherworld Annwn. On the one hand, he launches assaults on Otherworldly fortresses in search of treasure and frees their prisoners. On the other, his warband in the earliest sources includes former pagan gods, and his wife and his possessions are clearly Otherworldly in origin.[40]\\r\\nOne of the most famous Welsh poetic references to Arthur comes in the collection of heroic death-songs known as Y Gododdin (The Gododdin), attributed to 6th-century poet Aneirin. One stanza praises the bravery of a warrior who slew 300 enemies, but says that despite this, \\"he was no Arthur\\" ÿ that is, his feats cannot compare to the valour of Arthur.[41] Y Gododdin is known only from a 13th-century manuscript, so it is impossible to determine whether this passage is original or a later interpolation, but John Koch's view that the passage dates from a 7th-century or earlier version is regarded as unproven; 9th- or 10th-century dates are often proposed for it.[42] Several poems attributed to Taliesin, a poet said to have lived in the 6th century, also refer to Arthur, although these all probably date from between the 8th and 12th centuries.[43] They include \\"Kadeir Teyrnon\\" (\\"The Chair of the Prince\\"),[44] which refers to \\"Arthur the Blessed\\"; \\"Preiddeu Annwn\\" (\\"The Spoils of Annwn\\"),[45] which recounts an expedition of Arthur to the Otherworld; and \\"Marwnat vthyr pen[dragon]\\" (\\"The Elegy of Uther Pen[dragon]\\"),[46] which refers to Arthur's valour and is suggestive of a father-son relationship for Arthur and Uther that pre-dates Geoffrey of Monmouth.\\r\\nOther early Welsh Arthurian texts include a poem found in the Black Book of Carmarthen, \\"Pa gur yv y porthaur?\\" (\\"What man is the gatekeeper?\\").[48] This takes the form of a dialogue between Arthur and the gatekeeper of a fortress he wishes to enter, in which Arthur recounts the names and deeds of himself and his men, notably Cei (Kay) and Bedwyr (Bedivere). The Welsh prose tale Culhwch and Olwen (c.?1100), included in the modern Mabinogion collection, has a much longer list of more than 200 of Arthur's men, though Cei and Bedwyr again take a central place. The story as a whole tells of Arthur helping his kinsman Culhwch win the hand of Olwen, daughter of Ysbaddaden Chief-Giant, by completing a series of apparently impossible tasks, including the hunt for the great semi-divine boar Twrch Trwyth. The 9th-century Historia Brittonum also refers to this tale, with the boar there named Troy(n)t.[49] Finally, Arthur is mentioned numerous times in the Welsh Triads, a collection of short summaries of Welsh tradition and legend which are classified into groups of three linked characters or episodes to assist recall. The later manuscripts of the Triads are partly derivative from Geoffrey of Monmouth and later continental traditions, but the earliest ones show no such influence and are usually agreed to refer to pre-existing Welsh traditions. Even in these, however, Arthur's court has started to embody legendary Britain as a whole, with \\"Arthur's Court\\" sometimes substituted for \\"The Island of Britain\\" in the formula \\"Three XXX of the Island of Britain\\".[50] While it is not clear from the Historia Brittonum and the Annales Cambriae that Arthur was even considered a king, by the time Culhwch and Olwen and the Triads were written he had become Penteyrnedd yr Ynys hon, \\"Chief of the Lords of this Island\\", the overlord of Wales, Cornwall and the North.[51]\\r\\nIn addition to these pre-Galfridian Welsh poems and tales, Arthur appears in some other early Latin texts besides the Historia Brittonum and the Annales Cambriae. In particular, Arthur features in a number of well-known vitae (\\"Lives\\") of post-Roman saints, none of which are now generally considered to be reliable historical sources (the earliest probably dates from the 11th century).[52] According to the Life of Saint Gildas, written in the early 12th century by Caradoc of Llancarfan, Arthur is said to have killed Gildas' brother Hueil and to have rescued his wife Gwenhwyfar from Glastonbury.[53] In the Life of Saint Cadoc, written around 1100 or a little before by Lifris of Llancarfan, the saint gives protection to a man who killed three of Arthur's soldiers, and Arthur demands a herd of cattle as wergeld for his men. Cadoc delivers them as demanded, but when Arthur takes possession of the animals, they turn into bundles of ferns.[54] Similar incidents are described in the medieval biographies of Carannog, Padarn, and Eufflam, probably written around the 12th century. A less obviously legendary account of Arthur appears in the Legenda Sancti Goeznovii, which is often claimed to date from the early 11th century (although the earliest manuscript of this text dates from the 15th century).[55] Also important are the references to Arthur in William of Malmesbury's De Gestis Regum Anglorum and Herman's De Miraculis Sanctae Mariae Laudensis, which together provide the first certain evidence for a belief that Arthur was not actually dead and would at some point return, a theme that is often revisited in post-Galfridian folklore.[56]\\r\\nThe first narrative account of Arthur's life is found in Geoffrey of Monmouth's Latin work Historia Regum Britanniae (History of the Kings of Britain), completed c.?1138.[57] This work is an imaginative and fanciful account of British kings from the legendary Trojan exile Brutus to the 7th-century Welsh king Cadwallader. Geoffrey places Arthur in the same post-Roman period as do Historia Brittonum and Annales Cambriae. He incorporates Arthur's father, Uther Pendragon, his magician advisor Merlin, and the story of Arthur's conception, in which Uther, disguised as his enemy Gorlois by Merlin's magic, sleeps with Gorlois's wife Igerna at Tintagel, and she conceives Arthur. On Uther's death, the fifteen-year-old Arthur succeeds him as King of Britain and fights a series of battles, similar to those in the Historia Brittonum, culminating in the Battle of Bath. He then defeats the Picts and Scots before creating an Arthurian empire through his conquests of Ireland, Iceland and the Orkney Islands. After twelve years of peace, Arthur sets out to expand his empire once more, taking control of Norway, Denmark and Gaul. Gaul is still held by the Roman Empire when it is conquered, and Arthur's victory naturally leads to a further confrontation between his empire and Rome's. Arthur and his warriors, including Kaius (Kay), Beduerus (Bedivere) and Gualguanus (Gawain), defeat the Roman emperor Lucius Tiberius in Gaul but, as he prepares to march on Rome, Arthur hears that his nephew Modredus (Mordred)whom he had left in charge of Britainhas married his wife Guenhuuara (Guinevere) and seized the throne. Arthur returns to Britain and defeats and kills Modredus on the river Camblam in Cornwall, but he is mortally wounded. He hands the crown to his kinsman Constantine and is taken to the isle of Avalon to be healed of his wounds, never to be seen again.[58]\\r\\nHow much of this narrative was Geoffrey's own invention is open to debate. Certainly, Geoffrey seems to have made use of the list of Arthur's twelve battles against the Saxons found in the 9th-century Historia Brittonum, along with the battle of Camlann from the Annales Cambriae and the idea that Arthur was still alive.[60] Arthur's personal status as the king of all Britain would also seem to be borrowed from pre-Galfridian tradition, being found in Culhwch and Olwen, the Triads, and the saints' lives.[61] Finally, Geoffrey borrowed many of the names for Arthur's possessions, close family, and companions from the pre-Galfridian Welsh tradition, including Kaius (Cei), Beduerus (Bedwyr), Guenhuuara (Gwenhwyfar), Uther (Uthyr) and perhaps also Caliburnus (Caledfwlch), the latter becoming Excalibur in subsequent Arthurian tales.[62] However, while names, key events, and titles may have been borrowed, Brynley Roberts has argued that \\"the Arthurian section is Geoffrey's literary creation and it owes nothing to prior narrative.\\"[63] So, for instance, the Welsh Medraut is made the villainous Modredus by Geoffrey, but there is no trace of such a negative character for this figure in Welsh sources until the 16th century.[64] There have been relatively few modern attempts to challenge this notion that the Historia Regum Britanniae is primarily Geoffrey's own work, with scholarly opinion often echoing William of Newburgh's late-12th-century comment that Geoffrey \\"made up\\" his narrative, perhaps through an \\"inordinate love of lying\\".[65] Geoffrey Ashe is one dissenter from this view, believing that Geoffrey's narrative is partially derived from a lost source telling of the deeds of a 5th-century British king named Riotamus, this figure being the original Arthur, although historians and Celticists have been reluctant to follow Ashe in his conclusions.[66]\\r\\nWhatever his sources may have been, the immense popularity of Geoffrey's Historia Regum Britanniae cannot be denied. Well over 200 manuscript copies of Geoffrey's Latin work are known to have survived, and this does not include translations into other languages.[67] Thus, for example, around 60 manuscripts are extant containing Welsh-language versions of the Historia, the earliest of which were created in the 13th century; the old notion that some of these Welsh versions actually underlie Geoffrey's Historia, advanced by antiquarians such as the 18th-century Lewis Morris, has long since been discounted in academic circles.[68] As a result of this popularity, Geoffrey's Historia Regum Britanniae was enormously influential on the later medieval development of the Arthurian legend. While it was by no means the only creative force behind Arthurian romance, many of its elements were borrowed and developed (e.g., Merlin and the final fate of Arthur), and it provided the historical framework into which the romancers' tales of magical and wonderful adventures were inserted.[69]\\r\\nThe popularity of Geoffrey's Historia and its other derivative works (such as Wace's Roman de Brut) is generally agreed to be an important factor in explaining the appearance of significant numbers of new Arthurian works in continental Europe during the 12th and 13th centuries, particularly in France.[70] It was not, however, the only Arthurian influence on the developing \\"Matter of Britain\\". There is clear evidence that Arthur and Arthurian tales were familiar on the Continent before Geoffrey's work became widely known (see for example, the Modena Archivolt),[71] and \\"Celtic\\" names and stories not found in Geoffrey's Historia appear in the Arthurian romances.[72] From the perspective of Arthur, perhaps the most significant effect of this great outpouring of new Arthurian story was on the role of the king himself: much of this 12th-century and later Arthurian literature centres less on Arthur himself than on characters such as Lancelot and Guinevere, Percival, Galahad, Gawain, Ywain, and Tristan and Iseult. Whereas Arthur is very much at the centre of the pre-Galfridian material and Geoffrey's Historia itself, in the romances he is rapidly sidelined.[73] His character also alters significantly. In both the earliest materials and Geoffrey he is a great and ferocious warrior, who laughs as he personally slaughters witches and giants and takes a leading role in all military campaigns,[74] whereas in the continental romances he becomes the roi fainant, the \\"do-nothing king\\", whose \\"inactivity and acquiescence constituted a central flaw in his otherwise ideal society\\".[75] Arthur's role in these works is frequently that of a wise, dignified, even-tempered, somewhat bland, and occasionally feeble monarch. So, he simply turns pale and silent when he learns of Lancelot's affair with Guinevere in the Mort Artu, whilst in Chrtien de Troyes's Yvain, the Knight of the Lion, he is unable to stay awake after a feast and has to retire for a nap.[76] Nonetheless, as Norris J. Lacy has observed, whatever his faults and frailties may be in these Arthurian romances, \\"his prestige is neveror almost nevercompromised by his personal weaknesses?... his authority and glory remain intact.\\"[77]\\r\\nArthur and his retinue appear in some of the Lais of Marie de France,[79] but it was the work of another French poet, Chrtien de Troyes, that had the greatest influence with regard to the development of Arthur's character and legend.[80] Chrtien wrote five Arthurian romances between c.?1170 and 1190. Erec and Enide and Cligs are tales of courtly love with Arthur's court as their backdrop, demonstrating the shift away from the heroic world of the Welsh and Galfridian Arthur, while Yvain, the Knight of the Lion, features Yvain and Gawain in a supernatural adventure, with Arthur very much on the sidelines and weakened. However, the most significant for the development of the Arthurian legend are Lancelot, the Knight of the Cart, which introduces Lancelot and his adulterous relationship with Arthur's queen (Guinevere), extending and popularising the recurring theme of Arthur as a cuckold, and Perceval, the Story of the Grail, which introduces the Holy Grail and the Fisher King and which again sees Arthur having a much reduced role.[81] Chrtien was thus \\"instrumental both in the elaboration of the Arthurian legend and in the establishment of the ideal form for the diffusion of that legend\\",[82] and much of what came after him in terms of the portrayal of Arthur and his world built upon the foundations he had laid. Perceval, although unfinished, was particularly popular: four separate continuations of the poem appeared over the next half century, with the notion of the Grail and its quest being developed by other writers such as Robert de Boron, a fact that helped accelerate the decline of Arthur in continental romance.[83] Similarly, Lancelot and his cuckolding of Arthur with Guinevere became one of the classic motifs of the Arthurian legend, although the Lancelot of the prose Lancelot (c.?1225) and later texts was a combination of Chrtien's character and that of Ulrich von Zatzikhoven's Lanzelet.[84] Chrtien's work even appears to feed back into Welsh Arthurian literature, with the result that the romance Arthur began to replace the heroic, active Arthur in Welsh literary tradition.[85] Particularly significant in this development were the three Welsh Arthurian romances, which are closely similar to those of Chrtien, albeit with some significant differences: Owain, or the Lady of the Fountain is related to Chrtien's Yvain; Geraint and Enid, to Erec and Enide; and Peredur son of Efrawg, to Perceval.[86]\\r\\nUp to c.?1210, continental Arthurian romance was expressed primarily through poetry; after this date the tales began to be told in prose. The most significant of these 13th-century prose romances was the Vulgate Cycle (also known as the Lancelot-Grail Cycle), a series of five Middle French prose works written in the first half of that century.[88] These works were the Estoire del Saint Grail, the Estoire de Merlin, the Lancelot propre (or Prose Lancelot, which made up half the entire Vulgate Cycle on its own), the Queste del Saint Graal and the Mort Artu, which combine to form the first coherent version of the entire Arthurian legend. The cycle continued the trend towards reducing the role played by Arthur in his own legend, partly through the introduction of the character of Galahad and an expansion of the role of Merlin. It also made Mordred the result of an incestuous relationship between Arthur and his sister and established the role of Camelot, first mentioned in passing in Chrtien's Lancelot, as Arthur's primary court.[89] This series of texts was quickly followed by the Post-Vulgate Cycle (c.?1230ÿ40), of which the Suite du Merlin is a part, which greatly reduced the importance of Lancelot's affair with Guinevere but continued to sideline Arthur, and to focus more on the Grail quest.[88] As such, Arthur became even more of a relatively minor character in these French prose romances; in the Vulgate itself he only figures significantly in the Estoire de Merlin and the Mort Artu. During this period, Arthur was made one of the Nine Worthies, a group of three pagan, three Jewish and three Christian exemplars of chivalry. The Worthies were first listed in Jacques de Longuyon's Voeux du Paon in 1312, and subsequently became a common subject in literature and art.[90]\\r\\nThe development of the medieval Arthurian cycle and the character of the \\"Arthur of romance\\" culminated in Le Morte d'Arthur, Thomas Malory's retelling of the entire legend in a single work in English in the late 15th century. Malory based his bookoriginally titled The Whole Book of King Arthur and of His Noble Knights of the Round Tableon the various previous romance versions, in particular the Vulgate Cycle, and appears to have aimed at creating a comprehensive and authoritative collection of Arthurian stories.[91] Perhaps as a result of this, and the fact that Le Morte D'Arthur was one of the earliest printed books in England, published by William Caxton in 1485, most later Arthurian works are derivative of Malory's.[92]\\r\\nThe end of the Middle Ages brought with it a waning of interest in King Arthur. Although Malory's English version of the great French romances was popular, there were increasing attacks upon the truthfulness of the historical framework of the Arthurian romances ÿ established since Geoffrey of Monmouth's time ÿ and thus the legitimacy of the whole Matter of Britain. So, for example, the 16th-century humanist scholar Polydore Vergil famously rejected the claim that Arthur was the ruler of a post-Roman empire, found throughout the post-Galfridian medieval \\"chronicle tradition\\", to the horror of Welsh and English antiquarians.[93] Social changes associated with the end of the medieval period and the Renaissance also conspired to rob the character of Arthur and his associated legend of some of their power to enthrall audiences, with the result that 1634 saw the last printing of Malory's Le Morte d'Arthur for nearly 200 years.[94] King Arthur and the Arthurian legend were not entirely abandoned, but until the early 19th century the material was taken less seriously and was often used simply as a vehicle for allegories of 17th- and 18th-century politics.[95] Thus Richard Blackmore's epics Prince Arthur (1695) and King Arthur (1697) feature Arthur as an allegory for the struggles of William III against James II.[95] Similarly, the most popular Arthurian tale throughout this period seems to have been that of Tom Thumb, which was told first through chapbooks and later through the political plays of Henry Fielding; although the action is clearly set in Arthurian Britain, the treatment is humorous and Arthur appears as a primarily comedic version of his romance character.[96]\\r\\nJohn Dryden's masque King Arthur is still performed, largely thanks to Henry Purcell's music, though seldom unabridged.\\r\\nIn the early 19th century, medievalism, Romanticism, and the Gothic Revival reawakened interest in Arthur and the medieval romances. A new code of ethics for 19th-century gentlemen was shaped around the chivalric ideals embodied in the \\"Arthur of romance\\". This renewed interest first made itself felt in 1816, when Malory's Le Morte d'Arthur was reprinted for the first time since 1634.[98] Initially, the medieval Arthurian legends were of particular interest to poets, inspiring, for example, William Wordsworth to write \\"The Egyptian Maid\\" (1835), an allegory of the Holy Grail.[99] Pre-eminent among these was Alfred Tennyson, whose first Arthurian poem \\"The Lady of Shalott\\" was published in 1832.[100] Arthur himself played a minor role in some of these works, following in the medieval romance tradition. Tennyson's Arthurian work reached its peak of popularity with Idylls of the King, however, which reworked the entire narrative of Arthur's life for the Victorian era. It was first published in 1859 and sold 10,000 copies within the first week.[101] In the Idylls, Arthur became a symbol of ideal manhood who ultimately failed, through human weakness, to establish a perfect kingdom on earth.[102] Tennyson's works prompted a large number of imitators, generated considerable public interest in the legends of Arthur and the character himself, and brought Malory's tales to a wider audience.[103] Indeed, the first modernisation of Malory's great compilation of Arthur's tales was published in 1862, shortly after Idylls appeared, and there were six further editions and five competitors before the century ended.[104]\\r\\nThis interest in the 'Arthur of romance' and his associated stories continued through the 19th century and into the 20th, and influenced poets such as William Morris and Pre-Raphaelite artists including Edward Burne-Jones.[105] Even the humorous tale of Tom Thumb, which had been the primary manifestation of Arthur's legend in the 18th century, was rewritten after the publication of Idylls. While Tom maintained his small stature and remained a figure of comic relief, his story now included more elements from the medieval Arthurian romances and Arthur is treated more seriously and historically in these new versions.[106] The revived Arthurian romance also proved influential in the United States, with such books as Sidney Lanier's The Boy's King Arthur (1880) reaching wide audiences and providing inspiration for Mark Twain's satiric A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court (1889).[107] Although the 'Arthur of romance' was sometimes central to these new Arthurian works (as he was in Burne-Jones's \\"The Sleep of Arthur in Avalon\\", 1881-1898), on other occasions he reverted to his medieval status and is either marginalized or even missing entirely, with Wagner's Arthurian operas providing a notable instance of the latter.[108] Furthermore, the revival of interest in Arthur and the Arthurian tales did not continue unabated. By the end of the 19th century, it was confined mainly to Pre-Raphaelite imitators,[109] and it could not avoid being affected by World War I, which damaged the reputation of chivalry and thus interest in its medieval manifestations and Arthur as chivalric role model.[110] The romance tradition did, however, remain sufficiently powerful to persuade Thomas Hardy, Laurence Binyon and John Masefield to compose Arthurian plays,[111] and T. S. Eliot alludes to the Arthur myth (but not Arthur) in his poem The Waste Land, which mentions the Fisher King.[112]\\r\\nIn the latter half of the 20th century, the influence of the romance tradition of Arthur continued, through novels such as T. H. White's The Once and Future King (1958) and Marion Zimmer Bradley's The Mists of Avalon (1982) in addition to comic strips such as Prince Valiant (from 1937 onward).[114] Tennyson had reworked the romance tales of Arthur to suit and comment upon the issues of his day, and the same is often the case with modern treatments too. Bradley's tale, for example, takes a feminist approach to Arthur and his legend, in contrast to the narratives of Arthur found in medieval materials,[115] and American authors often rework the story of Arthur to be more consistent with values such as equality and democracy.[116] The romance Arthur has become popular in film and theatre as well. T. H. White's novel was adapted into the Lerner and Loewe stage musical Camelot (1960) and the Disney animated film The Sword in the Stone (1963); Camelot, with its focus on the love of Lancelot and Guinevere and the cuckolding of Arthur, was itself made into a film of the same name in 1967. The romance tradition of Arthur is particularly evident and, according to critics, successfully handled in Robert Bresson's Lancelot du Lac (1974), Eric Rohmer's Perceval le Gallois (1978) and perhaps John Boorman's fantasy film Excalibur (1981); it is also the main source of the material used in the Arthurian spoof Monty Python and the Holy Grail (1975).[117]\\r\\nRe-tellings and re-imaginings of the romance tradition are not the only important aspect of the modern legend of King Arthur. Attempts to portray Arthur as a genuine historical figure of c.?500, stripping away the \\"romance\\", have also emerged. As Taylor and Brewer have noted, this return to the medieval \\"chronicle tradition\\"' of Geoffrey of Monmouth and the Historia Brittonum is a recent trend which became dominant in Arthurian literature in the years following the outbreak of the Second World War, when Arthur's legendary resistance to Germanic invaders struck a chord in Britain.[118] Clemence Dane's series of radio plays, The Saviours (1942), used a historical Arthur to embody the spirit of heroic resistance against desperate odds, and Robert Sherriff's play The Long Sunset (1955) saw Arthur rallying Romano-British resistance against the Germanic invaders.[119] This trend towards placing Arthur in a historical setting is also apparent in historical and fantasy novels published during this period.[120] In recent years the portrayal of Arthur as a real hero of the 5th century has also made its way into film versions of the Arthurian legend, most notably the TV series' Arthur of the Britons (1972ÿ73), Merlin (2008-12), The Legend of King Arthur (1979), and Camelot (2011) [121] and the feature films King Arthur (2004), The Last Legion (2007) and King Arthur: Legend of the Sword (2017).[122]\\r\\nArthur has also been used as a model for modern-day behaviour. In the 1930s, the Order of the Fellowship of the Knights of the Round Table was formed in Britain to promote Christian ideals and Arthurian notions of medieval chivalry.[123] In the United States, hundreds of thousands of boys and girls joined Arthurian youth groups, such as the Knights of King Arthur, in which Arthur and his legends were promoted as wholesome exemplars.[124] However, Arthur's diffusion within contemporary culture goes beyond such obviously Arthurian endeavours, with Arthurian names being regularly attached to objects, buildings, and places. As Norris J. Lacy has observed, \\"The popular notion of Arthur appears to be limited, not surprisingly, to a few motifs and names, but there can be no doubt of the extent to which a legend born many centuries ago is profoundly embedded in modern culture at every level.\\"[125]","input":"How old is the story of king arthur?"},{"output":"The Havasupai people","context":"The Havasupai people (Havasupai: Havsuw Baaja) are an American Indian tribe who have lived in the Grand Canyon for at least the past 800 years.[1] Havasu means blue-green water and pai people.[2]\\r\\nLocated primarily in an area known as Havasu Canyon,[3] this Yuman-speaking population once laid claim to an area the size of Delaware (1.6?million acres [650,000?ha]).[4] In 1882, however, the tribe was forced by the federal government to abandon all but 518 acres (210?ha) of its land. A silver rush and the Santa Fe Railroad in effect destroyed the fertile land. Furthermore, the inception of the Grand Canyon as a national park in 1919 pushed the Havasupai to the brink, as their land was consistently being used by the National Park Service. Throughout the 20th century, the tribe used the US judicial system to fight for the restoration of the land. In 1975, the tribe succeeded in regaining approximately 185,000 acres (75,000?ha) of their ancestral land with the passage of the Grand Canyon National Park Enlargement Act.[5]\\r\\nAs a means of survival, the tribe has turned to tourism, attracting thousands of people annually to its streams and waterfalls at the Havasupai Indian Reservation.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nEthnically, the Havasupai and the Hualapai are one people, although today, they are politically separate groups as the result of U.S. government policy. The Hualapai (Pa'a or Pai) had three subtribes: the Plateau People, Middle Mountain People and Yavapai Fighter. The subtribes were divided into seven bands, which themselves were broken up into thirteen regional bands or local groups.[6] The local groups were composed of several extended family groups, living in small villages:[7] The Havasupai were just the Havasooa Pa'a regional band (or local group) of the Nyav-kapai (Eastern People) of the Plateau People subtribe.[8]\\r\\nThe tribe had traditionally relied heavily on agriculture, hunting and gathering as their means of survival. Although living primarily above and inside the Grand Canyon, which consists mostly of harsh terrain, the tribes reservation was also home to some lush vegetation and aquamarine blue water of Havasu Creek. Their name, meaning \\"the People of the Blue-Green Waters\\" reflects this.\\r\\nThe Havasupai are said to have existed within and around the Grand Canyon for over eight centuries. Little is known about the tribe prior to their first recorded European encounter in 1776 with Spanish priest Francisco Garces.[9] Garces reported seeing roughly 320 individuals in his time with the Havasupai, a number that would diminish over the centuries as westward expansion and natural catastrophes significantly decreased the population size,[10] before rising to approximately 650 in the current era.\\r\\nIn the first half of the 19th century, with exception to the introduction of horses by the Spanish, U.S. westward expansion affected the Havasupai less than it did other indigenous populations of the west. Even as interaction with settlers slowly increased, day-to-day life did not change much for the tribe until silver was discovered in 1870 by Cataract Creek.[11] The migration of prospectors to the area was unwelcome. The Havasupai sought protection from the intrusion of western pioneers on their land and sought out assistance, but to little avail. An executive order by President Rutherford Hayes in 1880 established a small federally protected reservation for the tribe, yet it did not include the mining areas along the Creek (Hirst, 1985).\\r\\nDuring this era, Havasupai relations with other Native American tribes were generally mixed. Bonds and interactions with the Hopi tribe, whose reservation was in close proximity, were strong, as the two peoples did a great deal of trading with each other.[4] The Hopi introduced crops such as the gourd and sunflower that would eventually become a staple of the Havasupai diet. Still, the Havasupai were not without enemies as they were consistently at odds with the Yavapai and the Southern Paiute, who would steal and destroy crops planted by the Havasupai.[4]\\r\\nIn 1882 President Chester A. Arthur issued an executive order that all land on the plateau of the canyon, which was traditionally used for winter homes for the tribe, was to become public property of the United States.[11] The order in effect relegated the Havasupai to a 518-acre (2.10?km2) plot of land in Cataract Canyon, taking almost all of their aboriginal land for American public use. According to reports, the Havasupai were completely unaware of the act for several years.[12]\\r\\nThe loss of almost all of their land was not the only issue that the Havasupai were contending with: the increase in the number of settlers in the local region had depleted game used for hunting, and soil erosion (a result of poor irrigation techniques) touched off a series of food shortages.[12] Furthermore, interaction with the settlers sparked deadly disease outbreaks amongst tribe members, who were ravaged by smallpox, influenza, and measles.[12] By 1906 only 166 tribal members remained?ÿ half the number Garces saw when he first came across the tribe in 1776.[10]\\r\\nIn the 1800s the continental railway system was greatly expanded. In 1897 construction opened on a spur line of the Santa Fe Railroad, which was to lead directly to the Grand Canyon;[12] by 1901 the line was open. During his visit to the Grand Canyon in 1903, President Theodore Roosevelt met two Havasupais at Indian Garden. Roosevelt told them about the park that was being created, and that they would have to leave the area.[12] In 1908 the Grand Canyon was declared a national monument, and by 1919 it had received National Park status. However, it was not until 1928 that the Havasupai finally left Indian Garden, forced out by the National Park Service.[9]\\r\\nIssues regarding health within the Havasupai population reduced its growth to the point where almost an entire generation was lost due to infant and child mortality. Low morale spread throughout the tribe, leading to an increase in gambling, alcoholism, and violence. As the years progressed the Havasupai came to realize that they could not hope to survive in their American social situation without embracing at least some aspects of it. Breaking horses, working on farms, or even serving as employees of the Grand Canyon National Park were all options for tribal members.[11] The Havasupai fought to keep their methods and traditions alive, but the federal government and the National Park Service generally held a dismissive attitude toward these efforts and accelerated the pace of actions such as razing residents' traditional homes and replacing them with cabins.[12] As similar instances transpired throughout the years, the methods of the Park became clear: they wanted the final 518 acres (2.10?km2).[citation needed]\\r\\nIn this period the tribe continually fought with the government to have the land that had been taken returned to them. In 1968 the tribe won their Indian Claim Commission case against the United States.[13] The court findings stated that the Havasupai had portions of their land taken from them illegally in 1882 and that the tribe was entitled to recover the land from the US at fair market value (ICC 210). That value ended up being 55 cents an acre, totaling just over one million dollars. Although the case was a landmark for the Havasupai in the sense that it was proven in a court of law that the federal government had inappropriately taken their land, it had still not been properly returned to the tribe.[12]\\r\\nHowever, the momentum that the Havasupai gained from the ICC case followed them into the 1970s as the tribe continued to fight to have their traditional territory returned to them. In 1974, garnering support from the Nixon administration as well as influential newspapers such as the Los Angeles Times, the Wall Street Journal, and the San Francisco Chronicle, the tribe made their push to have the congressional bill S. 1296, which would actually return their land, passed through Congress.[12] Months of deliberation and stalling on the part of some congressmen[citation needed] almost led to the demise of the bill, but days before Congress went on fall break the bill was finally passed by both Houses and made its way to the Presidents desk. Similarly, the bill sat on President Gerald Fords desk until the final possible moments before it was signed and passed into law on January 4, 1975.[12] S. 1296 granted the Havasupai a trust title to approximately 185,000 acres (750?km2); another 95,300 acres (386?km2) were designated as \\"Havasupai Use Lands,\\" to be overseen by the National Park Service, but available for traditional use by the Havasupai.[5]\\r\\nMining interests also had a presence in the canyon in this period. Tunnels are a familiar sight in the campground area with the deepest of them around 300 feet (91?m). The largest of the mines is in Carbonate Canyon, adjacent to Havasu Falls, where rails and timbers still can be found descending three levels. Lead was mined here for the last time during WWII. Ranger Gale Burak, who worked at the Grand Canyon for several years, spoke of her experiences as a cook for the Havasu Lead and Zinc Company hard rock mining camp,[14] where the campground now resides. Below Mooney Falls, the famous pipe \\"ladder\\" ascended to a vanadium deposit.\\r\\nFollowing the return of a large share of their land, the Havasupai as a tribe have once again begun to flourish. Although many of the day-to-day customs that existed prior to 1882 are not well established today, the Havasupai have continued to respect and preserve the traditions of their ancestors. As of today the tribe consists of about 650 members, and around 200 others claim Havasupai heritage.\\r\\nPresently, the tribe has begun to take advantage of the beauty of its land by turning it into a tourist destination for visitors to the Grand Canyon. Tribal members often work as packers and/or workers for tourist ventures, or work at the lodge, tourist offices, the caf, etc.\\r\\nIn 2003, protests ensued when it was found that Arizona State University had used blood samples consensually acquired from the Havasupai people for different purposes than originally stated: This included research with regard to the tribe's ancestors' geographical origins - which contradicts traditional Havasupai beliefs - and levels of inbreeding, which was deemed to be \\"offensive\\".[15]\\r\\nASU incurred legal fees of 1,700,000 US$ and eventually agreed to pay the Havasupai 700,000 US$.[15] It has since been claimed that scientific study of Native Northern American genomes has been hampered due to scientists' fears of getting caught up in a similar legal predicament.[16] In the cause of the controversy, a dissertation was partially redacted before publication, as one chapter had directly cited results gained from the Havasupai samples.[15]\\r\\nPrior to modern times agriculture was the essential means of progress and survival for the Havasupai. While in the winter the tribe members stationed themselves on the plateau of the canyon, in the summer irrigation gardening of the crop fields brought the members back inside the canyon walls.[10] As vast and uneven as the Grand Canyon is, it is somewhat of an anomaly that the Havasupai were able to agriculturally sustain and thrive in such a voluminous landscape. Because of a lack of available soil rich in nutrients, it has been suggested that the tribe cultivated only 200 acres (0.81?km2) of land on the canyon floor.[4] Although lacking space, the tribes irrigation technology was far more advanced than others in the Southwest which allowed them to be agriculturally intensive. However, being located at the bottom of a canyon left the fields vulnerable to flooding as a result of rain and the overflowing of Cataract Creek, as was the case in 1911 when almost an entire crop field was destroyed.[11] In 1920 to combat the issue the federal government assisted the tribe in constructing a new irrigation system which was generally effective in ceasing soil erosion from water overflows.[4]\\r\\nHistorically the main crops for the Havasupai were corn, beans, squash, sunflowers, gourds, and some cotton. Corn, the tribes main crop, was generally harvested in the later summer months. While growing, a farming technique called cepukaka was used to protect the corn from being blown over when it got to a certain height. In this technique, a farmer loosened the soil around the corn and then pulled it into a hill around the stalk base.[4] Along with their traditional crops, the Havasupai were introduced to melons, watermelons, and orchard trees with the arrival of the Spanish. By the 1940s these crops had become staples of the Havasupai diet.[4]\\r\\nThe bow and arrow were of primary importance to a Havasupai hunter. Built from an unidentifiable tree, an entire process of crafting, bending, and designing went into the construction of these hunting tools.[4] With westward expansion, however, came the introduction of the rifle; as years went by, the gun became the primary hunting device for men. The word for \\"arrow\\" began to stand in for \\"bullet\\" as well (Whiting, 1985).\\r\\nThroughout the years, sheep and deer were the dominant game for the Havasupai, but small game including rabbits and squirrels were also used as food.[4] Historically, the Havasupai hunted in large groups, and the distribution of game amongst the hunters was generally fair. In the twentieth century, however, due to overhunting and neighboring development, the populations of large game animals such as sheep became sparse. As a result, the Havasupai were forced to alter their hunting habits to adjust to the expansionists, which in turn made tribesmen less likely to share with others.[4]\\r\\nThe gathering of wild plants and seeds were typically done by Havasupai women. Two primary methods were used: 1) Knocking seeds from plants directly, and 2) The heads of plants were gathered before the seeds were ready to fall.[4] It was desirable for the women to locate lighter foods which could easily be moved to the plateau in winter. Additionally, dry foods that could be stored for extended periods of time to prevent spoilage were preferable.[4] Walnuts, wild candytuft, and barrel cacti were only a few of the many plants and seeds gathered by the women throughout the spring and summer months.[4]\\r\\nA seven-member tribal council, which handles most policy matters, is elected once every two years. It is led by a chairman who is elected from among the members of the council. The Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) is the entity charged with law enforcement and protection for the Tribe, while the Indian Health Service clinic provides health care and emergency services.\\r\\nHavasupai is a dialect of the Upland Yuman language spoken by about 450 people on the Havasupai Indian Reservation in and around the Grand Canyon. It is the only Native American language in the United States spoken by 100% of its indigenous population. The Havasupai variety is nearly identical to the variety of the Hualapai, although the two groups are socially and politically distinct (Kendall 1983:5) and employ different orthographies. The speakers of Havasupai and Hualapai consider their languages separate. It is a little more distantly related to the Yavapai language. Grammatical descriptions, vocabularies, and texts documenting Havasupai have been published (Mithun 1999:578).\\r\\nSupai (Havasupai: Havasuuw) is the Havasupai city at 361413N 1124121W? / ?36.23694N 112.68917W? / 36.23694; -112.68917 at the bottom of the Grand Canyon. The town is the capital of the Havasupai Indian Reservation, at 360940N 1123648W? / ?36.16111N 112.61333W? / 36.16111; -112.61333 in Coconino County. It is home to around 500 of the tribe members and is one of the most remote cities in the contiguous United States, as it can only be accessed by taking old U.S. Route 66 and traveling about 60 miles (97?km) along BIA Road 18 to the trailhead. The city can be reached from the trailhead via an 8-mile (13?km) hike. An alternative to the hike is a helicopter ride or a horse ride. The town has 136 houses, a caf, a general store, a tourist office, a lodge, a post office, a school, an LDS chapel, and a small Christian Church, among other buildings.\\r\\nTourism is the main source of revenue for the Havasupai tribe. The town receives more than 20,000 visitors per year.[17] The Tribe charges for entering its land, and visitors are required to reserve either a room at their lodge, or space at the campground.\\r\\nThe trailhead is at Hualapai Hilltop, Arizona (located at the end of BIA Road 18), where there is a large parking lot, a helipad and portable toilets. The trail can be traveled by foot or horseback. Alternatively, transportation by helicopter is periodically available. Mule service can also be purchased for luggage/packs only. The trail to Supai is approximately 8 miles (13?km) long, and descends approximately 2,000 feet (610?m). The campground is an additional 2 miles (3.2?km), with another drop of about 350 feet (110?m).\\r\\nHavasu Creek runs through Supai. The creek has several waterfalls, including Havasu Falls.\\r\\nTwo Havasupai Indian children, the daughters of Chickapanagie's, enjoying a melon, ca. 1900.

Topographically, it is dominated by the Indian Plate, which rises above sea level as Nepal and northern parts of India situated south of the Himalayas and the Hindu Kush. South Asia is bounded on the south by the Indian Ocean and on land (clockwise, from west) by West Asia, Central Asia, East Asia, and Southeast Asia.\\r\\nThe current territories of Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Maldives, Nepal, India, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka form South Asia.[7] The South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) is an economic cooperation organisation in the region which was established in 1985 and includes all eight nations comprising South Asia.[8]\\r\\nSouth Asia covers about 5.1 million km2 (1.9 million mi2), which is 11.51% of the Asian continent or 3.4% of the world's land surface area.[7] The population of South Asia is about 1.749 billion or about one fourth of the world's population, making it both the most populous and the most densely populated geographical region in the world.[3] Overall, it accounts for about 39.49% of Asia's population, over 24% of the world's population, and is home to a vast array of peoples.[9][10][11]\\r\\nIn 2010, South Asia had the world's largest population of Hindus, Jains and Sikhs. There are about 600 million Muslims[12][13][14][15][16] as well as over 35 million Christians and 25 million Buddhists in South Asia.[17]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe total area of South Asia and its geographical extent is not clear cut as systemic and foreign policy orientations of its constituents are quite asymmetrical.[19] Aside from the central region of South Asia, formerly part of the British Empire, there is a high degree of variation as to which other countries are included in South Asia.[20][21][22][23]\\r\\nModern definitions of South Asia are consistent in including Afghanistan, India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Nepal, Bhutan and Maldives as the constituent countries.[24][25][26][27][28][29] Myanmar is included by some scholars in South Asia, but in Southeast Asia by others.[21][30] Some do not include Afghanistan,[21] others question whether Afghanistan should be considered a part of South Asia or the Middle East.[31][32]\\r\\nThe current territories of Bangladesh, India, and Pakistan, which were the core of the British Empire prior to 1947, form the central region of South Asia, in addition to Afghanistan,[24][25][26][27][28][29] which was a British protectorate until 1919, after the Afghans lost to the British in the Second Anglo-Afghan war. The mountain countries of Nepal and Bhutan, and the island countries of Sri Lanka and Maldives are generally included as well. Myanmar (formerly Burma) is often added, and by various deviating definitions based on often substantially different reasons, the British Indian Ocean Territory and the Tibet Autonomous Region are included as well.[19][33][34][35][36][37][38][39][40]\\r\\nThe common concept of South Asia is largely inherited from the administrative boundaries of the British Raj,[41] with several exceptions. The Aden Colony, British Somaliland and Singapore, though administered at various times under the Raj, have not been proposed as any part of South Asia.[42] Additionally Burma was administered as part of the Raj until 1937, but is now considered a part of Southeast Asia and is a member state of ASEAN. The 562 princely states that were protected by but not directly ruled by the Raj became administrative parts of South Asia upon joining Union of India or Dominion of Pakistan.[43][44][45] Geopolitically, it had formed the whole territory of Greater India,[30][46]\\r\\nThe South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC), a contiguous block of countries, started in 1985 with seven countries?ÿ Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, the Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka?ÿ and added Afghanistan as an eighth member in 2007.[47][48] China and Myanmar have also applied for the status of full members of SAARC.[49][50] This bloc of countries include two independent countries that were not part of the British Raj ÿ Nepal, and Bhutan. Afghanistan was a British protectorate from 1878 until 1919, after the Afghans lost to the British in the Second Anglo-Afghan war. The World Factbook, based on geo-politics, people, and economy defines South Asia as comprising Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, British Indian Ocean Territory, India, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka.[51] The South Asia Free Trade Agreement incorporated Afghanistan in 2011, and the World Bank grouping of countries in the region also includes all eight members comprising South Asia and SAARC as well,[52][53] and the same goes for the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF).[54][55]\\r\\nThe Centres for South Asian Studies at both the University of Michigan and the University of Virginia include Tibet along with the eight members of SAARC in their research programs, but exclude the Maldives.[62][63] The South Asian Studies Program of Rutgers University and the University of California, Berkeley Centre for South Asia Studies also include the Maldives.[64][65]\\r\\nThe South Asian Studies Program of Brandeis University defines the region as comprising \\"India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Nepal, Bhutan, and in certain contexts Afghanistan, Burma, Maldives and Tibet\\".[66] The similar program of Columbia University includes Afghanistan, Bangladesh, India, the Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka in their study and excludes Burma.[67]\\r\\nThe United Nations Statistics Division's scheme of sub-regions include all eight members of the SAARC as part of Southern Asia, along with Iran[68] only for statistical purposes.[69] Population Information Network (POPIN) includes Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Burma, India, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka as part of South Asia. Maldives, in view of its characteristics, was admitted as a member Pacific POPIN subregional network only in principle.[70] The HirschmanÿHerfindahl index of the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific for the region includes only the original seven signatories of SAARC.[71]\\r\\nThe British Indian Ocean Territory is connected to the region by a publication of Jane's for security considerations.[72] The region may also include the disputed territory of Aksai Chin, which was part of the British Indian princely state of Jammu and Kashmir, but is now administered as part of the Chinese autonomous region of Xinjiang.[73]\\r\\nThe inclusion of Myanmar in South Asia is without consensus, with many considering it a part of Southeast Asia and others including it within South Asia.[21][30] Afghanistan was of importance to the British colonial empire, especially after the Second Anglo-Afghan War over 1878ÿ1880. Afghanistan remained a British protectorate until 1919, when a treaty with Vladimir Lenin included the granting of independence to Afghanistan. Following India's partition, Afghanistan has generally been included in South Asia, with some considering it a part of Southwest Asia.[19] During the Soviet war in Afghanistan (1979ÿ1989) American foreign policy considered Pakistan and Afghanistan in Southwest Asia, while others included it as a part of South Asia.[7] There is no universal agreement among scholars on which countries should be included within South Asia.[21]\\r\\nIn the past, a lack of a coherent definition for South Asia resulted in not only a lack of academic studies, but also in a lack interest for such studies.[74] The confusion existed also because of the lack of a clear boundary ÿ geographically, geopolitical, socio-culturally, economically or historically ÿ between South Asia and other parts of Asia, especially the Middle East and Southeast Asia.[75] Identification with a South Asian identity was also found to be significantly low among respondents in an older two-year survey across Bangladesh, India, Nepal, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka.[76] However, modern definitions of South Asia are very consistent in including Afghanistan, India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Nepal, Bhutan and Maldives as the constituent countries.[24][25][26][27][28][29]\\r\\nAccording to the Oxford English Dictionary, the term \\"subcontinent\\" signifies a \\"subdivision of a continent which has a distinct geographical, political, or cultural identity\\" and also a \\"large land mass somewhat smaller than a continent\\".[77][78] Historians Catherine Asher and Cynthia Talbot state that the term \\"Indian subcontinent\\" describes a natural physical landmass in South Asia that has been relatively isolated from the rest of Eurasia.[79] The Indian subcontinent is also a geological term referring to the land mass that drifted northeastwards from ancient Gondwana, colliding with the Eurasian plate nearly 55 million years ago, towards the end of Palaeocene. This geological region largely includes Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka.[80]\\r\\nThe use of the term Indian subcontinent began in the British Empire, and has been a term particularly common in its successors.[81] This region has also been labelled as \\"India\\" (in its classical and pre-modern sense), \\"Greater India\\", or as South Asia.[30][46]\\r\\nAccording to anthropologist John R. Lukacs, \\"the Indian Subcontinent occupies the major landmass of South Asia\\",[82] while the political science professor Tatu Vanhanen states, \\"the seven countries of South Asia constitute geographically a compact region around the Indian Subcontinent\\".[83] According to Chris Brewster, India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Nepal and Bhutan constitute the Indian subcontinent; with Afghanistan and Maldives included it is more commonly referred to as South Asia.[84] The geopolitical boundaries of Indian subcontinent, according to Dhavendra Kumar, include \\"India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Nepal, Bhutan and other small islands of the Indian Ocean\\".[85] Maldives, the country consisting of a small archipelago southwest of the peninsula, is considered part of the Indian subcontinent.[86]\\r\\nThe terms \\"Indian subcontinent\\" and \\"South Asia\\" are sometimes used interchangeably.[33][81] The South Asia term is particularly common when scholars or officials seek to differentiate this region from East Asia.[87] According to historians Sugata Bose and Ayesha Jalal, the Indian subcontinent has come to be known as South Asia \\"in more recent and neutral parlance.\\"[88] This \\"neutral\\" notion refers to the concerns of Pakistan and Bangladesh, particularly given the recurring conflicts between India and Pakistan, wherein the dominant placement of \\"India\\" as a prefix before the subcontinent might offend some political sentiments.[30]\\r\\nThere is no globally accepted definition on which countries are a part of South Asia or Indian subcontinent.[21][22][23] While Afghanistan is not considered as a part of the Indian subcontinent, Afghanistan is often included in South Asia.[23] Similarly, Myanmar is included by some scholars in South Asia but not in Indian subcontinent.[30]\\r\\nAccording to Saul Cohen, early colonial era strategists treated South Asia with East Asia, but in reality the South Asia region excluding Afghanistan is a distinct geopolitical region separated from other nearby geostrategic realms, one that is geographically diverse.[89] The region is home to a variety of geographical features, such as glaciers, rainforests, valleys, deserts, and grasslands that are typical of much larger continents. It is surrounded by three water bodies?ÿ the Bay of Bengal, the Indian Ocean and the Arabian Sea?ÿ and has acutely varied climate zones. The tip of the Indian Peninsula had the highest quality pearls.[90]\\r\\nThe boundaries of South Asia vary based on how the region is defined. South Asia's northern, eastern, and western boundaries vary based on definitions used, while the Indian Ocean is the southern periphery. Most of this region rests on the Indian Plate and is isolated from the rest of Asia by mountain barriers.[91][92] Much of the region consists of a peninsula in south-central Asia, rather resembling a diamond which is delineated by the Himalayas on the north, the Hindu Kush in the west, and the Arakanese in the east,[93] and which extends southward into the Indian Ocean with the Arabian Sea to the southwest and the Bay of Bengal to the southeast.[33][35]\\r\\nAccording to Robert M. Cutler ÿ a scholar of Political Science at Carleton University,[94] the terms South Asia, Southwest Asia and Central Asia are distinct, but the confusion and disagreements have arisen because of geopolitical movement to enlarge these regions into Greater South Asia, Greater Southwest Asia and Greater Central Asia. The frontier of Greater South Asia, states Cutler, between 2001ÿ2006 has been geopolitically extended to eastern Iran and western Afghanistan in the west, and in the north to northeastern Iran, northern Afghanistan, and southern Uzbekistan.[94]\\r\\nMost of this region is a subcontinent resting on the Indian Plate, the northerly portion of the Indo-Australian Plate, separated from the rest of the Eurasian Plate. The Indian Plate includes most of South Asia, forming a land mass which extends from the Himalayas into a portion of the basin under the Indian Ocean, including parts of South China and Eastern Indonesia, as well as Kunlun and Karakoram ranges,[95][96][97][page?needed] and extending up to but not including Ladakh, Kohistan, the Hindu Kush range and Balochistan.[98][99][100] It may be noted that geophysically the Yarlung Tsangpo River in Tibet is situated at the outside of the border of the Subcontinental structure, while the Pamir Mountains in Tajikistan are situated inside that border.[101]\\r\\nIt was once a small continent before colliding with the Eurasian Plate about 50ÿ55 million years ago and giving birth to the Himalayan range and the Tibetan plateau. It is the peninsular region south of the Himalayas and Kuen Lun mountain ranges and east of the Indus River and the Iranian Plateau, extending southward into the Indian Ocean between the Arabian Sea (to the southwest) and the Bay of Bengal (to the southeast).\\r\\nThe climate of this vast region varies considerably from area to area from tropical monsoon in the south to temperate in the north. The variety is influenced by not only the altitude, but also by factors such as proximity to the sea coast and the seasonal impact of the monsoons. Southern parts are mostly hot in summers and receive rain during monsoon periods. The northern belt of Indo-Gangetic plains also is hot in summer, but cooler in winter. The mountainous north is colder and receives snowfall at higher altitudes of Himalayan ranges.\\r\\nAs the Himalayas block the north-Asian bitter cold winds, the temperatures are considerably moderate in the plains down below. For most part, the climate of the region is called the Monsoon climate, which keeps the region humid during summer and dry during winter, and favours the cultivation of jute, tea, rice, and various vegetables in this region.\\r\\nSouth Asia is largely divided into four broad climate zones:[103]\\r\\nMaximum relative humidity of over 80% has been recorded in Khasi and Jaintia Hills and Sri Lanka, while the area adjustment to Pakistan and western India records lower than 20%ÿ30%.[103] Climate of South Asia is largely characterized by monsoons. South Asia depends critically on monsoon rainfall.[104] Two monsoon systems exist in the region:[105]\\r\\nThe warmest period of the year precedes the monsoon season (March to mid June). In the summer the low pressures are centered over the Indus-Gangetic Plain and high wind from the Indian Ocean blows towards the center. The monsoons are second coolest season of the year because of high humidity and cloud covering. But, at the beginning of June the jetstreams vanish above the Tibetan Plateau, low pressure over the Indus Valley deepens and the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) moves in. The change is violent. Moderately vigorous monsoon depressions form in the Bay of Bengal and make landfall from June to September.[103]\\r\\n(2017)[114]\\r\\n(2016)[115]\\r\\nThe history of core South Asia begins with evidence of human activity of Homo sapiens, as long as 75,000 years ago, or with earlier hominids including Homo erectus from about 500,000 years ago.[116] The Indus Valley Civilization, which spread and flourished in the northwestern part of South Asia from c. 3300 to 1300 BCE in present-day Northern India, Pakistan and Afghanistan, was the first major civilization in South Asia.[117] A sophisticated and technologically advanced urban culture developed in the Mature Harappan period, from 2600 to 1900 BCE.[118]\\r\\nThe earliest prehistoric culture have roots in the mesolithic sites as evidenced by the rock paintings of Bhimbetka rock shelters dating to a period of 30,000 BCE or older,[note 2] as well as neolithic times.[note 3] According to anthropologist Possehl, the Indus Valley Civilization provides a logical, if somewhat arbitrary, starting point for South Asian religions, but these links from the Indus religion to later-day South Asian traditions are subject to scholarly dispute.[119]\\r\\nThe Vedic period, named after the Vedic religion of the Indo-Aryans,[note 4] lasted from c. 1900 to 500 BCE.[121][122] The Indo-Aryans were pastoralists[123] who migrated into north-western India after the collapse of the Indus Valley Civilization,[120][124] Linguistic and archaeological data show a cultural change after 1500 BCE,[120] with the linguistic and religious data clearly showing links with Indo-European languages and religion.[125] By about 1200 BCE, the Vedic culture and agrarian lifestyle was established in the northwest and northern Gangetic plain of South Asia.[123][126][127] Rudimentary state-forms appeared, of which the Kuru-Pa?cla union was the most influential.[128][129] The first recorded state-level society in South Asia existed around 1000 BCE.[123] In this period, states Samuel, emerged the Brahmana and Aranyaka layers of Vedic texts, which merged into the earliest Upanishads.[130] These texts began to ask the meaning of a ritual, adding increasing levels of philosophical and metaphysical speculation,[130] or \\"Hindu synthesis\\".[131]\\r\\nThe Indo-Aryans brought with them their language[132] and religion.[133][134] The Vedic beliefs and practices of the pre-classical era were closely related to the hypothesised Proto-Indo-European religion and the Indo-Iranian religion,[135] the latter being \\"a syncretic mixture of old Central Asian and new Indo-European elements\\".[136] The Vedic religion history is unclear and \\"heavily contested\\", states Samuel.[137]\\r\\nIncreasing urbanisation of India between 800 and 400 BCE, and possibly the spread of urban diseases, contributed to the rise of ascetic movements and of new ideas which challenged the orthodox Brahmanism.[138] These ideas led to Sramana movements, of which Mahavira (c. 549ÿ477 BCE), proponent of Jainism, and Buddha (c. 563-483), founder of Buddhism, were the most prominent icons.[139]\\r\\nThe Greek army led by Alexander the Great stayed in the Hindu Kush region of South Asia for several years and then later moved into the Indus valley region. Later, the Maurya Empire extended over much of South Asia in the 3rd century BCE. Buddhism spread beyond the Indian subcontinent, through northwest into Central Asia. The Bamiyan Buddhas of Afghanistan and the edicts of A?oka suggest that the Buddhist monks spread Buddhism (Dharma) in eastern provinces of the Seleucid Empire, and possibly even farther into West Asia.[140][141][142] The Theravada school spread south from India in the 3rd century BCE, to Sri Lanka, later to Southeast Asia.[143] Buddhism, by the last centuries of the 1st millennium BCE, was prominent in the Himalayan region, Gandhara, Hindu Kush region and Bactria.[144][145][146]\\r\\nFrom about 500 BCE through about 300 CE, the Vedic-Brahmanic synthesis or \\"Hindu synthesis\\" continued.[131] Classical Hindu and Sramanic (particularly Buddhist) ideas spread within Indian subcontinent, as well outside South Asia.[147][148][149] The Gupta Empire ruled over a large part of the subcontinent between 4th and 7th centuries, a period that saw the construction of major temples, monasteries and universities such as the Nalanda.[150][151][152] During this era, and through the 10th century, numerous cave monasteries and temples such as the Ajanta Caves, Badami cave temples and Ellora Caves were built in South Asia.[153][154][155]\\r\\nIslam came as a political power in the fringe of South Asia in 8th century CE when the Arab general Muhammad bin Qasim conquered Sindh and Multan in southern Punjab in modern-day Pakistan.[156] By 962 CE, Hindu and Buddhist kingdoms in South Asia were under a wave of raids from Muslim armies from Central Asia.[157] Among them was Mahmud of Ghazni, who raided and plundered kingdoms in north India from east of the Indus river to west of Yamuna river seventeen times between 997 and 1030.[158] Mahmud of Ghazni raided the treasuries but retracted each time, only extending Islamic rule into western Punjab.[159][160]\\r\\nThe wave of raids on north Indian and western Indian kingdoms by Muslim warlords continued after Mahmud of Ghazni, plundering and looting these kingdoms.[161] The raids did not establish or extend permanent boundaries of their Islamic kingdoms. The Ghurid Sultan Mu'izz al-Din Muhammad began a systematic war of expansion into north India in 1173.[162] He sought to carve out a principality for himself by expanding the Islamic world.[158][163] Mu'izz sought a Sunni Islamic kingdom of his own extending east of the Indus river, and he thus laid the foundation for the Muslim kingdom that became the Delhi Sultanate.[158] Some historians chronicle the Delhi Sultanate from 1192 due to the presence and geographical claims of Mu'izz al-Din in South Asia by that time.[164] The Delhi Sultanate covered varying parts of South Asia, and was ruled by a series of dynasties, called Mamluk, Khalji, Tughlaq, Sayyid and Lodi dynasties. Muhammad bin Tughlaq came to power in 1325, launched a war of expansion and the Delhi Sultanate reached it largest geographical reach over the Indian subcontinent during his 26-year rule.[165] A Sunni Sultan, Muhammad bin Tughlaq persecuted non-Muslims such as Hindus, as well as non-Sunni Muslims such as Shia and Mahdi sects.[166][167][168]\\r\\nRevolts against the Delhi Sultanate sprang up in many parts of South Asia during the 14th century. After the death of Muhammad bin Tughlaq, the Bengal Sultanate came to power in 1352 CE, as the Delhi Sultanate began disintegrating. The Bengal Sultanate remained in power through the early 16th century. It was reconquered by the armies of the Mughal Empire. The state religion of the Bengal Sultanate was Islam, and the region under its rule, a region that ultimately emerged as the modern nation of Bangladesh, saw a growth of a syncretic form of Islam.[169][170] In the Deccan region, the Hindu kingdom Vijayanagara Empire came to power in 1336 and remained in power through the 16th century, after which it too was reconquered and absorbed into the Mughal Empire.[171][172]\\r\\nAbout 1526, the Punjab governor Dawlat Khan Lodؐ reached out to the Mughal Babur and invited him to attack Delhi Sultanate. Babur defeated and killed Ibrahim Lodi in the Battle of Panipat in 1526. The death of Ibrahim Lodi ended the Delhi Sultanate, and the Mughal Empire replaced it.[173]\\r\\nThe modern history period of South Asia, that is 16th-century onwards, witnessed the start of the Central Asian dynasty named the Mughals, with Turkish-Mongol roots and Sunni Islam theology. The first ruler was Babur, whose empire extended the northwest and Indo-Gangetic Plain regions of South Asia. The Deccan and northeastern region of the South Asia was largely under Hindu kings such as those of Vijayanagara Empire and Ahom kingdom,[174] with some regions such as parts of modern Telangana and Andhra Pradesh under local Sultanates such as the Shia Islamic rulers of Golconda Sultanate.[175]\\r\\nThe Mughal Empire continued its wars of expansion after Babur's death. With the fall of Rajput kingdoms and Vijayanagara, its boundaries reached all of west, as well as the Marathi and Kannada speaking regions of the Deccan peninsula. The Mughal Empire was marked by a period of artistic exchanges and a Central Asian and South Asian architecture synthesis, with remarkable buildings such as the Taj Mahal.[176] It also marked an extended period of religious persecution.[177] Two of the religious leaders of Sikhism, Guru Arjan and Guru Tegh Bahadur were arrested under orders of the Mughal emperors, asked to convert to Islam, and executed when they refused.[178][179][180] Religious taxes on non-Muslims called jizya were imposed. Buddhist, Hindu and Sikh temples were desecrated. However, not all Muslim rulers persecuted non-Muslims. Akbar, a Mughal ruler for example, sought religious tolerance and abolished jizya.[181] After his death, the persecution of non-Muslims in South Asia returned.[182] The persecution and religious violence in South Asia peaked during Aurangzeb era, with him issuing orders in 1669, to all his governors of provinces to \\"destroy with a willing hand the schools and temples of the infidels, and that they were strictly enjoined to put an entire stop to the teaching and practice of idolatrous forms of worship\\".[183][184] In Aurangzeb's time, almost all of South Asia was claimed by the Mughal Empire. However, this claim was violently challenged in various regions of South Asia, particularly by the Sikh Guru Gobind Singh in the northwest,[185] and by Shivaji in the Deccan regions.[186]\\r\\nMaritime trading between South Asia and European merchants began after the Portuguese explorer Vasco de Gama returned to Europe. After the death of Aurangzeb and the collapse of the Mughal Empire, the region came under the rule of many small Islamic sultanates and Hindu kingdoms. British, French, Portuguese colonial interests struck treaties with these rulers, and established their trading ports. In the northwest South Asia, a large region was consolidated into the Sikh Empire by Ranjit Singh.[187][page?needed][188] After his death, the British Empire expanded their interests till the Hindu Kush region. In the east, the Bengal region was split into Muslim East Bengal and Hindu West Bengal, by the colonial British empire, in early 1900s, a split that was reversed. However, after the World War II, at the eve of India's independence, the region was split again into East Pakistan and West Bengal. East Pakistan became Bangladesh in 1971.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe population of South Asia is about 1.749 billion which makes it the most populated region in the world.[189] It is socially very mixed, consisting of many language groups and religions, and social practices in one region that are vastly different from those in another.[190]\\r\\nSouth Asia is home to some of the most populated cities in the world. Delhi, Karachi, Mumbai, and Dhaka are four of the world's largest megacities.\\r\\nThere are numerous languages in South Asia. The spoken languages of the region are largely based on geography and shared across religious boundaries, but the written script is sharply divided by religious boundaries. In particular, Muslims of South Asia such as in Afghanistan and Pakistan use the Arabic alphabet and Persian Nastaliq. Till 1971, Muslim Bangladesh (then known as East Pakistan) too mandated only Nastaliq script, but thereafter has adopted regional scripts and particularly Bengali. Non-Muslims of South Asia, and some Muslims in India, on the other hand use their traditional ancient heritage scripts such as those derived from Brahmi script for Indo-European languages and non-Brahmi scripts for Dravidian languages and others.[194]\\r\\nThe Nagari script has been the primus inter pares of the traditional South Asian scripts.[195] The Devanagari script is used for over 120 South Asian languages,[196] including Hindi,[197] Marathi, Nepali, Pali, Konkani, Bodo, Sindhi and Maithili among other languages and dialects, making it one of the most used and adopted writing systems in the world.[198] The Devanagari script is also used for classical Sanskrit texts.[196]\\r\\nThe largest spoken language in this region is Hindi, followed by Bengali, Telugu, Tamil, Gujarati and Punjabi.[194] In the modern era, new syncretic languages developed in the region such as Urdu that is used by Muslim community of northern Indian subcontinent (particularly Pakistan and northern states of India).[199] The Punjabi language spans three religions: Islam, Hinduism and Sikhism. The spoken language is similar, but it is written in three scripts. The Sikh use Gurmukhi alphabet, Muslim Punjabis in Pakistan use the Nastaliq script, while Hindu Punjabis in India use the Gurmukhi or Ngarؐ script.

The Hindus, Buddhists, Jains, Sikhs and Christians are concentrated in India, Nepal, Sri Lanka and Bhutan, while the Muslims are concentrated in Afghanistan (99%), Bangladesh (90%), Pakistan (96%) and Maldives (100%).[12]\\r\\nIndian religions are the religions that originated in the Indian subcontinent; namely Hinduism, Jainism, Buddhism and Sikhism.[204] The Indian religions are distinct yet share terminology, concepts, goals and ideas, and from the Indian subcontinent spread into East Asia and southeast Asia.[204] Early Christianity and Islam were introduced into coastal regions of South Asia by merchants who settled among the local populations. Later Sindh, Balochistan, and parts of the Punjab region saw conquest by the Arab caliphates along with an influx of Muslims from Persia and Central Asia, which resulted in spread of both Shia and Sunni Islam in parts of northwestern region of South Asia. Subsequently, under the influence of Muslim rulers of the Islamic sultanates and the Mughal Empire, Islam spread in South Asia.[205][206]\\r\\nIndia is the largest & fastest growing economy in the region (US$2.180 trillion) and makes up almost 82% of the South Asian economy; it is the world's 7th largest in nominal terms and 3rd largest by purchasing power adjusted exchange rates (US$8.020 trillion).[217] India is the only member of powerful G-20 major economies and BRICS from the region. It is the fastest growing major economy in the world and one of the world's fastest registering a growth of 7.3% in FY 2014ÿ15. Pakistan has the next largest economy($250 billion) and the 5th highest GDP per capita in the region,[218] followed by Bangladesh and then by Sri Lanka which has the 2nd highest per capita and is the 4th largest economy in the region.

Their attacks on immunization teams have claimed 78 lives since December 2012.[227]\\r\\nAccording to the World Bank's 2011 report, based on 2005 ICP PPP, about 24.6% of the South Asian population falls below the international poverty line of $1.25/day.[228] Afghanistan and Bangladesh rank the highest, with 30.6% and 43.3% of their respective populations below the poverty line. Bhutan, Maldives and Sri Lanka have the lowest number of people below the poverty line, with 2.4%, 1.5% and 4.1% respectively. India has lifted the most people in the region above the poverty line between 2008 and 2011, around 140 million. As of 2011, 21.9% of India's population lives below the poverty line, compared to 41.6% in 2005.[229][230]\\r\\nThe World Bank estimates that India is one of the highest ranking countries in the world for the number of children suffering from malnutrition. The prevalence of underweight children in India is among the highest in the world, and is nearly double that of Sub Saharan Africa with dire consequences for mobility, mortality, productivity and economic growth.[231]\\r\\nAccording to the World Bank, 70% of the South Asian population and about 75% of South Asia's poor live in rural areas and most rely on agriculture for their livelihood[232] according to the UN's Food and Agricultural Organisation. In 2015, approximately 281 million people in the region were malnourished. The report says that Nepal reached both the WFS target as well as MDG and is moving towards bringing down the number of undernourished people to less than 5% of the population.[224] Bangladesh reached the MDG target with the National Food Policy framework?ÿ with only 16.5% of the population undernourished. In India, the malnourished comprise just over 15 percent of the population. While the number of malnourished people in neighborhood has shown a decline over the last 25 years, the number of under-nourished in Pakistan displays an upward trend.There were 28.7 million hungry in Pakistan in the 1990s?ÿ a number that has steadily increased to 41.3 million in 2015 with 22% of the population malnourished. Approximately 194.6 million people are undernourished in India, which accounts for the highest number of people suffering from hunger in any single country.[224][233]\\r\\nThe 2006 report stated \\"the low status of women in South Asian countries and their lack of nutritional knowledge are important determinants of high prevalence of underweight children in the region\\". Corruption and the lack of initiative on the part of the government has been one of the major problems associated with nutrition in India. Illiteracy in villages has been found to be one of the major issues that need more government attention. The report mentioned that although there has been a reduction in malnutrition due to the Green Revolution in South Asia, there is concern that South Asia has \\"inadequate feeding and caring practices for young children\\".[234]\\r\\ngovernment\\r\\nof state\\r\\ngovernment\\r\\nlanguages\\r\\nof arms\\r\\nIslamic republic\\r\\nHouse of the People\\r\\nDari\\r\\nconstitutional republic\\r\\nconstitutional monarchy\\r\\nNational Assembly\\r\\nconstitutional republic\\r\\nLok Sabha\\r\\nEnglish\\r\\nconstitutional republic\\r\\nconstitutional republic\\r\\nIslamic republic\\r\\nNational Assembly\\r\\nEnglish\\r\\nconstitutional republic\\r\\nTamil\\r\\nEnglish\\r\\nor region\\r\\ndivision type\\r\\ngovernment\\r\\n(km2)\\r\\nlanguages\\r\\nof arms\\r\\nOcean Territory\\r\\nGarcia\\r\\nTerritory\\r\\nconstitutional republic\\r\\n(China)\\r\\nregion of China\\r\\nMandarin\\r\\nIndia[235][236][237] and Pakistan[238][239] are the dominant political powers in the region. India is by far the largest country in the area covering around three-fourths the land area of the subcontinent.[citation needed] India has the largest population of around three times the combined population of the 6 other countries in the subcontinent.[240] India is also the world's largest democracy[241] India's annual defence budget for 2013ÿ14 is $39.2 Billion[242] which is equal to the whole Pakistan's Federal budget of $39.3 billion for 2014ÿ15.[243]\\r\\nBangladesh is a unitary state and parliamentary democracy.[244] Bangladesh also stands out as one of the few Muslim-majority democracies. It is a moderate and generally secular and tolerant  though sometimes this is getting stretched at the moment  alternative to violent extremism in a very troubled part of the world, said Dan Mozena, the U.S. ambassador to Bangladesh. Although Bangladesh's legal code is secular, more citizens are embracing a conservative version of Islam, with some pushing for sharia law, analysts say. Experts say that the rise in conservatism reflects the influence of foreign-financed Islamic charities and the more austere version of Islam brought home by migrant workers in Persian Gulf countries.[245]\\r\\nDiplomacy among the countries of South Asia has been mainly driven by populist politics, with the centre-stage taken by India-Pakistan conflict ever since their independence in 1947, and then the creation of Bangladesh under tense circumstances in 1971. During the height of Cold war, the elite political leaders of Pakistan aligned with the US, while India played crucial role in forming the Non-Aligned Movement and while maintaining goodwill relations with the USSR.\\r\\nPakistan's governance is one of the most conflicted in the region. The military rule and the unstable government in Pakistan has become a concern for the South Asian region. In Nepal, the governance has struggled to come in the side of democracy and it only showed signs in the recent past, basically in the 21st century, to support the democratic system. The political situation in Sri Lanka has been dominated by an increasingly assertive Sinhalese nationalism, and the emergence of a Tamil separatist movement under LTTE, which was suppressed in May 2009. Myanmar's politics is dominated by a military Junta, which has sidelined the democratic forces led by Aung San Suu Kyi.\\r\\nGovernance Indicators (2015)[248]\\r\\nof violence/terrorism","input":"What is the most developed country in south asia?"},{"output":"120,000 and 680,000","context":"Spawn is the eggs and sperm released or deposited into water by aquatic animals. As a verb, to spawn refers to the process of releasing the eggs and sperm, and the act of both sexes is called spawning. Most aquatic animals, except for aquatic mammals and reptiles, reproduce through the process of spawning.\\r\\nSpawn consists of the reproductive cells (gametes) of many aquatic animals, some of which will become fertilized and produce offspring. The process of spawning typically involves females releasing ova (unfertilized eggs) into the water, often in large quantities, while males simultaneously or sequentially release spermatozoa (milt) to fertilize the eggs.[1][2][3]\\r\\nMost fish reproduce by spawning, as do most other aquatic animals, including crustaceans such as crabs and shrimps, molluscs such as oysters and squid, echinoderms such as sea urchins and sea cucumbers, amphibians such as frogs and newts, aquatic insects such as mayflies and mosquitoes and corals, which are actually small aquatic animalsnot plants. Fungi, such as mushrooms, are also said to \\"spawn\\" a white, fibrous matter that forms the matrix from which they grow.[citation needed]\\r\\nThere are many variations in the way spawning occurs, depending on sexual differences in anatomy, how the sexes relate to each other, where and how the spawn is released and whether or how the spawn is subsequently guarded.\\r\\nMarine animals, and particularly bony fish, commonly reproduce by broadcast spawning. This is an external method of reproduction where the female releases many unfertilised eggs into the water. At the same time, a male or many males release a lot of sperm into the water which fertilises some of these eggs. The eggs contain a drop of nutrient oil to sustain the embryo as it develops inside the egg case. The oil also provides buoyancy, so the eggs float and drift with the current. The strategy for survival of broadcast spawning is to disperse the fertilised eggs, preferably away from the coast into the relative safety of the open ocean. There the larvae develop as they consume their fat stores, and eventually hatch from the egg capsule into miniature versions of their parents. To survive, they must then become miniature predators themselves, feeding on plankton. Fish eventually encounter others of their own kind (conspecifics), where they form aggregations and learn to school.\\r\\nInternally, the sexes of most marine animals can be determined by looking at the gonads. For example, male testes of spawning fish are smooth and white and account for up to 12% of the mass of the fish, while female ovaries are granular and orange or yellow, accounting for up to 70% of the fish's mass. Male lampreys, hagfish and salmon discharge their sperm into the body cavity where it is expelled through pores in the abdomen. Male sharks and rays can pass sperm along a duct into a seminal vesicle, where they store it for a while before it is expelled, while teleosts usually employ separate sperm ducts.[4]:141\\r\\nExternally, many marine animals, even when spawning, show little sexual dimorphism (difference in body shape or size) or little difference in colouration. Where species are dimorphic, such as sharks or guppies, the males often have penis-like intromittent organs in the form of a modified fin.[4]:141\\r\\nA species is semelparous if its individuals spawn only once in their lifetime, and iteroparous if its individuals spawn more than once. The term semelparity comes from the Latin semel, once, and pario, to beget, while iteroparity comes from itero, to repeat, and pario, to beget.\\r\\nSemelparity is sometimes called \\"big bang\\" reproduction, since the single reproductive event of semelparous organisms is usually large and fatal to the spawners.[5] The classic example of a semelparous animal is the Pacific salmon,which lives for many years in the ocean before swimming to the freshwater stream of its birth, spawning, and then dying. Other spawning animals which are semelparous include mayflies, squid, octopus, smelt, capelin and some amphibians.[6] Semelparity is often associated with r-strategists. However, most fish and other spawning animals are iteroparous.\\r\\nWhen the internal ovaries or egg masses of fish and certain marine animals are ripe for spawning they are called roe. Roe from certain species, such as shrimp, scallop, crab and sea urchins, are sought as human delicacies in many parts of the world. Caviar is a name for the processed, salted roe of non-fertilized sturgeon. The term soft roe or white roe denotes fish milt. Lobster roe is called coral because it turns bright red when cooked. Roe (reproductive organs) are usually eaten either raw or briefly cooked.\\r\\n\\"The reproductive behaviour of fishes is remarkably diversified: they may be oviparous (lay eggs), ovoviparous (retain the eggs in the body until they hatch), or viviparous (have a direct tissue connection with the developing embryos and give birth to live young). All cartilaginous fishesthe elasmobranches (e.g., sharks, rays, and skates)employ internal fertilization and usually lay large, heavy-shelled eggs or give birth to live young. The most characteristic features of the more primitive bony fishes is the assemblage of polyandrous (many males) breeding aggregations in open water and the absence of parental care...\\"[7]\\r\\nThere are two main reproduction methods in fish. The first method is by laying eggs and the second by live-bearing (producing their young alive).\\r\\nMonogamy occurs when one male mates with one female exclusively. This is also called pair spawning.[9] Most fish are not monogamous, and when they are, they often alternate with non-monogamous behaviours. Monogamy can occur when feeding and breeding grounds are small, when it is difficult for fish to find partners, or when both sexes look after the young.[8] Many tropical cichlids, which rear their young together in locations where they must fiercely defend against competitors and predators are monogamous.[10] \\"In some pipefishes and seahorses, development of eggs takes a long time before the female can place them in the brood pouch of a male, where they are fertilized. While the male is pregnant, the female starts a new batch of eggs, which are ready at about the same time that the male gives birth to the young from the previous mating. This close timing of development promotes monogamy, especially if the likelihood of encountering another potential mate is low.\\"[8]\\r\\nPolygyny occurs when one male gets exclusive mating rights with multiple females. In polygyny a large conspicuous male usually defends females from other males or defends a breeding site.[8] The females choose large males that are successfully defending prime breeding sites which the females find attractive. For example, sculpin males defend \\"caves\\" underneath rocks which are suitable for the incubation of embryos.\\r\\nAnother way males get to mate with several females is through the use of leks. Leks are places where many fish come together, and the males display to each another. Based on these displays, each female then selects the male they want to be their mate. For example, among the cichlid Cyrtocara eucinostomus in Lake Malawi, up to 50,000 large and colourful males display together on a lek four kilometres long. The females, which are mouth brooders, choose which male they want to fertilize their eggs.[11]\\r\\nPolyandry occurs when one female gets exclusive mating rights with multiple males. This is not common, but it does happen among fish like clownfish that change their sex. It can also happen when males do the brooding but can cannot handle all the eggs the female produce, such as with some pipefish.[4]:161\\r\\nThe males in some deep sea anglerfishes are much smaller than the females. When they find a female they bite into her skin, releasing an enzyme that digests the skin of their mouth and her body and fusing the pair down to the blood-vessel level. The male then slowly atrophies, losing first his digestive organs, then his brain, heart, and eyes, ending as nothing more than a pair of gonads, which release sperm in response to hormones in the female's bloodstream indicating egg release. This extreme sexual dimorphism ensures that, when the female is ready to spawn, she has a mate immediately available.[12] A single anglerfish female can \\"mate\\" with many males in this manner.\\r\\nPolygynandry occurs when multiple males mate indiscriminately with multiple females. This mutual promiscuity is the approach most commonly used by spawning animals, and is perhaps the \\"original fish mating system.\\"[4]:161 Common examples are forage fish, such as herrings, which form huge mating shoals in shallow water. The water becomes milky with sperm and the bottom is draped with millions of fertilized eggs.[4]:161\\r\\nAlternate male strategies which allow small males to engage in cuckoldry can develop in species where spawning is dominated by large and aggressive males. Cuckoldry is a variant of polyandry, and can occur with sneak spawners (sometimes called streak spawners). A sneak spawner is a male that rushes in to join the spawning rush of a spawning pair.[13] A spawning rush occurs when a fish makes a burst of speed, usually on a near vertical incline, releasing gametes at the apex, followed by a rapid return to the lake or sea floor or fish aggregation.[14] Sneaking males do not take part in courtship. In salmon and trout, for example, jack males are common. These are small silvery males that migrate upstream along with the standard, large, hook-nosed males and that spawn by sneaking into a redd (spawning nest) to release sperm simultaneously with a mated pair. This behaviour is an evolutionarily stable strategy for reproduction, because it is favoured by natural selection just like the \\"standard\\" strategy of large males.[15]\\r\\nCuckoldry occurs in many fish species, including dragonets, parrotfishes and wrasses on tropical reefs and the bluegill sunfish in fresh water. Sneaker males that become too large to hide effectively become satellite males. With bluegill sunfish, satellite males mimic the behaviour and colouration of the females. They hover over a nest containing a pair of courting sunfish, and gradually descend to reach the pair just as they spawn. Males may need to be 6 or 7 years old to function capably as parental males, but may be able to function as sneaker or satellite males when they are as young as 2 or 3 years old. The smaller satellite and sneaker males may get mauled by the more powerful parental males, but they spawn when they are younger and they do not put energy into parental care.[4]:161ÿ2[16]\\r\\nHermaphroditism occurs when a given individual in a species possesses both male and female reproductive organs, or can alternate between possessing first one, and then the other. Hermaphroditism is common in invertebrates but rare in vertebrates. It can be contrasted with gonochorism, where each individual in a species is either male or female, and remains that way throughout their lives. Most fish are gonochorists, but hermaphroditism is known to occur in 14 families of teleost fishes.[17]\\r\\nUsually hermaphrodites are sequential, meaning they can switch sex, usually from female to male (protogyny). This can happen if a dominant male is removed from a group of females. The largest female in the harem can switch sex over a few days and replace the dominant male.[17] This is found amongst coral reef fishes such as groupers, parrotfishes and wrasses. It is less common for a male to switch to a female (protandry).[4]:162 As an example, most wrasses are protogynous hermaphrodites within a haremic mating system.[18][19] Hermaphroditism allows for complex mating systems. Wrasses exhibit three different mating systems: polygynous, lek-like, and promiscuous mating systems.[20] Group spawning and pair spawning occur within mating systems. The type of spawning that occurs depends on male body size.[19] Labroids typically exhibit broadcast spawning, releasing high amounts of planktonic eggs, which are broadcast by tidal currents; adult wrasses have no interaction with offspring.[21] Wrasse of a particular subgroup of the Labridae family Labrini do not exhibit broadcast spawning.\\r\\nLess commonly hermaphrodites can be synchronous, meaning they simultaneously possess both ovaries and testicles and can function as either sex at any one time. Black hamlets \\"take turns releasing sperm and eggs during spawning. Because such egg trading is advantageous to both individuals, hamlets are typically monogamous for short periods of timeÿan unusual situation in fishes.\\"[22] The sex of many fishes is not fixed, but can change with physical and social changes to the environment where the fish lives.[23]\\r\\nParticularly among fishes, hermaphroditism can pay off in situations where one sex is more likely to survive and reproduce, perhaps because it is larger.[24] Anemone fishes are sequential hermaphrodites which are born as males, and become females only when they are mature. Anemone fishes live together monogamously in an anemone, protected by the anemone stings. The males do not have to compete with other males, and female anemone fish are typically larger. When a female dies a juvenile (male) anemone fish moves in, and \\"the resident male then turns into a female and reproductive advantages of the large femaleÿsmall male combination continue\\".[25] In other fishes sex changes are reversible. For example, if some gobies are grouped by sex (male or female), some will switch sex.[4]:164[24]\\r\\nUnisexuality occurs when a species is all-male or all-female. Unisexuality occurs in some fish species, and can take complex forms. Squalius alburnoides, a minnow found in several river basins in Portugal and Spain, appears to be an all-male species. The existence of this species illustrates the potential complexity of mating systems in fish. The species originated as a hybrid between two species, and is diploid, but not hermaphroditic. It can have triploid and tetraploid forms, including all-female forms that reproduce mainly through hybridogenesis.[26]\\r\\nIt is rare to find true parthenogenesis in fishes, where females produce female offspring with no input from males. All-female species include the Texas silverside, Menidia clarkhubbsi[27] as well as a complex of Mexican mollies.[4]:162 Parthenogenesis has been recently observed in hammerhead sharks[28] and blacktip sharks.[29] It is also known to occur in crayfish[30][31] and amphibians.[32][33]\\r\\nThis section is patterned after a classification of the spawning behaviours of fish by Balon (1975, 1984) into reproductive guilds. This classification is based on how the eggs are fertilized (internal or external spawners), where the eggs are deposited (pelagic or benthic spawners), and whether and how the parents look after the eggs after spawning (bearers, guarders and nonguarders).[34]\\r\\nNonguarders do not protect their eggs and offspring after spawning\\r\\nOpen substrate spawners scatter their eggs in the environment. They usually spawn in shoals without complex courtship rituals, and males outnumber females.\\r\\nBroadcast spawners: release their gametes (sperm and eggs) into open water for external fertilisation. There is no subsequent parental care.[35] About 75% of coral species are broadcasters, the majority of which are hermatypic, or reef-building corals.[36]\\r\\nBrood hiders hide their eggs but do not give parental care after they have hidden them. Brood hiders are mostly benthic spawners that bury the fertilized eggs. For example, among salmon and trout the female digs a nest with her tail in gravel. These nests are called redds. The female then lays her eggs while the male fertilizes them, while both fish defend the redd if necessary from other members of the same species. Then the female buries the nest, and the nest site is abandoned. In North America, some minnows build nests out of piles of stones rather than dig holes. The minnow males have tubercles on their head and body which they use to help them defend the nest site.[4]:145\\r\\nBitterlings have a remarkable reproduction strategy where parents transfer responsibility for the care of their young to mussels. The female extends her ovipositor into the mantle cavity of the mussel and deposits her eggs between the gill filaments. The male then ejects his sperm into the mussel's inhalant water current and fertilization takes place within the gills of the host. The same female may use a number of mussels, and she deposits only one or two yellow, oval eggs into each. Early developmental stages are protected from predation within the body of the mussel. After 3 to 4 weeks larvae swim away from the host to continue life on their own.\\r\\nGuarders protect their eggs and offspring after spawning by practicing parental care (also called brood care). Parental care is an \\"investment by parents in offspring that increases the offsprings' chances of surviving (and hence reproducing). In fish, parental care can take a variety of forms including guarding, nest building, fanning, splashing, removal of dead eggs, retrieval of straying fry, external egg carrying, egg burying, moving eggs or young, ectodermal feeding, oral brooding, internal gestation, brood-pouch egg carrying, etc.\\"[37]\\r\\nTerritorial behaviour is generally necessary for guarders, and the embryos are almost always guarded by males (apart from cichlids). There is a need to be territorial because looking after embryos usually includes defending the site where they are being looked after. It also often means there is competition for the best egg-laying sites. Elaborate courtship behaviour is usual among guarders.[4]:145\\r\\nGuarding males keep the embryos safe from predators, keep oxygen levels high by fanning water currents, and keep the area free from dead embryos and debris. They protect the embryos until they hatch, and often look after the larval stages as well. The time spent guarding can range from a few days to several months.[4]:145\\r\\nSome guarders build nests (nest spawners) and some do not (substrate spawners), though the difference between the two groups can be small.[4]:142 Substrate spawners clean off a suitable area of surface suitable for egg laying, and look after the area, but they do not actively build a nest.\\r\\nBaby paradise fish just hatched, gathered under the surface of a bubble nest\\r\\nAnemone fish nest in an anemone. Here a male is protecting spawn produced by his partner.\\r\\nBearers are fish that carry their embryos (and sometimes their young) around with them, either externally or internally.\\r\\nMouth brooders - carry eggs or larvae in their mouth. Mouth brooders can be ovophiles or larvophiles. Ovophile or egg-loving mouth-brooders lay their eggs in a pit, which are sucked up into the mouth of the female. The small number of large eggs hatch in the mother's mouth, and the fry remain there for a period of time. Fertilization often occurs with the help of egg-spots, which are colorful spots on the anal fin of the male. When the female sees these spots, she tries to pick up the egg-spots, but instead gets a mouthful of sperm, fertilizing the eggs in her mouth. Many cichlids and some labyrinth fish are ovophile mouthbrooders. Larvophile or larvae-loving mouth-brooders lay their eggs on a substrate and guard them until the eggs hatch. After hatching, the female picks up the fry and keeps them in her mouth. When the fry can fend for themselves, they are released. Some eartheaters are larvophile mouthbrooders.\\r\\nThe beginning of the evolutionary process of livebearing starts with facultative (optional) internal bearing. The process occurs in several species of oviparous (egg-laying) killifishes which spawn in the normal way on the substrate, but in the process accidentally fertilize eggs which the female retains and does not spawn. These eggs are spawned later, usually without allowing much time for embryonic development.[4]:147\\r\\nThe next step in the evolution of livebearing is obligate (by necessity) internal bearing, where the female retains all the embryos. \\"The only source of nutrition for these embryos, however, is the egg yolk, as in externally spawned eggs. This situation, also referred to as ovoviviparity, is characteristic of marine rock fishes and the Lake Baikal sculpins. This strategy allows these fish to have fecundities approaching those of pelagic fish with external fertilization, but it also enables them to protect the young during their most vulnerable stage of development. By contrast, sharks and rays using this strategy produce a relatively small number of embryos and retain them for a few weeks to 16 months or longer. The shorter times spans are characteristic of species that eventually deposit their embryos in the environment, surrounded by a horny capsule; whereas the longer periods are characteristic of sharks that retain the embryos until they are ready to emerge as actively swimming young.\\"[4]:147[38]\\r\\nHowever, some fish do not fit these categories. The livebearing largespring gambusia (Gambusia geiseri) was thought to be ovoviviparous until it was shown in 2001 that the embryos received nutrients from the mother.[39]\\r\\n\\r\\nSpawning grounds are the areas of water where aquatic animals spawn, or produce their eggs. After spawning, the spawn may or may not drift to new grounds which become their nursery grounds. Many species undertake migrations each year, and sometimes great migrations, to reach their spawning grounds. For example, lakes and river watersheds can be major spawning grounds for anadromous fish such as salmon. These days, it is often necessary to construct fish ladders and other bypass systems so salmon can navigate their way past hydroelectric dams or other obstructions such as weirs on their way to spawning grounds.[40][41] Coastal fish often use mangroves and estuaries as spawning grounds, while reef fish can find adjacent seagrass meadows that make good spawning grounds. Short-finned eels can travel anything up to three or four thousand kilometres to their spawning ground in deep water somewhere in the Coral Sea.\\r\\nForage fish often make great migrations between their spawning, feeding and nursery grounds. Schools of a particular stock usually travel in a triangle between these grounds. For example, one stock of herrings have their spawning ground in southern Norway, their feeding ground in Iceland, and their nursery ground in northern Norway. Wide triangular journeys such as these may be important because forage fish, when feeding, cannot distinguish their own offspring.[42]\\r\\nCapelin are a forage fish of the smelt family found in the Atlantic and Arctic oceans. In summer, they graze on dense swarms of plankton at the edge of the ice shelf. Larger capelin also eat krill and other crustaceans. The capelin move inshore in large schools to spawn and migrate in spring and summer to feed in plankton rich areas between Iceland, Greenland, and Jan Mayen. The migration is affected by ocean currents. Around Iceland maturing capelin make large northward feeding migrations in spring and summer. The return migration takes place in September to November. The spawning migration starts north of Iceland in December or January.[43]\\r\\nThe diagram on the right shows the main spawning grounds and larval drift routes. Capelin on the way to feeding grounds is coloured green, capelin on the way back is blue, and the breeding grounds are red.[43] In a paper published in 2009, researchers from Iceland recount their application of an interacting particle model to the capelin stock around Iceland, successfully predicting the spawning migration route for 2008.[44]\\r\\nReferred to as \\"the greatest shoal on earth\\", the sardine run occurs when millions of sardines migrate from their spawning grounds south of the southern tip of Africa northward along the Eastern Cape coastline. Chinook salmon make the longest freshwater migration of any salmon, over 3,000 kilometres (1,900?mi) up the Yukon River to spawning grounds upstream of Whitehorse, Yukon. Some green sea turtles swim more than 2,600 kilometres (1,600?mi) to reach their spawning grounds.\\r\\nGoldfish, like all cyprinids, are egg-layers. They usually start breeding after a significant temperature change, often in spring. Males chase females, prompting them to release their eggs by bumping and nudging them. As the female goldfish spawns her eggs, the male goldfish stays close behind fertilizing them. Their eggs are adhesive and attach to aquatic vegetation. The eggs hatch within 48 to 72 hours. Within a week or so, the fry begins to assume its final shape, although a year may pass before they develop a mature goldfish colour; until then they are a metallic brown like their wild ancestors. In their first weeks of life, the fry grow quicklyan adaptation born of the high risk of getting devoured by the adult goldfish.\\r\\nA member of the Cyprinidae family, carp spawn in times between April and August, largely dependent upon the climate and conditions they live in. Oxygen levels of the water, availability of food, size of each fish, age, number of times the fish has spawned before and water temperature are all factors known to effect when and how many eggs each carp will spawn at any one time.[45]\\r\\nPrior to spawning, male Siamese fighting fish build bubble nests of varying sizes at the surface of the water. When a male becomes interested in a female, he will flare his gills, twist his body, and spread his fins. The female darkens in colour and curves her body back and forth. The act of spawning takes place in a \\"nuptial embrace\\" where the male wraps his body around the female, each embrace resulting in the release of 10-40 eggs until the female is exhausted of eggs. The male, from his side, releases milt into the water and fertilization takes place externally. During and after spawning, the male uses his mouth to retrieve sinking eggs and deposit them in the bubble nest (during mating the female sometimes assists her partner, but more often she will simply devour all the eggs that she manages to catch). Once the female has released all of her eggs, she is chased away from the male's territory, as it is likely that she'll eat the eggs due to hunger.[46] The eggs then remain in the male's care. He keeps them in the bubble nest, making sure none fall to the bottom and repairing the nest as needed. Incubation lasts for 24ÿ36 hours, and the newly hatched larvae remain in the nest for the next 2ÿ3 days, until their yolk sacs are fully absorbed. Afterwards the fry leave the nest and the free-swimming stage begins.[47]\\r\\nSiamese fighting fish build bubble nests of varying sizes.\\r\\nA pair of Siamese fighting fish spawning under their bubble nest.\\r\\nOne-day-old Siamese fighting fish larvae in a bubble nest - their yolk sacs have not yet been absorbed\\r\\nA 15-day-old free-swimming fry of a Siamese fighting fish\\r\\nCopepods are tiny crustaceans which usually reproduce either by broadcast spawning or by sac spawning. Broadcasting copepods scatter their eggs into the water, but sac spawners lay their eggs into an ovigerous sac. Sac spawners spawn few but relatively large eggs that develop slowly. By contrast, broadcast spawners spawn numerous small eggs that develop rapidly.[48] However, the shorter hatch times that result from broadcasting are not short enough to compensate for the higher mortality compared to sac spawners. To produce a given number of hatched eggs, broadcasters must spawn more eggs than sac spawners.[49]\\r\\nAfter mating, the fertilized eggs of the California spiny lobster are carried on the female's pleopods until they hatch, with between 120,000 and 680,000 carried by a single female.[50] The eggs begin coral red, but darken as they develop to a deep maroon.[51] When she is carrying the eggs, the female is said to be \\"berried\\". The eggs are ready to hatch after 10 weeks,[50] and spawning takes place from May to August.[52] The larvae that hatch (called phyllosoma larvae) do not resemble the adults. Instead, they are flat, transparent animals around 14?mm (0.55?in) long, but as thin as a sheet of paper.[53] The larvae feed on plankton,[51] and grow through ten molts into ten further larval stages, the last of which is around 30ÿ32?mm (1.2ÿ1.3?in) long.[53] The full series of larval molts takes around 7 months, and when the last stage molts, it metamorphoses into the puerulus state, which is a juvenile form of the adult, though still transparent.[53] The puerulus larvae settle to the sea floor when the water is near its maximum temperature, which in Baja California is in the fall.[54]\\r\\nEgg-bearing female lobsters migrate inshore from deeper waters to hatch their eggs, though they do not have specific spawning grounds.[55][56] These lobster migrations can occur in close single-file formation \\"lobster trains\\".\\r\\nOysters are broadcast spawners, that is, eggs and sperm are released into open water where fertilisation occurs. They are protandric; during their first year they spawn as males by releasing sperm into the water. As they grow over the next two or three years and develop greater energy reserves, they spawn as females by releasing eggs. Bay oysters usually spawn by the end of June. An increase in water temperature prompts a few oysters to spawn. This triggers spawning in the rest, clouding the water with millions of eggs and sperm. A single female oyster can produce up to 100 million eggs annually. The eggs become fertilized in the water and develop rapidly into planktonic larvae. which eventually find suitable sites, such as another oyster's shell, on which to settle. Attached oyster larvae are called spat. Spat are oysters less than 25 millimetres (0.98?in) long.\\r\\nThe Pacific oyster usually has separate sexes. Their sex can be determined by examining the gonads, and it can change from year to year, normally during the winter months. In certain environmental conditions, one sex is favoured over the other. Protandry is favoured in areas of high food abundance and protogyny occurs in areas of low food abundance. In habitats with a high food supply, the sex ratio in the adult population tends to favour females, and areas with low food abundances tend to have a larger proportion of male adults. Spawning in the Pacific oyster occurs at 20?C (68?F). This species is very fecund, with females releasing about 50ÿ200 million eggs in regular intervals (at a rate of 5ÿ10 times a minute) in a single spawning. Once released from the gonads, the eggs move through the suprabranchial chambers (gills), are then pushed through the gill ostia into the mantle chamber, and are finally released in the water, forming a small cloud. In males, the sperm is released at the opposite end of the oyster, along with the normal exhalent stream of water.[57] A rise in water temperature is thought to be the main cue in the initiation of spawning, as the onset of higher water temperatures in the summer results in earlier spawning in the Pacific oyster.[58]\\r\\nThe larvae of the Pacific oyster are planktotrophic, and are about 70?m at the prodissoconch 1 stage. The larvae move through the water column via the use of a larval foot to find suitable settlement locations. They can spend several weeks at this phase, which is dependent on water temperature, salinity and food supply. Over these weeks, larvae can disperse great distances by water currents before they metamorphose and settle as small spat. Similar to other oyster species, once the Pacific oyster larvae find a suitable habitat, they attach to it permanently using cement secreted from a gland in their foot. After settlement, the larvae metamorphose into juvenile spat. The growth rate is very rapid in optimum environmental conditions, and market size can be achieved in 18 to 30 months.[59]\\r\\nCephalopods, such as squid and octopuses, have prominent heads and a set of arms (tentacles) modified from the primitive foot of molluscs. All cephalopods are sexually dimorphic. However, they lack external sexual characteristics, so they use colour communication. A courting male approaches a likely looking mate flashing his brightest colours, often in rippling displays. If the other cephalopod is female and receptive, her skin will change colour to become pale, and mating will occur. If the other cephalopod remains brightly coloured, it is taken as a warning.[60]\\r\\nAll cephalopods reproduce by spawning eggs. Most cephalopods use semi-internal fertilization where the male places his gametes inside the female's mantle cavity to fertilize the ova in the female's single ovary.[61] The \\"penis\\" in most male cephalopods is a long and muscular end of the gonoduct used to transfer spermatophores to a modified sperm-carrying arm called a hectocotylus. That in turn is used to transfer the spermatophores to the female. In species where the hectocotylus is missing, the \\"penis\\" is long and able to extend beyond the mantle cavity and transfers the spermatophores directly to the female. In many cephalopods, mating occurs head to head and the male may simply transfer sperm to the female. Others may detach the sperm-carrying arm and leave it attached to the female. Deep water squid have the greatest known penis length relative to body size of all mobile animals, second in the entire animal kingdom only to certain sessile barnacles. Penis elongation in the greater hooked squid may result in a penis that is as long as the mantle, head and arms combined.[62][63]\\r\\nSome species brood their fertilized eggs: female paper nautilus construct shelters for the young, while Gonatiid squid carry a larva-laden membrane from the hooks on their arms.[64] Other cephalopods deposit their young under rocks and aerate them with their tentacles hatching. Mostly the eggs are left to their own devices; many squid lay sausage-like bunches of eggs in crevices or occasionally on the sea floor. Cuttlefish lay eggs separately in cases and attach them to coral or algal fronds.[65] Like Pacific salmon, cephalopods are mostly semelparous, spawning many small eggs in one batch and then dying. Cephalopods usually live fast and die young. Most of the energy extracted from their food is used for growing, and they mature rapidly to their adult size. Some gain as much as 12% of their body mass each day. Most live for one to two years, reproducing and then dying shortly thereafter.[66][67]\\r\\nEchinoderms are marine animals, widespread in all oceans, but not found in fresh water. Just below their skin is an endoskeleton composed of calcareous plates or ossicles.\\r\\nSea urchins are spiky echinoderms with spherical bodies which usually contain five gonads. They move slowly, feed mostly on seaweed, and are important for the diet of sea otters. Sea urchins are dioecious, having separate male and female sexes, although there is generally no easy way to distinguish the two. The gonads are lined with muscles underneath the peritoneum, and these allow the animal to squeeze its gametes through the duct and into the surrounding sea water, where fertilization takes place.[68] Their roe (male and female gonads) is soft and melting, with a colour ranging from orange to pale yellow, and is sought after as a human delicacy in many parts of the world.\\r\\nSea cucumbers are leathery echinoderms with elongated bodies which contain a single, branched gonad. They are found on the sea floor worldwide, and occur in great numbers on the deep sea floor where they often make up the majority of the animal biomass.[69] They feed on plankton and decaying organic debris found at the sea bottom, catching food that flows by with their open tentacles or sifting through bottom sediments. Like sea urchins, most sea cucumbers reproduce by releasing sperm and ova into the ocean water. Depending on conditions, one organism can produce thousands of gametes.\\r\\nSea cucumbers are typically dioecious, with separate male and female individuals. The reproductive system consists of a single gonad, consisting of a cluster of tubules emptying into a single duct that opens on the upper surface of the animal, close to the tentacles.[68] Many species fertilise their eggs internally. The fertilised egg develops in a pouch on the adult's body and eventually hatches as a juvenile sea cucumber.[70] A few species brood their young inside the body cavity, giving birth through a small rupture in the body wall close to the anus. The remaining species develop their eggs into a free-swimming larva, usually after about three days of development. This larva swims by means of a long band of cilia wrapped around its body. As the larva grows it transforms into a barrel-shaped body with three to five separate rings of cilia. The tentacles are usually the first adult features to appear, before the regular tube feet.[68]\\r\\nAmphibians are found in and around fresh water lakes and ponds, but not in marine environments. Examples are frogs and toads, salamanders, newts and caecilians (which resemble snakes). They are cold-blooded animals that metamorphose from a juvenile water-breathing form, usually to an adult air-breathing form, though mudpuppies retain juvenile gills in adulthood.\\r\\nFemale frogs and toads usually spawn gelatinous egg masses containing thousands of eggs in water. Different species lay eggs in distinctive and identifiable ways. For example, the American toad lays long strings of eggs. The eggs are highly vulnerable to predation, so frogs have evolved many techniques to ensure the survival of the next generation. In colder areas the embryo is black to absorb more heat from the sun, which speeds up development. Most commonly, this involves synchronous reproduction. Many individuals will breed at the same time, overwhelming the actions of predators; the majority of the offspring will still die due to predation, but there is a greater chance some will survive. Another way in which some species avoid predators and the pathogens eggs are exposed to in ponds is to lay eggs on leaves above the pond, with a gelatinous coating designed to retain moisture. In these species the tadpoles drop into the water upon hatching. The eggs of some species laid out of water can detect vibrations of nearby predatory wasps or snakes, and will hatch early to avoid being eaten.[72]\\r\\nWhile the length of the egg stage depends on the species and environmental conditions, aquatic eggs generally hatch within one week. Unlike salamanders and newts, frogs and toads never become sexually mature while still in their larval stage. The hatched eggs continue life as tadpoles, which typically have oval bodies and long, vertically flattened tails. As a general rule, free living larvae are fully aquatic. They lack eyelids and have a cartilaginous skeleton, a lateral line system, gills for respiration (external gills at first, internal gills later) and tails with dorsal and ventral folds of skin for swimming.[73] They quickly develop a gill pouch that covers the gills and the front legs; the lungs are also developed at an early stage as an accessory breathing organ. Some species which go through the metamorphosis inside the egg and hatch to small frogs never develop gills; instead there are specialised areas of skin that take care of respiration. Tadpoles also lack true teeth, but the jaws in most species usually have two elongate, parallel rows of small keratinized structures called keradonts in the upper jaw while the lower jaw has three rows of keradonts, surrounded by a horny beak, but the number of rows can be lower (sometimes zero), or much higher.[74] Tadpoles feed on algae, including diatoms filtered from the water through the gills. Some species are carnivorous at the tadpole stage, eating insects, smaller tadpoles, and fish. Cannibalism has been observed among tadpoles. Early developers who gain legs may be eaten by the others, so the late bloomers survive longer.[75]\\r\\nSea turtles are amphibious reptiles, but they are not amphibians. Reptiles belong to the class Reptilia while amphibians belong to the class Amphibia. These are two distinct taxonomic groups. Reptiles have scales and leathery skins, while the skins of amphibians are smooth and porous. Unlike frogs, sea turtle eggs have tough, leathery shells which allow them to survive on land without drying out.\\r\\nSome sea turtles migrate long distances between feeding and spawning grounds. Green turtles have feeding grounds along the Brazilian coast. Each year, thousands of these turtles migrate about 2,300 kilometres (1,400?mi) to their spawning ground, Ascension Island in the Atlantic, an island only 11 kilometres (6.8?mi) across. Each year the returning turtles dig between 6,000 and 15,000 nests, often returning to the same beach from where they hatched. Females usually mate every two to four years. Males on the other hand visit the breeding areas every year, attempting to mate.[76] Green sea turtles' mating is similar to other marine turtles. Female turtles control the process. A few populations practice polyandry, although this does not seem to benefit hatchlings.[77] After mating in the water, the female moves above the beach's high tide line where she digs a hole with her hind flippers and deposits her eggs. Litter size depends on the age of the female and species, but green turtle clutches range between 100 and 200. She then covers the nest with sand and returns to the sea.[78]\\r\\nAt around 45 to 75 days, the eggs hatch during the night and the hatchlings instinctively head directly into the water. This is the most dangerous time in a turtle's life. As they walk, predators such as gulls and crabs grab them. A significant percentage never make it to the ocean. Little is known of the initial life history of newly hatched sea turtles.[79] Juveniles spend three to five years in the open ocean before they settle as still-immature juveniles into their permanent shallow-water lifestyle.[80][81] It is speculated that they take twenty to fifty years to reach sexual maturity. Individuals live up to eighty years in the wild.[78] They are among the larger sea turtles, many more than a meter long and weighing up to 300 kilograms (660?lb).[82]\\r\\nAquatic insects also spawn. Mayflies \\"are famed for their short adult life. Some species have under an hour to mate and lay their eggs before they die. Their pre-adult stage, known as the subimago, may be even shorter - perhaps lasting just a few minutes before they moult into their adult form. Therefore a mayfly spends most of its life as a nymph, hidden from view under the water.\\"[83]\\r\\nCorals can be both gonochoristic (unisexual) and hermaphroditic, each of which can reproduce sexually and asexually. Reproduction also allows corals to settle new areas.\\r\\nCorals predominantly reproduce sexually. 25% of hermatypic corals (stony corals) form single sex (gonochoristic) colonies, while the rest are hermaphroditic.[36] About 75% of all hermatypic corals \\"broadcast spawn\\" by releasing gameteseggs and sperminto the water to spread offspring. The gametes fuse during fertilization to form a microscopic larva called a planula, typically pink and elliptical in shape. A typical coral colony form several thousand larvae per year to overcome the odds against formation of a new colony.[84]\\r\\nPlanulae exhibit positive phototaxis, swimming towards light to reach surface waters where they drift and grow before descending to seek a hard surface to which they can attach and establish a new colony. They also exhibit positive sonotaxis, moving towards sounds that emanate from the reef and away from open water.[85] High failure rates afflict many stages of this process, and even though millions of gametes are released by each colony very few new colonies form. The time from spawning to settling is usually 2ÿ3 days, but can be up to 2 months.[86] The larva grows into a polyp and eventually becomes a coral head by asexual budding and growth.\\r\\nSynchronous spawning is very typical on the coral reef and often, even when multiple species are present, all corals spawn on the same night. This synchrony is essential so that male and female gametes can meet. Corals must rely on environmental cues, varying from species to species, to determine the proper time to release gametes into the water. The cues involve lunar changes, sunset time, and possibly chemical signalling.[36] Synchronous spawning may form hybrids and is perhaps involved in coral speciation.[87] In some places the spawn can be visually dramatic, clouding the usually clear water with gametes, typically at night.\\r\\nCorals use two methods for sexual reproduction, which differ in whether the female gametes are released:\\r\\nFungi are not plants, and require different conditions for optimal growth. Plants develop through photosynthesis, a process that converts atmospheric carbon dioxide into carbohydrates, especially cellulose. While sunlight provides an energy source for plants, mushrooms derive all of their energy and growth materials from their growth medium, through biochemical decomposition processes. This does not mean that light is an unnecessary requirement, since some fungi use light as a signal to induce fruiting. However, all the materials for growth must already be present in the growth medium. Instead of seeds, mushrooms reproduce sexually during underground growth, and asexually through spores. Either of these can be contaminated with airborne microorganisms, which will interfere with mushroom growth and prevent a healthy crop. Mycelium, or actively growing mushroom culture, is placed on growth substrate to seed or introduce mushrooms to grow on a substrate. This is also known as inoculation, spawning or adding spawn. Its main advantages are to reduce chances of contamination while giving mushrooms a firm beginning.[89][90]\\r\\nSpawning brittle star\\r\\nHead of female krill with her brood sac\\r\\nSpawning sockeye salmon\\r\\nDead salmon after spawning\\r\\nThese lagoons, connected to the River Tees, provide a quiet backwater for fish to spawn and to take refuge in times of high water levels\\r\\nIn the middle of this weir is a fish ladder, which allows trout and salmon to pass the weir to go upriver to spawn.","input":"How many eggs the fish produces each time?"},{"output":"Nabi Tajima","context":"This is a list of tables of the oldest people in the world in ordinal ranks.

In biological terms, human development entails growth from a one-celled zygote to an adult human being. Fertilisation occurs when the sperm cell successfully enters and fuses with an egg cell (ovum). The genetic material of the sperm and egg then combine to form a single cell called a zygote and the germinal stage of prenatal development commences.[1] Embryogenesis covers the first eight weeks of development; at the beginning of the ninth week the embryo is termed a fetus. Human embryology is the study of this development during the first eight weeks after fertilisation. The normal period of gestation (pregnancy) is nine months or 38 weeks.\\r\\nThe germinal stage refers to the time from fertilization through the development of the early embryo until implantation is completed in the uterus. The germinal stage takes around 10 days.[2] During this stage, the zygote begins to divide, in a process called cleavage. A blastocyst is then formed and implanted in the uterus. Embryogenesis continues with the next stage of gastrulation, when the three germ layers of the embryo form in a process called histogenesis, and the processes of neurulation and organogenesis follow.\\r\\nIn comparison to the embryo, the fetus has more recognizable external features and a more complete set of developing organs. The entire process of embryogenesis involves coordinated spatial and temporal changes in gene expression, cell growth and cellular differentiation. A nearly identical process occurs in other species, especially among chordates.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFertilization takes place when the spermatozoon has successfully entered the ovum and the two sets of genetic material carried by the gametes fuse together, resulting in the zygote (a single diploid cell). This usually takes place in the ampulla of one of the fallopian tubes. The zygote contains the combined genetic material carried by both the male and female gametes which consists of the 23 chromosomes from the nucleus of the ovum and the 23 chromosomes from the nucleus of the sperm. The 46 chromosomes undergo changes prior to the mitotic division which leads to the formation of the embryo having two cells.\\r\\nSuccessful fertilization is enabled by three processes, which also act as controls to ensure species-specificity. The first is that of chemotaxis which directs the movement of the sperm towards the ovum. Secondly there is an adhesive compatibility between the sperm and the egg. With the sperm adhered to the ovum, the third process of acrosomal reaction takes place; the front part of the spermatozoan head is capped by an acrosome which contains digestive enzymes to break down the zona pellucida and allow its entry.[3] The entry of the sperm causes calcium to be released which blocks entry to other sperm cells. A parallel reaction takes place in the ovum called the zona reaction. This sees the release of cortical granules that release enzymes which digest sperm receptor proteins, thus preventing polyspermy. The granules also fuse with the plasma membrane and modify the zona pellucida in such a way as to prevent further sperm entry.\\r\\nThe beginning of the cleavage process is marked when the zygote divides through mitosis into two cells. This mitosis continues and the first two cells divide into four cells, then into eight cells and so on. Each division takes from 12 to 24 hours. The zygote is large compared to any other cell and undergoes cleavage without any overall increase in size. This means that with each successive subdivision, the ratio of nuclear to cytoplasmic material increases.[4] Initially the dividing cells, called blastomeres (blastos Greek for sprout), are undifferentiated and aggregated into a sphere enclosed within the membrane of glycoproteins (termed the zona pellucida) of the ovum. When eight blastomeres have formed they begin to develop gap junctions, enabling them to develop in an integrated way and co-ordinate their response to physiological signals and environmental cues.[5]\\r\\nWhen the cells number around sixteen the solid sphere of cells within the zona pellucida is referred to as a morula[6] At this stage the cells start to bind firmly together in a process called compaction, and cleavage continues as cellular differentiation.\\r\\nCleavage itself is the first stage in blastulation, the process of forming the blastocyst. Cells differentiate into an outer layer of cells (collectively called the trophoblast) and an inner cell mass. With further compaction the individual outer blastomeres, the trophoblasts, become indistinguishable. They are still enclosed within the zona pellucida. This compaction serves to make the structure watertight, containing the fluid that the cells will later secrete. The inner mass of cells differentiate to become embryoblasts and polarise at one end. They close together and form gap junctions, which facilitate cellular communication. This polarisation leaves a cavity, the blastocoel, creating a structure that is now termed the blastocyst. (In animals other than mammals, this is called the blastula.) The trophoblasts secrete fluid into the blastocoel. The resulting increase in size of the blastocyst causes it to hatch through the zone pellucida, which then disintegrates.[7][4]\\r\\nThe inner cell mass will give rise to the embryo proper, the amnion, yolk sac and allantois, while the fetal part of the placenta will form from the outer trophoblast layer. The embryo plus its membranes is called the conceptus, and by this stage the conceptus has reached the uterus. The zona pellucida ultimately disappears completely, and the now exposed cells of the trophoblast allow the blastocyst to attach itself to the endometrium, where it will implant. The formation of the hypoblast and epiblast, which are the two main layers of the bilaminar germ disc, occurs at the beginning of the second week.[8] Either the embryoblast or the trophoblast will turn into two sub-layers.[9] The inner cells will turn into the hypoblast layer, which will surround the other layer, called the epiblast, and these layers will form the embryonic disc that will develop into the embryo.[8][9] The trophoblast will also develop two sub-layers: the cytotrophoblast, which is front of the syncytiotrophoblast, which in turn lies within the endometrium.[8] Next, another layer called the exocoelomic membrane or Heusers membrane will appear and surround the cytotrophoblast, as well as the primitive yolk sac.[9] The syncytiotrophoblast will grow and will enter a phase called lacunar stage, in which some vacuoles will appear and be filled by blood in the following days.[8][9] The development of the yolk sac starts with the hypoblastic flat cells that form the exocoelomic membrane, which will coat the inner part of the cytotrophoblast to form the primitive yolk sac. An erosion of the endothelial lining of the maternal capillaries by the syncytiotrophoblastic cells of the sinusoids will form where the blood will begin to penetrate and flow through the trophoblast to give rise to the uteroplacental circulation.[10][11] Subsequently new cells derived from yolk sac will be established between trophoblast and exocelomic membrane and will give rise to extra-embryonic mesoderm, which will form the chorionic cavity.[9]\\r\\nAt the end of the second week of development, some cells of the trophoblast penetrate and form rounded columns into the syncytiotrophoblast. These columns are known as primary villi. At the same time, other migrating cells form into the exocelomic cavity a new cavity named the secondary or definitive yolk sac, smaller than the primitive yolk sac.[9][10]\\r\\nAfter ovulation, the endometrial lining becomes transformed into a secretory lining in preparation of accepting the embryo. It becomes thickened, with its secretory glands becoming elongated, and is increasingly vascular. This lining of the uterine cavity (or womb) is now known as the decidua, and it produces a great number of large decidual cells in its increased interglandular tissue. The trophoblast then differentiates into an inner layer, the cytotrophoblast, and an outer layer, the syncytiotrophoblast. The cytotrophoblast contains cuboidal epithelial cells and is the source of dividing cells, and the syncytiotrophoblast is a syncytial layer without cell boundaries.\\r\\nThe syncytiotrophoblast implants the blastocyst in the decidual epithelium by projections of chorionic villi, forming the embryonic part of the placenta. The placenta develops once the blastocyst is implanted, connecting the embryo to the uterine wall. The decidua here is termed the decidua basalis; it lies between the blastocyst and the myometrium and forms the maternal part of the placenta. The implantation is assisted by hydrolytic enzymes that erode the epithelium. The syncytiotrophoblast also produces human chorionic gonadotropin, a hormone that stimulates the release of progesterone from the corpus luteum. Progesterone enriches the uterus with a thick lining of blood vessels and capillaries so that it can oxygenate and sustain the developing embryo. The uterus liberates sugar from stored glycogen from its cells to nourish the embryo.[12] The villi begin to branch and contain blood vessels of the embryo. Other villi, called terminal or free villi, exchange nutrients. The embryo is joined to the trophoblastic shell by a narrow connecting stalk that develops into the umbilical cord to attach the placenta to the embryo.[9][13] Arteries in the decidua are remodelled to increase the maternal blood flow into the intervillous spaces of the placenta, allowing gas exchange and the transfer of nutrients to the embryo. Waste products from the embryo will diffuse across the placenta.\\r\\nAs the syncytiotrophoblast starts to penetrate the uterine wall, the inner cell mass (embryoblast) also develops. The inner cell mass is the source of embryonic stem cells, which are pluripotent and can develop into any one of the three germ layer cells.\\r\\nThe embryoblast forms an embryonic disc, which is a bilaminar disc of two layers, an upper layer called the epiblast (primitive ectoderm) and a lower layer called the hypoblast (primitive endoderm). The disc is stretched between what will become the amniotic cavity and the yolk sac. The epiblast is adjacent to the trophoblast and made of columnar cells; the hypoblast is closest to the blastocyst cavity and made of cuboidal cells. The epiblast migrates away from the trophoblast downwards, forming the amniotic cavity, the lining of which is formed from amnioblasts developed from the epiblast. The hypoblast is pushed down and forms the yolk sac (exocoelomic cavity) lining. Some hypoblast cells migrate along the inner cytotrophoblast lining of the blastocoel, secreting an extracellular matrix along the way. These hypoblast cells and extracellular matrix are called Heuser's membrane (or the exocoelomic membrane), and they cover the blastocoel to form the yolk sac (or exocoelomic cavity). Cells of the epiblast migrate along the outer edges of this reticulum and form the extraembryonic mesoderm; this disrupts the extraembryonic reticulum. Soon pockets form in the reticulum, which ultimately coalesce to form the chorionic cavity or extraembryonic coelom.\\r\\nThe primitive streak, a linear band of cells formed by the migrating epiblast, appears, and this marks the beginning of gastrulation, which takes place around the seventeenth day (week 3) after fertilisation. The process of gastrulation reorganises the two-layer embryo into a three-layer embryo, and also gives the embryo its specific head-to-tail, and front-to-back orientation, by way of the primitive streak which establishes bilateral symmetry. A primitive node (or primitive knot) forms in front of the primitive streak which is the organiser of neurulation. A primitive pit forms as a depression in the centre of the primitive node which connects to the notochord which lies directly underneath. The node has arisen from epiblasts of the amniotic cavity floor, and it is this node that induces the formation of the neural plate which serves as the basis for the nervous system. The neural plate will form opposite the primitive streak from ectodermal tissue which thickens and flattens into the neural plate. The epiblast in that region moves down into the streak at the location of the primitive pit where the process called ingression, which leads to the formation of the mesoderm takes place. This ingression sees the cells from the epiblast move into the primitive streak in an epithelial-mesenchymal transition; epithelial cells become mesenchymal stem cells, multipotent stromal cells that can differentiate into various cell types. The hypoblast is pushed out of the way and goes on to form the amnion.The epiblast keeps moving and forms a second layer, the mesoderm. The epiblast has now differentiated into the three germ layers of the embryo, so that the bilaminar disc is now a trilaminar disc, the gastrula.\\r\\nThe three germ layers are the ectoderm, mesoderm and endoderm, and are formed as three overlapping flat discs. It is from these three layers that all the structures and organs of the body will be derived through the processes of somitogenesis, histogenesis and organogenesis.[14] The embryonic endoderm is formed by invagination of epiblastic cells that migrate to the hypoblast, while the mesoderm is formed by the cells that develop between the epiblast and endoderm. In general, all germ layers will derive from the epiblast.[9][13] The upper layer of ectoderm will give rise to the outermost layer of skin, central and peripheral nervous systems, eyes, inner ear, and many connective tissues.[15] The middle layer of mesoderm will give rise to the heart and the beginning of the circulatory system as well as the bones, muscles and kidneys. The inner layer of endoderm will serve as the starting point for the development of the lungs, intestine, thyroid, pancreas and bladder.\\r\\nFollowing ingression, a blastopore develops where the cells have ingressed, in one side of the embryo and it deepens to become the archenteron, the first formative stage of the gut. As in all deuterostomes, the blastopore becomes the anus whilst the gut tunnels through the embryo to the other side where the opening becomes the mouth. With a functioning digestive tube, gastrulation is now completed and the next stage of neurulation can begin.\\r\\nFollowing gastrulation, the ectoderm gives rise to epithelial and neural tissue, and the gastrula is now referred to as the neurula. The neural plate that has formed as a thickened plate from the ectoderm, continues to broaden and its ends start to fold upwards as neural folds. Neurulation refers to this folding process whereby the neural plate is transformed into the neural tube, and this takes place during the fourth week. They fold, along a shallow neural groove which has formed as a dividing median line in the neural plate. This deepens as the folds continue to gain height, when they will meet and close together at the neural crest. The cells that migrate through the most cranial part of the primitive line form the paraxial mesoderm, which will give rise to the somitomeres that in the process of somitogenesis will differentiate into somites that will form the sclerotome, the syndetome,[16] the myotome and the dermatome to form cartilage and bone, tendons, dermis (skin), and muscle. The intermediate mesoderm gives rise to the urogenital tract and consists of cells that migrate from the middle region of the primitive line. Other cells migrate through the caudal part of the primitive line and form the lateral mesoderm, and those cells migrating by the most caudal part contribute to the extraembryonic mesoderm.[9][13]\\r\\nThe embryonic disc begins flat and round, but eventually elongates to have a wider cephalic part and narrow-shaped caudal end.[8] At the beginning, the primitive line extends in cephalic direction and 18 days after fertilization returns caudally until it disappears. In the cephalic portion, the germ layer shows specific differentiation at the beginning of the 4th week, while in the caudal portion it occurs at the end of the 4th week.[9] Cranial and caudal neuropores become progressively smaller until they close completely (by day 26) forming the neural tube.[17]\\r\\nLate in the fourth week, the superior part of the neural tube flexes at the level of the future midbrainthe mesencephalon. Above the mesencephalon is the prosencephalon (future forebrain) and beneath it is the rhombencephalon (future hindbrain).\\r\\nCranial neural crest cells migrate to the pharyngeal arches as neural stem cells, where they develop in the process of neurogenesis into neurons.\\r\\nThe optical vesicle (which eventually becomes the optic nerve, retina and iris) forms at the basal plate of the prosencephalon. The alar plate of the prosencephalon expands to form the cerebral hemispheres (the telencephalon) whilst its basal plate becomes the diencephalon. Finally, the optic vesicle grows to form an optic outgrowth.\\r\\nHaematopoietic stem cells that give rise to all the blood cells develop from the mesoderm.\\r\\nThe development of the organs starts during the third to eighth weeks of embryogenesis.\\r\\nThe heart is the first functional organ to develop and starts to beat and pump blood at around 21 or 22 days.[18] Cardiac myoblasts and blood islands in the splanchnopleuric mesenchyme on each side of the neural plate, give rise to the cardiogenic region.[9]:165This is a horseshoe-shaped area near to the head of the embryo. By day 19, following cell signalling, two strands begin to form as tubes in this region, as a lumen develops within them. These two endocardial tubes grow and by day 21 have migrated towards each other and fused to form a single primitive heart tube, the tubular heart. This is enabled by the folding of the embryo which pushes the tubes into the thoracic cavity.[19]\\r\\nAlso at the same time that the tubes are forming, vasculogenesis (the development of the circulatory system) has begun. This starts on day 18 with cells in the splanchnopleuric mesoderm differentiating into angioblasts that develop into flattened endothelial cells. These join to form small vesicles called angiocysts which join up to form long vessels called angioblastic cords. These cords develop into a pervasive network of plexuses in the formation of the vascular network. This network grows by the additional budding and sprouting of new vessels in the process of angiogenesis.[19]\\r\\nThe tubular heart quickly forms five distinct regions. From head to tail, these are the infundibulum, bulbus cordis, primitive ventricle, primitive atrium, and the sinus venosus. Initially, all venous blood flows into the sinus venosus, and is propelled from tail to head to the truncus arteriosus. This will divide to form the aorta and pulmonary artery; the bulbus cordis will develop into the right (primitive) ventricle; the primitive ventricle will form the left ventricle; the primitive atrium will become the front parts of the left and right atria and their appendages, and the sinus venosus will develop into the posterior part of the right atrium, the sinoatrial node and the coronary sinus.[18]\\r\\nCardiac looping begins to shape the heart as one of the processes of morphogenesis, and this completes by the end of the fourth week. Programmed cell death (apoptosis) is involved in this process, at the joining surfaces enabling fusion to take place.[19] In the middle of the fourth week, the sinus venosus receives blood from the three major veins: the vitelline, the umbilical and the common cardinal veins.\\r\\nDuring the first two months of development, the interatrial septum begins to form. This septum divides the primitive atrium into a right and a left atrium. Firstly it starts as a crescent-shaped piece of tissue which grows downwards as the septum primum. The crescent shape prevents the complete closure of the atria allowing blood to be shunted from the right to the left atrium through the opening known as the ostium primum. This closes with further development of the system but before it does, a second opening (the ostium secundum) begins to form in the upper atrium enabling the continued shunting of blood.[19]\\r\\nA second septum (the septum secundum) begins to form to the right of the septum primum. This also leaves a small opening, the foramen ovale which is continuous with the previous opening of the ostium secundum. The septum primum is reduced to a small flap that acts as the valve of the foramen ovale and this remains until its closure at birth. Between the ventricles the septum inferius also forms which develops into the muscular interventricular septum.[19]\\r\\nThe digestive system starts to develop from the third week and by the twelfth week, the organs have correctly positioned themselves.\\r\\nFrom the third to the eighth week the face and neck develop.\\r\\nIn the fourth week limb development begins.\\r\\nToxic exposures during the germinal stage may cause prenatal death resulting in a miscarriage, but do not cause developmental defects. However, toxic exposures in the embryonic period can be the cause of major congenital malformations, since the precursors of the major organ systems are now developing.\\r\\nEach cell of the preimplantation embryo has the potential to form all of the different cell types in the developing embryo. This cell potency means that some cells can be removed from the preimplantation embryo and the remaining cells will compensate for their absence. This has allowed the development of a technique known as preimplantation genetic diagnosis, whereby a small number of cells from the preimplantation embryo created by IVF, can be removed by biopsy and subjected to genetic diagnosis. This allows embryos that are not affected by defined genetic diseases to be selected and then transferred to the mother's uterus.\\r\\nSacrococcygeal teratomas, tumours formed from different types of tissue, that can form, are thought to be related to primitive streak remnants, which ordinarily disappear.[8][9][11]\\r\\nFirst arch syndromes are congenital disorders of facial deformities, caused by the failure of neural crest cells to migrate to the first pharyngeal arch.\\r\\nSpina bifida a congenital disorder is the result of the incomplete closure of the neural tube.\\r\\nVertically transmitted infections can be passed from the mother to the unborn child at any stage of its development.\\r\\nHypoxia a condition of inadequate oxygen supply can be a serious consequence of a preterm or premature birth.\\r\\nRepresenting different stages of embryogenesis\\r\\nEarly stage of the gastrulation process\\r\\nPhase of the gastrulation process\\r\\nTop of the form of the embryo\\r\\nEstablishment of embryo medium\\r\\nSpinal cord at 5 weeks\\r\\nHead and neck at 32 days","input":"What is the first cell of a human called?"},{"output":"Bill de Blasio","context":"De Blasio\\r\\nMalliotakis\\r\\nBill de Blasio\\r\\nDemocratic\\r\\nBill de Blasio\\r\\nDemocratic\\r\\nAn election for Mayor of New York City was held on November 7, 2017.

The candidates were incumbent Mayor, Bill De Blasio and former NYC Council Member, Sal Albanese. Both candidates had democratic primaries on August 23rd[8] and on September 6th.[9]\\r\\nThe first general election debate was held on October 10th featuring Democratic nominee and incumbent NYC Mayor, Bill De Blasio, Republican challenger, Nicole Malliotakis, and Independent candidate, Bo Dietl.[10] The second general election debate was held on November 1st.[11]\\r\\nBesides the Democratic and Republican parties, the Conservative, Green, Working Families, Independence, Reform, and Women's Equality parties are qualified New York parties.

Sculptor Gutzon Borglum created the sculpture's design and oversaw the project's execution from 1927 to 1941 with the help of his son, Lincoln Borglum, and Chief Carver Luigi del Bianco.[2][3] Mount Rushmore features 60-foot (18?m) sculptures of the heads of four United States presidents: George Washington (1732ÿ1799), Thomas Jefferson (1743ÿ1826), Theodore Roosevelt (1858ÿ1919), and Abraham Lincoln (1809ÿ1865).[4] The memorial park covers 1,278.45 acres (2.00?sq?mi; 5.17?km2)[5] and is 5,725 feet (1,745?m) above sea level.[6]\\r\\nSouth Dakota historian Doane Robinson is credited with conceiving the idea of carving the likenesses of famous people into the Black Hills region of South Dakota in order to promote tourism in the region. Robinson's initial idea was to sculpt the Needles; however, Gutzon Borglum rejected the Needles because of the poor quality of the granite and strong opposition from Native American groups. They settled on Mount Rushmore, which also has the advantage of facing southeast for maximum sun exposure. Robinson wanted it to feature American West heroes like Lewis and Clark, Red Cloud,[7] and Buffalo Bill Cody,[8] but Borglum decided the sculpture should have broader appeal and chose the four presidents.\\r\\nAfter securing federal funding through the enthusiastic sponsorship of \\"Mount Rushmore's great political patron\\" U.S. Senator Peter Norbeck,[9] construction on the memorial began in 1927, and the presidents' faces were completed between 1934 and 1939. Upon Gutzon Borglum's death in March 1941, his son Lincoln Borglum took over as leader of the construction project. Each president was originally to be depicted from head to waist. Lack of funding forced construction to end in late October 1941.[10]\\r\\nMount Rushmore has become an iconic symbol of the United States, and it has appeared in works of fiction, as well as being discussed or depicted in other popular works. It attracts over two million visitors annually.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOriginally known to the Lakota Sioux as \\"The Six Grandfathers\\",[11] the mountain was renamed after Charles E. Rushmore, a prominent New York lawyer, during an expedition in 1885.[12] At first, the project of carving Rushmore was undertaken to increase tourism in the Black Hills region of South Dakota. After long negotiations involving a Congressional delegation and President Calvin Coolidge, the project received Congressional approval. The carving started in 1927 and ended in 1941 with no fatalities.[13]\\r\\nAs Six Grandfathers, the mountain was part of the route that Lakota leader Black Elk took in a spiritual journey that culminated at Black Elk Peak. Following a series of military campaigns from 1876 to 1878, the United States asserted control over the area, a claim that is still disputed on the basis of the 1868 Treaty of Fort Laramie (see section \\"Controversy\\" below). Among American settlers, the peak was known variously as Cougar Mountain, Sugarloaf Mountain, Slaughterhouse Mountain, and Keystone Cliffs. It was named Mount Rushmore during a prospecting expedition by Charles Rushmore, David Swanzey (husband of Carrie Ingalls), and Bill Challis.[14]\\r\\nHistorian Doane Robinson conceived the idea for Mount Rushmore in 1923 to promote tourism in South Dakota. In 1924, Robinson persuaded sculptor Gutzon Borglum to travel to the Black Hills region to ensure the carving could be accomplished. Borglum had been involved in sculpting the Confederate Memorial Carving, a massive bas-relief memorial to Confederate leaders on Stone Mountain in Georgia, but was in disagreement with the officials there.[15]\\r\\nThe original plan was to make the carvings in granite pillars known as the Needles. However, Borglum realized that the eroded Needles were too thin to support sculpting. He chose Mount Rushmore, a grander location, partly because it faced southeast and enjoyed maximum exposure to the sun. Borglum said upon seeing Mount Rushmore, \\"America will march along that skyline.\\"[16] Congress authorized the Mount Rushmore National Memorial Commission on March 3, 1925.[16] President Coolidge insisted that, along with Washington, two Republicans and one Democrat be portrayed.[17]\\r\\nBetween October 4, 1927, and October 31, 1941, Gutzon Borglum and 400 workers[18] sculpted the colossal 60 foot (18?m) high carvings of U.S. presidents George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Theodore Roosevelt, and Abraham Lincoln to represent the first 130 years of American history. These presidents were selected by Borglum because of their role in preserving the Republic and expanding its territory.[16][19] The carving of Mount Rushmore involved the use of dynamite, followed by the process of \\"honeycombing\\", a process where workers drill holes close together, allowing small pieces to be removed by hand.[20] In total, about 450,000 short tons (410,000?t) of rock were blasted off the mountainside.[21] The image of Thomas Jefferson was originally intended to appear in the area at Washington's right, but after the work there was begun, the rock was found to be unsuitable, so the work on the Jefferson figure was dynamited, and a new figure was sculpted to Washington's left.[16]\\r\\nThe Chief Carver of the mountain was Luigi del Bianco, artisan and headstone carver in Port Chester, NY. Del Bianco emigrated to the U.S. from Friuli in Italy, and was chosen to work on this project because of his remarkable skill at etching emotions and personality into his carved portraits.[2][3]\\r\\nIn 1933, the National Park Service took Mount Rushmore under its jurisdiction. Julian Spotts helped with the project by improving its infrastructure. For example, he had the tram upgraded so it could reach the top of Mount Rushmore for the ease of workers. By July 4, 1934, Washington's face had been completed and was dedicated. The face of Thomas Jefferson was dedicated in 1936, and the face of Abraham Lincoln was dedicated on September 17, 1937. In 1937, a bill was introduced in Congress to add the head of civil-rights leader Susan B. Anthony, but a rider was passed on an appropriations bill requiring federal funds be used to finish only those heads that had already been started at that time.[22] In 1939, the face of Theodore Roosevelt was dedicated.\\r\\nThe Sculptor's Studio?ÿ a display of unique plaster models and tools related to the sculpting?ÿ was built in 1939 under the direction of Borglum. Borglum had planned to make a secret room behind the hairline of Abraham Lincoln which was supposed to be a doorway to a chamber originally intended to hold some of America's most treasured documents but was left unfinished due to his death.[23] Borglum died from an embolism in March 1941. His son, Lincoln Borglum, continued the project. Originally, it was planned that the figures would be carved from head to waist,[24] but insufficient funding forced the carving to end. Borglum had also planned a massive panel in the shape of the Louisiana Purchase commemorating in eight-foot-tall gilded letters the Declaration of Independence, U.S. Constitution, Louisiana Purchase, and seven other territorial acquisitions from Alaska to Texas to the Panama Canal Zone.[19] In total, the entire project cost US$989,992.32.[25] Unusually for a project of such size, no workers died during the carving.[26]\\r\\nOn October 15, 1966, Mount Rushmore was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. A 500-word essay giving the history of the United States by Nebraska student William Andrew Burkett was selected as the college-age group winner in a 1934 competition, and that essay was placed on the Entablature on a bronze plate in 1973.[22][27] In 1991, President George H. W. Bush officially dedicated Mount Rushmore.[28]\\r\\nIn a canyon behind the carved faces is a chamber, cut only 70 feet (21?m) into the rock, containing a vault with sixteen porcelain enamel panels. The panels include the text of the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution, biographies of the four presidents and Borglum, and the history of the U.S. The chamber was created as the entrance-way to a planned \\"Hall of Records\\"; the vault was installed in 1998.[29]\\r\\nTen years of redevelopment work culminated with the completion of extensive visitor facilities and sidewalks in 1998, such as a Visitor Center, the Lincoln Borglum Museum, and the Presidential Trail. Maintenance of the memorial requires mountain climbers to monitor and seal cracks annually. Due to budget constraints, the memorial is not regularly cleaned to remove lichens. However, on July 8, 2005, Alfred K?rcher GmbH, a German manufacturer of pressure washing and steam cleaning machines, conducted a free cleanup operation which lasted several weeks, using pressurized water at over 200?F (93?C).[30]\\r\\nThe flora and fauna of Mount Rushmore are similar to those of the rest of the Black Hills region of South Dakota. Birds including the turkey vulture, bald eagle, hawk, and meadowlark fly around Mount Rushmore, occasionally making nesting spots in the ledges of the mountain. Smaller birds, including songbirds, nuthatches, and woodpeckers, inhabit the surrounding pine forests.[31] Terrestrial mammals include the mouse, least chipmunk, red squirrel, skunk, porcupine, raccoon, beaver, badger, coyote, bighorn sheep, bobcat, elk, mule deer, yellow-bellied marmot, and American bison.[31][32] The striped chorus frog, western chorus frog, and northern leopard frog also inhabit the area,[33] along with several species of snake. Grizzly Bear Brook and Starling Basin Brook, the two streams in the memorial, support fish such as the longnose dace and the brook trout.[citation needed] Mountain goats are not indigenous to the region. Those living near Mount Rushmore are descendents of a tribe that Canada gifted to Custer State Park in 1924, which later escaped.[31][34][35]\\r\\nAt lower elevations, coniferous trees, mainly the ponderosa pine, surround most of the monument, providing shade from the sun. Other trees include the bur oak, the Black Hills spruce, and the cottonwood. Nine species of shrubs grow near Mount Rushmore. There is also a wide variety of wildflowers, including especially the snapdragon, sunflower, and violet. Towards higher elevations, plant life becomes sparser.[35] However, only approximately five percent of the plant species found in the Black Hills are indigenous to the region.[36]\\r\\nThe area receives about 18 inches (460?mm) of precipitation on average per year, enough to support abundant animal and plant life. Trees and other plants help to control surface runoff. Dikes, seeps, and springs help to dam up water that is flowing downhill, providing watering spots for animals. In addition, stones like sandstone and limestone help to hold groundwater, creating aquifers.[37]\\r\\nA study of the fire scars present in tree ring samples indicates that forest fires occur in the ponderosa forests surrounding Mount Rushmore around every 27 years. Large fires are not common. Most events have been ground fires that serve to clear forest debris.[38] The area is a climax community. Recent[when?] pine beetle infestations have threatened the forest.[32]\\r\\nMount Rushmore is largely composed of granite. The memorial is carved on the northwest margin of the Black Elk Peak granite batholith in the Black Hills of South Dakota, so the geologic formations of the heart of the Black Hills region are also evident at Mount Rushmore. The batholith magma intruded into the pre-existing mica schist rocks during the Proterozoic, 1.6 billion years ago.[39] Coarse grained pegmatite dikes are associated with the granite intrusion of Black Elk Peak and are visibly lighter in color, thus explaining the light-colored streaks on the foreheads of the presidents.\\r\\nThe Black Hills granites were exposed to erosion during the Neoproterozoic, but were later buried by sandstone and other sediments during the Cambrian. Remaining buried throughout the Paleozoic, they were re-exposed again during the Laramide orogeny around 70 million years ago.[39] The Black Hills area was uplifted as an elongated geologic dome.[40] Subsequent erosion stripped the granite of the overlying sediments and the softer adjacent schist. Some schist does remain and can be seen as the darker material just below the sculpture of Washington.\\r\\nThe tallest mountain in the region is Black Elk Peak (7,242?ft or 2,207?m). Borglum selected Mount Rushmore as the site for several reasons. The rock of the mountain is composed of smooth, fine-grained granite. The durable granite erodes only 1 inch (25?mm) every 10,000 years, thus was more than sturdy enough to support the sculpture and its long-term exposure.[16] The mountain's height of 5,725 feet (1,745?m) above sea level[6] made it suitable, and because it faces the southeast, the workers also had the advantage of sunlight for most of the day.\\r\\nThe Mount Rushmore area is underlain by well drained alfisol soils of very gravelly loam (Mocmount) to silt loam (Buska) texture, brown to dark grayish brown.[41]\\r\\nMount Rushmore has a humid continental climate (Dwb in the Koeppen climate classification). It is inside a USDA Plant Hardiness Zone of 5a, meaning certain plant life in the area can withstand a low temperature of no less than ?20?F (?29?C).[42]\\r\\nThe two wettest months of the year are May and June. Orographic lift causes brief but strong afternoon thunderstorms during the summer.[43]\\r\\nTourism is South Dakota's second-largest industry, and Mount Rushmore is the state's top tourist attraction.[46] In 2012, 2,185,447 people visited the park.[1] In the 1950s and 1960s, Sioux Benjamin Black Elk (son of medicine man Black Elk) was the \\"Fifth Face of Mount Rushmore\\", posing for photographs with thousands of tourists. He became one of the most photographed people in the world.[47]\\r\\nThe ongoing conservation of the site is overseen by the US National Park Service.[48] Physical efforts to conserve the monument have included replacement of the sealant applied originally by Gutzon Borglum, which had proved ineffective at providing water resistance (components include linseed oil, granite dust and white lead). A modern silicone replacement was used, disguised with granite dust.\\r\\nIn 1998, electronic monitoring devices were installed to track movement in the topology of the sculpture to an accuracy of 3?mm. The site has been subsequently digitally recorded using a terrestrial laser scanning methodology in 2009 as part of the international Scottish Ten project, providing a record of unprecedented resolution and accuracy to inform the conservation of the site. This data was made accessible online to be freely used by the wider community to aid further interpretation and public access.[49]\\r\\nThe United States seized the area from the Lakota tribe after the Great Sioux War of 1876. The Treaty of Fort Laramie from 1868 had previously granted the Black Hills to the Lakota in perpetuity. Members of the American Indian Movement led an occupation of the monument in 1971, naming it \\"Mount Crazy Horse\\". Among the participants were young activists, grandparents, children and Lakota holy man John Fire Lame Deer, who planted a prayer staff atop the mountain. Lame Deer said the staff formed a symbolic shroud over the presidents' faces \\"which shall remain dirty until the treaties concerning the Black Hills are fulfilled.\\"[50]\\r\\nIn 2004, the first Native American superintendent of the park, Gerard Baker, was appointed. Baker has stated that he will open up more \\"avenues of interpretation\\", and that the four presidents are \\"only one avenue and only one focus.\\"[51]\\r\\nThe Crazy Horse Memorial is being constructed elsewhere in the Black Hills to commemorate the famous Native American leader as a response to Mount Rushmore. It is said to be larger than Mount Rushmore and has the support of Lakota chiefs; the Crazy Horse Memorial Foundation has rejected offers of federal funds. However, this memorial is likewise the subject of controversy, even within the Native American community.[52]\\r\\nBecause of its fame as a monument, Mount Rushmore has been depicted in multiple places in popular culture. It is often depicted as a cover for a secret location; shown with faces removed or modified (as in Superman II), or added; or parodied. Trey Parker and Matt Stone used the location as the headquarters for their movie Team America: World Police. The memorial was also famously used as the location of the climactic chase scene in Alfred Hitchcock's 1959 movie North by Northwest.[53]\\r\\nOn August 11, 1952, the U.S. Post Office issued the Mount Rushmore Memorial commemorative stamp on the 25th anniversary of the dedication of the Mt. Rushmore National Memorial in the Black Hills of South Dakota.[54] On January 2, 1974, a 26-cent airmail stamp depicting the monument was also issued.[55]\\r\\nNotes\\r\\nFurther reading","input":"Who is on the mt. rushmore monument?"},{"output":"Ronald Joseph Ryan","context":"Ronald Joseph Ryan (21 February 1925 ÿ 3 February 1967) was the last person to be legally executed in Australia.

His three sisters were made wards of the state a year later when authorities declared them to be \\"neglected\\". His sisters were sent to the Good Shepherd Convent in Collingwood. Ryan absconded from Rupertswood in September 1939 and, with his half-brother George Thompson, worked in and around Balranald, New South Wales; spare money earned from sleeper cutting and kangaroo shooting was sent to his mother, who was looking after their sick, alcoholic father.[3][4]\\r\\nAt the age of 20, Ryan had saved enough money to rent a house in Balranald. He collected his mother and sisters and they lived together in this house. Ryan's father stayed in Melbourne and died a year later, aged 62, after a long battle with miners' disease, phthisis tuberculosis.[2][3][4]\\r\\nAged about 22, Ryan decided to join his brother, who was tomato farming near Tatura, Victoria. He started visiting Melbourne on weekends and during one of these weekend trips Ryan met his future wife, Dorothy Janet George. On 4 February 1950, Ryan married Dorothy at St Stephen's Anglican Church in Richmond, Victoria. He converted from Roman Catholicism to the Church of England to marry her. He converted back to Catholicism[5] shortly before his execution.[6] Dorothy was the daughter of the mayor of the Melbourne suburb of Hawthorn. Ryan and Dorothy had three daughters, Janice, Wendy and Rhonda. A fourth baby was stillborn.\\r\\nAfter spending a few months working for his father-in-law as a trainee mechanic, Ryan decided that more money could be made cutting timber near Marysville and Licola. When it was too wet to cut timber, Ryan got a job painting for the State Electricity Commission. By 1952 the Ryan family was living in Noojee.[7]\\r\\nTrouble with the law started when his rented house burnt down. Ryan was away for the weekend in Melbourne when the arsonist struck. The arsonist was caught and claimed that Ryan had put him up to it in order to claim insurance money. His first appearance in court was in Warragul in 1953 when he was acquitted on a charge of arson.[7]\\r\\nIn 1956 Ryan appeared in court for passing bad cheques in Dandenong. He was given a bond. His next appearance in court was after he issued a large number of forged cheques in Warrnambool. His partner was caught with the goods purchased with the bad cheques and handed Ryan over to the police. He received another good-behaviour bond after the arresting detective gave a favourable character reference on Ryan's behalf.[8]\\r\\nAfter being apprehended for robbery in April 1960, Ryan and his accomplices escaped from the Melbourne City Watch House but were recaptured several days later.[9] On 17 June 1960, Ryan pleaded guilty in the Melbourne Court of General Sessions to eight charges of breaking and stealing and one of escaping from legal custody. He was sentenced to eight and a half years imprisonment.[7]\\r\\nRyan first served prison time at Bendigo Prison. Here, under Ian Grindlay (who would later become the Governor of Pentridge Prison), he appeared to want to rehabilitate himself. His time in prison was productive and he exhibited a disciplined approach to study, completing his Leaving Certificate (the equivalent of 11 years of formal schooling).[10] He was studying for his Matriculation (the successful completion of 12 years of formal schooling) when he was released on parole in August 1963. He was regarded by the authorities as a model prisoner.[11]\\r\\nAfter working as a clerk for a couple of months, Ryan went to lunch and never returned. He had started robbing butcher shops and used explosives to blow their safes.[12]\\r\\nRyan and two accomplices were caught after a butcher shop robbery on 4 January 1964. He was charged with breaking and entering and theft offences on 6 January 1964. Bailed on 3 February 1964, Ryan skipped town and fled to New South Wales. He later admitted to nine robberies in New South Wales between 4 April and 11 July 1964. On a visit home on 14 July he was caught by Victoria Police in the early hours the next morning. On 13 November 1964 he received an eight-year prison sentence for breaking and entering. He was sent to Pentridge Prison.[1]\\r\\nAfter Ryan was sentenced to Pentridge Prison, he was placed in B Division where he met fellow prisoner Peter John Walker (who was serving a 12-year sentence for bank robbery). When Ryan was informed that his wife was seeking a divorce, he made a plan to escape from prison. Walker decided to go along with him. Ryan planned to take himself and his family and flee to Brazil, which did not have an extradition treaty with Australia.[1][10] At around 2:07?pm on Sunday, 19 December 1965, Ryan and Walker put the escape plan into effect. As prison officers were taking turns attending a staff Christmas party in the officers' mess hall, Ryan and Walker scaled a five-metre prison wall with the aid of two wooden benches, a hook and blankets. Running along the top of the wall to a prison watch tower, they overpowered prison warder Helmut Lange and took his M1 carbine rifle. Ryan threatened Lange and demanded he pull the lever to open the prison tower gate. Lange, however, deliberately pulled the wrong lever. Ryan, Walker and Lange then proceeded down the steps to the tower gate, but it would not open. At the bottom of the stairs was the night officers' lodge. Warder Fred Brown was returning from lunch to relieve Lange when he was confronted by the escapees. Brown did not resist. When Ryan realised Lange had tricked him, he jabbed the rifle into Lange's back and marched him back up the stairs so Lange could pull the correct lever to open the tower gate. The two escapees then exited through the gate into the prison car park.[1] To the escapees' dismay there were only two cars in the car park and one had a flat tyre.[13]\\r\\nHowever, they did encounter the prison chaplain, Brigadier James Hewitt of the Salvation Army, in the car park. The escapees grabbed Hewitt and used him as a shield. Ryan, armed with the rifle, pointed it at Hewitt and demanded his car. Prison Officer Bennett in Tower 2 saw the prisoners. Ryan called to Bennett to throw down his rifle. Bennett ducked out of sight and then got his rifle.[1]\\r\\nWhen Hewitt told Ryan he did not have his car that day, Ryan rifle-butted him in the head causing serious injuries.[14] Les Watt, a petrol attendant who watched the escape from a petrol station on Sydney Rd, witnessed Ryan hitting Hewitt with the rifle.[15] The escapees then left the badly injured chaplain and Ryan ran out to Champ Street, directly in front of the south-west corner of the prison.[1]\\r\\nWalker went south across Church Street toward the adjacent Roman Catholic church in Sydney Road. Prison officer Bennett had his rifle aimed at Walker and ordered Walker to halt or he would shoot. Walker took cover behind a small wall that bordered the church.[13] The prison alarm was raised by Warder Lange, and it began to blow loudly, indicating a prison escape. Unarmed warders, Wallis, Mitchinson and Paterson, came running out of the prison's main gate and onto the street.[1][16]\\r\\nGeorge Hodson, who had been having lunch in the prison officers' mess near the Number 1 post, responded to Lange's whistle. Bennett shouted to Hodson that he had a prisoner, Walker, pinned down behind the low church boundary wall. Hodson headed for Walker and picked up Walker's pipe. Hodson grappled with Walker but the escapee managed to break free so Hodson began hitting him over his head with the piece of pipe. Walker was a faster runner than Hodson, but Hodson continued to chase after Walker with the pipe still in his hand. Both men ran towards the armed Ryan.[1][16]\\r\\nMeanwhile, confusion and noise were increasing around the busy intersection of Sydney Road and O'Hea Street and across to the Champ Street intersection, with Ryan waving the rifle around trying to get cars to stop so he could commandeer them, and people ducking for cover between cars.[1][16]\\r\\nFrank and Pauline Jeziorski were travelling south on Champ Street and had slowed to give way to traffic on Sydney Rd when Ryan armed with the rifle appeared in front of their car. Ryan threatened the driver and his passenger wife to get out of their car. The driver, Frank Jeziorski, turned his car off, put it in neutral then got out of his vehicle. Ryan got in via the driver's door. Surpisingly, Pauline Jeziorski refused to get out of the car. She was persuaded by Ryan to get out, only to go back in the car to get her handbag.[17] Paterson, realising Ryan was armed, returned inside the prison to get a rifle.[18]\\r\\nWarder William Mitchinson was first to reach the car and grabbed Ryan through the driver's window, he told Ryan \\"the game's up\\".[19] Warder Thomas Wallis who was following, ran to Pauline Jeziorski's side of the car. He grabbed her and pulled her away from the car.[18]\\r\\nIn frustration, Ryan forced Mitchinson to back off, then got out of the passenger's side door and noticed Walker running towards him, being chased by Hodson who was holding the pipe in his hand. Walker was shouting frantically to Ryan that prison guard William Bennett, standing on the Number 2 prison tower, had his rifle aimed at them. At this time, Hodson was chasing Walker,[1] Ryan took a couple of steps forward and raised his rifle and aimed it at Hodson.[19]\\r\\nGeorge Hodson fell to the ground. He had been struck by a single bullet, travelling from front to back. The bullet had exited through Hodson's back, about an inch lower than the point of entry in his right chest. Hodson died in the middle of Sydney Road. Paterson, now with a rifle, ran back outside and onto Champ Street. He decided he could not get a clear shot, so he stood on a low wall in the prison's front garden. He aimed his rifle at Ryan, and claimed he fired a shot in the air when a woman came into his line of sight.[1]\\r\\nRyan and Walker ran past the critically wounded Hodson and commandeered a blue Standard Vanguard sedan on Sydney Road from its driver, Brian Mullins. With Walker driving and Ryan a passenger, the car travelled through an adjacent service station and then west along O'Hea Street.[13]\\r\\nRyan and Walker successfully eluded their pursuers outside Pentridge Prison and drove away before changing cars. They then made their way south following the Moonee Ponds Creek to change cars again before hiding in a safe house in Kensington provided by Norman Harold Murray. The following day the men moved into Christine Aitken's flat in Ormond Rd, Elwood.\\r\\nThe prison escape dominated newspapers and other media. One newspaper reported that, \\"Ronald Ryan, serving time for burglary, seized a prison officer and shot him three times, twice in the chest and once in the back.\\"[20] Reports of their activities caused widespread anxiety.\\r\\nOn 23 December, Ryan (armed with the warden's rifle) and Walker robbed an ANZ bank in North Rd, Ormond. Ryan herded 13 people into the bank's strongroom and stole AS4500. A witness, June Crawford, told reporters, \\"a bandit told me 'This gun shot a man a few days ago.'\\"[21]\\r\\nOn 24 December 1965, the Victorian Government announced a S6,000 reward for information leading to the capture of Ryan and Walker. It was reported in The Age newspaper that the Chief Secretary and Attorney General, Arthur Rylah, had issued a warning to the escapees that the killing of Hodson during the prison escape was the worst Victoria had known and that the \\"Hanging Act was still in force.\\"[1]\\r\\nOn 24 December (Christmas Eve), there was a party at the flat.[1] A petty criminal, John Fisher, who knew Ryan, and Arthur Henderson (Aitken's boyfriend) were there. After all their beer had been consumed, Walker and Henderson left to find sly-grog in Albert Park for more drinks. An hour later Walker returned alone to the flat. He had killed Henderson in a Middle Park toilet block. Henderson was shot in the back of his head by Walker. The escapees left the flat and returned to Kensington. On 26 December, Aitken and another woman were charged with harbouring the criminals. They came forward after Henderson was killed and the escapees had left. The charges were later dropped. The pair returned to hiding in the basement of the house in Kensington. Murray was given money to buy a car in Sydney and return with it. Murray returned with the car with Queensland plates on 31 December (New Year's Eve). Ryan and Walker left for Sydney on 1 January 1966 (New Year's Day) and arrived on 2 January.[13]\\r\\nAfter arriving in Sydney, Ryan and Walker endeavoured to establish some safe houses, Ryan also wanted to make contact with a woman he knew when he was in Sydney years ago, she was not home but her daughter was.[18] Ryan made an arrangement to meet the woman and daughter at Concord Repatriation Hospital on the evening of 6 January. Unknown to Ryan the daughter recognised Ryan and tipped off the police. Acting on the information, Detective Inspector Ray \\"Gunner\\" Kelly was alerted about their presence. DI Kelly with a heavily armed contingent of 50 police officers and detectives set a trap for them. When the escapee's car pulled up near the hospital, Ryan walked over to a nearby telephone box, but it had been deliberately put out of order, so he walked over to a neighbouring shop and asked to use the phone there. The owner had been instructed to tell Ryan that his phone was also out of order, and as Ryan walked out of the shop he was tackled by six detectives, dropping a loaded .32 revolver that he had been carrying. At the same moment Det. Sgt Fred Krahe thrust a shotgun through the car window and held it at Walker's head, and he was captured without a struggle.[22] Ryan and Walker had been on the run for 19 days. In the boot of the car Police found 3 pistols, a shotgun and two rifles, all fully loaded, an axe, jemmy, two coils of rope, a hacksaw and two boiler suits.[18]\\r\\nRyan and Walker were extradited back to Melbourne. They were jointly tried for the murder of George Hodson. It is alleged that Ryan made three verbal confessions to police whilst being extradited to Melbourne. According to police, Ryan admitted to them he had shot prison officer Hodson. However, these verbal allegations were not signed by Ryan and he denied making such verbal or written confessions to anyone. The only signed document by Ryan was that he would give no verbal testimony.[23] Walker was also tried for the shooting murder of Arthur James Henderson during the period when he and Ryan were at large.\\r\\nOn 15 March 1966, the case of The Queen v. Ryan and Walker began in the Supreme Court of Victoria. The first day was spent choosing the make up of the jury. Ryan and Walker each exercised their legal right in objecting to twenty candidates.\\r\\nThe Crown's case presented no scientific evidence. Ryan's rifle was never scientifically tested by ballistic forensic experts to prove it had fired a shot at all. The fatal bullet was never recovered so no ballistic and no forensic evidence was possible to prove or disprove guilt beyond reasonable doubt. The spent bullet casing (allegedly fired by Ryan) was never recovered so no ballistic and no forensic evidence was possible to prove Ryan had fired the fatal shot. [24]\\r\\nThe Crown's case relied only on eyewitnesses who were near Pentridge Prison when Hodson was shot and killed, because there was no scientific forensic evidence to prove Ryan fired a shot. Each eyewitness testified a different account of what they saw and where Ryan was standing. Eleven eyewitnesses testified that they saw Ryan waving and aiming his rifle. There were variations, whether Ryan was standing, walking or squatting at the time a single shot was heard and whether Ryan was to the left or right of Hodson. Only four eyewitnesses testified that they saw Ryan fire a shot. Two eyewitnesses testified that they saw smoke coming from Ryan's rifle. Two eyewitnesses testified that they saw Ryan recoil his rifle.[24]\\r\\nSome witnesses testified that they saw Ryan's rifle recoil when he fired and also saw smoke from Ryan's rifle. The owners of the car Ryan got into, Frank and Pauline Jeziorski, were two of the witnesses. A warder, Thomas Wallis, testified that he saw smoke come out of the rifle Ryan was holding. Pauline Jeziorski testified that she smelled gunpowder after Ryan had fired the shot.[1][25]\\r\\nAt trial, all prison officers testified that they did not see Hodson carrying anything and that they did not see Hodson hit Walker. However, two witnesses, Louis Bailey and Keith Dobson, testified that they saw Hodson carrying something like an iron-bar or baton as he was chasing after Walker. Governor Grindlay testified that he did not see a bar near Hodson's body but that he found one after Hodson's body was loaded into an ambulance.\\r\\nThe Crown also relied upon unrecorded unsigned testimony that Ryan had, allegedly, verbally confessed to shooting Hodson.[26]\\r\\nDetective Sergeant KP \\"Bill\\" Walters told the court that on 6 January 1966, the day after his re-capture in Sydney, Ryan said\\r\\nIn the heat of the moment you sometimes do an act without thinking. I think this is what happened with Hodson. He had no need to interfere. He was stupid. He was told to keep away. He grabbed Pete [Walker] and hit him with an iron bar. He caused his own death. I didn't want to shoot him. I could have shot a lot more.[27]\\r\\nDetective Senior Constable Harry Morrison told the court that on 7 January 1966 during the flight returning Ryan back to Melbourne Ryan said: \\"The warder spoilt the whole show. If he had not poked his great head into it he would not have got shot. It was either him or Pete.\\"[28]\\r\\nThe Crown also called the two bank officers from the bank that Ryan and Walker robbed. Robert Sipthorpe and George Robertson testified that Ryan said \\"This is the gun that shot a man the other day!\\" At trial, Ryan's defence lawyer Dr Philip Opas QC cross examined the two witnesses asking if instead they heard \\"This is the type of gun that shot a man the other day.\\" Both witnesses stuck to their story.[26]\\r\\nJohn Fisher, who had a long criminal history and had not seen or heard from Ryan for more than two years, testified that he asked Ryan who had shot Hodson. Fisher said Ryan told him he had shot Hodson.[1]\\r\\nNone of the verbal confessions were signed by Ryan, who only signed documents saying that he would give no verbal testimony. Ryan testified he had been \\"verballed\\" and denied the allegations of verbals/confessions said to have been made by him.[23]\\r\\nThe main problem for the defence was that Victoria had the Gaols Act of 1958 in which it stated:\\r\\nThe defence spent a lot of time arguing about when the time of the felony ended. Did it end after the prisoners had cleared the prison walls or did it once the prisoners were caught and returned to custody?.[30]\\r\\nThe defence pointed to various substantial discrepancies in The Crown's case. While some eyewitnesses testified they saw Ryan to the east of Hodson when a single shot was heard, other eyewitnesses testified Ryan was to the west of Hodson. The discrepancies in evidence were substantial and wide-ranging. Opas contended that each of the fourteen eyewitnesses evidence were so contradictory that little store could be placed on them.[10]\\r\\nPhilip Opas produced a human skeleton as a visual aid to explain the trajectory of the fatal bullet, Opas argued that the ballistics evidence indicated that the fatal bullet entered Hodson's (chest) body in a downward trajectory. He also got a Monash University mathematics professor Terry Speed, to explain that Ryan 5 feet 8?inches (1.73 m) tall would have had to have been 8 feet 3?inches (2.55 m) tall to have fired the shot.[31] These calculations were based on Ryan being twenty feet from Hodson and Hodson was standing perfectly upright. The bullet would enter Hodson's body 62?inches from the ground and exit 61?inches from the ground. If the shot was in a downward angle the bullet would have hit the road forty feet from where Hodson was hit, it also suggested that Hodson could have been shot from another elevated point and possibly by another prison officer. It would cast doubt that Ryan had fired the fatal shot. But the prosecution argued that Hodson 6 feet 1?inch (1.85 m) tall could have been running in a stooped position, thus accounting for the bullet's fatal angle of entry.[10] No witnesses saw or testified seeing Hodson running in a stooped position.[1][16]\\r\\nThe trajectory theory put forward by Opas, the trial judge dismissed the theory as did the judges at the Appeal two months later. They said there was enough evidence to say Hodson was not standing fully erected but was running in a forward leaning position when he was shot.[30]\\r\\nOpas in defending Ryan put a lot of pressure on a warder who made conflicting statements, Paterson had made several mutually contradictory statements to police about what he saw, heard and did on that day. In his first statement given to Detective Sergeant Carton on 19 December 1965 Paterson said; \\"I did not hear a shot fired other than the one I fired.\\" In a second statement given to Senior Detective Morrison on 12 January 1966 Paterson said; \\"Just as I turned into the entrance to the garden I heard a shot.\\" In a third statement on 3 February 1966 Paterson said; \\"I ran back inside and asked for a gun, I went to the main gate and I received a gun and ran back outside, as I was running on to the lawn I heard the crack of a shot.\\" Paterson changed his story, too, about who was in the line of fire when he aimed his rifle. In his first statement Paterson said; \\"I sighted my rifle at Ryan and was about to fire when a woman walked into the line of fire and I lifted my rifle.\\" In his second statement Paterson said; \\"I took aim at Ryan but two prison officers were in the line of fire so I dropped my rifle again.\\" In his third statement Paterson said; \\"I took aim at Ryan and I found out I had to fire between two prison officers to get Ryan, so I lowered my gun again.\\" [1][10]\\r\\nRyan testified that he kept his rifle to prove his innocence in the event of recapture, as he knew that forensic microscopic markings on the spent bullet would prove that it was not fired from his rifle.[10][32]\\r\\nDespite extensive search by police, neither the fatal bullet nor the spent cartridge were ever found. Although all prison-authorised rifles were the same M1 carbine type, scientific forensic testing of the bullet would have proven which rifle fired the fatal shot ÿ every rifle leaves a microscopic \\"unique marker\\" on the fired bullet as it travels through the barrel of the rifle.[32]\\r\\nAll the bullets in Ryan's M1 carbine rifle would be accounted for if Ryan cocked the rifle with the safety-catch on, this faulty operation (conceded by prison officer Lange, assistant prison governor Robert Duffy, and confirmed by ballistic experts at trial) would have caused an undischarged bullet to be ejected, spilling onto the floor of the guard tower. Opas established that a person who was inexperienced in handling that type of rifle and its cocking-lever rifle, it would be easy to jam the rifle and any attempt to clear the jam would result in a live round being ejected.\\r\\nOn the eighth day of the trial Ryan was sworn in and took the witness stand. Ryan denied firing a shot, denied the alleged verbal (unsigned) confessions said to have been made by him, and denied ever saying to anyone that he had shot a man. According to Ryan, they were after the reward money by making false allegations.[1] \\"At no time did I fire a shot. My freedom was the only objective. The rifle was taken in the first instance so that it could not be used against me.\\"\\r\\nAfter a trial in the Victorian Supreme Court lasting twelve sitting days Ryan was convicted of the murder of Hodson and sentenced to death by Justice John Starke, the mandatory sentence at that time. Asked if he had anything to say before sentencing Ryan stated \\"I still maintain my innocence. I will consult with my counsel with a view to appeal. That is all I have to say!\\"[33] Walker was found not guilty of murder, but guilty of manslaughter and sentenced to 12 years imprisonment. He would later be found guilty of manslaughter for the death of Arthur Henderson and receive an additional 12 years sentence.\\r\\nAccording to juryman Tom Gildea, the jury evidently thought that the death sentence would be commuted, as had happened in the previous 35 death penalties cases since 1951. Gildea's account of the discussions in the jury room, not one member of the jury thought that Ryan would be executed.[34] Gildea said,\\r\\nOf the jury, two members held out the first vote we took, but 10 of us were sure Ryan was guilty. He was a bit too sure of himself in the witness box but the thing that decided us was handling the rifle which had killed Hodson. We had been told the rifle had a hair trigger,[35] but when we examined it we found we had to pull it at least half an inch and use quite a bit of force.\\"[36] Eight members of the jury were experienced with rifles either in the country or overseas with war service.[36][37]\\r\\nGildea also said, \\"I don't know how much experience the judge and the lawyers had but we had had our share in the jury box I can tell you.\\"[36]\\r\\nWhen it was apparent that the Victorian Government was intent on hanging Ryan, Gildea contacted the nine other jury members he could trace.[34] Gildea said that of the twelve jurors, three refused to sign petitions, one older man who was convinced of Ryan's guilt and the two who believe Ryan was not guilty. Two other jurors could not be contacted.[34][37]\\r\\nSeven jury members, including Gildea, signed separate petitions requesting Ryan's death sentence be commuted to life in prison.[34] Later, some of the jurors came forth and stated they would never have convicted Ryan of murder had they known that he would in fact be executed.[1] Gildea said \\"We didn't want the rope. If we had known Ryan would hang, I think we would have gone for manslaughter.\\"[36][37]\\r\\nOpas decided to appeal against the murder verdict. The appeal was to the Victorian Court of Criminal Appeal, a bench consisting of three judges of the Supreme Court. The basis of the appeal was that the verdict was against the weight of the evidence. He argued that as a matter of law that the inherent inconsistencies and improbabilities and even impossibilities in the evidence.[38]\\r\\nAt the trial there had been a legal argument on when the crime of escaping from jail had been completed. In the Crimes act, a relevant section provides that \\"every male person lawfully imprisoned for any crime who escapes shall be guilty of a felony\\".[38]\\r\\nAt the trial, Mr Justice Starke had directed the jury: \\"In certain circumstances, the crime of murder may be established even though the accused had no intention of killing. And that is so in these circumstances. If a killing occurs by an act of violence in the course of a commission of a felony involving violence, or in the furtherance of the purpose of such felony, the accused is guilty of murder, even though there is no actual intention of killing.\\"[38] There was long legal argument on when the escape felony finished, did it stop once Ryan and Walker left the prison property or did it continue until they were caught in Sydney nineteen days later?[38]\\r\\nThe appeal was dismissed on 8 June 1966.[38]\\r\\nOn 14 October 1966, the Full High Court rejected appeals by Ryan and Walker.[39] With all legal avenues yet to be exhausted, legal aid to Ryan was cut by the Bolte Government. Premier Bolte then directed the Public Solicitor to withdraw Opas' brief as the government was not going to fund the petition to the Privy Council.[10]\\r\\nRyan had a right to increased free legal assistance for expert forensics analysis, to hire expert witnesses, and to present a series of appeals and recourses that were available to those facing execution by the government. The Full Court agreed that it was unthinkable that a man should be executed before he had exhausted his ultimate right of appeals. Opas decided to apply to the Privy Council in London. The appeal is a vestigial remnant of an appeal to the sovereign in person.[10]\\r\\nOn 12 December 1966, the State Executive Council (Premier Bolte's cabinet) announced that Ryan would hang on 9 January 1967.\\r\\nOpas, convinced of Ryan's innocence, agreed to work without pay. Opas consulted the Ethics Committee of the Bar Council to seek approval to make a public appeal for a solicitor prepared to brief him, as Opas was prepared to pay his travel, other expenses and appear without fee. The Committee said that this would be touting for business and was unethical. Opas argued that a man's life was at stake and he could not see how he would be touting when no payment was involved. Opas defied the ruling and on national radio sought an instructor. Opas was inundated with offers and accepted the first application, being from Ralph Freadman. Alleyne Kiddle was in London completing a master's degree and she agreed to take a junior brief without a fee.[10]\\r\\nOn 4 January 1967, the State Executive Council stayed Ryan's execution pending an approach to the Privy Council.[39]\\r\\nOpas then flew to London to present Ryan's case to the highest judges in the Commonwealth. Ryan's execution was delayed by Premier Bolte awaiting the Privy Council's decision.\\r\\nOn 23 January 1967, the Privy Council Judicial Committee refused Ryan leave for appeal.[39]\\r\\nOn 25 January 1967, the State Executive Council set Ryan's execution date as 31 January.[39]\\r\\nOn 30 January 1967, Justice Starke ordered a stay of execution following an affidavit from former prisoner John Tolmie who said he saw a warder fire a shot from Number 1 tower at the time of the murder.[39] The following day Tolmie was charged with perjury for making a false affidavit; he was not in gaol at the time of the escape.[40]\\r\\nBolte scheduled Ryan's execution for the morning of Friday 3 February 1967, a week before the dismissal of the appeal to the Privy Council was published in the Government Gazette.[10][41]\\r\\nThe State Government of Victoria had commuted every death sentence passed since 1951, after Robert Clayton, Norman Andrews and Jean Lee were executed for the torture and murder of an old man.[42]\\r\\nStarke reported that the Premier of Victoria, Sir Henry Bolte, insisted that the death sentence be carried out.[43] Bolte's cabinet was unanimous although there were at least four State cabinet members who opposed capital punishment.[43]\\r\\nWhen it became apparent that Bolte intended to proceed with the execution, a secret eleventh-hour plea for mercy was made by four of the jury members. They sent petitioning letters to the Governor of Victoria, Sir Rohan Delacombe, stating that in reaching their verdict they believed that capital punishment had been abolished in Victoria and requested that the governor exercise the Royal Prerogative of Mercy and commute Ryan's sentence of death. Such Melbourne newspapers as The Age, The Herald and The Sun all ran campaigns opposing the hanging of Ryan. The papers ran a campaign of spirited opposition on the grounds that the death penalty was barbaric. Churches, universities, unions and a large number of the public and legal professions opposed the death sentence. An estimated 18,000 people participated in street protests and around 15,000 signed a petition against the hanging. The Australian Broadcasting Commission (ABC) suspended radio broadcasts for two minutes as a protest.[1]\\r\\nBolte denied all requests for mercy and was determined that Ryan would hang.[44] On the afternoon of the eve of Ryan's hanging, Opas appeared before the trial judge, Justice John Starke, seeking a postponement of the execution due to the opportunity to test new proffered evidence. Opas pleaded with Starke and said, \\"Why the indecent haste to hang this man until we have tested all possible exculpatory evidence?\\" Starke, however, rejected the application.[45]\\r\\nAttorney-General, Arthur Rylah, rejected a second plea to refer Ryan's case to the Full Court under Section 584 of the Crimes Act. A third attempt to save Ryan, in the form of a petition presented at the Crown Solicitor's office pleading for clemency, was also rejected. Close secrecy surrounded all government moves on the Ryan case. That evening, a former Pentridge prisoner, Allan John Cane, arrived in Melbourne from Brisbane in a new bid to save Ryan. An affidavit by Cane, which was presented to Cabinet, says he and seven prisoners were outside the cookhouse when they saw and heard a prison warder fire a shot from the No. 1 guard post at Pentridge Prison the day Hodson was shot. Police had interviewed these prisoners but none were called on at the trial to give evidence. Cane was immediately rushed into conference with his solicitor, Bernard Gaynor, who tried to contact cabinet ministers informing them of Cane's arrival. Gaynor telephoned Government House seeking an audience with the Governor, Sir Rohan Delacombe. However, Gaynor was told by a Government House spokesman that nobody would be answering calls until 9?am (one hour after Ryan's scheduled execution). Gaynor said Cane's mission had failed.[46]\\r\\nAt 23:00, Ryan was informed that his final petition for mercy had been rejected. More than 3,000 people gathered outside Pentridge Prison in protest of the hanging. Shortly before midnight more than 200 police were at the prison to control the demonstrators.[47]\\r\\nOn the night before the execution Ryan was transferred to a cell just a few steps away from the gallows trapdoor. Father Brosnan was with him most of this time. At the eleventh hour Ryan wrote his last letters to his family members, to his defence counsel, to the Anti-Hanging Committee and to Father Brosnan. The letters were handwritten on toilet paper inside his cell and neatly folded. In the documentary film The Last Man Hanged Ryan's letter to The Anti-Hanging Committee is read out loud to the public. Ryan wrote; \\"...?I state most emphatically that I am not guilty of murder.\\"[48] Ryan's last letter was to his daughters, it contained this line \\"With regard to my guilt I say only that I am innocent of intent and have a clear conscience in the matter.\\"[1]\\r\\nRyan refused to have any sedatives but he did have a nip of whisky, and walked calmly onto the gallows trapdoor. Ronald Ryan's last words were to the hangman; \\"God bless you, please make it quick.\\"[49]\\r\\nRyan was hanged in 'D' Division at Pentridge Prison at 8:00?am on Friday 3 February 1967.\\r\\nA nationwide three-minute silence was observed by Ryan's supporters at the exact time that Ryan was hanged.\\r\\nLater that day, Ryan's body was buried in an unmarked grave within the \\"D\\" Division prison facility.\\r\\nForty years later in 2007, the Victorian Premier John Brumby granted permission for Ryan's family members to have his body exhumed from Pentridge Prison after Hodson's daughter jumped and danced on Ryan's grave. Ryan's remains were cremated and placed next to his deceased ex-wife in Portland Cemetery.[50]\\r\\nRyan was a slightly built man who stood 5?ft 8?inches (173?cm) tall. He had suffered an injury to his left eye as a child resulting in a permanent droop of his left eyelid. He favoured expensive clothing, aiming to impress others, and aspired to be known as Australia's leading criminal.[51] He was of above-average intelligence and was described by the people who knew him and prison authorities as a likable character but also a compulsive gambler.[8]\\r\\nArresting officer Det Harding described Ryan as \\"...?tough, plausible and particularly difficult to question, he gave nothing away until he realised the game was up.\\"[8]\\r\\nNineteen years after Ryan's execution, a former warder, Doug Pascoe, claimed on air to Channel 9 and other media that he had fired a shot during Ryan's escape bid. Pascoe said his shot may have accidentally killed his fellow prison guard, Hodson. Pascoe had not told anyone that he fired a shot during the escape because at that time, \\"I was a 23-year-old coward.\\" In 1986, he tried to sell his story but his claim was dismissed by police because his rifle had a full magazine after the shooting and he was too far away.[52][53]\\r\\nPascoe's claim was rejected by another former warder, Bill Newman. Newman claimed that he was in Tower 3 the afternoon of the escape and that Pascoe was in Tower 4. Tower 3 was 200 metres from the shooting and Tower 4 was 500 metres away.[54] Police produced a photocopy of the duty roster for the day that showed that Newman was meant to have been in Tower 3 and Pascoe in Tower 4.[53]\\r\\nThough Opas claimed that the staff duty roster was virtually meaningless on the day of the shooting because prison officers were taking turns sitting in for their colleagues while they attended the annual staff Christmas party, Newman said he returned to his tower (3) at 1.45?pm and later signed statements for the police.[53] According to the duty roster Robert Paterson was not on duty either but in fact he was on duty ÿ he was the one that fired a shot.[10]\\r\\nRetired prison governor Ian Grindlay said that Ryan told him \\"straight out\\" that he had shot but not meant to kill Hodson.[54]\\r\\nSister Margaret Kingston of the Good Shepherd Convent in Abbotsford, said Ryan told her that he had shot Hodson, but had not meant to kill him.[55]\\r\\nTwenty-five years after being a witness in Ryan's trial, where he gave evidence claiming to have seen him commit the murder, a man broke his silence, for fear that the alleged killer was becoming a latter-day Ned Kelly.[56] Les Watt wrote to The Australian: \\"Let me assure you and your readers that Ryan did kill Hodson.\\" Watt spoke out after reading Philip Opas' comments and the latter's autobiography.[57] Watt was one of four witnesses to testify seeing Ryan fire a shot. Watt said that it might well be proper for Opas to leave the bar as his emotional involvement with the case had certainly distorted the facts, leading as it had to the suggestion that Ryan might not have fired the shot that killed Hodson. Watt, on the contrary, said that he saw Ryan take aim and fire and then saw Hodson fall flat on his face and not move. \\"It was a sickening sight. I also witnessed a slight puff of smoke come from the carbine Ryan used. This was probably as a result of a bullet passing through a well-oiled barrel bore.\\"[58]\\r\\nAn Australian criminologist, Gordon Hawkins, the director of Sydney University's Institute of Criminology, doubts the damning validity of the \\"unsigned confessions\\" of Ryan in a television film documentary, Beyond reasonable doubt.[23] Although verbal confessions are not permissible in court, in the 1960s the public and therefore the jury, were much more trusting of the police.[59] As to whether as a result an innocent man was hanged, there is at least a reasonable doubt. Following revelations of police corruption uncovered by various Australian police royal commissions.[59] Australian police have to record or tape all interviews they carry out in connection with a crime. The police had no evidence of these unsigned verbal confessions. Ryan signed only a statement saying that he would not be giving any statements, verbal or written, to anyone except his lawyer. Hawkins questions why Ryan, a seasoned criminal, would suddenly feel the need to tell all to the police.[23]\\r\\nIn 1993, a former Pentridge prisoner, Harold Sheehan, claimed he had witnessed the shooting but had not come forward at the time. Sheehan saw Ryan on his knees when the shot rang out and, therefore, Ryan could not have inflicted the wound that had killed Hodson, which passed in a downward trajectory.[10]\\r\\nAll prison-authorised M1 carbine rifles, including that seized by Ryan from Lange, were issued loaded with eight rounds ball. Seven of the eight were accounted for in Ryan's case. If the eighth fell onto the floor of the prison watch-tower when Ryan cocked the rifle with the safety catch on, thereby ejecting a live round, then the bullet that killed Hodson must have been fired by a person other than Ryan.[4][10][60]\\r\\nIn a letter, \\"Opas on Ryan ÿ The innocence of Ronald Ryan\\", written to the Victorian Bar Association and published in the Victorian Bar News (Spring 2002), Opas responded[10] to an assertion made by Julian Burnside, in reviewing Mike Richard's book The Hanged Man, that Ryan was guilty, but that while the verdict was correct the punishment was wrong.[61]\\r\\nOpas disagreed with this assertion, refusing to believe that at any time Ryan confessed to anyone that he fired a shot and denying the existence of any evidence whatsoever that Ryan ever confessed guilt to anyone, either verbally or in writing.[10]\\r\\nRyan gave evidence and swore that he did not fire at Hodson. He denied firing a shot at all. Ryan denied the alleged verbal confessions said to have been made by him. Opas says the last words Ryan said to him were; \\"We've all got to go sometime, but I don't want to go this way for something I didn't do.\\"[10]\\r\\nOn 26 March 2003, just months prior to his death, Catholic priest Father John Brosnan was asked on ABC Radio by journalist Kellie Day about Ryan, who was believed to have fired the fatal shot during the prison breakout. Brosnan said; \\"No, I won't make a hero out of him. He caused a situation. I don't know whose bullet killed who, but a friend of mine died. But I'll tell you what, he had heroic qualities.\\" [62] Father Brosnan said. \\"George was a nice fellow, but his wife had left him, taking their thirteen-year-old daughter with her, and he didn't have much of a life. I used to talk to him at Pentridge and drop in to see him in St Kilda sometimes to cheer him up.\\" [34]\\r\\nOn 1 March 2004, in an interview with the Australian Coalition Against Death Penalty (ACADP),[63] Opas said: \\"I want to put the record straight. I want the truth told about Ronald Ryan ÿ that an innocent man went to the gallows. I want the truth to be made available to everyone, for anyone young and old, who may want to do research into Ryan's case or research on the issue of capital punishment. I will go to my grave firmly of the opinion that Ronald Ryan did not commit murder. I refuse to believe that at any time he told anyone that he did\\".[64]\\r\\nOn 23 August 2008, Philip Opas QC, died after a long illness at the age of 91. Opas maintained Ryan's innocence to the end.[65] Opas asked Australian Coalition President Dorina Lisson to keep fighting to clear Ryan's name.[66] According to Ms Lisson, she and others are determined to have Ryan's murder conviction overturned because there is no scientific ballistic forensic evidence to prove Ryan guilty of murder, that a wrongly convicted man was hanged based solely on unsigned unrecorded unproven \\"hearsay\\" allegations of verbals/confessions.[66]\\r\\nFor 35 years, Barry Jones, who was a member of both the Victorian and Federal Parliaments refused to comment publicly on Ryan's hanging. Mr Jones broke his silence in 2002 at the launch of Mike Richards' book, The Hanged Man.[67] Mr Jones says he remains \\"unsure\\" of whether Ryan ever pulled the trigger. \\"It seemed to me that there was probably a reasonable doubt in the case,\\" he said.[67] Mr Jones, also the former secretary of the Victorian Anti-Hanging Committee says he believes Ryan's hanging was an attempt by then Victorian Premier Henry Bolte, to push his law and order agenda.[67]\\r\\nJustice Starke, the judge at Ryan's trial and a committed abolitionist, was convinced of Ryan's guilt but did not personally think that he should hang. Until his death in 1992, Starke remained troubled about Ryan's hanging and would often ask his colleagues if they thought he did the right thing.[1] Philip Opas' junior in the trial, Brian Bourke, was filmed in 2005 saying One of the problems of Ryan's trial was an alleged admission that he made on the plane back to the homicide fellows. That sort of thing can't happen now, because they've got to be recorded on tape, but whether he made the admission or was verballed, I don't know. He was a pretty talkative fellow, he might have. I didn't have much doubt about his guilt.[68]\\r\\nAn Epiphany Window was installed at St James the Great Anglican Church a few weeks after the execution. It was created by the artist Dr Miroslav \\"Dismas\\" Zika, who etched an inscription in Latin into the glass towards the base of the window, a translation of which in English is rendered \\"Dismas made this in 1967 at the beginning of the month when Bolte, scandalous, arrogant, was demanding Ryan suffer capital punishment.\\" Bolte considered this objectionable. The Archbishop of Melbourne, Dr Frank Woods, apologised to the Premier, clarifying that the inscription had neither been included in the original design brief, nor had any \\"official authorisation\\", and that the offending inscription would be removed. Dr Zika remained unrepentant.[77]","input":"Who was the last man hung in australia?"},{"output":"a full-sized automobile","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Hudson Hornet is a full-sized automobile which was produced by the Hudson Motor Car Company of Detroit, Michigan, between 1951 and 1954 and then by American Motors Corporation (AMC) in Kenosha, Wisconsin, and marketed under the Hudson brand between 1955 and 1957.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first-generation Hudson Hornets featured a functional \\"step-down\\" design with dropped floorpan and a chassis with a lower center of gravity than contemporary vehicles that helped the car handle well ÿ a bonus for racing. The Hornet's lower and sleeker look was accentuated by streamlined styling, sometimes called \\"ponton\\" styling. Hornet owner Spencer Blake, writing for Popular Mechanics in 1999, notes that \\"the car's unique, low slung appearance and silky handling earned Hudson an image that ÿ for many buyers ÿ eclipsed luxury marques like Cadillac.\\"[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe second-generation Hudson Hornet was a restyled Nash that was badge engineered as a Hudson.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Hornet, introduced for the 1951 model year, was based on Hudson's \\"step-down\\" design[4] that was first seen in the 1948 model year on the Commodore. Unlike a unibody, the design didn't fully merge the body and chassis frame into a single structure, but the floorpan footwells recessed down, in between the car's chassis rails, which were in turn routed around them  instead of a conventional floor, sitting on top of straight ladder frame rails  a body on frame design that later became more widely adopted, and known as a perimeter frame. Thus one \\"stepped down\\" into a Hudson. Thanks to the step-down chassis and body, the car's \\"lower center of gravity...was both functional and stylish. The car not only handled well, but treated its six passengers to a sumptuous ride. The low-slung look also had a sleekness about it that was accentuated by the nearly enclosed rear wheels.\\"[5]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHudson Hornets were available as a two-door coupe, four-door sedan, a convertible and a hardtop coupe. The models were priced the same as Commodore Eight, which was priced from US$2,543 to $3,099. \\r\\nAll Hornets from 1951 to 1953 were powered by Hudson's high-compression straight-six \\"H-145\\" engine. In 1954, power was increased to 170?hp (127?kW) from 145?hp (108?kW). Starting in 1952 an optional \\"twin-H\\" or twin one barrel carburetor setup was available at additional cost. A L-head (flathead or sidevalve) design, at 308?cu?in (5.0?L) it was the \\"largest [displacement] six-cylinder engine in the world\\" at the time. It had a two-barrel carburetor and produced 145?hp (108?kW)[3] at 3800 rpm and 275?lb?ft (373?N?m) of torque.[6] The engine was capable of far more power in the hands of precision tuners, including Marshall Teague, who claimed he could get 112 miles per hour (180.2?km/h) from an AAA- or NASCAR-certified stock Hornet, as well as Hudson engineers who developed \\"severe usage\\" options (thinly disguised racing parts).[7] The combination of the Hudson engine with overall road-ability of the Hornets, plus the fact these cars were over engineered and over built, made them unbeatable in competition on the dirt and the very few paved tracks of the 1950s.[8] The newly introduced \\"Twin H-Power\\" was available in November 1951 as a Dealer installed option at the cost of $85.60. An electric clock was standard.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nHudson Hornet 1951 model year production totaled 43,656 units.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1952 the \\"Twin H-Power\\" version now standard equipment with dual single-barrel carburetors atop a dual-intake manifold, and power rose to 170?hp (127?kW; 172?PS). The hood featured a functional scoop that ducts cold air to the carburetors and was considered \\"ventilation\\" in 1954, rather than ram air.[1]  The engine could be tuned to produce 210?hp (157?kW) when equipped with the \\"7-X\\" modifications that Hudson introduced later.[6] During 1952 and 1953 the Hornet received minor cosmetic enhancements, and still closely resembled the Commodore of 1948.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Hornet proved to be nearly invincible in stock-car racing.[7] \\"[D]espite its racing successes...sales began to languish.\\"[5] Hudson's competitors, using separate body-on-frame designs, could change the look of their models on a yearly basis without expensive chassis alterations\\"[5] whereas the Hornet's \\"modern, sophisticated unibody design was expensive to update,\\" so it \\"was essentially locked in\\" and \\"suffered against the planned obsolescence of the Big Three [General Motors, Ford, and Chrysler] automakers.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 1953 model year brought minor changes to the Hudson Hornet. The front end was modified with a new grille and a non-functional air scoop hood ornament.[9] four different body designs: two-door club coupe, Hollywood hardtop, Convertible Brougham, and a four-door sedan.\\r\\n\\r\\nHudson Hornet 1953 model year production totaled 27,208 units of which around 910 were the Hollywood hardtops.[10] An 8-tube radio was a $100 option.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nEventually, for the 1954 model year, the model underwent a major square-lined redesign. This entailed extensive retooling because of the way the step-down frame wrapped around the passenger compartment. The front had a simpler grille that complemented the now-functional hood scoop and a new one-piece curved windshield, while the sides gained period-typical fender chrome accents, and the formerly sloped rear end was squared off.[12] The front to rear fender line was styled to make the car look longer and taillamps were also redesigned.[13] The interior was also updated with a new dash and instrument cluster that were surprisingly modern.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was still no V8 engine available, but the 308?cu?in (5.0?L) six-cylinder was standard in Hornets and produced 160?hp (119?kW), the racing-inspired 170?hp (127?kW; 172?PS) \\"Twin-H-Power\\" (dual carburetor) option was very popular, and a 7-X version of the engine was offered as a factory option, producing over 210?hp (157?kW; 213?PS) using a high compression head, special camshaft, and other \\"severe usage\\" parts designed for racing.  The  308?cu?in (5.0?L) engine has remarkable torque at low RPMs and a fairly flat torque curve, which helped the Hornet beat V-8s from other makes whose power advantage came only at much higher RPMs.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough the Hornet's redesign put it on par with its contemporaries in terms of looks and style, it came too late to boost sales.  The news that Hudson was in financial difficulties and had been essentially taken over by Nash-Kelvinator to form American Motors Corporation during the 1954 model year was known by the car-buying public.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe updated Hornet Brougham convertible, the sole convertible available from Hudson, was attractive but overpriced at US$3,288 for a six-cylinder car in 1954.[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nHudson Hornet 1954 model year production totaled 24,833 (the final year of \\"step-down\\" design production, overlapping Hudson's \\"merger\\" with Nash-Kelvinator).\\r\\n\\r\\nHudson was the first automobile manufacturer to get involved in stock car racing.[8] The Hornet \\"dominated stock car racing in the early-1950s, when stock car racers actually raced stock cars.\\"[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring 1952, Marshall Teague finished the 1952 AAA season with a 1000-point lead over his closest rival, winning 12 of the 13 scheduled events.[7] Hornets driven by NASCAR aces Herb Thomas, Dick Rathmann, Al Keller, Frank Mundyand, and Tim Flock won 27 NASCAR races driving for the Hudson team.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the AAA racing circuit, Teague drove a stock Hornet that he called the Fabulous Hudson Hornet to 14 wins during the season. This brought the Hornet's season record to 40 wins in 48 events, a winning percentage of 83%.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nOverall, Hudson won 27 of the 34 NASCAR Grand National races in 1952, followed by 22 wins of 37 in 1953, and capturing 17 of the 37 races in 1954  \\"an incredible accomplishment, especially from a car that had some legitimate luxury credentials.\\"[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe original Fabulous Hudson Hornet can be found today fully restored in Ypsilanti, Michigan at the Ypsilanti Automotive Heritage Museum, a facility that was formerly home to Miller Motors, the last Hudson dealership in the world.[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn its final three model years, the Hornet became a product of the newly formed American Motors Corporation (AMC). Following the 1954 merger of the Hudson Motor Car Company and Nash-Kelvinator, Hudson's Detroit manufacturing facility was closed and production of Hudson models was shifted to Nash's Wisconsin factory. No longer built on the \\"Step-down\\" platform, all Hudsons were now based on the senior Nash models, but featuring distinctive Hudson styling themes.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe new models were delayed to a January 1955 introduction, \\"as American Motors engineers work out the problem of making two completely different looking automobiles with identical body shells.\\"[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first entirely new car from American Motors, the 1955 Hudson emerged as a conservatively styled car compared to the competition. The 1955 Hornet was the cleanest model with a broad eggcrate grille and distinctive two-toning.[18] Sedan and hardtop body styles were offered, but the coupe and convertible were no longer available.[19]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 308?cu?in (5.0?L) straight-six engine continued in 160?bhp (119?kW) or 170?bhp (127?kW) versions. For the first time ever, the Hornet could be ordered with a Packard-built 320?cu?in (5.2?L) V8 engine producing 208?bhp (155?kW) and Packard's Ultramatic automatic transmission. The rear suspension now incorporated a torque tube system for the driveshaft and coil spring rear suspension along with front springs that are twice as long as most other cars.[20]\\r\\n\\r\\nAlong with Nash, the new Hudsons had the widest front seats in the industry.[21] The Weather Eye heating and ventilation with an optional air conditioning system were highly rated in terms of efficiency.[20] The integrated placement of major air conditioning systems under the hood and the price of only $395 (about half the cost as on other cars) also won praise.[20] Automotive journalist Floyd Clymer rated the Hudson Hornet as the safest car built in the United States because of (1) the single unit welded body, (2) high quality braking system with added mechanical backup system, (3) roadability, general handling, and maneuverability; as well as (4) excellent acceleration and power for emergency situations.[20]\\r\\n\\r\\nProduction for the 1955 model year totaled 10,010 four-door sedans and 3,324 Hollywood two-door hardtops.[18]\\r\\n\\r\\nFor the 1956 model year, AMC executives decided to give the Hornet more character and the design for the vehicles was given over to designer Richard Arbib, who provided the Hornet and Wasp with one of the more distinctive looks in the 1950s which he called \\"V-Line Styling\\". Taking the traditional Hudson tri-angle, Arbib applied its \\"V\\" form in every conceivable manner across the interior and exterior of the car. Combined with tri-tone paint combinations, the Hudson's look was unique and immediately noticeable.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe legendary 308?cu?in (5.0?L) straight-six engine, with and without Twin-H Power, was offered and gained 5?hp (4?kW) for 1956. However, Packard's V8 engine was available only during the first half of 1956. At mid-model year Hornet Special was introduced featuring a lower price and AMC's new 250?cu?in (4.1?L) 190?hp (142?kW) V8 engine.[18] The Hornet Special models were built on a 7-inch (178?mm) shorter and slightly lighter Statesman/Wasp four-door sedan and two-door hardtop platform with Hornet trim.[22]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 1956 design failed to excite buyers and Hudson Hornet sales decreased to 8,152 units, of which 6,512 were four-door sedans and 1,640 Hollywood two-door hardtops.[18]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1957, the historic Hudson name came only in a Hornet version in \\"Super\\" and \\"Custom\\" series, and available as a four-door sedan or a two-door \\"Hollywood\\" hardtop. For the second year the V-Line styling featured an enormous egg-crate grille, creases and chrome strips on the sides, and five tri-tone schemes for the Custom models. There was more ornamentation to the cars, including fender \\"finettes\\" atop the rounded rear quarter panels for 1957, as well as very unusual twin-fin trim on top of both front fenders.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe price was reduced and the power was increased by way of AMC's new 327?cu?in (5.4?L) V8 that was rated at 255?hp (190?kW) with a four-barrel carburetor and dual exhausts. Consumers reacted by buying only 4,108 units.[23]\\r\\n\\r\\nProduction of the Hornet ended on June 25, 1957, at which time the Hudson marque was dropped and all of AMC's products took the \\"Rambler\\" name.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 1951 Hudson Hornet was selected as the \\"Car of the Year\\" in a book profiling seventy-five years of noteworthy automobiles by automotive journalist Henry Bolles Lent.[24]\\r\\n\\r\\nSome police departments used the Hudson Hornet 4-door sedans as police cars. After their retirement, they were replaced by the AMC Matador and the AMC Ambassador police cars.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor the 1970 model year, American Motors resurrected the Hornet name for their new compact car that replaced the Rambler American (see AMC Hornet).\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2006, a small, front-wheel-drive concept car called Hornet was designed and developed by Dodge (see Dodge Hornet).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Disney Pixar film Cars and several spin-off video games featured a Fabulous Hudson Hornet named Doc Hudson, a retired Piston Cup champion. The Piston cup is the franchise's version of the Winston Cup Series, which changed to Sprint Cup Series in 2004 (today Monster Energy Cup Series).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Hudson Hornet was featured in the video games, Driver: San Francisco and Forza Motorsport 4 as a part of July Car Pack.\\r\\n\\r\\nFirst-generation Hudson Hornets are legendary for their NASCAR racing history and Jay Leno lists the 1951-1954 models as one of the \\"top ten of America's most collectible cars\\".[28] \\"One of the great postwar landmarks - a true champion\\" gives it a big edge in collector appeal.[29] Richard M. Langworth describes the first-generation Hornets in his book Complete Book of Collectible Cars: 70 Years of Blue Chip Auto Investments as \\"the most remembered Hudson of the postwar years, one of the industry's all-time greats.\\"[30] For example, prices on the Club Coupes, the body style used by the winning NASCAR drivers, have greatly appreciated in the last several years where several nicely restored examples have broken the $75K barrier in several cases.[31] The convertible versions have also increased in value with a restored 1953 bringing $150,000 in 2013.[32]","input":"What kind of car is the hudson hornet?"},{"output":"27 September 2003","context":"The National Space Research and Development Agency (NASRDA) is the national space agency of Nigeria.

The satellite was launched by Kosmos-3M rocket from Russian Plesetsk spaceport on 27 September 2003. Nigeriasat-1 was part of the world-wide Disaster Monitoring Constellation System.[1] The primary objectives of the Nigeriasat-1 were: to give early warning signals of environmental disaster; to help detect and control desertification in the northern part of Nigeria; to assist in demographic planning; to establish the relationship between vectors and the environment that breeds malaria and to give early warning signals on future outbreaks of meningitis using remote sensing technology; to provide the technology needed to bring education to all parts of the country through distant learning; and to aid in conflict resolution and border disputes by mapping out state and International borders.\\r\\nNigeriaSat-2 and NigeriaSat-X, Nigeria's third and fourth satellites, were built as a high-resolution earth satellite by SSTL for DMC system also.

According to Nigerian Communications Satellite Limited, it was put into \\"emergency mode operation in order to effect mitigation and repairs\\".[3] The satellite eventually failed after losing power on 11 November 2008.\\r\\nOn 24 March 2009, the Nigerian Federal Ministry of Science and Technology, NigComSat Ltd. and CGWIC signed a further contract for the in-orbit delivery of the NigComSat-1R satellite. NigComSat-1R was also a DFH-4 satellite, and is expected to be delivered in the fourth quarter of 2011 as a replacement for the failed NigComSat-1.[4]\\r\\nOn 19 December 2011, a new Nigerian communications satellite was launched into orbit by China in Xichang.The satellite according to Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan which was paid for by the insurance policy on NigComSat-1 which de-orbited in 2009, would have a positive impact on national development in various sectors such as communications, internet services, health, agriculture, environmental protection and national security.[5]\\r\\nNigComSat-2 and NigComSat-3 - more communications satellites to extend Nigerian Communication Satellite ltd capacity, planning to launch in 2012 and 2013.\\r\\nNigeriaSAT-1 - dual-aimed military/civil Earth monitoring satellite with synthetic aperture radar, planning to launch in 2015.\\r\\nRobert Ajayi Boroffice announced at a public lecture on space technology development that Nigeria will be able to build indigenous satellites in the country without foreign assistance by 2018.

In the case of credit cards, holds may last as long as thirty days, depending on the issuing bank.\\r\\nThe main reason for authorization holds is where there is a two-step process in the payment, consisting of an authorization and a settlement with a time lag in between. These were common with signature-based (non-PIN-based) credit and debit card transactions where a transaction was authorised but not settled until a few days later. It is also common in hotel, rental car services or on pay at the pump at filling stations where the company wants to confirm a valid method of payment has been received prior to providing services or goods and knowing the amount that will be charged.\\r\\nThe major consequence for the user is that they cannot access that part of their account until the authorization hold expires without being finalized or is settled and the banking system transfers the funds. If the account balance is low this could result in an unavailable funds fee. The actual balance will not be reduced until the merchant submits the batch of transactions, and the banking system transfers the funds.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen a merchant swipes a customer's credit card, the credit card terminal connects to the merchant's acquirer, or credit card processor, which verifies that the customer's account is valid and that sufficient funds are available to cover the transaction's cost. At this step, the funds are \\"held\\" and deducted from the customer's credit limit (or available bank balance, in the case of a debit card), but are not yet transferred to the merchant. At the time of the merchant's choosing, the merchant instructs the credit card machine to submit the finalized transactions to the acquirer in a \\"batch transfer,\\" which begins the settlement process, where the funds are transferred from the customers' accounts to the merchant's accounts.\\r\\nThis process is not instantaneous: the transaction may not appear on the customer's statement or online account activity for one to two days, and it can take up to three days for funds to be deposited in the merchant's account. The preauthorization will be terminated if it is allowed to expire before the settlement occurs.\\r\\nFor example, if an individual has a credit limit of $100 and uses a credit card to make a purchase at a retail store for $30, then the available credit will immediately decrease to $70, because the merchant has obtained an authorization from the individual's bank by swiping the card through its credit card terminal.\\r\\nIf the billing statement were then sent out immediately, the actual charges would still be $0, because the merchant has not actually collected the funds in question. The actual charge is not put through until the merchant submits their batch of transactions and the banking system transfers the funds.\\r\\nA debit card works differently. Like in the previous example, if one has a balance of $100 in the bank and used a debit card to make a purchase at a retail store for $30, the available balance will immediately decrease to $70, as a hold on the $30 is enacted because the merchant has obtained an authorization from the bank by swiping the card through the credit card terminal. However, the actual balance with the bank is still $100, because the merchant has not actually collected the funds in question.\\r\\nSome services, like hotels and rental cars, have the card as authorized at the beginning of service, but the settlement will not be placed until the completion of the service. Many times, there are additional deposits required in addition to the anticipated cost of the service to cover any additional unexpected charges for damages, excessive mileage or fuel, or if hotel guests charge room service, movies, or phone calls to the account.\\r\\nUpon the completion of the service, the vendor will then process the settlement of any final charges and submit them to the processor. It is not until then that the vendor will receive any funds, even though the customer's account would have shown the pending transaction from the authorization at the beginning of service. The settled charges will be deducted from the authorized funds and are not in addition to the authorized funds.\\r\\nOn occasion, negligence or computer error may make a merchant attempt to authorize a card twice, creating a double hold on the cardholder's bank account. That often happens when a processor requires additional security verification such as a card security code, ZIP code, or address, and incorrect information is provided or is mistyped. Gasoline pumps often impose a double hold, one for a standard amount (such as $75) and another for the amount of purchase. Though the merchant will settle the transaction only once, the hold will temporarily lower the customer's available balance, potentially causing declines or, for a debit card, even overdrafts.[1]\\r\\nOnly banks have the ability to remove preauthorizations from the card holder's card. Thus, a merchant may void a transaction, but the hold will remain on the account.[2][dead link]\\r\\nRarely, banks will remove authorization holds with a verbal (or, for larger amounts, written) request from the authorizing merchant.[citation needed] Such requests usually require information such as the cardholder's name, card number, authorization number and transaction amount.[citation needed] Since most banks cannot verify that the letter from the merchant is someone who has authority to ensure that the charge will not settle, they require the hold to remain according to their bank policies.[citation needed]\\r\\nAnother issue that occurs on a regular basis with authorization holds is the transaction amount changing between the time the hold is placed on the account and when the transaction is settled. It most commonly occurs when the final debit amount is uncertain when the authorization is actually obtained.\\r\\nFor example, if an individual makes a fuel purchase by swiping a check card or credit card at the pump without using the PIN, the pump has no way of knowing how much fuel will be used. The pump typically authorizes a fixed amount, usually $1 but sometimes up to $100, to verify that the card is legitimate and that the customer has funds available. When the transaction is settled, it will actually post for the value of the purchase.[3]\\r\\nThere currently[when?] is litigation in the State of Florida that alleges that some gas stations do not adequately inform their customers that a certain fixed dollar amount (usually between $75 and $100) will be requested as a pre-authorization in connection with a customer's purchase of self-service gasoline at the pump using a debit card and that this practice violates various Florida consumer protection and civil laws. The lawsuit was filed by Florida attorneys Cameron Moyer and James Staack in November, 2007. Class certification was granted by the Circuit Court in February, 2009. The defendant is currently[when?] appealing the Class Certification Order.[4]\\r\\nAnother example can be seen with a restaurant transaction. If an individual spends $40 at a meal, the server does not know how large a tip they will leave if they choose to leave one on the card. The restaurant's credit card terminal is typically set to authorize a larger amount, such as 20% above the cost of the meal, but the transaction will settle for the actual total including the actual tip written on the receipt. Some restaurants will authorize just the amount of the bill, but the transaction will settle higher with the tip included. This type of settlement (for an amount higher than the authorized amount) is only possible when the original authorization was executed with a specific merchant category code (hospitality). It is not possible in eCommerce or retail environments.\\r\\nAcquiring banks sometimes forbid the practice of preauthorizing an amount including a tip, but will guarantee settlement of the amount authorized, plus 15 or 20%.[citation needed]\\r\\nOther businesses that may settle transactions for different amounts than those originally authorized include hotels and car rental agencies. The final cost of these transactions can be extremely unpredictable from unforeseen extras such as room service charges, refuelling charges, or longer stays. Those companies typically place a hold on the customer's credit card at the beginning of the transaction for the estimated total, plus a percentage or a fixed cash amount (such as the estimated rental charges, plus 15% or $250). The establishments usually do not settle the transactions until after the customer has checked out or returned the rental car. Some hotels and car rental agencies do not accept Visa or MasterCard-branded debit cards, as the authorization holds can expire before the transaction is settled. Additionally, some agencies use the requirement of a credit card as a tool to screen high-risk customers, as credit cards usually require a good credit history, and all that is needed for a debit card is a checking account.\\r\\nAnother example of a transaction that may settle for an amount different from the amount authorized is a transaction incurred in a currency different from the currency in which the card is denominated. The final, settled, transaction amount will be based on the exchange rate in effect on the settlement date. Since that rate is generally not known at the time of authorization, the banks will use an estimated amount based on the exchange rate at the time of authorization.","input":"What is a pre authorized credit card payment?"},{"output":"Eurasian","context":"The Mid-Atlantic Ridge (MAR) is a mid-ocean ridge, a divergent tectonic plate or constructive plate boundary located along the floor of the Atlantic Ocean, and part of the longest mountain range in the world. In the North Atlantic it separates the Eurasian and North American Plates, and in the South Atlantic it separates the African and South American Plates. The ridge extends from a junction with the Gakkel Ridge (Mid-Arctic Ridge) northeast of Greenland southward to the Bouvet Triple Junction in the South Atlantic. Although the Mid-Atlantic Ridge is mostly an underwater feature, portions of it have enough elevation to extend above sea level. The section of the ridge that includes the island of Iceland is also known as the Reykjanes Ridge. The ridge has an average spreading rate of about 2.5 centimetres (0.98?in) per year.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA ridge under the Atlantic Ocean was first inferred by Matthew Fontaine Maury in 1850. The existence of the ridge was discovered during the expedition of HMS Challenger in 1872.[2] A team of scientists on board, led by Charles Wyville Thomson, discovered a large rise in the middle of the Atlantic while investigating the future location for a transatlantic telegraph cable.[3] The existence of such a ridge was confirmed by sonar in 1925[4] and was found to extend around the Cape of Good Hope into the Indian Ocean by the German Meteor expedition.[5]\\r\\nIn the 1950s, mapping of the Earth's ocean floors by Bruce Heezen, Maurice Ewing, Marie Tharp and others revealed that the Mid-Atlantic Ridge had a strange bathymetry of valleys and ridges,[6] with its central valley being seismologically active and the epicenter of many earthquakes.[7][8] Ewing, Heezen and Tharp discovered that the ridge is part of a 40,000-km-long essentially continuous system of mid-ocean ridges on the floors of all the Earths oceans.[9] The discovery of this worldwide ridge system led to the theory of seafloor spreading and general acceptance of Wegener's theory of continental drift and expansion in the modified form of plate tectonics. The ridge is central to the breakup of the hypothetical supercontinent of Pangaea that began some 180 million years ago.\\r\\nThe Mid-Atlantic Ridge includes a deep rift valley that runs along the axis of the ridge along nearly its entire length. This rift marks the actual boundary between adjacent tectonic plates, where magma from the mantle reaches the seafloor, erupting as lava and producing new crustal material for the plates.\\r\\nNear the equator, the Mid-Atlantic Ridge is divided into the North Atlantic Ridge and the South Atlantic Ridge by the Romanche Trench, a narrow submarine trench with a maximum depth of 7,758?m (25,453?ft), one of the deepest locations of the Atlantic Ocean. This trench, however, is not regarded as the boundary between the North and South American Plates, nor the Eurasian and African Plates.\\r\\nThe islands on or near the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, from north to south, with their respective highest peaks and location, are:\\r\\nNorthern Hemisphere (North Atlantic Ridge):\\r\\nSouthern Hemisphere (South Atlantic Ridge):\\r\\nThe ridge sits atop a geologic feature known as the Mid-Atlantic Rise, which is a progressive bulge that runs the length of the Atlantic Ocean, with the ridge resting on the highest point of this linear bulge. This bulge is thought to be caused by upward convective forces in the asthenosphere pushing the oceanic crust and lithosphere. This divergent boundary first formed in the Triassic period, when a series of three-armed grabens coalesced on the supercontinent Pangaea to form the ridge. Usually, only two arms of any given three-armed graben become part of a divergent plate boundary. The failed arms are called aulacogens, and the aulacogens of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge eventually became many of the large river valleys seen along the Americas and Africa (including the Mississippi River, Amazon River and Niger River). The Fundy Basin on the Atlantic coast of North America between New Brunswick and Nova Scotia in Canada is evidence of the ancestral Mid-Atlantic Ridge.[10][11]","input":"What four major plates make up the floor of the atlantic ocean?"},{"output":"February 16ÿ18, 2013","context":"Lady and the Tramp is a 1955 American animated romantic musical comedy-drama film produced by Walt Disney and released to theaters on June 22, 1955 by Buena Vista Distribution. The 15th Disney animated feature film, it was the first animated feature filmed in the CinemaScope widescreen film process.[2] Based on Happy Dan, The Whistling Dog by Ward Greene, Lady and the Tramp tells the story of a female American Cocker Spaniel named Lady who lives with a refined, upper-middle-class family, and a male stray mongrel called the Tramp. When the two dogs meet, they embark on many romantic adventures and fall in love. A direct-to-video sequel, Lady and the Tramp II: Scamp's Adventure, was released in 2001.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOn Christmas morning, 1909, in a quaint Midwestern town, Jim Dear gives his wife Darling an American cocker spaniel puppy that she names Lady. Lady enjoys a happy life with the couple and befriends two local neighborhood dogs, Jock, a Scottish terrier, and Trusty, a bloodhound. Meanwhile, across town, a stray mongrel called the Tramp lives on his own, dining on scraps from Tony's Italian restaurant and protecting his fellow strays Peg (a Pekingese) and Bull (a bulldog) from the local dogcatcher. One day, Lady is saddened after her owners begin treating her rather coldly. Jock and Trusty visit her and determine that their change in behavior is due to Darling expecting a baby. While Jock and Trusty try to explain what a baby is, Tramp interrupts the conversation and offers his own thoughts on the matter, making Jock and Trusty take an immediate dislike to the stray and order him out of the yard. As Tramp leaves, he reminds Lady that \\"when the baby moves in, the dog moves out.\\"\\r\\nEventually, the baby arrives and the couple introduces Lady to the infant, of whom Lady grows fond. Soon after, Jim Dear and Darling leave for a trip, with their Aunt Sarah looking after the baby and the house. Aunt Sarah's two trouble-making Siamese cats, Si and Am, deliberately mess up the house and trick her into thinking that Lady attacked them. Aunt Sarah then takes Lady to a pet shop to get a muzzle. Terrifed, Lady flees, only to be pursued by a trio of stray dogs. Tramp rescues her and finds a beaver at the local zoo who can remove the muzzle. Later, Tramp shows Lady how he lives \\"footloose and collar-free\\", eventually leading into a candlelit dinner at Tony's. Lady begins to fall in love with Tramp, but she chooses to return home in order to watch over the baby. Tramp offers to escort Lady back home, but when Tramp decides to chase hens around a farmyard for fun, Lady is captured by the dog catcher and brought to the local dog pound. While at the pound, the other dogs (including Peg and Bull, who have been caught) reveal to Lady that Tramp previously had multiple girlfriends and feel it is unlikely he will ever settle down. She is eventually claimed by Aunt Sarah, who chains her in the backyard as punishment for running away.\\r\\nJock and Trusty visit to comfort Lady, but when Tramp arrives to apologize, Lady angrily confronts him about his past girlfriends and failure to rescue her from the pound. Tramp sadly leaves, but immediately thereafter a rat sneaks into the house. Lady sees the rat and barks frantically at it, but Aunt Sarah tells her to be quiet. Tramp hears her barking and rushes back, entering the house and cornering the rat in the nursery. Lady breaks free and rushes to the nursery, where Tramp inadvertently knocks over the baby's crib before ultimately killing the rat. The commotion alerts Aunt Sarah, who sees both dogs and thinks they are responsible. She pushes Tramp in a closet and locks Lady in the basement, then calls the pound to take Tramp away. Jim Dear and Darling return home as the dog catcher departs, and when they release Lady, she leads them to the dead rat. Overhearing everything, Jock and Trusty chase after the dog catcher's wagon. The dogs are able to track down the wagon and scare the horses, causing the wagon to crash. Jim Dear arrives in a taxi with Lady, and she reunites with Tramp, but their joy is short-lived when they find Trusty pinned underneath the wagon's wheel, motionless, with Jock howling mournfully.\\r\\nThat Christmas, Tramp has been adopted into the family, and he and Lady have started their own family, with three daughters who look like Lady and a son who looks similar to Tramp. Jock comes to see the family along with Trusty, who is still alive and merely suffered a broken leg, which is still healing. Thanks to the puppies, Trusty has a fresh audience for his old stories about his Grandpappy Old Reliable, but he has forgotten them.\\r\\nIn 1937, Disney story man Joe Grant came up with an idea inspired by the antics of his English Springer Spaniel Lady, and how she got \\"shoved aside\\" by Joe's new baby. He approached Walt Disney with sketches of Lady. Disney enjoyed the sketches and commissioned Grant to start story development on a new animated feature entitled Lady.[3] Through the late 1930s and early 1940s, Joe Grant and other artists worked on the story, taking a variety of approaches, but Disney was not pleased with any of them, primarily because he thought Lady was too sweet, and there was not enough action.[3]\\r\\nIn the early 1940s, Walt read the short story written by Ward Greene, \\"Happy Dan, The Whistling Dog\\", in Cosmopolitan magazine.[4] He thought Grant's story would be improved if Lady fell in love with a cynical dog character like the one in Greene's story and bought the rights to it.[5] The cynical dog had various names during development, including Homer, Rags, and Bozo, before \\"Tramp\\" was chosen.[4]\\r\\nThe finished film is slightly different from what was originally planned. Lady was to have only one next-door neighbor, a Ralph Bellamy-type canine named Hubert. Hubert was later replaced by Jock and Trusty. Aunt Sarah was the traditional overbearing mother-in-law. In the final film, she is softened to a busybody. Aunt Sarah's Nip and Tuck were later renamed Si and Am.[4] Originally, Lady's owners were called Jim Brown and Elizabeth. These were changed to highlight Lady's point of view. They were briefly referred to as \\"Mister\\" and \\"Missis\\" before settling on the names \\"Jim Dear\\" and \\"Darling\\". To maintain a dog's perspective, Darling and Jim's faces are rarely shown, similar to Mammy Two Shoes in the Tom and Jerry cartoons. The rat was a somewhat comic character in early sketches, but became a great deal more frightening, due to the need to raise dramatic tension. A scene created but then deleted was one in which after Trusty says \\"Everybody knows, a dog's best friend is his human\\", Tramp describes a world in which the roles of both dogs and humans are switched; the dogs are the masters and vice versa.[3] There was a love triangle among Lady, Tramp, and a Russian wolfhound named Boris (who appears in the dog pound in the final version).[6]\\r\\nThe film's opening sequence, in which Darling unwraps a hat box on Christmas morning and finds Lady inside, is inspired by an incident when Walt Disney presented his wife Lily with a Chow puppy as a gift in a hat box.[7]\\r\\nIn 1949, Grant left the studio, yet Disney story men were continually pulling Grant's original drawings and story off the shelf to retool.[3] A solid story began taking shape in 1953,[5] based on Grant's storyboards and Greene's short story.[3] Greene later wrote a novelization of the film that was released two years before the film itself, at Walt Disney's insistence, so that audiences would be familiar with the story.[8] Grant did not receive film credit for his story work, an issue that animation director Eric Goldberg hoped to rectify in the Lady and the Tramp Platinum Edition's behind-the-scenes vignette that explained Grant's role.[3]\\r\\nSinger Peggy Lee not only voiced four characters but co-wrote six songs for the movie.[9]\\r\\nAs they had done with deer on Bambi, the animators studied many dogs of different breeds to capture the movement and personality of dogs. Although the spaghetti eating sequence is probably now the best known scene from the film, Walt Disney was prepared to cut it, thinking that it would not be romantic and that dogs eating spaghetti would look silly. Animator Frank Thomas was against Walt's decision and animated the entire scene himself without any lay-outs. Walt was impressed by Thomas's work and how he romanticized the scene and kept the scene in.[3] On viewing the first take of the scene, the animators felt that the action should be slowed down, so an apprentice trainee was assigned to create \\"half numbers\\" in between many of the original frames.[10]\\r\\nOriginally, the background artist was supposed to be Mary Blair and she did some inspirational sketches for the film. However, she left the studio to become a children's book illustrator in 1953. Claude Coats was then appointed as the key background artist. Coats made models of the interiors of Jim Dear and Darling's house, and shot photos and film at a low perspective as reference to maintain a dog's view.[8] Eyvind Earle (who later became the art director of Disney's Sleeping Beauty) did almost 50 miniature concept sketches for the Bella Notte sequence and was a key contributor to the film.[8]\\r\\nOriginally, Lady and the Tramp was planned to be filmed in a regular full frame aspect ratio. However, due to the growing interest of widescreen film among movie-goers, Disney decided to animate the film in CinemaScope making Lady and the Tramp the first animated feature filmed in the process.[4] This new innovation presented additional problems for the animators: the expansion of space created more realism but gave fewer closeups.[5] It also made it difficult for a single character to dominate the screen so that groups had to be spread out to keep the screen from appearing sparse.[4] Longer takes become necessary since constant jump-cutting would seem too busy or annoying.[2] Layout artists essentially had to reinvent their technique. Animators had to remember that they had to move their characters across a background instead of the background passing behind them.[5] Yet the animators overcame these obstacles during the action scenes, such as Tramp killing the rat.[2]\\r\\nMore problems arose as the premiere date got closer since not all theaters had the capability to show CinemaScope at the time. Upon learning this, Walt issued two versions of the film: one in widescreen, and another in the Academy ratio. This involved gathering the layout artists to restructure key scenes when characters were on the edges of the screen.[11]\\r\\nLady and the Tramp was originally released to theaters on June 22, 1955. At the time, the film took in a higher figure than any other Disney animated feature since Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs,[12] earning an estimated $7.5 million in rentals at the North American box office in 1955.[13] An episode of Disneyland called \\"A Story of Dogs\\" aired before the film's release.[14] The film was also reissued to theaters in 1962, 1972, 1980, and 1986. Lady and the Tramp also played a limited engagement in select Cinemark Theatres from February 16ÿ18, 2013.[15]\\r\\nLady and the Tramp was first released on North American VHS and Laserdisc in 1987 as part of the Walt Disney Classics video series and in the UK in 1990. It was released on VHS in 1998 as part of the Walt Disney Masterpiece Collection video series. A Disney Limited Issue series DVD of the film was released on November 23, 1999.\\r\\nAfter the first release on video tapes, Peggy Lee sought performance and song royalties on the video sales. Disney CEO Eisner refused, thus she filed suite in 1988. Eventually in 1992, the California Court of Appeals order Disney to pay Lee $3.2 million in compensation or about a 4% on the video sales.[9]\\r\\nLady and the Tramp was remastered and restored for DVD on February 28, 2006, as the seventh installment of Disney's Platinum Editions series.[16] One million copies of the Platinum Edition were sold on February 28, 2006.[17] The Platinum Edition DVD went on moratorium on January 31, 2007, along with the 2006 DVD reissue of the film's sequel Lady and the Tramp II: Scamp's Adventure.[18]\\r\\nLady and the Tramp was released on Blu-ray on February 7, 2012 as a part of Disney's Diamond Editions series.[19] A standalone 1-disc DVD edition was released on March 20, 2012.[20][21]\\r\\nDespite being an enormous success at the box office, the film was also initially panned by critics; one indicated that the dogs had \\"the dimensions of hippos\\", another that \\"the artists' work is below par\\".[22]\\r\\nHowever, the film has since gone on to become regarded as a classic. The sequence of Lady and Tramp sharing a plate of spaghetti  climaxed by an accidental kiss as they swallow opposite ends of the same strand of spaghetti  is considered an iconic scene in American film history.[23]\\r\\nLady and the Tramp was named number 95 out of the \\"100 Greatest Love Stories of All Time\\" by the American Film Institute in their 100 Years...100 Passions special, as one of only two animated films to appear on the list, along with Disney's Beauty and the Beast which ranked 34th.[24] In 2010, Rhapsody called its accompanying soundtrack one of the all-time great Disney and Pixar soundtracks.[25] In June 2011, TIME named it one of \\"The 25 All-TIME Best Animated Films\\".[26]\\r\\nThe review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported that the film received an 89% approval rating with an average rating of 7.6/10 based on 38 reviews. The website's consensus states that \\"A nostalgic charmer, Lady and the Tramp's token sweetness is mighty but the songs and richly colored animation are technically superb and make for a memorable experience.\\"[27]\\r\\nThe score for the film was composed and conducted by Oliver Wallace. Recording artist Peggy Lee wrote the songs with Sonny Burke and assisted with the score as well.[4] In the film, she sings \\"La La Lu\\", \\"The Siamese Cat Song\\", and \\"He's a Tramp\\".[36] She helped promote the film on the Disney TV series, explaining her work with the score and singing a few of the film's numbers.[4] These appearances are available as part of the Lady and the Tramp Platinum Edition DVD set.\\r\\nOn November 16, 1988, Peggy Lee sued the Walt Disney Company for breach of contract, claiming that she retained the rights to transcriptions of the music, arguing that videotape editions were transcriptions.[37] After a protracted legal battle, she was awarded $2.3 million in 1991.[38]\\r\\nThe remastered soundtrack of Lady and the Tramp was released on CD by Walt Disney Records on September 9, 1997, and was released as a digital download on September 26, 2006.[39]\\r\\nOn February 27, 2001, Disney Television Animation released a direct-to-video sequel to the film entitled Lady and the Tramp II: Scamp's Adventure. Produced 46 years after its predecessor, the film centers on the adventures of Lady and Tramp's only son, Scamp, who desires to be a wild dog. He runs away from his family and joins a gang of junkyard dogs to fulfill his longing for freedom and a life without rules. Reviews for the sequel were generally mixed to negative, with critics panning its plot.","input":"When was lady and the tramp last released?"},{"output":"Lake Superior","context":"The Great Lakes (French: les Grands-Lacs), also called the Laurentian Great Lakes[1] and the Great Lakes of North America, are a series of interconnected freshwater lakes located primarily in the upper mid-east region of North America, on the CanadaÿUnited States border, which connect to the Atlantic Ocean through the Saint Lawrence River. They consist of Lakes Superior, Michigan, Huron (or MichiganÿHuron), Erie, and Ontario.\\r\\nThe Great Lakes is the largest group of freshwater lakes on Earth by total area, and second largest by total volume containing 21% of the world's surface fresh water by volume.[2][3][4] The total surface is 94,250 square miles (244,106?km2), and the total volume (measured at the low water datum) is 5,439 cubic miles (22,671?km3)[5], a bit less than the volume of Lake Baikal (23,615 km3). Due to their sea-like characteristics (rolling waves, sustained winds, strong currents, great depths, and distant horizons) the five Great Lakes have also long been referred to as inland seas.[6] Lake Superior is the second largest lake in the world by area, and Lake Michigan is the largest lake that is entirely within one country.[7][8][9][10]\\r\\nThe Great Lakes began to form at the end of the last glacial period around 14,000 years ago, as retreating ice sheets exposed the basins they had carved into the land which then filled with meltwater.[11] The lakes have been a major highway for transportation, migration, and trade, and they are home to a large number of aquatic species. Many invasive species have been introduced due to trade, and some threaten the region's biodiversity.\\r\\nThe surrounding region is called the Great Lakes region, which includes the Great Lakes Megalopolis.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThough the five lakes reside in separate basins, they form a single, naturally interconnected body of fresh water, within the Great Lakes Basin. The lakes form a chain connecting the east-central interior of North America to the Atlantic Ocean. From the interior to the outlet at the Saint Lawrence River, water flows from Superior to Huron and Michigan, southward to Erie, and finally northward to Lake Ontario. The lakes drain a large watershed via many rivers, and are studded with approximately 35,000 islands.[13] There are also several thousand smaller lakes, often called \\"inland lakes,\\" within the basin.[14] The surface area of the five primary lakes combined is roughly equal to the size of the United Kingdom, while the surface area of the entire basin (the lakes and the land they drain) is about the size of the UK and France combined.[15] Lake Michigan is the only one of the Great Lakes that is located entirely within the United States; the others form a water boundary between the United States and Canada. The lakes are divided among the jurisdictions of the Canadian province of Ontario and the U.S. states of Michigan, Wisconsin, Minnesota, Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and New York. Both Ontario and Michigan include in their boundaries portions of four of the lakes: Ontario does not border Lake Michigan, and Michigan does not border Lake Ontario. New York and Wisconsin's jurisdictions extend into two lakes, and the remaining states into one of the lakes.\\r\\nAs the surfaces of Lakes Superior, Huron, Michigan, and Erie are all approximately the same elevation above sea level, while Lake Ontario is significantly lower, and because the Niagara Escarpment precludes all natural navigation, the four upper lakes are commonly called the \\"upper great lakes\\". This designation, however, is not universal. Those living on the shore of Lake Superior often refer to all the other lakes as \\"the lower lakes\\", because they are farther south. Sailors of bulk freighters transferring cargoes from Lake Superior and northern Lake Michigan and Lake Huron to ports on Lake Erie or Ontario commonly refer to the latter as the lower lakes and Lakes Michigan, Huron, and Superior as the upper lakes. This corresponds to thinking of Lakes Erie and Ontario as \\"down south\\" and the others as \\"up north\\". Vessels sailing north on Lake Michigan are considered \\"upbound\\" even though they are sailing toward its effluent current.[25]\\r\\nLakes Huron and Michigan are sometimes considered a single lake, called Lake MichiganÿHuron, because they are one hydrological body of water connected by the Straits of Mackinac.[26] The straits are 5 miles (8?km) wide[15] and 120 feet (37?m) deep; the water levels ÿ currently at 577 feet (176?m) ÿ rise and fall together,[27] and the flow between Michigan and Huron frequently reverses direction.\\r\\nDispersed throughout the Great Lakes are approximately 35,000 islands.[13] The largest among them is Manitoulin Island in Lake Huron, the largest island in any inland body of water in the world.[34] The second-largest island is Isle Royale in Lake Superior.[35] Both of these islands are large enough to contain multiple lakes themselvesfor instance, Manitoulin Island's Lake Manitou is the world's largest lake located on a freshwater island.[36]\\r\\nThe Saint Lawrence Seaway and Great Lakes Waterway make the Great Lakes accessible to ocean-going vessels.[37] However, shifts in shipping to wider ocean-going container shipswhich do not fit through the locks on these routeshave limited container shipping on the lakes. Most Great Lakes trade is of bulk material, and bulk freighters of Seawaymax-size or less can move throughout the entire lakes and out to the Atlantic.[38] Larger ships are confined to working in the lakes themselves. Only barges can access the Illinois Waterway system providing access to the Gulf of Mexico via the Mississippi River. Despite their vast size, large sections of the Great Lakes freeze over in winter, interrupting most shipping from January to March. Some icebreakers ply the lakes, keeping the shipping lanes open through other periods of ice on the lakes.\\r\\nThe Great Lakes are also connected by canal to the Gulf of Mexico by way of the Illinois River (from the Chicago River) and the Mississippi River. An alternate track is via the Illinois River (from Chicago), to the Mississippi, up the Ohio, and then through the TennesseeÿTombigbee Waterway (a combination of a series of rivers and lakes and canals), to Mobile Bay and the Gulf. Commercial tug-and-barge traffic on these waterways is heavy.[39]\\r\\nPleasure boats can also enter or exit the Great Lakes by way of the Erie Canal and Hudson River in New York. The Erie Canal connects to the Great Lakes at the east end of Lake Erie (at Buffalo, New York) and at the south side of Lake Ontario (at Oswego, New York).\\r\\nIn 2009, the lakes contained 84% of the surface freshwater of North America;[40] if the water were evenly distributed over the entire continent's land area, it would reach a depth of 1.5 meters (5 feet).[15] The source of water levels in the lakes is tied to what was left by melting glaciers when the lakes took their present form. Annually, only about 1% is \\"new\\" water originating from rivers, precipitation, and groundwater springs that drain into the lakes. Historically, evaporation has been balanced by drainage, making the level of the lakes constant.[15] While the lake levels have been preserved, intensive human population growth only began in the region in the 20th century and continues today.[15] At least two human water use activities have been identified as having the potential to affect the lakes' levels: diversion (the transfer of water to other watersheds) and consumption (substantially done today by the use of lake water to power and cool electric generation plants, resulting in evaporation).[41]\\r\\nThe water level of Lake MichiganÿHuron had remained fairly constant over the 20th century,[42] but has nevertheless dropped more than 6 feet from the record high in 1986 to the low of 2013.[43] One newspaper reported that the long-term average level has gone down about 20 inches because of dredging and subsequent erosion in the St. Clair River. Lake MichiganÿHuron hit all-time record low levels in 2013; according to the US Army Corps of Engineers, the previous record low had been set in 1964.[43] By April 2015 the water level had recovered to 7 inches (17.5?cm) more than the \\"long term monthly average\\".[44]\\r\\nThe Great Lakes contained 21% of the world's surface fresh water around the year 2000: 5,472 cubic miles (22,810?km3), or 6.0G1015 U.S.?gallons (2.3G1016 liters). This is enough water to cover the 48 contiguous U.S. states to a uniform depth of 9.5 feet (2.9?m). Although the lakes contain a large percentage of the world's fresh water, the Great Lakes supply only a small portion of U.S. drinking water on a national basis.[51]\\r\\nThe total surface area of the lakes is approximately 94,250 square miles (244,100?km2)nearly the same size as the United Kingdom, and larger than the U.S. states of New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Rhode Island, Massachusetts, Vermont, and New Hampshire combined.[52]\\r\\nThe Great Lakes coast measures approximately 10,500 miles (16,900?km);[15] however, the length of a coastline is impossible to measure exactly and is not a well-defined measure (see Coastline paradox). Of the total 10,500 miles (16,900?km) of shoreline, Canada borders approximately 5,200 miles (8,400?km), while the remaining 5,300 miles (8,500?km) are bordered by the United States. Michigan has the longest shoreline of the United States, bordering roughly 3,288 miles (5,292?km) of shoreline, followed by Wisconsin (820 miles (1,320?km)), New York (473 miles (761?km)), and Ohio (312 miles (502?km)).[53] Traversing the shoreline of all the lakes would cover a distance roughly equivalent to travelling half-way around the world at the equator.[15]\\r\\nIt has been estimated that the foundational geology that created the conditions shaping the present day upper Great Lakes was laid from 1.1 to 1.2 billion years ago,[15][54] when two previously fused tectonic plates split apart and created the Midcontinent Rift, which crossed the Great Lakes Tectonic Zone. A valley was formed providing a basin that eventually became modern day Lake Superior. When a second fault line, the Saint Lawrence rift, formed approximately 570?million years ago,[15] the basis for Lakes Ontario and Erie were created, along with what would become the Saint Lawrence River.\\r\\nThe Great Lakes are estimated to have been formed at the end of the last glacial period (the Wisconsin glaciation ended 10,000 to 12,000 years ago), when the Laurentide Ice Sheet receded.[11] The retreat of the ice sheet left behind a large amount of meltwater (see Lake Algonquin and Lake Chicago) that filled up the basins that the glaciers had carved, thus creating the Great Lakes as we know them today.[55] Because of the uneven nature of glacier erosion, some higher hills became Great Lakes islands. The Niagara Escarpment follows the contour of the Great Lakes between New York and Wisconsin. See also Glacial Lake Iroquois and Champlain Sea.\\r\\nLand below the glaciers \\"rebounded\\" as it was uncovered.[56] Because the glaciers covered some areas longer than others, this glacial rebound occurred at different rates.\\r\\nThe Great Lakes have a humid continental climate, K?ppen climate classification Dfa (in southern areas) and Dfb (in northern parts)[57] with varying influences from air masses from other regions including dry, cold Arctic systems, mild Pacific air masses from the West, and warm, wet tropical systems from the south and the Gulf of Mexico.[58] The lakes themselves also have a moderating effect on the climate; they can also increase precipitation totals and produce lake effect snowfall.[57]\\r\\nThe most well-known winter effect of the Great Lakes on regional weather is the lake effect in snowfall, which is sometimes very localized. Even late in winter, the lakes often have no icepack in the middle. The prevailing winds from the west pick up the air and moisture from the lake surface, which is slightly warmer in relation to the cold surface winds above. As the slightly warmer, moist air passes over the colder land surface, the moisture often produces concentrated, heavy snowfall that sets up in bands or \\"streamers\\". This is similar to the effect of warmer air dropping snow as it passes over mountain ranges. During freezing weather with high winds, the \\"snow belts\\" receive regular snow fall from this localized weather pattern, especially along the eastern shores of the lakes. Snow belts are found in Wisconsin, Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and New York, United States; and Ontario, Canada.\\r\\nThe lakes also moderate seasonal temperatures to some degree, but not with as large an influence as do large oceans; they absorb heat and cool the air in summer, then slowly radiate that heat in autumn. They protect against frost during transitional weather, and keep the summertime temperatures cooler than further inland. This effect can be very localized and overridden by offshore wind patterns. This temperature buffering produces areas known as \\"fruit belts\\", where fruit can be produced that is typically grown much farther south. For instance, Western Michigan has apple and cherry orchards, and vineyards cultivated adjacent to the lake shore as far north as the Grand Traverse Bay and Nottawasaga Bay in central Ontario. The eastern shore of Lake Michigan and the southern shore of Lake Erie have many successful wineries because of the moderating effect, as does the Niagara Peninsula between Lake Erie and Lake Ontario. A similar phenomenon allows wineries to flourish in the Finger Lakes region of New York, as well as in Prince Edward County, Ontario on Lake Ontario's northeast shore. Related to the lake effect is the regular occurrence of fog over medium-sized areas, particularly along the shorelines of the lakes. This is most noticeable along Lake Superior's shores.\\r\\nThe Great Lakes have been observed to help intensify storms, such as Hurricane Hazel in 1954, and the 2011 Goderich, Ontario tornado, which moved onshore as a tornadic waterspout. In 1996 a rare tropical or subtropical storm was observed forming in Lake Huron, dubbed the 1996 Lake Huron cyclone. Rather large severe thunderstorms covering wide areas are well known in the Great Lakes during mid-summer; these Mesoscale convective complexs or MCCs[59] can cause damage to wide swaths of forest and shatter glass in city buildings. These storms mainly occur during the night, and the systems sometimes have small embedded tornadoes, but more often straight-line winds accompanied by intense lightning.\\r\\nHistorically, the Great Lakes, in addition to their lake ecology, were surrounded by various forest ecoregions (except in a relatively small area of southeast Lake Michigan where savanna or prairie occasionally intruded). Logging, urbanization, and agriculture uses have changed that relationship. In the early 21st century, Lake Superior's shores are 91% forested, Lake Huron 68%, Lake Ontario 49%, Lake Michigan 41%, and Lake Erie, where logging and urbanization has been most extensive, 21%. Some of these forests are second or third growth (i.e. they have been logged before, changing their composition). At least 13 wildlife species are documented as becoming extinct since the arrival of Europeans, and many more are threatened or endangered.[15] Meanwhile, exotic and invasive species have also been introduced.\\r\\nThe organisms living on the bottom of shallow waters are similar to those found in smaller lakes. The deep waters, however, contain organisms found only in deep, cold lakes of the northern latitudes. These include the delicate opossum shrimp (order mysida), the deepwater scud (a crustacean of the order amphipoda), two types of copepods, and the deepwater sculpin (a spiny, large-headed fish).[61]\\r\\nThe Great Lakes are an important source of fishing. Early European settlers were astounded by both the variety and quantity of fish; there were 150 different species in the Great Lakes.[15] Throughout history, fish populations were the early indicator of the condition of the Lakes and have remained one of the key indicators even in the current era of sophisticated analyses and measuring instruments. According to the bi-national (U.S. and Canadian) resource book, The Great Lakes: An Environmental Atlas and Resource Book: \\"The largest Great Lakes fish harvests were recorded in 1889 and 1899 at some 67,000 tonnes (66,000 long tons; 74,000 short tons) [147 million pounds].\\"[62]\\r\\nBy 1801, the New York Legislature found it necessary to pass regulations curtailing obstructions to the natural migrations of Atlantic salmon from Lake Erie into their spawning channels. In the early 19th century, the government of Upper Canada found it necessary to introduce similar legislation prohibiting the use of weirs and nets at the mouths of Lake Ontario's tributaries. Other protective legislation was passed, as well, but enforcement remained difficult.[63]\\r\\nOn both sides of the CanadaÿUnited States border, the proliferation of dams and impoundments have multiplied, necessitating more regulatory efforts. Concerns by the mid-19th century included obstructions in the rivers which prevented salmon and lake sturgeon from reaching their spawning grounds. The Wisconsin Fisheries Commission noted a reduction of roughly 25% in general fish harvests by 1875. The states have removed dams from rivers where necessary.[clarification needed][64]\\r\\nOverfishing has been cited as a possible reason for a decrease in population of various whitefish, important because of their culinary desirability and, hence, economic consequence. Moreover, between 1879 and 1899, reported whitefish harvests declined from some 24.3 million pounds (11 million?kg) to just over 9 million pounds (4 million?kg).[65] By 1900, commercial fishermen on Lake Michigan were hauling in an average of 41 million pounds of fish annually.[66] By 1938, Wisconsin's commercial fishing operations were motorized and mechanized, generating jobs for more than 2,000 workers, and hauling 14 million pounds per year.[66] The population of giant freshwater mussels was eliminated as the mussels were harvested for use as buttons by early Great Lakes entrepreneurs.[65] Since 2000, the invasive quagga mussel has smothered the bottom of Lake Michigan almost from shore to shore, and their numbers are estimated at 900 trillion.[66]\\r\\nThe influx of parasitic lamprey populations after the development of the Erie Canal and the much later Welland Canal led to the two federal governments of the US and Canada working on joint proposals to control it. By the mid-1950s, the lake trout populations of Lakes Michigan and Huron were reduced, with the lamprey deemed largely to blame. This led to the launch of the bi-national Great Lakes Fishery Commission.\\r\\nThe Great Lakes: An Environmental Atlas and Resource Book (1972) noted: \\"Only pockets remain of the once large commercial fishery.\\"[62] But, water quality improvements realized during the 1970s and 1980s, combined with successful salmonid stocking programs, have enabled the growth of a large recreational fishery.[67] The last commercial fisherman left Milwaukee in 2011 because of overfishing and anthropogenic changes to the biosphere.[66]\\r\\nSince the 19th century an estimated 160 new species have found their way into the Great Lakes ecosystem; many have become invasive; the overseas ship ballast and ship hull parasitism are causing severe economic and ecological impacts.[68][69] According to the Inland Seas Education Association, on average a new species enters the Great Lakes every eight months.[69]\\r\\nIntroductions into the Great Lakes include the zebra mussel, which was first discovered in 1988, and quagga mussel in 1989. The mollusks are efficient filter feeders, competing with native mussels and reducing available food and spawning grounds for fish. In addition, the mussels may be a nuisance to industries by clogging pipes. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service estimates that the economic impact of the zebra mussel could be about $5?billion over the next decade.[70]\\r\\nThe alewife first entered the system west of Lake Ontario via 19th-century canals. By the 1960s, the small silver fish had become a familiar nuisance to beach goers across Lakes Michigan, Huron, and Erie. Periodic mass dieoffs result in vast numbers of the fish washing up on shore; estimates by various governments have placed the percentage of Lake Michigan's biomass, which was made up of alewives in the early 1960s, as high as 90%. In the late 1960s, the various state and federal governments began stocking several species of salmonids, including the native lake trout as well as non-native chinook and coho salmon; by the 1980s, alewife populations had dropped drastically.[71] The ruffe, a small percid fish from Eurasia, became the most abundant fish species in Lake Superior's Saint Louis River within five years of its detection in 1986. Its range, which has expanded to Lake Huron, poses a significant threat to the lower lake fishery.[72] Five years after first being observed in the St. Clair River, the round goby can now be found in all of the Great Lakes. The goby is considered undesirable for several reasons: it preys upon bottom-feeding fish, overruns optimal habitat, spawns multiple times a season, and can survive poor water quality conditions.[73]\\r\\nSeveral species of exotic water fleas have accidentally been introduced into the Great Lakes, such as the spiny waterflea, Bythotrephes longimanus, and the fishhook waterflea, Cercopagis pengoi, potentially having an effect on the zooplankton population. Several species of crayfish have also been introduced that may contend with native crayfish populations. More recently an electric fence has been set up across the Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal in order to keep several species of invasive Asian carp out of the area. These fast-growing planktivorous fish have heavily colonized the Mississippi and Illinois river systems.[74] The sea lamprey, which has been particularly damaging to the native lake trout population, is another example of a marine invasive species in the Great Lakes.[75] Invasive species, particularly zebra and quagga mussels, may be at least partially responsible for the collapse of the deepwater demersal fish community in Lake Huron,[76] as well as drastic unprecedented changes in the zooplankton community of the lake.[77]\\r\\nNative habitats and ecoregions in the Great Lakes region include:\\r\\nPlant lists include:\\r\\nLogging\\r\\nLogging of the extensive forests in the Great Lakes region removed riparian and adjacent tree cover over rivers and streams, which provide shade, moderating water temperatures in fish spawning grounds. Removal of trees also destabilized the soil, with greater volumes washed into stream beds causing siltation of gravel beds, and more frequent flooding.\\r\\nRunning cut logs down the tributary rivers into the Great Lakes also dislocated sediments. In 1884, the New York Fish Commission determined that the dumping of sawmill waste (chips and sawdust) had impacted fish populations.[78]\\r\\nThe first U.S. Clean Water Act, passed by a Congressional override after being vetoed by US President Richard Nixon in 1972, was a key piece of legislation,[79] along with the bi-national Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement signed by Canada and the U.S. A variety of steps taken to process industrial and municipal pollution discharges into the system greatly improved water quality by the 1980s, and Lake Erie in particular is significantly cleaner.[80] Discharge of toxic substances has been sharply reduced. Federal and state regulations control substances like PCBs. The first of 43 \\"Great Lakes Areas of Concern\\" to be formally \\"de-listed\\" due to successful cleanup was Ontario's Collingwood Harbour in 1994; Ontario's Severn Sound followed in 2003.[81] Presque Isle Bay in Pennsylvania is formally listed as in recovery, as is Ontario's Spanish Harbour. Dozens of other Areas of Concern have received partial cleanups such as the Rouge River (Michigan) and Waukegan Harbor (Illinois).[82]\\r\\nUntil 1970, mercury was not listed as a harmful chemical, according to the United States Federal Water Quality Administration. Within the past ten years mercury has become more apparent in water tests. Mercury compounds have been used in paper mills to prevent slime from forming during their production, and chemical companies have used mercury to separate chlorine from brine solutions. Studies conducted by the Environmental Protection Agency have shown that when the mercury comes in contact with many of the bacteria and compounds in the fresh water, it forms the compound methyl mercury, which has a much greater impact on human health than elemental mercury due to a higher propensity for absorption. This form of mercury is not detrimental to a majority of fish types, but is very detrimental to people and other wildlife animals who consume the fish. Mercury has been known for health related problems such as birth defects in humans and animals, and the near extinction of eagles in the Great Lakes region.[83]\\r\\nThe amount of raw sewage dumped into the waters was the primary focus of both the first Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement and federal laws passed in both countries during the 1970s. Implementation of secondary treatment of municipal sewage by major cities greatly reduced the routine discharge of untreated sewage during the 1970s and 1980s.[84] The International Joint Commission in 2009 summarized the change: \\"Since the early 1970s, the level of treatment to reduce pollution from waste water discharges to the Great Lakes has improved considerably. This is a result of significant expenditures to date on both infrastructure and technology, and robust regulatory systems that have proven to be, on the whole, quite effective.\\"[85] The commission reported that all urban sewage treatment systems on the U.S. side of the lakes had implemented secondary treatment, as had all on the Canadian side except for five small systems.[citation needed]\\r\\nHowever contrary to federal laws in both countries, those treatment system upgrades have not yet eliminated Combined sewer Overflow events.[citation needed] This describes when older sewerage systems, which combine storm water with sewage into single sewers heading to the treatment plant, are temporarily overwhelmed by heavy rainstorms. Local sewage treatment authorities then must release untreated effluent, a mix of rainwater and sewage, into local water bodies. While enormous public investments such as the Deep Tunnel projects in Chicago and Milwaukee have greatly reduced the frequency and volume of these events, they have not been eliminated. The number of such overflow events in Ontario, for example, is flat according to the International Joint Commission.[85] Reports about this issue on the U.S. side highlight five large municipal systems (those of Detroit, Cleveland, Buffalo, Milwaukee and Gary) as being the largest current periodic sources of untreated discharges into the Great Lakes.[86]\\r\\nPhosphate detergents were historically a major source of nutrient to the Great Lakes algae blooms in particular in the warmer and shallower portions of the system such as Lake Erie, Saginaw Bay, Green Bay, and the southernmost portion of Lake Michigan. By the mid-1980s, most jurisdictions bordering the Great Lakes had controlled phosphate detergents,[87] resulting in sharp reductions in the frequency and extent of the blooms.[citation needed]\\r\\nIn 2013, news of a garbage patch of plastic pollution in the lakes was reported.[88]\\r\\nSeveral Native American tribes inhabited the region since at least 1000 BC, after the end of the Wisconsin glaciation. The peoples of the Great Lakes traded with the Hopewell culture from around 1000 AD, as copper nuggets have been extracted from the region, and fashioned into ornaments and weapons in the mounds of Southern Ohio. The brigantine Le Griffon, which was commissioned by Ren-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle, was built at Cayuga Creek, near the southern end of the Niagara River, and became the first known sailing ship to travel the upper Great Lakes on August 7, 1679.[89]\\r\\nThe RushÿBagot Treaty signed in 1818, after the War of 1812 and the later Treaty of Washington eventually led to a complete disarmament of naval vessels in the Great Lakes. Nonetheless, both nations maintain coast guard vessels in the Great Lakes.\\r\\nDuring settlement, the Great Lakes and its rivers were the only practical means of moving people and freight. Barges from middle North America were able to reach the Atlantic Ocean from the Great Lakes when the Welland canal opened in 1824 and the later Erie Canal opened in 1825.[90] By 1848, with the opening of the Illinois and Michigan Canal at Chicago, direct access to the Mississippi River was possible from the lakes.[91] With these two canals an all-inland water route was provided between New York City and New Orleans.\\r\\nThe main business of many of the passenger lines in the 19th century was transporting immigrants. Many of the larger cities owe their existence to their position on the lakes as a freight destination as well as for being a magnet for immigrants. After railroads and surface roads developed, the freight and passenger businesses dwindled and, except for ferries and a few foreign cruise ships, has now vanished. The immigration routes still have an effect today. Immigrants often formed their own communities and some areas have a pronounced ethnicity, such as Dutch, German, Polish, Finnish, and many others. Since many immigrants settled for a time in New England before moving westward, many areas on the U.S. side of the Great Lakes also have a New England feel, especially in home styles and accent.\\r\\nSince general freight these days is transported by railroads and trucks, domestic ships mostly move bulk cargoes, such as iron ore, coal and limestone for the steel industry. The domestic bulk freight developed because of the nearby mines. It was more economical to transport the ingredients for steel to centralized plants rather than try to make steel on the spot. Grain exports are also a major cargo on the lakes.\\r\\nIn the 19th century and early 20th centuries, iron and other ores such as copper were shipped south on (downbound ships), and supplies, food, and coal were shipped north (upbound). Because of the location of the coal fields in Pennsylvania and West Virginia, and the general northeast track of the Appalachian Mountains, railroads naturally developed shipping routes that went due north to ports such as Erie, Pennsylvania and Ashtabula, Ohio.\\r\\nBecause the lake maritime community largely developed independently, it has some distinctive vocabulary. Ships, no matter the size, are called boats. When the sailing ships gave way to steamships, they were called steamboatsthe same term used on the Mississippi. The ships also have a distinctive design (see Lake freighter). Ships that primarily trade on the lakes are known as lakers. Foreign boats are known as salties. One of the more common sights on the lakes has been since about 1950 the 1,000?by?105-foot (305-by-32-meter), 78,850-long-ton (80,120-metric-ton) self-unloader. This is a laker with a conveyor belt system that can unload itself by swinging a crane over the side.[92] Today, the Great Lakes fleet is much smaller in numbers than it once was because of the increased use of overland freight, and a few larger ships replacing many small ones.\\r\\nDuring World War II, the risk of submarine attacks against coastal training facilities motivated the United States Navy to operate two aircraft carriers on the Great Lakes, USS?Sable?(IX-81) and USS?Wolverine?(IX-64). Both served as training ships to qualify naval aviators in carrier landing and takeoff.[93] Lake Champlain briefly became the sixth Great Lake of the United States on March 6, 1998, when President Clinton signed Senate Bill 927. This bill, which reauthorized the National Sea Grant Program, contained a line declaring Lake Champlain to be a Great Lake. Not coincidentally, this status allows neighboring states to apply for additional federal research and education funds allocated to these national resources.[94] Following a small uproar, the Senate voted to revoke the designation on March 24 (although New York and Vermont universities would continue to receive funds to monitor and study the lake).[95]\\r\\nIn the early years of the 21st century, water levels in the Great Lakes were a concern.[96] Researchers at the Mowat Centre said that low levels could cost $19bn by 2050.[97]\\r\\nExcept when the water is frozen during winter, more than 100 lake freighters operate continuously on the Great Lakes,[98] which remain a major water transport corridor for bulk goods. The Great Lakes Waterway connects all the lakes; the smaller Saint Lawrence Seaway connects the lakes to the Atlantic oceans. Some lake freighters are too large to use the Seaway, and only operate on the Waterway and lakes.\\r\\nIn 2002, 162 million net tons of dry bulk cargo were moved on the Lakes. This was, in order of volume: iron ore, grain and potash.[99] The iron ore and much of the stone and coal are used in the steel industry. There is also some shipping of liquid and containerized cargo but most container ships cannot pass the locks on the Saint Lawrence Seaway because the ships are too wide.\\r\\nOnly four bridges are on the Great Lakes other than Lake Ontario because of the cost of building structures high enough for ships to pass under. The Blue Water Bridge is, for example, more than 150 feet high and more than a mile long.[98]\\r\\nThe Great Lakes are used to supply drinking water to tens of millions of people in bordering areas. This valuable resource is collectively administered by the state and provincial governments adjacent to the lakes, who have agreed to the Great Lakes Compact to regulate water supply and use.\\r\\nTourism and recreation are major industries on the Great Lakes.[100] A few small cruise ships operate on the Great Lakes including a couple of sailing ships. Sport fishing, commercial fishing, and Native American fishing represent a U.S.$4 billion a year industry with salmon, whitefish, smelt, lake trout, bass and walleye being major catches. Many other water sports are practiced on the lakes such as yachting, sea kayaking, diving, kitesurfing, powerboating, and lake surfing.\\r\\nThe Great Lakes Circle Tour is a designated scenic road system connecting all of the Great Lakes and the Saint Lawrence River.[101]\\r\\nFrom 1844 through 1857, palace steamers carried passengers and cargo around the Great Lakes.[102] In the first half of the 20th century large luxurious passenger steamers sailed the lakes in opulence.[103] The Detroit and Cleveland Navigation Company had several vessels at the time and hired workers from all walks of life to help operate these vessels.[104] Several ferries currently operate on the Great Lakes to carry passengers to various islands, including Isle Royale, Drummond Island, Pelee Island, Mackinac Island, Beaver Island, Bois Blanc Island (Ontario), Bois Blanc Island (Michigan), Kelleys Island, South Bass Island, North Manitou Island, South Manitou Island, Harsens Island, Manitoulin Island, and the Toronto Islands. As of 2007, four car ferry services cross the Great Lakes, two on Lake Michigan: a steamer from Ludington, Michigan, to Manitowoc, Wisconsin, and a high speed catamaran from Milwaukee to Muskegon, Michigan, one on Lake Erie: a boat from Kingsville, Ontario, or Leamington, Ontario, to Pelee Island, Ontario, then onto Sandusky, Ohio, and one on Lake Huron: the M.S. Chi-Cheemaun [105] runs between Tobermory and South Baymouth, Manitoulin Island, operated by the Owen Sound Transportation Company. An international ferry across Lake Ontario Rochester, New York, to Toronto ran during 2004 and 2005, but is no longer in operation.\\r\\nThe large size of the Great Lakes increases the risk of water travel; storms and reefs are common threats. The lakes are prone to sudden and severe storms, in particular in the autumn, from late October until early December. Hundreds of ships have met their end on the lakes. The greatest concentration of shipwrecks lies near Thunder Bay (Michigan), beneath Lake Huron, near the point where eastbound and westbound shipping lanes converge.\\r\\nThe Lake Superior shipwreck coast from Grand Marais, Michigan, to Whitefish Point became known as the \\"Graveyard of the Great Lakes\\". More vessels have been lost in the Whitefish Point area than any other part of Lake Superior.[106] The Whitefish Point Underwater Preserve serves as an underwater museum to protect the many shipwrecks in this area.\\r\\nThe first ship to sink in Lake Michigan was Le Griffon, also the first ship to sail the Great Lakes. Caught in a 1679 storm while trading furs between Green Bay and Michilimacinac, she was lost with all hands aboard.[107] Its wreck may have been found in 2004,[108] but a wreck subsequently discovered in a different location was also claimed in 2014 to be Le Griffon.[109]\\r\\nThe largest and last major freighter wrecked on the lakes was the SS?Edmund Fitzgerald, which sank on November 10, 1975, just over 17 miles (30?km) offshore from Whitefish Point on Lake Superior. The largest loss of life in a shipwreck out on the lakes may have been that of Lady Elgin, wrecked in 1860 with the loss of around 400 lives on Lake Michigan. In an incident at a Chicago dock in 1915, the SS?Eastland rolled over while loading passengers, killing 841.\\r\\nIn August 2007, the Great Lakes Shipwreck Historical Society announced that it had found the wreckage of Cyprus, a 420-foot (130?m) long, century-old ore carrier. Cyprus sank during a Lake Superior storm on October 11, 1907, during its second voyage while hauling iron ore from Superior, Wisconsin, to Buffalo, New York. The entire crew of 23 drowned, except one, Charles Pitz, who floated on a life raft for almost seven hours.[110]\\r\\nIn June 2008, deep sea divers in Lake Ontario found the wreck of the 1780 Royal Navy warship HMS?Ontario in what has been described as an \\"archaeological miracle\\".[111] There are no plans to raise her as the site is being treated as a war grave.\\r\\nIn June 2010, L.R. Doty was found in Lake Michigan by an exploration diving team led by dive boat Captain Jitka Hanakova from her boat the Molly V.[112] The ship sank in October 1898, probably attempting to rescue a small schooner, Olive Jeanette, during a terrible storm.\\r\\nStill missing are the two last warships to sink in the Great Lakes, the French minesweepers, Inkerman and Cerisoles, which vanished in Lake Superior during a blizzard in 1918. 78 lives were lost making it the largest loss of life in Lake Superior and the greatest unexplained loss of life in the Great Lakes.\\r\\nRelated articles\\r\\nIn 1872, a treaty gave access to the St. Lawrence River to the United States, and access to Lake Michigan to the Dominion of Canada.[113] The International Joint Commission was established in 1909 to help prevent and resolve disputes relating to the use and quality of boundary waters, and to advise Canada and the United States on questions related to water resources. Concerns over diversion of Lake water are of concern to both Americans and Canadians. Some water is diverted through the Chicago River to operate the Illinois Waterway but the flow is limited by treaty. Possible schemes for bottled water plants and diversion to dry regions of the continent raise concerns. Under the U.S. \\"Water Resources Development Act\\",[114] diversion of water from the Great Lakes Basin requires the approval of all eight Great Lakes governors through the Great Lakes Commission, which rarely occurs. International treaties regulate large diversions.\\r\\nIn 1998, the Canadian company Nova Group won approval from the Province of Ontario to withdraw 158,000,000 U.S. gallons (600,000?m3) of Lake Superior water annually to ship by tanker to Asian countries. Public outcry forced the company to abandon the plan before it began. Since that time, the eight Great Lakes Governors and the Premiers of Ontario and Quebec have negotiated the Great Lakes-Saint Lawrence River Basin Sustainable Water Resources Agreement[115] and the Great Lakes-St. Lawrence River Basin Water Resources Compact[116] that would prevent most future diversion proposals and all long-distance ones. The agreements strengthen protection against abusive water withdrawal practices within the Great Lakes basin. On December 13, 2005, the Governors and Premiers signed these two agreements, the first of which is between all ten jurisdictions. It is somewhat more detailed and protective, though its legal strength has not yet been tested in court. The second, the Great Lakes Compact, has been approved by the state legislatures of all eight states that border the Great Lakes as well as the U.S. Congress, and was signed into law by President George W. Bush on October 3, 2008.[117]\\r\\nThe Great Lakes Restoration Initiative, described as \\"the largest investment in the Great Lakes in two decades,\\"[118] was funded at $475 million in the U.S. federal government's Fiscal Year 2011 budget, and $300 million in the Fiscal Year 2012 budget. Through the program a coalition of federal agencies is making grants to local and state entities for toxics cleanups, wetlands and coastline restoration projects, and invasive species-related projects.\\r\\nIn 2006, the United States Coast Guard (USCG) proposed a plan to designate 34 areas in the Great Lakes, at least 5?mi (8?km) offshore, as permanent safety zones for live fire machine gun practice. In August 2006, the plan was published in the Federal Register. The USCG reserved the right to hold target practice whenever the weather allowed with a two-hour notice. These firing ranges would be open to the public when not in use. In response to requests from the public, the Coast Guard held a series of public meetings in nine U.S. cities to solicit comment. During these meetings many people voiced concerns about the plan and its impact on the environment.[119] On December 18, 2006, the Coast Guard announced its decision to withdraw the entire proposal.[120] Officials said they would look into alternative ammunition, modifying the proposed zones and have more public dialogue before proposing a new plan.[121]\\r\\nDynamically updated data\\r\\nCoordinates: 4545N 840W? / ?45.750N 84.000W? / 45.750; -84.000","input":"Which great lake is the highest above sea level?"},{"output":"a museum operated by the government of Alabama, showcasing rockets, achievements, and artifacts of the U.S. space program","context":"The U.S. Space & Rocket Center in Huntsville, Alabama is a museum operated by the government of Alabama, showcasing rockets, achievements, and artifacts of the U.S. space program.

U.S. Space Camp gives an in-depth exposure to the space program through participant use of simulators, lectures, and training exercises. Similarly, Aviation Challenge offers a taste of military fighter pilot training including simulations, lectures, and survival exercises. Both camps provide residential and day camp educational programs for children and adults.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe U.S. Space & Rocket Center has one of the most extensive collections of space artifacts and displays more than 1500 pieces. Displays include rockets, engines, spacecraft, simulators, and hands-on exhibits.[9][10]\\r\\nThe Space & Rocket Center introduces visitors to U.S. rocketry efforts from its predecessor at Peenemnde with the German V-1 flying bomb, through a progression of U.S. military rockets up to the Saturn rocket family civilian rockets, and on to the Space Shuttle. The Saturn V Dynamic Test Vehicle, the only Saturn V of the three on display to have been brought together outside a museum, is displayed overhead in a new building designed specifically for the rocket. The Space Shuttle Pathfinder was the first Space Shuttle  a mockup made of steel and wood to test facilities for handling the vehicle  and it now sits atop an external tank with solid rocket boosters attached.\\r\\nThe center showcases significant military rockets, including representatives of the Project Nike series, which formed the first ballistic missile defense, MIM-23 Hawk surface-to-air missile, Hermes, an early surface-to-surface missile, MGR-1 Honest John and Corporal nuclear missiles and Patriot, first used in the Gulf War of 1991.\\r\\nThe rocketry collection includes numerous engines, as well. In addition to the authentic engines mounted on rockets on display, the museum has unmounted engines on display, including two F-1s, the type of gigantic engine that produced 1,500,000 pounds-force (6,700,000?N) to push Saturn Vs off the launch pad, J-2 engine that powered second and third stages of the Saturn V, and both Descent and Ascent Propulsion System (DPS/APS) engines for the Lunar Module. Engines from the V-2 engine to NERVA to the Space Shuttle Main Engine are on display as well.[10]\\r\\nThe Apollo program gets full coverage in the Davidson Center for Space Exploration with artifacts outlining Apollo missions. Astronauts crossed the service structure's red walkway to the White Room, both on display, and climbed in the Command Module atop a Saturn V which was their cabin for the trip to the moon and back. Apollo 16's command module is on display. The Saturn V Instrument Unit controlled five F-1 engines in the first stage of the rocket as it lifted off the pad. Several exhibits relate the complexity and magnitude of that phase of the journey. They took a Lunar Module (mockup on display) to the lunar surface where they collected moon rocks such as the Apollo 12 specimen at the museum. Later moon trips took a Lunar Rover (displayed beside the LM). The first few moon trips ended at a Mobile Quarantine Facility (Apollo 12's is on display) where astronauts stayed to ensure containment of any moon bugs after that mission.[11][12]\\r\\nA restored engineering mock-up of Skylab is also on display, showing the Apollo project's post-lunar efforts.[13][14]\\r\\nVarious simulators help visitors understand the spaceflight experience. Space Shot lets the rider experience launch-like 4 gs and 2ÿ3 seconds of weightlessness. G-Force Accelerator offers 3 gs of acceleration for an extended period by means of a centrifuge. Several other simulators entertain and educate visitors.[15]\\r\\nOther exhibits offer a hands-on understanding of concepts related to rocketry or space travel. A bell jar demonstrates the reason for using a rocket instead of a propeller in the vacuum of space. A wind tunnel offers visitors the opportunity to manipulate a model to see how forces change with its orientation, and The Mind of Saturn exhibit demonstrates gyroscopic force (necessary for rocket navigation). An Apollo trainer offers visitors the opportunity to climb in.[16]\\r\\nSome simulators on exhibit were used for astronaut training. A Project Mercury simulator shows the cramped conditions endured by the first Americans in space. A Gemini simulator shows visitors the accommodations when two people flew together to space for the first U.S. missions involving extra-vehicular activities and space rendezvous.[10]\\r\\nExhibits also cover the future of space flight. Two Orion CEV exhibits show the next NASA spacecraft, and a Bigelow Aerospace commercial habitat model details a space tourism effort.[17]\\r\\nTwo play areas offer places indoors and out for children to release some energy. The outdoor play area offers a miniature (and slower) Space Shot ride along with slides and tunnels, all under a canopy. The indoor area fosters imaginative play about a trip to Mars with a space ship and some cartoon \\"aliens\\".\\r\\nThe U.S. Space & Rocket Center is also the resting place of Miss Baker, a squirrel monkey who flew on a suborbital test flight of the PGM-19 Jupiter rocket on May 28, 1959. Baker lived in a facility at the Center from 1971 until she died of kidney failure in November 1984.[18]\\r\\nThe Space & Rocket Center offers bus tours of Marshall Space Flight Center. The tour offers views of all four National Historic Landmarks at the center including a stop at the landmark Redstone Test Stand, where Alan Shepard's Redstone Rocket was tested prior to launch.[19] Another scheduled stop is the Payload Operations and Integration Center, which serves as mission control for a number of experiments. Bus tours originally started July 4, 1972,[20] but were suspended following the September 11 attacks in 2001. Tours resumed July 20, 2012, the 43rd anniversary of the Apollo 11 moon landing, limited to United States citizens because of security protocol at the Army installation, Redstone Arsenal, which contains Marshall Space Flight Center.[7][21]\\r\\nIn the summer of 2010, the Space and Rocket Center began hosting traveling exhibits. The first was Star Wars: Where Science Meets Imagination with other exhibits planned. The United States Space Camp hosted at the facility has provided themed camps in conjunction with the exhibits, including a Jedi Experience camp.[22]\\r\\nOther traveling exhibits include:\\r\\nThe idea for the museum was first proposed by Dr. Wernher von Braun, who led the efforts of the United States to land the first man on the moon.[27] Plans for the museum were underway in 1960 with an economic feasibility study for the Huntsville-Madison County Chamber of Commerce.[28]\\r\\nVon Braun, understanding the dominance of football in the Alabama culture, persuaded rival Alabama and Auburn coaches Bear Bryant and Shug Jordan to appear in a television commercial supporting a $1.9 million statewide bond referendum to finance museum construction.[29] The referendum passed on November 30, 1965, and a donation of land from the Army's Redstone Arsenal provided a location on which to build.[30][5][31]\\r\\nTo help draw tourists from far afield, the center needed a crown jewel. The Huntsville Times reported, Center director \\"Edward O. Buckbee is the type of guy with the tenacity to 'arrange' for this planet's largest, most complex mechanical beast to become a part of the Alabama Space and Rocket Center at Huntsville. / Pulling off the coup ÿ getting a Saturn 5 moon rocket here which cost 90 times the center itself ÿ was 'a little difficult,' admits Buckbee in a galloping understatement.\\"[33] Buckbee worked with von Braun to see that the Saturn V Dynamic Test Vehicle would be delivered to the site as it was on June 28, 1969. The Saturn I which stands erect at the museum was delivered the same day.[34] Initial plans called for visitors to walk through the Saturn V.[32] The center opened in 1970.[5]\\r\\nThe Space & Rocket Center was a \\"major sponsor\\" of the United States pavilion at the 1982 World's Fair, providing exhibits on space and energy as well as equipment and operations for the IMAX theater at the fair. At the time, the Space & Rocket Center also served as the Alabama Energy Information Center.[35]\\r\\nMike Wing plunged the Center into debt as its executive director from 1998 to 1999.[36] Wing oversaw construction of a full-scale vertical Saturn V replica to be finished at by the 30th anniversary of the Apollo 11 moon landing, July 1999. It serves as a towering landmark in Huntsville, and cost the center $8.6 million of borrowed money. The Huntsville Times estimated interest costs at $10 million. Wing also sought to create a program for fifth grade students in Alabama and elsewhere to attend Space Camp at no cost to them. Anonymous corporate pledges that Wing promised would fund the $800 per student never arrived. Wing prolonged the Alabama Space Science Exhibit Commission's investigation into the pledges by writing bogus personal checks and having the center record them as received. The program ultimately cost the center $7.5 million. Wing was pressured to resign, and several members of the governing Alabama Space Science Exhibit Commission were ousted from that board as a result of the debacle.[37][38] At the end of Wing's term as director, the center was $26 million in debt.[39][40][41]\\r\\nThe expenditures would shape more than the next decade for the center. Larry Capps was selected as executive director after Wing, and he reduced the debt to $16 million while also building the Davidson Center for Space Exploration and moving the Saturn V Dynamic Test Vehicle into its custom-built facility.[39] Capps was director through his retirement in 2010.[42]\\r\\nDr. Deborah Barnhart, who headed Space Camp from 1986-1990, was selected to run the museum in 2010.[42] She has since brought Orion and other post-Shuttle training apparatus to Space Camp and retired the center's line of credit, reducing interest expenditures. The center had about $13 million debt in May, 2014.[43]\\r\\nHuntsville architect David Crowe designed the initial building with 22,000 square feet (2,000?m2) of exhibit space.[32] An Omnimax (now called IMAX Dome) theater was installed prior to February 28, 1984.[44] The movie SpaceCamp preceded droves more campers (5,000 in 1986 to 11,000 in 1987), for whom facilities were expanded again.[45][46]\\r\\nSince 1969, Huntsville residents could point to the Saturn I rocket at the U.S. Space & Rocket Center as a distant landmark (located a few miles from the city center).[34] In 1999, a full-scale model of the Saturn V rocket was erected, standing nearly twice as tall as the Saturn I.[37]\\r\\nSince 1979, A Saturn IB rocket owned by the museum stands at the Alabama Welcome Center in Ardmore \\"as a reminder to visitors of Alabama's role in the space program.\\"[47]\\r\\nA $3 million NASA Educator Resource Center was built during Larry Capps's tenure.[48]\\r\\nThe newest addition to the U.S. Space & Rocket Center is the Davidson Center for Space Exploration, named after Dr. Julian Davidson, founder of Davidson Technologies.[49] The 68,000 square feet (6,300?m2)[48] building opened January 31, 2008. The Davidson Center was designed to house the Saturn V Dynamic Test Vehicle (listed on the National Register of Historic Places) and many other space exploration exhibits. The vehicle is elevated above the floor surface with separated stages and engines exposed, so visitors have the opportunity to walk underneath the rocket. The Davidson Center also features a 3D movie theater in addition to the IMAX theater in the original museum.\\r\\nWhen the Davidson Center opened in 2008, the museum's ticket center and entrance was relocated to the Davidson Center, so it is now the first exhibit museum visitors experience. This, however, necessitated that visitors enter the original museum through the rear doors, causing it to be viewed out of its original sequence.\\r\\nThe U.S. Space & Rocket Center is owned by the State of Alabama and operated by the Alabama Space Science Exhibit Commission (ASSEC) whose 18 members are appointed by the Governor for terms of four or eight years.[50] The composition and authority of the board are set forth in Title 41, Article 15 of the Code of Alabama.[51] ASSEC meetings are open to the public.[52]\\r\\nThe U.S. Space & Rocket Center Foundation serves as the fundraising arm of the ASSEC.[52]\\r\\nThe Space & Rocket Center saw 540,153 visitors in 2010 and 553,137 in 2011,[53] and over 584,000 in 2013, the latter earning the museum recognition as the top paid tourist attraction in Alabama.[54]\\r\\nThe NASA Human Exploration Rover Challenge, previously known as the Great Moonbuggy Race, has run every year since 1994, and all but the first two have been held at the Space & Rocket Center. The race challenges high school and college students to design and build a small moonbuggy that they can assemble on-site and ride across a simulated lunar terrain.[55]\\r\\nThe U.S. Space & Rocket Center was the setting for feature films Space Warriors,[56] SpaceCamp,[57] and Beyond the Stars,[58] along with the made-for-TV movie A Smile as Big as the Moon.[59]\\r\\nThe U.S. Space & Rocket Center was the site of a roadblock and pitstop at the end of Leg 3 of The Amazing Race: Family Edition aired in October 2005.\\r\\n'Good Morning America has featured the Space & Rocket Center multiple times.

During the 18th century the disease killed an estimated 400,000 Europeans each year, including five reigning monarchs, and was responsible for a third of all blindness.[3] Between 20 and 60% of all those infectedand over 80% of infected childrendied from the disease.[4]\\r\\nDuring the 20th century, it is estimated that smallpox was responsible for 300ÿ500 million deaths.[5][6][7] In the early 1950s an estimated 50 million cases of smallpox occurred in the world each year.[8] As recently as 1967, the World Health Organization estimated that 15 million people contracted the disease and that two million died in that year.[8] After successful vaccination campaigns throughout the 19th and 20th centuries, the WHO certified the global eradication of smallpox in December 1979.[8] Smallpox is one of two infectious diseases to have been eradicated, the other being rinderpest, which was declared eradicated in 2011.[9][10][11]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIt has been suggested that smallpox was a major component of the Plague of Athens that occurred in 430 BCE, during the Peloponnesian Wars, and was described by Thucydides. Galen's description of the Antonine Plague, which swept through the Roman Empire in 165ÿ180, indicates that it was probably caused by smallpox.[12] Returning soldiers brought the disease home with them to Syria and Italy, where it raged for fifteen years and greatly weakened the Roman empire, killing up to one-third of the population in some areas.[13] Total deaths have been estimated at 5 million.[14] A second major outbreak of disease in the Roman Empire, known as the Plague of Cyprian (251ÿ266), was also either smallpox or measles. Although some historians believe that many historical epidemics and pandemics were early outbreaks of smallpox, contemporary records are not detailed enough to make a definite diagnosis.[1][15]\\r\\nMost of the details about the epidemics are lost, probably due to the scarcity of surviving written records from the Early Middle Ages. The first incontrovertible description of smallpox in Western Europe occurred in 581, when Bishop Gregory of Tours provided an eyewitness account describing the characteristic symptoms of smallpox.[15] Waves of epidemics wiped out large rural populations.[16] The establishment of the disease in Europe was of special importance, for this served as the endemic reservoir from which smallpox spread to other parts of the world, as an accompaniment of successive waves of European exploration and colonization.\\r\\nAround 400 AD, an Indian medical book recorded a disease marked by pustules and boils, saying \\"the pustules are red, yellow, and white and they are accompanied by burning pain  the skin seems studded with grains of rice.\\" The Indian epidemic was thought to be punishment from a god, and the survivors created a goddess, Sitala, as the anthropomorphic personification of the disease.[17][18][19] Smallpox was thus regarded as possession by Sitala. In Hinduism the goddess Sitala both causes and cures high fever, rashes, hot flashes and pustules. All of these are symptoms of smallpox.\\r\\nThe clearest description of smallpox from pre-modern times was given in the 9th century by the Persian physician, Muhammad ibn Zakariya ar-Razi, known in the West as \\"Rhazes\\", who was the first to differentiate smallpox from measles and chickenpox in his Kitab fi al-jadari wa-al-hasbah (The Book of Smallpox and Measles).[20]\\r\\nSmallpox was a leading cause of death in the 18th century. Every seventh child born in Russia died from smallpox.[8] It killed an estimated 400,000 Europeans each year in the 18th century, including five reigning European monarchs.[21] Most people became infected during their lifetimes, and about 30% of people infected with smallpox died from the disease, presenting a severe selection pressure on the resistant survivors.[22]\\r\\nIn northern Japan, Ainu population decreased drastically in the 19th century, due in large part to infectious diseases like smallpox brought by Japanese settlers pouring into Hokkaido.[23]\\r\\nThe Franco-Prussian War triggered a smallpox pandemic of 1870ÿ1875 that claimed 500,000 lives; while vaccination was mandatory in the Prussian army, many French soldiers were not vaccinated. Smallpox outbreaks among French prisoners of war spread to the German civilian population and other parts of Europe. Ultimately, this public health disaster inspired stricter legislation in Germany and England, though not in France. [24][25]\\r\\nIn 1849 nearly 13% of all Calcutta deaths were due to smallpox.[26] Between 1868 and 1907, there were approximately 4.7 million deaths from smallpox in India. Between 1926 and 1930, there were 979,738 cases of smallpox with a mortality of 42.3%.[27]\\r\\nOne of the earliest records of what may have been an encounter with smallpox in Africa is associated with the elephant war circa AD 568 when after fighting a siege in Mecca, Ethiopian troops contracted the disease which they carried with them back to Africa. Arab ports in Coastal towns in Africa likely contributed to the importation of smallpox into Africa, as early as the 13th century, though no records exist until the 16th century. Upon invasion of these towns by tribes in the interior of Africa, a severe epidemic affected all African inhabitants while sparing the Portuguese. Densely populated areas of Africa connected to the Mediterranean, Nubia and Ethiopia by caravan route likely were affected by smallpox since the 11th century, though written records do not appear until the introduction of the slave trade in the 16th century.[2]\\r\\nThe slave trade continued to spread smallpox to the entire continent, with raiders pushing farther inland along caravan routes in search of slaves. The effects of smallpox could be seen along caravan routes, and those who were not affected along the routes were still likely to become infected either waiting to board or on board ships.[2]\\r\\nSmallpox in Angola was likely introduced shortly after Portuguese settlement of the area in 1484. The 1864 epidemic killed 25,000 inhabitants, one third of the total population in that same area. In 1713, an outbreak occurred in South Africa after a ship from India docked at Cape Town, bringing infected laundry ashore. Many of the white population suffered, and whole clans of the Hottentot tribe were wiped out. A second outbreak occurred in 1755, again affecting both the white population and the Hottentots. The Hottentots spread the disease further among their tribes, and completely eradicating several tribes, all the way to the Kalahari desert. A third outbreak in 1767 similarly affected the Hottentots and Bantu tribes, but the whites settlers, having practiced variolation, were not affected nearly to the extent that they were in the first two outbreaks. Continued slaving operations brought smallpox to Cape Town again in 1840, taking the lives of 2500 people, and then to Uganda in the 1840s. It is estimated that up to eighty percent of the Griqua tribe was exterminated by smallpox in 1831, and whole tribes were being wiped out in Kenya up until 1899. Along the Zaire river basin were areas where no one survived the epidemics, leaving the land devoid of human life. In Ethiopia and the Sudan, six epidemics are recorded for the 19th century: 1811ÿ1813, 1838ÿ1839, 1865ÿ1866, 1878ÿ1879, 1885ÿ1887, and 1889ÿ1890.[28]\\r\\nAfter first contacts with Europeans and Africans, some believe that the death of 90ÿ95% of the native population of the New World was caused by Old World diseases.[39] It is suspected that smallpox was the chief culprit and responsible for killing nearly all of the native inhabitants of the Americas. For more than 200 years, this disease affected all new world populations, mostly without intentional European transmission, from contact in the early 16th century to until possibly as late as the French and Indian Wars (1754ÿ1767).[40]\\r\\nIn 1519 Hernn Corts landed on the shores of what is now Mexico and was then the Aztec empire. In 1520 another group of Spanish arrived in Mexico from Hispaniola, bringing with them the smallpox which had already been ravaging that island for two years. When Corts heard about the other group, he went and defeated them. In this contact, one of Corts's men contracted the disease. When Corts returned to Tenochtitlan, he brought the disease with him.\\r\\nSoon, the Aztecs rose up in rebellion against Corts and his men. Outnumbered, the Spanish were forced to flee. In the fighting, the Spanish soldier carrying smallpox died. Corts would not return to the capital until August 1521. In the meantime smallpox devastated the Aztec population. It killed most of the Aztec army and 25% of the overall population.[41] The Spanish Franciscan Motolinia left this description: \\"As the Indians did not know the remedy of the diseasethey died in heaps, like bedbugs. In many places it happened that everyone in a house died and, as it was impossible to bury the great number of dead, they pulled down the houses over them so that their homes become their tombs.\\"[42] On Corts's return, he found the Aztec armys chain of command in ruins. The soldiers who still lived were weak from the disease. Corts then easily defeated the Aztecs and entered Tenochtitln.[43] The Spaniards said that they could not walk through the streets without stepping on the bodies of smallpox victims.[44]\\r\\nThe effects of smallpox on Tahuantinsuyu (or the Inca empire) were even more devastating. Beginning in Colombia, smallpox spread rapidly before the Spanish invaders first arrived in the empire. The spread was probably aided by the efficient Inca road system. Within months, the disease had killed the Incan Emperor Huayna Capac, his successor, and most of the other leaders. Two of his surviving sons warred for power and, after a bloody and costly war, Atahualpa become the new emperor. As Atahualpa was returning to the capital Cuzco, Francisco Pizarro arrived and through a series of deceits captured the young leader and his best general. Within a few years smallpox claimed between 60% and 90% of the Inca population,[45] with other waves of European disease weakening them further. A handful of historians argue that a disease called Bartonellosis might have been responsible for some outbreaks of illness, but this opinion is in the scholarly minority.[46] The effects of Bartonellosis were depicted in the ceramics of the Moche people of ancient Peru.[47]\\r\\nEven after the two largest empires of the Americas were defeated by the virus and disease, smallpox continued its march of death. In 1561, smallpox reached Chile by sea, when a ship carrying the new governor Francisco de Villagra landed at La Serena. Chile had previously been isolated by the Atacama Desert and Andes Mountains from Peru, but at the end of 1561 and in early 1562, it ravaged the Chilean native population. Chronicles and records of the time left no accurate data on mortality but more recent estimates are that the natives lost 20 to 25 percent of their population. The Spanish historian Marmolejo said that gold mines had to shut down when all their Indian labor died.[48] Mapuche fighting Spain in Araucana regarded the epidemic as a magical attempt by Francisco de Villagra to exterminate them because he could not defeat them in the Arauco War.[31]\\r\\nIn 1633 in Plymouth, Massachusetts, the Native Americans were struck by the virus. As it had done elsewhere, the virus wiped out entire population groups of Native Americans. It reached Mohawks in 1634,[49] the Lake Ontario area in 1636, and the lands of the Iroquois by 1679. During the siege of Fort Pitt, as recorded in his journal by sundries trader and militia Captain, William Trent, on June 24, 1763, dignitaries from the Delaware tribe met with Fort Pitt officials, warned them of \\"great numbers of Indians\\" coming to attack the fort, and pleaded with them to leave the fort while there was still time. The commander of the fort refused to abandon the fort. Instead, the British gave as gifts two blankets, one silk handkerchief and one linen from the smallpox hospital, to two Delaware Indian delegates.[50] During and after Pontiac's War smallpox killed between 400,000-500,000 (possibly up to 1.5 million) Native Americans.[51][52]\\r\\nDuring the 1770s, smallpox killed at least 30% of the West Coast Native Americans.[53][54] The smallpox epidemic of 1780ÿ1782 brought devastation and drastic depopulation among the Plains Indians.[55] This epidemic is a classic instance of European immunity and non-European vulnerability. It is probable that the Indians contracted the disease from the Snake Indians on the Mississippi. From there it spread eastward and northward to the Saskatchewan River. According to David Thompsons account, the first to hear of the disease were fur traders from the Hudsons House on October 15, 1781.[56] A week later, reports were made to William Walker and William Tomison, who were in charge of the Hudson and Cumberland Hudsons Bay Company posts. By February, the disease spread as far as the Basquia Tribe. Smallpox attacked whole tribes and left few survivors. E. E. Rich described the epidemic by saying that Families lay unburied in their tents while the few survivors fled, to spread the disease.[57] After reading Tomisons journals, Houston and Houston calculated that, of the Indians who traded at the Hudson and Cumberland houses, 95% died of smallpox.[55] Paul Hackett adds to the mortality numbers suggesting that perhaps up to one half to three quarters of the Ojibway situated west of the Grand Portage died from the disease. The Cree also suffered a casualty rate of approximately 75% with similar effects found in the Lowland Cree.[58] By 1785 the Sioux Indians of the great plains had also been affected.[28] Not only did smallpox devastate the Indian population, it did so in an unforgiving way. William Walker described the epidemic stating that the Indians [are] all Dying by this Distemper  lying Dead about the Barren Ground like a rotten sheep, their Tents left standing & the Wild beast Devouring them.[56]\\r\\nA particularly virulent sequence of smallpox outbreaks took place in Boston, Massachusetts. From 1636 to 1698, Boston endured six epidemics. In 1721, the most severe epidemic occurred. The entire population fled the city, bringing the virus to the rest of the Thirteen Colonies.[59][60]\\r\\nIn the late 1770s, during the American Revolutionary War, smallpox returned once more and killed thousands.[61] Peter Kalm in his Travels in North America, described how in that period, the dying Indian villages became overrun with wolves feasting on the corpses and weakened survivors.[62] Smallpox was used also used as a weapon by the British.[63][64]\\r\\nBy 1832, the federal government of the United States established a smallpox vaccination program for Native Americans.[65]\\r\\nIn 1900 starting in New York City, smallpox reared its head once again and started a sociopolitical battle with lines drawn between the rich and poor, white and black. In populations of railroad and migrant workers who traveled from city to city the disease had reached an endemic low boil. This fact did not bother the government at the time, nor did it spur them to action. Despite the general acceptance of the germ theory of disease, pioneered by John Snow in 1849, smallpox was still thought to be mostly a malady that followed the less-distinct guidelines of a \\"filth\\" disease, and therefore would only affect the \\"lower classes\\".[66]\\r\\nThe last major smallpox epidemic in the United States occurred in Boston, Massachusetts throughout a three-year period, between 1901-1903. During this three-year period, 1596 cases of the disease occurred throughout the city. Of those cases, nearly 300 people died. As a whole, the epidemic had a 17% fatality rate.[67]\\r\\nThose who were infected with the disease were detained in quarantine facilities in the hopes of protecting others from getting sick. These quarantine facilities, or pesthouses, were mostly located on Southampton Street. As the outbreak worsened, men were also moved to hospitals on Gallops Island. Women and children were primarily sent to Southampton Street. Smallpox patients were not allowed in regular hospital facilities throughout the city, for fear the sickness would spread among the already sick.[68]\\r\\nA reflection of the previous outbreak that occurred in New York, the poor and homeless were blamed for the sickness's spread. In response to this belief, the city instructed teams of physicians to vaccinate anyone living in inexpensive housing.\\r\\nIn an effort to control the outbreak, the Boston Board of Health began voluntary vaccination programs. Individuals could receive free vaccines at their work places or at different stations set up throughout the city. By the end 1901, some 40,000 of the citys residents had received a smallpox vaccine. However, despite the city's efforts, the epidemic continued to grow. In January 1902, a door-to-door vaccination program was initiated. Health officials were instructed to compel individuals to receive vaccination, pay a $5 fine, or be faced with 15 days in prison. This door-to-door program was met by some resistance as some individuals feared the vaccines to be unsafe and ineffective. Others felt compulsory vaccination in itself was a problem that violated an individual's civil liberties.\\r\\nThis program of compulsory vaccination eventually led to the famous Jacobson v. Massachusetts case. The case was the result of a Cambridge resident's refusal to be vaccinated. Henning Jacobsen, a Swedish immigrant, refused vaccination out of fear it would cause him illness. He claimed a previous smallpox vaccine had made him sick as a child. Rather than pay the five dollar fine, he challenged the state's authority on forcing people to receive vaccination. His case was lost at the state level, but Jacobson appealed the ruling, and so, the case was taken up by the Supreme Court. In 1905 the Supreme Court upheld the Massachusetts law: it was ruled Jacobson could not refuse the mandatory vaccination.[67]\\r\\nIn Canada, between 1702 and 1703, nearly a quarter of the population of Quebec city died due to a smallpox epidemic.[28]\\r\\nThere is evidence that smallpox reached the Philippine islands from the 4th century CE onwards ÿ linked possibly to contact between South East Asians and Indian traders.[69]\\r\\nDuring the 18th century, there were many major outbreaks of smallpox, driven possibly by increasing contact with European colonists and traders. There were epidemics, for instance, in the Sultanate of Banjar (South Kalimantan), in 1734, 1750ÿ51, 1764ÿ65 and 1778ÿ79; in the Sultanate of Tidore (Moluccas ) during the 1720s, and in southern Sumatra during the 1750s, the 1770s and in 1786.[69][70][71]\\r\\nSmallpox is exogenous to Australia. The first recorded outbreak, in 1789, devastated the Aboriginal population; while the extent of this outbreak is disputed, some sources claim that it killed about 50% of coastal Aboriginal populations on the east coast.[72] There is an ongoing historical debate concerning two rival and irreconcilable theories about how the disease first entered the continent. The central hypotheses of these theories suggest that smallpox was transmitted to indigenous Australians by either:\\r\\nIn 1914, Dr J.?H.?L. Cumpston, director of the Australian Quarantine Service tentatively put forward the hypothesis that smallpox arrived with British settlers.[73] Cumpston's theory was most forcefully reiterated by the economic historian Noel Butlin, in his book Our Original Aggression (1983).[74] Likewise David Day, in Claiming a Continent: A New History of Australia (2001), suggested that members of Sydney's garrison of Royal Marines may have attempted to use smallpox as a biological weapon in 1789.[75] However, in 2002, historian John Connor stated that Day's theory was \\"unsustainable\\".[76] That same year, theories that smallpox was introduced with settlers, deliberately or otherwise, were contested in a full-length book by historian Judy Campbell: Invisible Invaders: Smallpox and Other Diseases in Aboriginal Australia 1780-1880 (2002).[77] Campbell consulted, during the writing of her book, Frank Fenner, who had overseen the final stages of a successful campaign by the World Health Organization (WHO) to eradicate smallpox. Campbell argued that scientific evidence concerning the viability of variolous matter (used for inoculation) did not support the possibility of the disease being brought to Australia on the long voyage from Europe. Campbell also noted that there was no evidence of Aborigines ever having been exposed to the variolous matter, merely speculation that they may have been. Later authors, such as Christopher Warren,[78] and Craig Mear [79] continued to argue that smallpox emanated from the importation of variolous matter on the First Fleet. Warren (2007) suggested that Campbell had erred in assuming that high temperatures would have sterilised the British supply of smallpox.[78] H. A. Willis (2010), in a survey of the literature discussed above, endorsed Campbell's argument.[80] In response, Warren (2011) suggested that Willis had not taken into account research on how heat affects the smallpox virus, cited by the WHO.[81] Willis (2011) replied that his position was supported by a closer reading of Frank Fenners report to the WHO (1988) and invited readers to consult that report online.[2][82]\\r\\nThe rival hypothesis, that the 1789 outbreak was introduced to Australia by visitors from Makassar, came to prominence in 2002, with Judy Campbell's book Invisible Invaders.[77] Campbell expanded upon the opinion of C.?C. Macknight (1986), an authority on the interaction between indigenous Australians and Makassans.[83] Citing the scientific opinion of Fenner (who wrote the foreword to her book) and historical documents, Campbell argued that the 1789 outbreak was introduced to Australia by Makassans, from where it spread overland.[77] Nevertheless, Michael Bennett in a 2009 article in Bulletin of the History of Medicine, argued that imported \\"variolous matter\\" may have been the source of the 1789 epidemic in Australia.[84] In 2011, Macknight re-entered the debate, declaring: The overwhelming probability must be that it [smallpox] was introduced, like the later epidemics, by [Makassan] trepangers on the north coast and spread across the continent to arrive in Sydney quite independently of the new settlement there.[85] Warren (2013) disputed this, on the grounds that: there was no suitable smallpox in Makassar before 1789; there were no trade routes suitable for transmission to Port Jackson; the theory of a Makassan source for smallpox in 1789 was contradicted by Aboriginal oral tradition, and; the earliest point at which there was evidence of smallpox entering Australia with Makassan visitors was around 1824.[86]\\r\\nAnother major outbreak was observed in 1828ÿ30, near Bathurst, New South Wales.[73] A third epidemic occurred in the Northern Territory and northern Western Australia from the mid-1860s,[80] until at least 1870.\\r\\nElsewhere in the Pacific, smallpox killed many indigenous Polynesians.[87] Nevertheless, Alfred Crosby, in his major work, Ecological Imperialism: The Biological Expansion of Europe, 900-1900 (1986) showed that in 1840 a ship with smallpox on it was successfully quarantined, preventing an epidemic amongst Mori of New Zealand. The only major outbreak in New Zealand was a 1913 epidemic, which affected Mori in northern New Zealand and nearly wiped out the Rapa Nui of Easter Island (Rapa Nui), was reported by Te Rangi Hiroa (Dr Peter Buck) to a medical congress in Melbourne in 1914.[88]\\r\\nThe whaler ship Delta brought smallpox to the Micronesian island of Pohnpei on 28 February 1854. The Pohnpeians reacted by first feasting their offended spirits and then resorted hiding. The disease eventually wiped out more than half the island's population. The deaths of chiefs threw Pohnpeian society into disarray, and the people started blaming the God of the Christian missionaries. The Christian missionaries themselves saw the epidemic as God's punishment for the people and offered the natives inoculations, though often withheld such treatment from the priests. The epidemic abated in October 1854.[89]\\r\\nOne viewpoint is that smallpox emerged in 1588 AD and the earlier reported cases were incorrectly identified as smallpox.[90][91]\\r\\nEarly in history, it was observed that those who had contracted smallpox once were never struck by the disease again. Thought to have been discovered by accident, it became known that those who contracted smallpox through a break in the skin in which smallpox matter was inserted received a less severe reaction than those who contracted it naturally. This realization led to the practice of purposely infecting people with matter from smallpox scabs in order to protect them later from a more severe reaction. This practice, known today as variolation, was first practiced in China in the 10th century.[28] Methods of carrying out the procedure varied depending upon location. Variolation was the sole method of protection against smallpox other than quarantine until Jenner's discovery of the inoculating abilities of cowpox against the smallpox virus in 1796. Efforts to protect populations against smallpox by way of vaccination followed for centuries after Jenner's discovery. Smallpox has since been completely eradicated since 1979, because of the mass vaccination efforts of the World Health Organization.\\r\\nThe word variolation is synonymous with inoculation, insertion, en-grafting, or transplantation. The term is used to define insertion of smallpox matter, and distinguishes this procedure from vaccination, where cowpox matter was used to obtain a much milder reaction among patients.[28]\\r\\nThe practice of variolation (also known as inoculation) first came out of East Asia.[92] First writings documenting variolation in China appear around 1500. Scabs from smallpox victims who had the disease in its mild form would be selected, and the powder was kept close to body temperature by means of keeping it close to the chest, killing the majority of the virus and resulting in a more mild case of smallpox.[93] Scabs were generally used when a month old, but could be used more quickly in hot weather (15ÿ20 days), and slower in winter (50 days). The process was carried out by taking eight smallpox scabs and crushing them in a mortar with two grains of Uvularia grandiflora in a mortar.[28] The powder was administered nasally through a silver tube that was curved at its point, through the right nostril for boys and the left nostril for girls.[93] A week after the procedure, those variolated would start to produce symptoms of smallpox, and recovery was guaranteed. In India, where the European colonizers came across variolation in the 17th century, a large, sharp needle was dipped into the pus collected from mature smallpox sores. Several punctures with this needle were made either below the deltoid muscle or in the forehead, and then were covered with a paste made from boiled rice.[93] Variolation spread farther from India to other countries in south west Asia, and then to the Balkans.[28]\\r\\nIn 1713, Mary Wortley Montagu's brother died of smallpox; she too contracted the virus two years later at the age of twenty-six, leaving her badly scarred.[95] When her husband was made ambassador to Ottoman Empire, she accompanied him to Constantinople. It was here that Montagu first came upon variolation.[96] Two Greek women made it their business to engraft people with pox that left them un-scarred and unable to catch the pox again.[95] In a letter, she wrote that she intended to have her own son undergo the process and would try to bring variolation into fashion in England.[97] Her son underwent the procedure, which was performed by Dr. Charles Maitland,[95] and survived with no ill effects. When an epidemic broke out in London following her return, Mary Wortley Montagu wanted to protect her daughter from the virus by having her variolated as well. Maitland performed the procedure, which was a success.[95] The story made it to the newspapers and was a topic for discussion in London salons.[96] Princess Caroline of Wales wanted her children variolated as well but first wanted more validation of the operation. She had both an orphanage and several convicts variolated before she was convinced.[92][95] When the operation, performed by the King's surgeon, Claude Amyand, and overseen by Maitland,[93] was a success, variolation got the royal seal of approval and the practice became widespread.[98] When the practice of variolation set off local epidemics and caused death in two cases, public reaction was severe. Minister Edmund Massey, in 1772, called variolation dangerous and sinful, saying that people should handle the disease as the biblical figure Job did with his own tribulations, without interfering with God's test for mankind.[93][96] Lady Mary still worked at promoting variolation but its practice waned until 1743.[96]\\r\\nRobert and Daniel Sutton further revived the practice of variolation in England by advertising their perfect variolation record, maintained by selecting patients who were healthy when variolated and were cared for during the procedure in the Sutton's own hygienic hospital.[96] Other changes that the Suttons made to carrying out the variolation process include reducing and later abolishing the preparatory period before variolation was carried out, making more shallow incisions to distribute the smallpox matter, using smallpox matter collected on the fourth day of the disease, where the pus taken was still clear, and recommending that those inoculated get fresh air during recovery.[93] The introduction of the shallower incision reduced both complications associated with the procedure and the severity of the reaction.[94] The prescription of fresh air caused controversy about Sutton's method and how effective it was in reality when those inoculated could walk about and spread the disease to those that had never before experienced smallpox.[93] It was the Suttons who introduced the idea of mass variolation of an area when an epidemic broke out as means of protection to the inhabitants in that location.[94]\\r\\nNews of variolation spread to the royal families of Europe. Several royal families had themselves variolated by English physicians claiming to be specialists. Recipients include the family of Louis XV following his own death of smallpox, and Catherine the Great, whose husband had been horribly disfigured by the disease.[96][98] Catherine the Great was variolated by Thomas Dimsdale, who followed Sutton's method of inoculation.[93] In France, the practice was sanctioned until an epidemic was traced back to an inoculation. After this instance, variolation was banned within city limits. These conditions caused physicians to move just outside the cities and continue to practice variolation in the suburbs.[96]\\r\\nEdward Jenner was variolated in 1756 at age eight in an inoculation barn in Wotton-under-Edge, England. At this time, in preparation for variolation children were bled repeatedly and were given very little to eat and only given a diet drink made to sweeten their blood. This greatly weakened the children before the actual procedure was given.[93][99] Jenner's own inoculation was administered by a Mr. Holbrow, an apothecary. The procedure involved scratching the arm with the tip of a knife, placing several smallpox scabs in the cuts and then bandaging the arm. After receiving the procedure, the children stayed in the barn for several weeks to recover. First symptoms occurred after one week and usually cleared up three days later. On average, it took a month to fully recover from the encounter with smallpox combined with weakness from the preceding starvation.[96]\\r\\nAt the age of thirteen, Jenner was sent to study medicine in Sodbury with Daniel Ludlow, a surgeon and apothecary, from 1762 to 1770[95][99][100] who had a strong sense of cleanliness which Jenner learned from him. During his apprenticeship, Jenner heard that upon contracting cowpox, the recipient became immune to smallpox for the remainder of their life.[95][98] However, this theory was dismissed because of several cases proving that the opposite was true.\\r\\nAfter learning all he could from Ludlow, Jenner apprenticed with John Hunter in London from 1770ÿ1773.[95][100] Hunter was a correspondent of Ludlows, and it is likely that Ludlow recommended Jenner to apprentice with Hunter. Hunter believed in deviating from the accepted treatment and trying new methods if the traditional methods failed. This was considered unconventional medicine for the time period and had a pivotal role in Jenner's development as a scientist.[96][101]\\r\\nAfter two years of apprenticeship, Jenner moved back to his hometown of Berkeley,[100] where he quickly gained the respect of both his patients and other medical professionals for his work as a physician.[96] It was during this time that Jenner revisited the connection between cowpox and smallpox.[95] He began investigating dairy farms in the Gloucestershire area looking for cowpox. This research was slow going as Jenner often had to wait months or even years before cases of cowpox would again return to the Gloucestershire area.[96] During his study, he found that cowpox was actually several diseases that were similar in nature but were distinguishable through slight differences, and that not all versions had the capacity to make one immune from smallpox upon contraction.[95]\\r\\nThrough his study, he incorrectly deduced that smallpox and cowpox were all the same disease, simply manifesting themselves differently in different animals, eventually setting back his research and making it difficult to publish his findings. Though Jenner had seen cases of people becoming immune to smallpox after having cowpox, too many exceptions of people still contracting smallpox after having had cowpox were arising. Jenner was missing crucial information which he later discovered in 1796.[96] Jenner hypothesized that in order to become immune to smallpox using cowpox, the matter from the cowpox pustules must be administered at maximum potency; else it was too weak to be effective in creating immunity to smallpox. He deduced that cowpox was most likely to transfer immunity from smallpox if administered at the eighth day of the disease.[95]\\r\\nOn May 14, 1796, he performed an experiment in which he took pus from a sore of a cowpox infected milkmaid named Sarah Nelmes and applied it to a few small scratches on the arm of an eight-year-old boy who had never before contracted either smallpox or cowpox, named James Phipps. Phipps recovered as expected.[95] Two months later, Jenner repeated the procedure using matter from smallpox, observing no effect. Phipps became the first person to become immune to smallpox without ever actually having the disease. He was variolated many more times over the course of his life to prove his immunity.[96]\\r\\nWhen the next cowpox epidemic broke out in 1798, Jenner conducted a series of inoculations using cowpox, all of them successful[95] except on his own son Robert.[96] Because his findings were revolutionary and lacked in evidence, the Royal Society (of whom Jenner was a member) refused to publish his findings.[96] Jenner then rode to London and had his book published by Sampson Lows firm[99] in June 1798[102] The book was an instant bestseller among the elite in London salons, in the medical establishment and among the ladies and gentlemen of the enlightenment.[96]\\r\\nKnowledge of the ability of cowpox to provide immunity from smallpox was present in England before Jenner's discovery. In 1774, a cattle dealer named Benjamin Jesty successfully inoculated his wife and three sons using cowpox. This was before Jenner discovered the immunization capabilities of cowpox.[98] However, Jesty simply performed the procedure; he did not take the discovery any further by inoculating his family with smallpox matter to see if there would be a reaction or perform any other trials.[93] Jenner was the first to prove the effectiveness of vaccination with cowpox using experimentation.[96]\\r\\nBenjamin Franklin, who had lost his own son to smallpox in 1736, made the suggestion to create a pamphlet to distribute to families explaining how to inoculate their children themselves, so as to eliminate cost as the factor in the decision to choose to inoculate children. William Heberden, a friend of Franklin's and an English physician, followed through with Franklin's idea, printing 2000 pamphlets in 1759 which were distributed by Franklin in America.[93]\\r\\nAn American physician, John Kirkpatrick, upon his visit to London in 1743, told of an instance where variolation stopped an epidemic in Charleston, South Carolina, in 1738,[103] where 800 people were inoculated and only eight deaths occurred.[93] His account of the success of variolation in Charleston helped to play a role in the revival of its practice in London. Kirkpatrick also advocated inoculating patients with matter from the sores of another inoculated person, instead of using matter from the sore of a smallpox victim, a procedure that Maitland had been using since 1722.[94]","input":"When was smallpox introduced to the new world?"},{"output":"the Nobel Prize-winning Indian-American astrophysicist Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar","context":"The Chandra X-ray Observatory (CXO), previously known as the Advanced X-ray Astrophysics Facility (AXAF), is a Flagship-class space observatory launched on STS-93 by NASA on July 23, 1999. Chandra is sensitive to X-ray sources 100 times fainter than any previous X-ray telescope, enabled by the high angular resolution of its mirrors. Since the Earth's atmosphere absorbs the vast majority of X-rays, they are not detectable from Earth-based telescopes; therefore space-based telescopes are required to make these observations. Chandra is an Earth satellite in a 64-hour orbit, and its mission is ongoing as of 2018[update].\\r\\nChandra is one of the Great Observatories, along with the Hubble Space Telescope, Compton Gamma Ray Observatory (1991ÿ2000), and the Spitzer Space Telescope. The telescope is named after the Nobel Prize-winning Indian-American astrophysicist Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar.[6] Its mission is similar to that of ESA's XMM-Newton spacecraft, also launched in 1999.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1976 the Chandra X-ray Observatory (called AXAF at the time) was proposed to NASA by Riccardo Giacconi and Harvey Tananbaum. Preliminary work began the following year at Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) and the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory (SAO). In the meantime, in 1978, NASA launched the first imaging X-ray telescope, Einstein (HEAO-2), into orbit. Work continued on the AXAF project throughout the 1980s and 1990s. In 1992, to reduce costs, the spacecraft was redesigned. Four of the twelve planned mirrors were eliminated, as were two of the six scientific instruments. AXAF's planned orbit was changed to an elliptical one, reaching one third of the way to the Moon's at its farthest point. This eliminated the possibility of improvement or repair by the space shuttle but put the observatory above the Earth's radiation belts for most of its orbit. AXAF was assembled and tested by TRW (now Northrop Grumman Aerospace Systems) in Redondo Beach, California.\\r\\nAXAF was renamed Chandra as part of a contest held by NASA in 1998, which drew more than 6,000 submissions worldwide.[7] The contest winners, Jatila van der Veen and Tyrel Johnson (then a high school teacher and high school student, respectively), suggested the name in honor of Nobel Prizeÿwinning Indian-American astrophysicist Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar. He is known for his work in determining the maximum mass of white dwarf stars, leading to greater understanding of high energy astronomical phenomena such as neutron stars and black holes.[6] Fittingly, the name Chandra means \\"moon\\" in Sanskrit.[8]\\r\\nOriginally scheduled to be launched in December 1998,[7] the spacecraft was delayed several months, eventually being launched in July 1999 by Space Shuttle Columbia during STS-93. At 22,753 kilograms (50,162?lb), it was the heaviest payload ever launched by the shuttle, a consequence of the two-stage Inertial Upper Stage booster rocket system needed to transport the spacecraft to its high orbit.\\r\\nChandra has been returning data since the month after it launched. It is operated by the SAO at the Chandra X-ray Center in Cambridge, Massachusetts, with assistance from MIT and Northrop Grumman Space Technology. The ACIS CCDs suffered particle damage during early radiation belt passages. To prevent further damage, the instrument is now removed from the telescope's focal plane during passages.\\r\\nAlthough Chandra was initially given an expected lifetime of 5 years, on September 4, 2001 NASA extended its lifetime to 10 years \\"based on the observatory's outstanding results.\\"[9] Physically Chandra could last much longer. A 2004 study performed at the Chandra X-ray Center indicated that the observatory could last at least 15 years.[10]\\r\\nIn July 2008, the International X-ray Observatory, a joint project between ESA, NASA and JAXA, was proposed as the next major X-ray observatory but was later cancelled.[11] ESA later resurrected the project as the Advanced Telescope for High Energy Astrophysics (ATHENA) with a proposed launch in 2028.[12]\\r\\nThe data gathered by Chandra has greatly advanced the field of X-ray astronomy. Here are some examples of discoveries supported by observations from Chandra:\\r\\nUnlike optical telescopes which possess simple aluminized parabolic surfaces (mirrors), X-ray telescopes generally use a Wolter telescope consisting of nested cylindrical paraboloid and hyperboloid surfaces coated with iridium or gold. X-ray photons would be absorbed by normal mirror surfaces, so mirrors with a low grazing angle are necessary to reflect them. Chandra uses four pairs of nested mirrors, together with their support structure, called the High Resolution Mirror Assembly (HRMA); the mirror substrate is 2?cm-thick glass, with the reflecting surface a 33?nm iridium coating, and the diameters are 65?cm, 87?cm, 99?cm and 123?cm.[21] The thick substrate and particularly careful polishing allowed a very precise optical surface, which is responsible for Chandra's unmatched resolution: between 80% and 95% of the incoming X-ray energy is focused into a one-arcsecond circle. However, the thickness of the substrate limits the proportion of the aperture which is filled, leading to the low collecting area compared to XMM-Newton.\\r\\nChandra's highly elliptical orbit allows it to observe continuously for up to 55 hours of its 65-hour orbital period. At its furthest orbital point from Earth, Chandra is one of the most distant Earth-orbiting satellites. This orbit takes it beyond the geostationary satellites and beyond the outer Van Allen belt.[22]\\r\\nWith an angular resolution of 0.5 arcsecond (2.4 rad), Chandra possesses a resolution over 1000 times better than that of the first orbiting X-ray telescope.\\r\\nCXO uses mechanical gyroscopes,[23] which are sensors that help determine what direction the telescope is pointed.[24] Other navigation and orientation systems on board CXO include an aspect camera, Earth and Sun sensors, and reaction wheels. It also has two sets of thrusters, one for movement and another for offloading momentum.[24]\\r\\nThe Science Instrument Module (SIM) holds the two focal plane instruments, the Advanced CCD Imaging Spectrometer (ACIS) and the High Resolution Camera (HRC), moving whichever is called for into position during an observation.\\r\\nACIS consists of 10 CCD chips and provides images as well as spectral information of the object observed. It operates in the photon energy range of 0.2ÿ10 keV. HRC has two micro-channel plate components and images over the range of 0.1ÿ10 keV. It also has a time resolution of 16 microseconds. Both of these instruments can be used on their own or in conjunction with one of the observatory's two transmission gratings.\\r\\nThe transmission gratings, which swing into the optical path behind the mirrors, provide Chandra with high resolution spectroscopy. The High Energy Transmission Grating Spectrometer (HETGS) works over 0.4ÿ10 keV and has a spectral resolution of 60ÿ1000. The Low Energy Transmission Grating Spectrometer (LETGS) has a range of 0.09ÿ3 keV and a resolution of 40ÿ2000.\\r\\nSummary:[25]\\r\\nX-Rays from Pluto.\\r\\nJupiter in X-ray light.\\r\\nTycho Supernova remnant in X-ray light.\\r\\nSN 2006gy (upper right) and parent galaxy NGC 1260.\\r\\nCXO orbit as of January 7, 2014.\\r\\nM31 Core in X-ray light.\\r\\nPSR B1509-58 - red, green and blue/max energy.\\r\\nTurbulence may prevent galaxy clusters from cooling.\\r\\nBright X-ray flare from Sagittarius A*, supermassive black hole in the Milky Way.[19]\\r\\nSNR 0519-69.0 - remains of an exploding star in the Large Magellanic Cloud.\\r\\nImages released to celebrate the International Year of Light 2015.\\r\\nCluster of newly formed stars in Orion Nebula.\\r\\nGK Persei: Nova of 1901.\\r\\nX-ray light rings from a neutron star in Circinus X-1.\\r\\nCygnus X-1, first strong black hole discovered.","input":"Who is nasa's chandra xray observatory named after?"},{"output":"~2500 ml/day","context":"Fluid balance is an aspect of the homeostasis of organisms in which the amount of water in the organism needs to be controlled, via osmoregulation and behavior, such that the concentrations of electrolytes (salts in solution) in the various body fluids are kept within healthy ranges. The core principle of fluid balance is that the amount of water lost from the body must equal the amount of water taken in; for example, in humans, the output (via respiration, perspiration, urination, defecation, and expectoration) must equal the input (via eating and drinking, or by parenteral intake). Euvolemia is the state of normal body fluid volume, including blood volume, interstitial fluid volume, and intracellular fluid volume; hypovolemia and hypervolemia are imbalances. Water is necessary for all life on Earth. Humans can survive for 4 to 6 weeks without food but only for a few days without water.\\r\\n\\r\\nProfuse sweating can increase the need for electrolyte replacement. Water-electrolyte imbalance produces headache and fatigue if mild; illness if moderate, and sometimes even death if severe. For example, water intoxication (which results in hyponatremia), the process of consuming too much water too quickly, can be fatal. Deficits to body water result in volume contraction and dehydration. Diarrhea is a threat to both body water volume and electrolyte levels, which is why diseases that cause diarrhea are great threats to fluid balance.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe amount of water varies with the individual, as it depends on the condition of the subject, the amount of physical exercise, and on the environmental temperature and humidity.[1] In the US, the reference daily intake (RDI) for water is 3.7 litres per day (l/day) for human males older than 18, and 2.7 l/day for human females older than 18[2] including water contained in food, beverages, and drinking water. The common misconception that everyone should drink two litres (68 ounces, or about eight 8-oz glasses) of water per day is not supported by scientific research. Various reviews of all the scientific literature on the topic performed in 2002 and 2008 could not find any solid scientific evidence that recommended drinking eight glasses of water per day.[3][4][5] For example, people in hotter climates will require greater water intake than those in cooler climates. An individual's thirst provides a better guide for how much water they require rather than a specific, fixed number. A more flexible guideline is that a normal person should urinate 4 times per day, and the urine should be a light yellow color.\\r\\n\\r\\nA constant supply is needed to replenish the fluids lost through normal physiological activities, such as respiration, perspiration and urination. Food contributes 0.5 to 1 l/day, and the metabolism of protein, fat, and carbohydrates produces another 0.25 to 0.4 l/day,[6] which means that 2 to 3 l/day of water for men and 1 to 2 l/day of water for women should be consumed as fluid to meet the Recommended Daily Intake (RDI).\\r\\n\\r\\nIn terms of mineral nutrients intake, it is unclear what the drinking water contribution is. However, inorganic minerals generally enter surface water and ground water via storm water runoff or through the Earth's crust. Treatment processes also lead to the presence of some minerals. Examples include calcium, zinc, manganese, phosphate, fluoride and sodium compounds.[7] Water generated from the biochemical metabolism of nutrients provides a significant proportion of the daily water requirements for some arthropods and desert animals, but provides only a small fraction of a human's necessary intake.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are a variety of trace elements present in virtually all potable water, some of which play a role in metabolism. For example, sodium, potassium and chloride are common chemicals found in small amounts in most waters, and these elements play a role in body metabolism. Other elements such as fluoride, while arguably beneficial in low concentrations, can cause dental problems and other issues when present at high levels. Water is essential for the growth and maintenance of our bodies, as it is involved in a number of biological processes.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen a person is ill, fluid may also be lost through vomiting, diarrhea, and hemorrhage. An individual is at an increased risk of dehydration in these instances, as the kidneys will find it more difficult to match fluid loss by reducing urine output (the kidneys must produce at least some urine in order to excrete metabolic waste.)\\r\\n\\r\\nOral rehydration therapy (ORT), is type of fluid replacement used as a treatment for dehydration. In an acute hospital setting, fluid balance is monitored carefully. This provides information on the patient's state of hydration, renal function and cardiovascular function.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf blood pressure is low (hypotension), the filtration rate in the kidneys will lessen, causing less fluid reabsorption and thus less urine output.\\r\\n\\r\\nAn accurate measure of fluid balance is therefore an important diagnostic tool, and allows for prompt intervention to correct the imbalance.\\r\\n\\r\\nFluid can leave the body in many ways. Fluid can enter the body as preformed water, ingested food and drink and to a lesser extent as metabolic water which is produced as a by-product of aerobic respiration (cellular respiration) and dehydration synthesis.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nA constant supply is needed to replenish the fluids lost through normal physiological activities, such as respiration, sweating and urination. Water generated from the biochemical metabolism of nutrients provides a significant proportion of the daily water requirements for some arthropods and desert animals, but provides only a small fraction of a human's necessary intake.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the normal resting state, input of water through ingested fluids is approximately 1200 ml/day, from ingested foods 1000 ml/day and from aerobic respiration 300 ml/day, totaling 2500 ml/day.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nInput of water is regulated mainly through ingested fluids, which, in turn, depends on thirst. An insufficiency of water results in an increased osmolarity in the extracellular fluid. This is sensed by osmoreceptors in the organum vasculosum of the lamina terminalis, which trigger thirst. Thirst can to some degree be voluntarily resisted, as during fluid restriction.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe human kidneys will normally adjust to varying levels of water intake. The kidneys will require time to adjust to the new water intake level. This can cause someone who drinks a lot of water to become dehydrated more easily than someone who routinely drinks less.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese outputs are in balance with the input of ~2500 ml/day.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe body's homeostatic control mechanisms, which maintain a constant internal environment, ensure that a balance between fluid gain and fluid loss is maintained.  The anti-diuretic hormones vasopressin (ADH) and aldosterone play a major role in this.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf the body is becoming fluid-deficient, this will be sensed by osmoreceptors in the vascular organ of lamina terminalis and subfornical organ.[14] These areas project to the supraoptic nucleus and paraventricular nucleus, which contain neurons that secrete the antidiuretic hormone, vasopressin, from their nerve endings in the posterior pituitary. Thus, there will be an increase in the secretion of antidiuretic hormone, causing fluid to be retained by the kidneys and urine output to be reduced.\\r\\n\\r\\nA fluid-insufficiency causes a decreased perfusion of the juxtaglomerular apparatus in the kidneys. This activates the reninÿangiotensin system. Among other actions, it causes renal tubules (i.e. the distal convoluted tubules and the cortical collecting ducts) to reabsorb more sodium and water from the urine. Potassium is secreted into the tubule in exchange for the sodium, which is reabsorbed.\\r\\nThe activated reninÿangiotensin system stimulates the zona glomerulosa of the adrenal cortex which in turn secretes the hormone aldosterone. This hormone stimulates the reabsorption of sodium ions from distal tubules and collecting ducts. Water in the tubular lumen cannot follow the sodium reabsorption osmotically, as this part of the kidney is impermeable to water; release of ADH (vasopressin) is required to increase expression of aquaporin channels in the cortical collecting duct, allowing reabsorption of water.\\r\\n\\r\\nBody water: Intracellular fluid/Cytosol","input":"How much fluid does a body lose a day?"},{"output":"thirteen","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nMonster Musume (Japanese: ƹβ?k?, Hepburn: Monsut Musume no Iru Nichij, \\"Everyday Life with Monster Girls\\") is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Okayado.[a] The series is published in Japan by Tokuma Shoten in their Monthly Comic Ry magazine and by Seven Seas Entertainment in the United States, with the chapters collected and reprinted into thirteen tankbon volumes to date. An anime adaptation aired between July and September 2015, and was licensed by Sentai Filmworks under the title Monster Musume: Everyday Life with Monster Girls. A PC game based on the series was released in December 2015.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe story of Monster Musume revolves around Kimihito Kurusu, a Japanese student whose life is thrown into turmoil after accidentally becoming involved with the \\"Interspecies Cultural Exchange\\" program.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor years, the Japanese government has kept a secret: mythical creatures such as centaurs, mermaids, harpies, and Lamiais are real.[7] Three years before the start of the story, the government revealed the existence of these creatures and passed a legal bill, the \\"Interspecies Cultural Exchange Act\\". Since then, these creatures, known as \\"liminals,\\" have become a part of human society, living with ordinary families like foreign exchange students and au-pair visitors, but with other duties and restrictions (the primary restriction being that liminals and humans are forbidden from harming each other).\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Asaka, Saitama, Kimihito Kurusu did not volunteer for the exchange program. But when Ms. Smith delivered the very scared and embarrassed Miia to his door by mistake,[7] he did not have the heart to send her away and they started living together. As the story continues, Kimihito meets and gives shelter to other female liminals, each of a different species. Some arrive more or less by accident, some are forced upon him by Ms. Smith, or force themselves in, and it does not take long for him to find himself in a hectic environment where he struggles to live in harmony with his new housemates while dealing with both their constant advances and the dramas of helping them get along in the human world. The situation takes on a new twist after he is told that because of expected changes in the law dealing with human-liminal relationships, he is expected, as a test case, to marry one of the girls, thus increasing their competition for his attention. However, as time passes, other  liminal girls are attracted to him and begin to vie for his attention, much to Kimihito's embarrassment and the annoyance of his housemates.\\r\\n\\r\\nOkayado (a pen name of Takemaru Inui[6]) published the prototype for Monster Musume in Comic Ryu's Anthology Comic Kemomo 02, published by Tokuma Shoten, in 2011.[8] He then reworked the story into a serialized publication, and the first chapter was published in Tokuma Shoten's seinen manga magazine Monthly Comic Ry on 19 March 2012.[9]  The first collected tankbon volume was released on 13 September 2012.[10]  The series moved to online-only serialization when Comic Ry changed formats on 19 June 2018.[11] The series has been licensed in English by Seven Seas Entertainment and in German by Kaz.[2][3][12]\\r\\n\\r\\nA four volume anthology of four-panel spin-offs with stories by Shake-O (Nurse Hitomi's Monster Infirmary), SaQ Tottori (Kykai Senj no Limbo), and Cool-Kyou-Sinnjya (I Can't Understand What My Husband Is Saying, Komori-san Can't Decline), titled Monster Musume: I ?

After the death of one of his classmates, he fabricates a lie that inadvertently brings him closer to the classmate's family, while also allowing him to gain his own sense of purpose.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe musical has received critical acclaim, particularly for Ben Platt's leading performance, the lyrics, and the book, and has served as a touchstone for discussion about pre-mature storytelling and themes explored in musical theatre, particularly that of mental illness and youth suicide.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the  71st Tony Awards, it was nominated for nine awards, winning six, including Best Musical, Best Score, Best Actor in a Musical for Platt, and Best Featured Actress in a Musical for Rachel Bay Jones. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe musical has its origins in an incident that took place during Pasek's high school years. The musical \\"takes the notion of a teenager, ... Evan Hansen, who invents an important role for himself in a tragedy that he did not earn.\\"[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nEvan Hansen is a teenager who struggles with severe social anxiety which makes it hard for him to make friends. His therapist recommends that he write letters to himself detailing what will be good about each day. Before the first day of his senior year in high school, his mother, Heidi, suggests that he make new friends by asking people to sign the cast on his arm, which he broke by falling out of a tree over the summer.\\r\\n\\r\\nAcross town, the wealthy Murphy family  Cynthia, Larry, and their children Zoe and Connor  sit down to breakfast. Zoe and Larry berate Connor for getting high before school, while Cynthia struggles with the fact that her family is falling apart. The two mothers wonder simultaneously how to connect with their sons (\\"Anybody Have a Map?\\").\\r\\n\\r\\nAt school, Evan runs into Alana, a smart classmate, and Jared, his only friend. Both Alana and Jared notice his broken arm, but neither signs his castinstead, Jared teases Evan about it. Jared and Evan then run into Connor, whom Jared pokes fun at. Connor interprets Evan's awkwardness as making fun of him, resulting in Connor pushing Evan to the ground. Connor's sister Zoe, whom Evan has a massive crush on, feels obligated to apologize for her brother's behavior. Evan wonders if this is his destiny ÿ to be ignored and an outcast, never getting the girl of his dreams; \\"on the outside always looking in\\" for the rest of his life (\\"Waving Through A Window\\").\\r\\n\\r\\nEvan writes himself another letter. He states he has given up on it being a good year and how he wonders if anyone would notice if he were not there. He remarks that all his hope is now pinned on Zoe, since his crush on her is the only thing that brings him happiness.  While printing the letter in the school's computer lab, he encounters Connor again, now much more subdued than he was in the morning. Connor asks what happened to Evan's arm and offers to sign his cast, musing that maybe now they can both pretend they have friends. After signing the cast, he reads Evan's letter (which he grabbed from the printer as a favor) and becomes furious at the mention of Zoe, thinking Evan intended for him to see the letter in order to make fun of him. He storms out, taking the letter with him.\\r\\n\\r\\nSeveral days pass with no sign of Connor. Evan is in an intense state of anxiety over what Connor might have done with the letter, and tells Jared online about his assignment to write letters to himself, and how he's worried about what Connor might've done with the letter. Jared remarks that Connor has always been completely out of his mind. Later that day, Evan is called to the principal's office, where Connor's parents are waiting to meet him. They tell Evan that Connor died by suicide a few days before with Evan's letter in his pocket. Believing it to be Connor's suicide note addressed to Evan, they ask Evan if he and Connor were close, as Connor had never mentioned having friends before. Not wanting to further their grief and unsure what to do, Evan agrees to go to their house to talk about Connor. There, after seeing Cynthia's distress over the loss of her son, Evan panics and, rather than telling the truth, begins to fabricate an intricate story of his and Connor's friendship, claiming he and Connor kept up a secret email correspondence and recounting a fictional version of the day he broke his arm in which Connor was with him (\\"For Forever\\"). Later, Heidi reminds Evan that he needs to begin applying for college scholarships. She mentions hearing about Connor's death, but Evan tells her not to worry and that he didn't know Connor. Seeing Connor's name signed on his cast, Heidi confronts Evan, but he lies, saying that someone else named Connor signed it. After realizing he needs evidence of his supposed \\"secret email account,\\" Evan enlists Jared's help in creating fake, backdated email conversations between himself and Connor (\\"Sincerely, Me\\").\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter Evan shows the Murphy family Connor's 'emails', Cynthia is ecstatic that her son had a friend, but Larry is more hurt that Connor took his family and his privileged life for granted; Zoe, who was alienated by Connor's aggressive behavior, refuses to mourn him at all (\\"Requiem\\"). However, after reading the suicide note, Zoe notices that she is mentioned and asks Evan why Connor would say that about her; Evan, unable to tell her the truth, tells her all the reasons he loves her under the guise of Connor saying them (\\"If I Could Tell Her\\"). Overcome with emotion, he impulsively kisses Zoe, but she pulls away and tells him to leave.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt school, Evan and Alana notice that people are starting to forget about Connor. Spurred on by a vision of Connor, Evan enlists Alana and Jared's help in founding \\"The Connor Project\\"  an organization dedicated to keeping Connor's memory alive. The three pitch the idea to the Murphys, who agree to support the project (\\"Disappear\\"); moved by his dedication, Cynthia gives Evan a necktie she had gotten for Connor that he had never worn, and asks Evan to wear it when he speaks at Connor's memorial service. At the official launch of The Connor Project, Evan gives an inspiring speech about his loneliness and friendship with Connor, which goes viral. Zoe, overcome by the impact her brother and Evan have had, kisses him (\\"You Will Be Found\\").\\r\\n\\r\\nEvan and Alana pitch a fundraising idea on The Connor Project's website. In memory of Connor, they want to raise $50,000 in three weeks to reopen the abandoned apple orchard that Evan and Connor supposedly spent time in. Despite Alana's total devotion the project, Evan becomes preoccupied with his new relationship with Zoe and his newfound family in the Murphys, and begins to neglect his mother, Jared, and The Connor Project (\\"Sincerely, Me (Reprise)\\").\\r\\n\\r\\nHeidi tells Evan that she saw the video of his speech on Facebook and asks him why he did not tell her about The Connor Project or about his and Connor's friendship. He angrily responds that he did not have the time because she is never around. Overcome with emotion, he then rushes off to the Murphys', telling her that he is going to Jared's. At the Murphys', Evan bonds with Larry Murphy and confides in him that his father left when he was young, has remarried, and no longer keeps in touch with him or his other relatives. Larry offers him an old baseball glove of Connor's that was never used (\\"To Break in a Glove\\"). Sometime later, at Evan's house, Evan makes an offhand comment to Zoe about how he and his mother do not have much money and he needs scholarships to pay for college. When he begins to mention Connor, Zoe tells him that she does not want their relationship to be about Connor, but about the two of them (\\"Only Us\\").\\r\\n\\r\\nEvan gets into a fight with Jared, who claims that Connor's death was the best thing that ever happened to Evan ÿ he is no longer invisible and has landed the girl of his dreams. Later on, Evan goes to the Murphys', only to discover that they have invited Heidi for dinner. Heidi, who has no idea that Evan had spent time at the Murphys', is mortified when Larry and Cynthia offer to use the money that they had set aside for Connor's college fund to send Evan to school instead. After returning home, Heidi and Evan fight over his secrecy and deception. When Heidi proclaims that the Murphys are not Evan's family, Evan confesses that he feels not only welcomed but also accepted by the Murphys in light of Heidi's absence and expectations towards Evan's mental health. Heidi tearfully berates him for running off to his new family, while Alana begins to find inconsistencies in the fake emails Evan \\"received\\" from Connor and suspects that the entire story is a lie. Beginning to panic, Evan urges Jared to help him clear up the inaccuracies, but Jared refuses due to Evan's own absence. Evan counters that Jared himself had acted as a friend to him only when he needed something from him. Jared threatens to expose Evan, and Evan warns him he could, in turn, open up about Jared's role in the lie. Heidi, Alana, and Jared converge in Evan's conscience, compounding his guilt and doubt over his decisions (\\"Good for You\\").\\r\\n\\r\\nEvan decides he has to come clean with what he has done. Imaginary Connor attempts to talk him out of it, citing the happiness he has given the Murphys and the fate of Evan's relationship with Zoe, but Evan does not back down, angrily shouting that he needs the whole thing to be over. Connor is unconvinced and asks Evan how he broke his arm: did he fall by accident or actually let go? Evan denies suicidal intent, but Connor tells him that if he tells the truth, all he has will be gone, and the only thing he will be left with is himself. He disappears, leaving Evan alone.\\r\\n\\r\\nEvan goes to apologize to Alana, but she says she has given up on Evan helping her with The Connor Project. She doubts the truth of Evan's repeated statements that he was Connor's best friend, since they were never seen together, and she says that it is easy to create fake backdated emails. Desperate, Evan says he has proof that they were friends. He shows her the letter to himself that he wrote when he was giving up on having a good year, claiming it to be Connor's suicide note. Realizing that the letter is the key to fulfilling the fundraising goal, Alana posts it online where, to Evan's chagrin, it goes viral.  As a result, many people begin to believe Connor's suicide was because of his uncaring, wealthy parents.\\r\\n\\r\\nEvan is distraught and goes to see the Murphys, who have become the targets of hateful comments from people who believe they were responsible for Connor's death. He walks in on the three of them fighting about why Connor really killed himself and finally admits that he fabricated the entire thing, hopeful that he could forge a genuine bond with the Murphys out of the tragedy. As Zoe and her mother tearfully run out, Larry turns away from Evan in disgust. Alone once more, Evan absorbs his perceived brokenness as inescapable (\\"Words Fail\\").\\r\\n\\r\\nEvan finds Heidi waiting for him at home. She saw the letter online, and immediately knew that it was one of Evan's therapy assignments. She apologizes to Evan for not seeing how badly he had been hurting, though Evan denies her guilt due to his deception. He then vaguely admits that his fall was a suicide attempt. Heidi sits him down and recalls the day that his father moved out: how she felt so small and alone and did not know how she was going to make it by herself. In the end, however, she realized that she was not alone ÿ she had Evan and knew that the two of them could make it through anything so long as they were together. Tearfully, Heidi promises that she will always be there for him when he needs her (\\"So Big/So Small\\").\\r\\n\\r\\nA year later, Evan is still living at home and working at Pottery Barn to earn enough money to go to college the next semester. He contacts Zoe, whom he has not seen since the day she found out the truth, and asks if she will agree to meet him. She does, but insists that they meet at the orchard that has been reopened in Connor's memory. He apologizes for the pain he caused her family and admits that he has been reading Connor's ten favorite books after finding a list in an old yearbook in an attempt to connect with who he really was. He also thanks her and her parents for keeping his secret and reveals that they never told anyone else that his friendship with Connor was a lie. She forgives him, saying the whole ordeal brought her family closer together over the past year because \\"everyone needed it for something.\\" Evan asks her why she insisted on meeting at the orchard, and she replies that she wanted to be sure he saw it, and the two share a gentle moment before they part. Evan mentally writes himself one last letter reflecting on the impact he has had on his community and finally accepts himself (\\"Finale\\").\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n*Not included on the Original Broadway Cast Recording\\r\\n\\r\\nAn original Broadway cast album was released at midnight on February 3, 2017. The second song on the album, \\"Waving Through A Window\\", was released as a special early download for those who had pre-ordered the album.[6] The fifth song, \\"Requiem\\", was made available to stream for 24 hours on January 26, 2017, a week before the release of the cast recording.[7] The song was released as a second pre-order bonus the next day. The recording of the Act 1 finale \\"You Will Be Found\\" was available for a first listen online on January 30, 2017.[8] The cast album debuted at number 8 on the February 25 Billboard 200.[9][10] The cast album became available in compact disc format on February 24, 2017. The cast album, produced by Alex Lacamoire, featuring the band from both the original Off-Broadway and Broadway productions, including Ben Cohn (piano), Jamie Eblen (drums), Justin Goldner and Dillon Kondor (guitars), Rob Jost (bass), Justin Smith, Todd Low and Adele Stein (strings)[11] and won the 2018 Grammy Award for Best Musical Theater Album.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nDear Evan Hansen premiered at the Arena Stage in Washington, D.C., running from July 10 to August 23, 2015.[13]  Directed by Michael Greif, with orchestrations by Alex Lacamoire, the set was designed by David Korins and the projection design was by Peter Nigrini. The cast featured Ben Platt in the title role.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe musical opened Off-Broadway at the Second Stage Theater on March 26, 2016, in previews, with the official opening on May 1. The cast featured Ben Platt, Laura Dreyfuss, Mike Faist, Rachel Bay Jones, Will Roland and Jennifer Laura Thompson repeating their roles from the Arena Stage production. New cast members were John Dossett and Kristolyn Lloyd. Michael Greif again directed, with choreography by Danny Mefford.[14][15][16][17] The Off-Broadway engagement closed on May 29, 2016.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe show premiered on Broadway on November 14, 2016, in previews, and officially opened on December 4.[18] After originally announcing that performances would take place at the Belasco Theatre, in mid-September 2016, producers announced that the show would instead be performed at the Music Box Theatre. Michael Park, who originated the role of Larry in the Arena Stage production, returned for the Broadway production (replacing John Dossett who went on to the musical War Paint). All other cast members from the Second Stage production returned for the Broadway engagement.[19][20][21] Ben Platt played his last performance on November 19, 2017. Noah Galvin replaced Platt on November 21, 2017 and played until February 2018.[3] Taylor Trensch played two performances in the show before officially replacing Galvin on February 6, 2018.\\r\\n\\r\\nA U.S. Tour was announced, starring Ben Levi Ross in the title role.[22] It will also star Jessica Phillips in the role of Heidi Hansen,[23] Jared Goldsmith in the role of Jared Kleinman,[24] and Phoebe Koyabe in the role of Alana Beck.[25] Also joining the cast will be Christiane Noll in the role of Cynthia Murphy, Aaron Lazar as Larry Murphy, Marrick Smith in the role of Connor Murphy, and Maggie Mckenna in the role of Zoe Murphy.[26] The tour will start in Denver in October 2018 and will go on to play more than fifty cities.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe show will play its first international performance in Toronto, Canada. The production is slated to begin performances in March 2019.[27]\\r\\n\\r\\nDerek Mong, in his review of the musical at the Arena Stage, wrote that the \\"inventive set design by David Korins...that transforms a small stage into a platform for the most intimate living room where a mother and son share a heart-to-heart to the physical abyss of internet cyberspace... book by Steven Levenson... lyrics and music by Benj Pasek and Justin Paul... heartfelt lyrics with universal appeal joined by the perfect, oftentimes acoustic, accompaniment that can change the mood from somber to celebratory to sinister in a single bar of music.\\"[28]\\r\\n\\r\\nBarbara Mackay in reviewing the Arena Stage production for TheatreMania wrote: \\"Levenson, Pasek, and Paul set themselves two high, untraditional bars in Evan Hansen: exploring a community's grief and examining a lonely protagonist who desperately wants to connect with that community... Ben Platt is outstanding as Evan... Since the success of the musical depends entirely on whether Evan's solitary nature appears funny or weird, Evan's ability to laugh at himself and make the audience laugh is crucial. Platt is charming as he eternally twists his shirt tails and hangs his head... Although the themes of grief and loneliness are serious, the musical is anything but somber. It addresses challenging facts of life. But from start to finish, when Evan leaves his room and finds an authentic life outside it, Dear Evan Hansen contains far more joy than sadness.\\"[29]\\r\\n\\r\\nSusan Davidson, in her review of the Arena Stage production for CurtainUp, noted: \\"...it helps to suspend the disbelief that sullen, anti-social teenagers can change quickly. Surely that's a process requiring time-released hormonal adjustments. It is hard to accept that a long-admired-from-afar girl can change Evan's outlook on life so rapidly or that Connor's teenage disequilibrium leads him to do what he does. Coming through loud and clear, however, is the fact that what starts as deceit can be blown totally out of proportion by the Internet where lies are disseminated with lightning speed leaving plenty of victims in their wake...The music is pleasant, not terribly original but good enough to get toes tapping. Benj Pasek and Justin Paul's ballads stand out, particularly Heidi's \\"So Big/So Small,\\" Evan's \\"Words Fail\\" and Zoe and Evan's young sweethearts duet \\"Only Us.\\"\\"[30]\\r\\n\\r\\nCharles Isherwood, in his review of the Second Stage production for The New York Times, noted: \\"The songs, by Benj Pasek and Justin Paul (Dogfight, A Christmas Story), strike the same complex notes, with shapely, heartfelt lyrics that expose the tensions and conflicts that Connors death and Evans involvement cause in both families. The music, played by a small but excellent band on a platform upstage, is appealingly unstrident pop-rock, with generous doses of acoustic guitar, keyboards and strings. Its the finest, most emotionally resonant score yet from this promising young songwriting team.\\"[31]\\r\\n\\r\\nDear Evan Hansen is a recipient of the Edgerton Foundation New Play Award.[32]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe musical was adapted into a young adult novel by actor and singer-songwriter Val Emmich, in collaboration with Pasek & Paul and Levenson. The novel, which will also feature additional material based on scenes and songs cut from the show's development that flesh out and expand upon the story, will be released by Little, Brown Books for Young Readers on October 9, 2018.[45]","input":"What happened to connor murphy dear evan hansen?"},{"output":"Neiphiu Rio of the Nationalist Democratic Progressive Party","context":"The Chief Minister of Nagaland is the chief executive of the northeast Indian state of Nagaland. As per the Constitution of India, the governor is a state's de jure head, but de facto executive authority rests with the chief minister. Following elections to the Nagaland Legislative Assembly, the state's governor usually invites the party (or coalition) with a majority of seats to form the government. The governor appoints the chief minister, whose council of ministers are collectively responsible to the assembly. Given that he has the confidence of the assembly, the chief minister's term is for five years and is subject to no term limits.[1]\\r\\nSince 1963, ten people belonging to seven parties have served as Chief Minister of Nagaland.

It is established by the provisions of the Korean Armistice Agreement to serve as a buffer zone between North Korea and South Korea. The demilitarized zone (DMZ) is a border barrier that divides the Korean Peninsula roughly in half. It was created by agreement between North Korea, China and the United Nations in 1953. The DMZ is 250 kilometres (160 miles) long, and about 4 kilometres (2.5 miles) wide.\\r\\n\\r\\nWithin the DMZ is a meeting point between the two nations in the small Joint Security Area (JSA) near the western end of the zone, where negotiations take place. There have been various incidents in and around the DMZ, with military and civilian casualties on both sides. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Korean Demilitarized Zone intersects but does not follow the 38th parallel north, which was the border before the Korean War. It crosses the parallel on an angle, with the west end of the DMZ lying south of the parallel and the east end lying north of it.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe DMZ is 250 kilometres (160 miles) long,[1] approximately 4?km (2.5?mi) wide. Though the zone separating both sides is demilitarized, beyond that strip the border is one of the most heavily militarized borders in the world.[2] The Northern Limit Line, or NLL, is the disputed maritime demarcation line between North and South Korea in the Yellow Sea, not agreed in the armistice. The coastline and islands on both sides of the NLL are also heavily militarized.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 38th parallel northwhich divides the Korean Peninsula roughly in halfwas the original boundary between the United States and Soviet Union's brief administration areas of Korea at the end of World War II. Upon the creation of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK, informally North Korea) and the Republic of Korea (ROK, informally South Korea) in 1948, it became a de facto international border and one of the most tense fronts in the Cold War.\\r\\n\\r\\nBoth the North and the South remained dependent on their sponsor states from 1948 to the outbreak of the Korean War. That conflict, which claimed over three million lives and divided the Korean Peninsula along ideological lines, commenced on 25 June 1950, with a full-front DPRK invasion across the 38th parallel, and ended in 1953 after international intervention pushed the front of the war back to near the 38th parallel.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the Armistice Agreement of 27 July 1953, the DMZ was created as each side agreed to move their troops back 2,000?m (2,200 yards) from the front line, creating a buffer zone 4?km (2.5?mi) wide. The Military Demarcation Line (MDL) goes through the center of the DMZ and indicates where the front was when the agreement was signed.\\r\\n\\r\\nOwing to this theoretical stalemate, and genuine hostility between the North and the South, large numbers of troops are still stationed along both sides of the line, each side guarding against potential aggression from the other side. The armistice agreement explains exactly how many military personnel and what kind of weapons are allowed in the DMZ. Soldiers from both sides may patrol inside the DMZ, but they may not cross the MDL; ROK soldiers, however heavily armed, patrol under the aegis of military police, and have memorized each line of the armistice.[4]  Sporadic outbreaks of violence have killed over 500 South Korean soldiers, 50 US soldiers and 250 soldiers from DPRK along the DMZ between 1953 and 1999.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nDaeseong-dong (also written Tae Sung Dong) and Kij?ng-dong are the only settlements allowed by the armistice committee to remain within the boundaries of the DMZ.[6] Residents of Tae Sung Dong are governed and protected by the United Nations Command and are generally required to spend at least 240 nights per year in the village to maintain their residency.[6] In 2008, the village had a population of 218 people.[6] The villagers of Tae Sung Dong are direct descendants of people who owned the land before the 1950ÿ53 Korean War.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nTo continue to deter North Korean incursion, in 2014 the United States government exempted the Korean DMZ from its pledge to eliminate anti-personnel landmines.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nInside the DMZ, near the western coast of the peninsula, Panmunjom is the home of the Joint Security Area (JSA). Originally, it was the only connection between North and South Korea[9] but that changed on 17 May 2007, when a Korail train went through the DMZ  to the North on the new Donghae Bukbu Line built on the east coast of Korea. However, the resurrection of this line was short-lived, as it closed again in July 2008 following an incident in which a South Korean tourist was shot and killed.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are several buildings on both the north and the south side of the Military Demarcation Line (MDL), and there have been some built on top of it. The JSA is the location where all negotiations since 1953 have been held, including statements of Korean solidarity, which have generally amounted to little except a slight decline of tensions. The MDL goes through the conference rooms and down the middle of the conference tables where the North Koreans and the United Nations Command (primarily South Koreans and Americans) meet face to face.\\r\\n\\r\\nWithin the JSA are a number of buildings for joint meetings called Conference Row. These are used for direct talks between the Korean War participants and parties to the armistice. Facing the Conference Row buildings are the North Korean Panmungak (English: Panmun Hall) and the South Korean Freedom House. In 1994, North Korea enlarged Panmungak by adding a third floor. In 1998, South Korea built a new Freedom House for its Red Cross staff and to possibly host reunions of families separated by the Korean War. The new building incorporated the old Freedom House Pagoda within its design.\\r\\n\\r\\nSince 1953 there have been occasional confrontations and skirmishes within the JSA. The axe murder incident in August 1976 involved the attempted trimming of a tree which resulted in two deaths (Captain Arthur Bonifas and First Lieutenant Mark Barrett). Another incident occurred on 23 November 1984, when a Soviet tourist named Vasily Matuzok (sometimes spelled Matusak), who was part of an official trip to the JSA (hosted by the North), ran across the MDL shouting that he wanted to defect.[10] North Korean troops immediately chased after him, opening fire. Border guards on the South Korean side returned fire, eventually surrounding the North Koreans as they pursued Matusak. One South Korean and three North Korean soldiers were killed in the action, and Matusak was not captured.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn late 2009, South Korean forces in conjunction with the United Nations Command began renovation of its three guard posts and two checkpoint buildings within the JSA compound. Construction was designed to enlarge and modernize the structures. Work was undertaken a year after North Korea finished replacing four JSA guard posts on its side of the MDL.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nBoth North and South Korea maintain peace villages in sight of each other's side of the DMZ. In the South, Daeseong-dong is administered under the terms of the DMZ. Villagers are classed as Republic of Korea citizens, but are exempt from paying tax and other civic requirements such as military service. In the North, Kij?ng-dong features a number of brightly painted, poured-concrete multi-story buildings and apartments with electric lighting. These features represented an unheard-of level of luxury for rural Koreans, north or south, in the 1950s. The town was oriented so that the bright blue roofs and white sides of the buildings would be the most distinguishing features when viewed from the border. However, based on scrutiny with modern telescopic lenses, it has been claimed the buildings are mere concrete shells lacking window glass or even interior rooms,[13][14] with the building lights turned on and off at set times and the empty sidewalks swept by a skeleton crew of caretakers in an effort to preserve the illusion of activity.[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the 1980s, the South Korean government built a 98.4?m (323?ft) flagpole in Daeseong-dong, which flies a South Korean flag weighing 130 kilograms (287 pounds). In what some have called the \\"flagpole war,\\" the North Korean government responded by building the 160?m (525?ft) Panmunjeom flagpole in Kij?ng-dong, only 1.2?km (0.7?mi) west of the border with South Korea. It flies a 270?kg (595?lb) flag of North Korea. As of 2014, the Panmunjom flagpole is the fourth tallest in the world, after the Jeddah Flagpole in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, at 170?m (558?ft), the Dushanbe Flagpole in Dushanbe, Tajikistan, at 165?m (541?ft) and the pole at the National Flag Square in Baku, Azerbaijan, which is 162?m (531?ft).[16][17]\\r\\n\\r\\nSince demarcation, the DMZ has had numerous cases of incidents and incursions by both sides, although the North Korean government typically never acknowledges direct responsibility for any of these incidents (there are exceptions, such as the axe incident).[18] This was particularly intense during the Korean DMZ Conflict (1966ÿ1969) when a series of skirmishes along the DMZ resulted in the deaths of 43 American, 299 South Korean and 397 North Korean soldiers.[19] This included the Blue House Raid in 1968, an attempt to assassinate President Park Chung Hee at the Blue House.[20]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1976, in now-declassified meeting minutes, U.S. Deputy Secretary of Defense William Clements told Henry Kissinger that there had been 200 raids or incursions into North Korea from the south, though not by the U.S. military.[21] Details of only a few of these incursions have become public, including raids by South Korean forces in 1967 that had sabotaged about 50 North Korean facilities.[22]\\r\\n\\r\\nSince 15 November 1974, South Korea has discovered four tunnels crossing the DMZ that had been dug by North Korea; the orientation of the blasting lines within each tunnel indicated they were dug by North Korea. North Korea claimed that the tunnels were for coal mining; however, no coal was found in the tunnels, which were dug through granite. Some of the tunnel walls were painted black to give the appearance of anthracite.[23]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe tunnels are believed to have been planned as a military invasion route by North Korea. They run in a north-south direction and do not have branches. Following each discovery, engineering within the tunnels has become progressively more advanced. For example, the third tunnel sloped slightly upwards as it progressed southward, to prevent water stagnation. Today, visitors from the south may visit the second, third and fourth tunnels through guided tours.[24]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first of the tunnels was discovered on 20 November 1974, by a South Korean Army patrol, noticing steam rising from the ground. The initial discovery was met with automatic fire from North Korean soldiers. Five days later, during a subsequent exploration of this tunnel, US Navy Commander Robert M. Ballinger and ROK Marine Corps Major Kim Hah-chul were killed in the tunnel by a North Korean explosive device. The blast also wounded five Americans and one South Korean from the United Nations Command.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe tunnel, which was about 0.9 by 1.2?m (3 by 4?ft), extended more than 1?km (0.62?mi) beyond the MDL into South Korea. The tunnel was reinforced with concrete slabs and had electric power and lighting. There were weapon storage and sleeping areas. A narrow-gauge railway with carts had also been installed. Estimates based on the tunnel's size suggest it would have allowed considerable numbers of soldiers to pass through it.[25]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe second tunnel was discovered on 19 March 1975. It is of similar length to the first tunnel. It is located between 50 and 160?m (160 and 520?ft) below ground, but is larger than the first, approximately 2 by 2?m (7 by 7 feet).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe third tunnel was discovered on 17 October 1978. Unlike the previous two, the third tunnel was discovered following a tip from a North Korean defector. This tunnel is about 1,600?m (5,200?ft) long and about 73?m (240?ft) below ground.[26] Foreign visitors touring the South Korean DMZ may view inside this tunnel using a sloped access shaft.\\r\\n\\r\\nA fourth tunnel was discovered on 3 March 1990, north of Haean town in the former Punchbowl battlefield. The tunnel's dimensions are 2 by 2?m (7 by 7 feet), and it is 145 metres (476?ft) deep. The method of construction is almost identical in structure to the second and the third tunnels.[27]\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to North Korea, between 1977 and 1979 the South Korean and United States authorities constructed a concrete wall along the DMZ.[28] North Korea, however, began to propagate information about the wall after the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, when the symbolism of a wall unjustly dividing a people became more apparent.[29]\\r\\n\\r\\nVarious organisations, such as the North Korean tour guide company Korea Konsult, claimed a wall was dividing Korea, saying that:\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the area south of the Military Demarcation Line, which cuts across Korea at its waist, there is a concrete wall which ... stretches more than 240?km (149?mi) from east to west, is 5ÿ8?m (16ÿ26?ft) high, 10ÿ19?m (33ÿ62?ft) thick at the bottom, and 3ÿ7?m (10ÿ23?ft) wide in the upper part. It is set with wire entanglements and dotted with gun embrasures, look-outs and varieties of military establishments.[30]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn December 1999, Chu Chang-jun, North Korea's ambassador to China, repeated claims that a \\"wall\\" divided Korea. He said the south side of the wall is packed with soil, which permits access to the top of the wall and makes it effectively invisible from the south side. He also claimed that it served as a bridgehead for any northward invasion.[31][32]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe United States and South Korea deny the wall's existence, although they do claim there are anti-tank barriers along some sections of the DMZ.[33]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the RT documentary 10 Days in North Korea, the crew shot footage of a wall as seen from North Korea and described it as a \\"5 metre high wall stretching from east to west\\".[34] Dutch journalist and filmmaker Peter Tetteroo also shot footage of a barrier in 2001 which his North Korean guides said was the Korean Wall.[28]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe North Korean side of the DMZ primarily serves to defend North Korea from invasion by South Korean forces. It also serves a similar function as the Berlin Wall and the inner German border did against its own citizens in the former East Germany in that it stops North Korean citizens from defecting to South Korea.[35][36]\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom the armistice until 1972, approximately 7,700 South Korean soldiers and agents infiltrated North Korea to sabotage military bases and industrial areas.[37]\\r\\n\\r\\nNorth Korea has thousands of artillery pieces near the DMZ. According to a 2018 article in The Economist, North Korea could bombard Seoul with over 10,000 rounds every minute.[38] Experts believe that 60 percent of its total artillery is positioned within a few kilometers of the DMZ acting as a deterrent against any South Korean invasion.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom 1953 until 2004 both sides broadcast audio propaganda across the DMZ.[39] Massive loudspeakers mounted on several of the buildings delivered DPRK propaganda broadcasts directed towards the south as well as propaganda radio broadcasts across the border.[13] In 2004, the North and South agreed to end the broadcasts.[39]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn August 2015, a border incident occurred where two South Korean soldiers were wounded after stepping on landmines that had allegedly been laid on the southern side of the DMZ by North Korean forces near an ROK guard post.[40][41] Both North Korea and South Korea then resumed broadcasting propaganda by loudspeaker.[42]  After four days of negotiations, on August 25, 2015 South Korea agreed to discontinue the broadcasts following a statement from North Korea's government expressing \\"regret\\" for the landmine incident.[43]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 8 January 2016, in response to North Korea's supposed successful testing of a hydrogen bomb, South Korea resumed broadcasts directed at the north.[44]  On 15 April 2016, it was reported that the South Koreans purchased a new stereo system to combat the North's broadcasts.[45]\\r\\n\\r\\nBoth North and South Korea have held balloon propaganda leaflet campaigns since the Korean War.[46]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn recent years, mainly South Korean non-governmental organizations have been involved in launching balloons targeted at the DMZ and beyond.[47] Due to the winds, the balloons tend to fall near the DMZ where there are mostly North Korean soldiers to see the leaflets.[48] As with the loudspeakers, balloon operations were mutually agreed to be halted between 2004 and 2010.[49] It has been assessed that the activists' balloons may contribute to the decay of remaining cooperation between the Korean governments,[50] and the DMZ has become more militarized in recent years.[51]\\r\\n\\r\\nMany North Korean leaflets during the Cold War gave instructions and maps to help the targeted South Korean soldiers in defecting. One of the leaflets found on the DMZ included a map of Cho Dae-hum's route of defection to North Korea across the DMZ. In addition to using balloons as a means of delivery, North Koreans have also used rockets to send leaflets to the DMZ.[52]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Civilian Control Line is a line that designates an additional buffer zone to the DMZ within a distance of 5 to 20?km from the Southern Limit Line of the DMZ. Its purpose is to limit and control the entrance of civilians into the area in order to protect and maintain the security of military facilities and operations near the DMZ. The commander of the 8th US Army ordered the creation of the CCL and it was activated and first became effective in February 1954.[53]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe buffer zone that falls south of the Southern Limit Line is called the Civilian Control Zone. Barbed wire fences and manned military guard posts mark the Civilian Control Line. The Civilian Control Zone is necessary for the military to monitor civilian travel to tourist destinations close to the Southern Limit Line of the DMZ like the discovered infiltration tunnels and tourist observatories. Usually when traveling within the Civilian Control Zone, South Korean soldiers accompany tourist buses and cars as armed guards to monitor the civilians as well as to protect them from North Korean intruders.\\r\\n\\r\\nRight after the ceasefire, the Civilian Control Zone outside the DMZ encompassed 100 or so empty villages. The government implemented migration measures to attract settlers into the area. As a result, in 1983, when the area delineated by the Civilian Control Line was at its largest, a total of 39,725 residents in 8,799 households were living in the 81 villages located within the Civilian Control Zone.[54]\\r\\n\\r\\nMost of the tourist and media photos of the \\"DMZ fence\\" are actually photos of the CCL fence. The actual DMZ fence on the Southern Limit Line is completely off-limits to everybody except soldiers and it is illegal to take pictures of the DMZ fence. The CCL fence acts more as a deterrent for South Korean civilians from getting too close to the dangerous DMZ and is also the final barrier for North Korean infiltrators if they get past the Southern Limit Line DMZ fence.[55]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe whole estuary of the Han River is deemed a \\"Neutral Zone\\" and is off-limits to all civilian vessels and is treated like the rest of the DMZ. Only military vessels are allowed within this neutral zone.\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to the July 1953 Korean Armistice Agreement civil shipping was supposed to be permissible in the Han River estuary and allow Seoul to be connected to the Yellow Sea (West Sea) via the Han River.[56] However, both Koreas and the UNC failed to make this happen. The South Korean government ordered the construction of the Ara Canal to finally connect Seoul to the Yellow Sea (West Sea), which was completed in 2012. Seoul was effectively landlocked from the ocean until 2012. The biggest limitation of the Ara Canal is it is too narrow to handle any vessels except small tourist boats and recreational boats, so Seoul still cannot receive large commercial ships or passenger ships in its port.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn recent years Chinese fishing vessels have taken advantage of the tense situation in the Han River Estuary Neutral Zone and illegally fished in this area due to both the North Korean and South Korean navies never patrolling this area due to the fear of naval battles breaking out. This has led to firefights and sinkings of boats between Chinese fishermen and the South Korean Coast Guard.[57][58]\\r\\n\\r\\nWithin the DMZ itself, in the town of Cheorwon, is the old capital of the kingdom of Taebong (901ÿ918), a regional upstart that became Goryeo, the dynasty that ruled a united Korea from 918 to 1392.\\r\\n\\r\\nTaebong was founded by the charismatic leader Gung Ye, a brilliant if tyrannical one-eyed ex-Buddhist monk. Rebelling against the kingdom of Silla, Korea's then ruling dynasty, he proclaimed the kingdom of Taebongalso called Later Goguryeo, in reference to the ancient kingdom of Goguryeo (37BC-668AD)in 901, with himself as king. The kingdom consisted of much of central Korea, including areas around the DMZ. He placed his capital in Cheorwon, a mountainous region that was easily defensible (in the Korean War, this same region would earn the name \\"the Iron Triangle\\").\\r\\n\\r\\nAs a former Buddhist monk, Gung Ye actively promoted the religion of Buddhism and incorporated Buddhist ceremonies into the new kingdom. Even after Gung Ye was dethroned by his own generals and replaced by Wang Geon, the man who would rule over a united Korea as the first king of Goryeo, this Buddhist influence would continue, playing a major role in shaping the culture of medieval Korea.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the ruins of Gung Ye's capital lie in the DMZ itself, visitors cannot see them. Moreover, excavation work and research have been hampered by political realities. In the future, inter-Korean peace may allow for proper archaeological studies to be conducted on the castle site and other historical sites within and underneath the DMZ.[59]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe ruins of the capital city of Taebong, the ruins of the castle of Gung Ye, and King Gung Ye's tomb all lie within the DMZ and are off-limits to everybody except soldiers who patrol the DMZ.[60]\\r\\n\\r\\nPanmunjeom is the site of the negotiations that ended the Korean War and is the main center of human activity in the DMZ.  The village is located on the main highway and near a railroad connecting the two Koreas.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe railway, which connects Seoul and Pyongyang, was called the Gyeongui Line before division in the 1940s.  Currently the South uses the original name, but the North refers to the route as the P'y?ngbu Line. The railway line has been mainly used to carry materials and South Korean workers to the Kaesong Industrial Region. Its reconnection has been seen as part of the general improvement in the relations between North and South in the early part of this century. However, in November 2008 North Korean authorities closed the railway amid growing tensions with the South.[61] Following the death of former South Korean President Kim Dae-jung, conciliatory talks were held between South Korean officials and a North Korean delegation who attended Kim's funeral. In September 2009, the Kaesong rail and road crossing was reopened.[62]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe road at Panmunjeom, which was known historically as Highway One in the South, was originally the only access point between the two countries on the Korean Peninsula. Passage is comparable to the strict movements that occurred at Checkpoint Charlie in Berlin at the height of the Cold War. Both North and South Korea's roads end in the JSA; the highways do not quite join as there is a 20?cm (8?in) concrete line that divides the entire site. People given the rare permission to cross this border must do so on foot before continuing their journey by road.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2007, on the east coast of Korea, the first train crossed the DMZ on the new Donghae Bukbu (Tonghae Pukpu) Line. The new rail crossing was built adjacent to the road which took South Koreans to Mount Kumgang Tourist Region, a region that has significant cultural importance for all Koreans. More than one million civilian visitors crossed the DMZ until the route was closed following the shooting of a 53-year-old South Korean tourist in July 2008.[63] After a joint investigation was rebuffed by North Korea, the South Korean government suspended tours to the resort. Since then the resort and the Donghae Bukbu Line have effectively been closed by North Korea.[64][65]\\r\\nCurrently, the South Korean Korea Railroad Corporation (Korail) organizes tours to DMZ with special DMZ themed trains.[66]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the past half century, the Korean DMZ has been a deadly place for humans, making habitation impossible. Only around the village of Panmunjeom and more recently the Donghae Bukbu Line on Korea's east coast have there been regular incursions by people.[67][68]\\r\\n\\r\\nThis natural isolation along the 250?km (160?mi) length of the DMZ has created an involuntary park which is now recognized as one of the most well-preserved areas of temperate habitat in the world.[69] In 1966 it was first proposed that the DMZ be turned into a national park.[70]\\r\\n\\r\\nSeveral endangered animal and plant species now exist among the heavily fortified fences, landmines and listening posts. These include the endangered red-crowned crane (a staple of Asian art), the white-naped crane, and, potentially, the extremely rare Siberian tiger,[69] Amur leopard, and Asiatic black bear. Ecologists have identified some 2,900 plant species, 70 types of mammals and 320 kinds of birds within the narrow buffer zone.[69] Additional surveys are now being conducted throughout the region.[71]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe DMZ owes its varied biodiversity to its geography, which crosses mountains, prairies, swamps, lakes, and tidal marshes. Environmentalists hope that the DMZ will be conserved as a wildlife refuge, with a well-developed set of objective and management plans vetted and in place. In 2005, CNN founder and media mogul Ted Turner, on a visit to North Korea, said that he would financially support any plans to turn the DMZ into a peace park and a UN-protected World Heritage Site.[72]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn September 2011, South Korea submitted a nomination form to Man and the Biosphere Programme (MAB) in UNESCO for designation of 435?km2 (168?sq?mi) in the southern part of the DMZ below the Military Demarcation Line, as well as 2,979?km2 (1,150?sq?mi) in privately controlled areas, as a Biosphere Reserve according to the Statutory Framework of the World Network of Biosphere Reserves.[73]  MAB National Committee of the Republic of Korea mentioned only southern part of DMZ to be nominated since there was no response from Pyongyang when it requested Pyongyang to push jointly. North Korea is a member nation of the international coordinating council of UNESCO's Man and the Biosphere (MAB) Programme, which designates Biosphere Reserves.[74]\\r\\n\\r\\nNorth Korea opposed the application as a violation of the armistice agreement during the council's meeting in Paris on July 9 to 13. The South Korean government's attempt to designate the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve was turned down at UNESCO's MAB council meeting in Paris in July 2012. Pyongyang expressed its opposition by sending letters to 32 council member countries, except for South Korea, and the UNESCO headquarters a month prior to the meeting. At the council meeting, Pyongyang said the designation violated the Armistice Agreement.[75]\\r\\n\\r\\nCoordinates: 381944N 1271500E? / ?38.329N 127.250E? / 38.329; 127.250","input":"How long is the border between north korea and south korea?"},{"output":"Bring It On","context":"Bring It On is a 2000 American teen comedy film directed by Peyton Reed and written by Jessica Bendinger. The film stars Kirsten Dunst, Eliza Dushku, Jesse Bradford, and Gabrielle Union. It was the first of the Bring It On film series and was followed by five direct-to-video sequels, none of which contain any of the original cast members: Bring It On Again (2004), which shared producers with the original, Bring It On: All or Nothing (2006), Bring It On: In It to Win It (2007), Bring It On: Fight to the Finish (2009) and Bring It On: Worldwide Cheersmack (2017). The plot of the film centers around a team's preparation for and participation in cheerleading competitions.\\r\\nBring It On was released in theaters in the North America on August 25, 2000. Bring It On earned a worldwide gross of approximately $90 million. Since its release, the film has become a cult classic.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTorrance Shipman, a student at Rancho Carne High School in San Diego, anxiously dreams about her first day of senior year. Her boyfriend, Aaron has gone to college, and her white cheerleading squad, the Toros, is aiming for a sixth consecutive national title. Torrance is elected to replace the team captain, \\"Big Red\\" who is graduating. Soon, however, teammate Carver is injured and can no longer compete with her broken leg. Torrance holds an audition for Carver's replacement and gains Missy Pantone, a gymnast who recently transferred to the school for senior year with her twin brother Cliff, with whom Torrance develops a flirtatious friendship. While watching the Toros practice, Missy recognizes their routines from a rival squad that her previous high school used to compete against. After accusing Torrance of being a liar and stealing the routine, she learns from Torrance's offended and passionately defensive reaction that she was completely unaware. So Missy drives Torrance to Los Angeles, where they watch an African American team, the East Compton Clovers, perform routines that are virtually identical to their own team's. Isis, the Clovers' team captain, angrily confronts the two. Torrance learns that \\"Big Red\\" regularly attended the Clovers' practices to videotape and steal their routines. In the meantime, Missy is seen as a threat by the other female members of the squad (because of her outstanding gymnastic abilities), but she ends up becoming Torrance's best friend and de facto co-captain.\\r\\nIsis informs Torrance of her plans to defeat the Toros at the regional and national championships, which the team has never attended due to their economic hardship. When Torrance tells the Toros about the routines, the team still votes in favor of using the current routine to win; Torrance reluctantly agrees. At the Toros' next home game, Isis and her teammates show up and perform the Toros' routine in front of the whole school, humiliating them. The Toros realize that they have no choice but to learn a different routine. In desperation, they employ a professional choreographer named Sparky Polastri to provide one, as suggested by Aaron. But at the Regionals, the team scheduled immediately ahead of the Toros performs the exact routine they had been practicing. The Toros have no choice but to perform the very same routine. After the debacle that ensues, Torrance speaks to a competition official and is told Polastri provided the routine to several other teams in California. As the defending champions, the Toros are nevertheless granted their place in Nationals, but Torrance is warned that a new routine will be expected. Torrance, crushed by her failure to lead the team successfully, considers quitting.\\r\\nCliff encourages and supports her, intensifying their growing attraction. Aaron, however, suggests that she is not leadership material and recommends that she step down from her position, selling her out in the process to Courtney and Whitney who have set themselves up as Torrance's rivals. When Cliff sees Torrance and Aaron together, he angrily severs his friendship with Torrance, to her distress. But her confidence is renewed by Cliff's encouragement and she convinces her unhappy team to create an innovative, new routine instead. She breaks up with Aaron, realizing his infidelity and his inability to be supportive, but Cliff still refuses to forgive her. Meanwhile, the Clovers are initially unable to compete at Nationals due to financial problems. This prompts Torrance to get her dad's company to sponsor the Clovers, but Isis rejects the money and gets her team to Nationals by appealing to a talk show host who grew up in their area. In the finals, the Toros place second, while the Clovers win. However, at the end of the movie, Torrance and Isis find respect in each other. Cliff and Torrance share a romantic kiss.\\r\\nBloopers run alongside the end credits, as the characters dance and lip-sync to B*Witched's cover of \\"Mickey\\".\\r\\nBring It On was produced by Marc Abraham and Thomas Bliss. It was the debut film of director Peyton Reed. His major concern with the film was pushing the sexual aspects of cheerleading without losing a PG-13 rating.[2] Roger Ebert from the Chicago Sun-Times argued that this agenda followed a trend of films at the time that watered down material in order to avoid an R rating and increase box office gross.[3]\\r\\nPrior to auditioning for the film, actors were expected to have a cheer prepared.[4] In order to avoid the use of stunt doubles, Reed required all the actors to undergo a four-week cheerleading camp.[4] Reed and Gabrielle Union met numerous times to discuss the best way to approach her character.[4] \\"I think she was able to find what was cool about that character that in a way I doubt other actresses could have,\\" Reed explained in an interview, \\"Whenever she's on the screen she has this charisma.\\"[4] When editing the film, Reed and editor Larry Bock watched cheerleading exploitation films from the 1970s.[2]\\r\\nBring It On was released in North America on August 25, 2000. The film grossed $17,362,105 in 2,380 theaters during its opening weekend, ranking first at the North American box office.[5] Although it experienced an 18% decline in gross earnings, the film held the top position for a second consecutive week, and later on a third.[5] The film went on to gross $68,379,000 in North America and an additional $22,070,929 overseas for a total gross of $90,449,929.[1]\\r\\nThe film received a 63% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on a total of 117 compiled reviews; the site's consensus reads: \\"Despite the formulaic, fluffy storyline, this movie is surprisingly fun to watch, mostly due to its high energy and how it humorously spoofs cheerleading instead of taking itself too seriously.\\"[6] In comparison, Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, gave the film an average score of 52 based on 31 reviews, indicating \\"Mixed or average reviews\\".[7]\\r\\nA. O. Scott from The New York Times commended the film for being able to \\"gesture toward serious matters of race and economic inequality\\", as well as for its \\"occasional snarl of genuine satire\\".[8] Kevin Thomas of The Los Angeles Times also favored the film, calling it a \\"Smart and sassy high school movie that's fun for all ages.\\"[7] Steven Rae from The Philadelphia Inquirer found it to be a \\"likable, low-budget high school comedy\\".[7] Meanwhile, Kim Morgan of The Oregonian dubbed it the \\"newest, and probably first, true cheerleading movie.\\"[7]\\r\\nHowever, some reviewers criticized the plot of the film. Although David Sterritt of The Christian Science Monitor gave praise for the writing, he likened the storyline's simplicity to that of \\"the average football cheer\\".[7] Kim Edwards from the Chicago Tribune, in a negative review, found the film \\"Absurdly unrealistic at times.\\"[7] The Seattle Post-Intelligencer's Paula Nechak concluded that the film was \\"predictable and surprisingly confusing in its ultimate message. \\"[7]\\r\\nMany critics reserved praise for Kirsten Dunst's performance. In his review, A. O. Scott called her \\"a terrific comic actress, largely because of her great expressive range, and the nimbleness with which she can shift from anxiety to aggression to genuine hurt.\\"[8] Charles Taylor of Salon noted that \\"among contemporary teenage actresses, Dunst has become the sunniest imaginable parodist.\\"[9] Jessica Winter from The Village Voice shared this sentiment, commenting that \\"[Dunst] provides the only major element of Bring It On that plays as tweaking parody rather than slick, strident, body-slam churlishness.\\"[10] Peter Stack of the San Francisco Chronicle, despite giving the film an unfavorable review, commended Dunst for her willingness \\"to be as silly and cloyingly agreeable as it takes to get through a slapdash film.\\"[11]\\r\\nCultural historian Maud Lavin says that despite Bring It On's predictable plot, its depiction of aggressive and competitive women, the differences shown between class and race, and the playful way it deals with homophobia gives it deeper cultural clout and meaning. In particular, Lavin says that the film suggests race relations could be \\"smoothed and transcended through level-playing-field sports competitiveness.\\"[12]\\r\\nThe film ranked #30 on Entertainment Weekly's list of the 50 Best High School Movies.[13] Initially unimpressed with the film and giving it 2 of 4 stars, Roger Ebert later referred to it as the \\"Citizen Kane of cheerleader movies.\\"[14]\\r\\nSeveral of cast members from the Bring It On film franchise have gone on to greater fame or notoriety. Kirsten Dunst, Eliza Dushku, Gabrielle Union, Jesse Bradford, Clare Kramer, Lindsay Sloane, and several others from the original film were already notable entertainers and television actors or have grown into such roles since their participation in the original film. Ryan Drummond voiced Sonic the Hedgehog from 1999 through 2004. Felicia Day, who appeared in Bring It On Again, became a highly respected actress in Joss Whedon's projects such as Dollhouse and Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog, as well as a screenwriter (The Guild), entrepreneur and web content creator. Bree Turner, who starred in Bring It On Again, would go on to star in NBC's Grimm. Joshua Gomez, also from Bring It On Again, was going to be well known as Chuck regular Morgan Grimes. Bethany Joy Lenz and Hayden Panettiere, who appeared in Bring It On Again and Bring It On: All or Nothing, went on to find sizable television audiences due to their roles on the television programs One Tree Hill and Heroes/Nashville, respectively. Lenz also appeared with Michael Copon (who co-starred in Bring It On: In It to Win It) during One Tree Hill's second season. Copon also starred in Power Rangers Time Force, Ashley Benson from In It to Win It, became known as Hanna Marin in the ABC Family (now Freeform) television series Pretty Little Liars and Cassandra Scerbo from In It to Win It, who later known as Nova Clarke in Syfy's Sharknado film series. The R&B/Pop trio Blaque have a recurring role in Bring It On. Noteworthy R&B singer and film actress Christina Milian, also appears as the main character in Bring It On: Fight to the Finish. Brittany Anne Pirtle from Fight to the Finish, went on to star as the Yellow Power Ranger in Nickelodeon's Power Rangers Samurai and Holland Roden from Fight to the Finish, became known as Lydia Martin in the MTV supernatural-drama Teen Wolf.\\r\\nBring It On has so far spawned a total of five direct-to-video sequels:\\r\\nThe only sequel to feature any of the original crew from Bring It On was 2004's Bring It On Again, which shared the film's same producers. These producers did not return for the subsequent sequels, and none of the films share recurring cast members. Original star Eliza Dushku has even been quoted in interviews as never even having been invited to participate in the sequels. Steve Rash directed two of the sequels and Alyson Fouse has written four. Otherwise, none of the films in the Bring It On franchise share any personnel whatsoever.\\r\\nThe five films that follow Bring It On share only tenuous links with one another. The plot of each film typically follows that of the one originally laid out in the first film - a competitive cheerleading team who has to change routines or other elements they have grown accustomed to in order to win.\\r\\nA stage version of the film premiered at the Alliance Theatre, Atlanta, Georgia on January 16, 2011. The musical has music by Lin-Manuel Miranda and Tom Kitt, lyrics by Amanda Green, and a book by Jeff Whitty.[15][16][17] The director and choreographer is Andy Blankenbuehler, with a cast that includes Amanda LaVergne as Campbell, Adrienne Warren as Danielle, and Nick Blaemire as Randall and \\"award-winning competitive cheerleaders from across the country\\".[15]\\r\\nThe Alliance Theatre production was nominated for eight Suzi Bass Awards, winning awards for Choreography (Andy Blankenbuehler), Sound Design (Brian Ronan) and World Premiere Play or Musical.[18] Additionally, the production was nominated for ten Atlanta Theater Fan Awards from www.AtlantaTheaterFans.com, more than any other production in 2011.[19] The production won for Best Musical and Best Choreography (Andy Blankenbuehler).[20]\\r\\nA national tour of the musical started at the Ahmanson Theatre, Los Angeles, in November 2011 through December 10, 2011 and then travels to San Francisco, Denver, Houston, and Toronto. The national tour stars Taylor Louderman as Campbell and Jason Gotay as Randall.[21][22] The cast took part in a special celebration kicking off the national tour of the musical on October 22, 2011, which featured performances from the show.[23]\\r\\nThe New York Times reviewer wrote of the Ahmanson Theatre production: \\"After an opening number that truly dazzles as it reveals the casts impressive gymnastic prowess, the score hits its stride only when Campbell transfers to Jackson High. Driven by surging R&B grooves and churning lyrics that suggest the fingerprints of Mr. Miranda ... the dance numbers for the Jackson crowd kick the musical into high gear for most of the first act.... Like most entertainments about the trials and triumphs of the teenage years, 'Bring It On' has as much sap as it does pep in its DNA. Its distinguished primarily by the electrifying dance routines and the elaborate cheer-squad performances.\\"[21]\\r\\nThe musical opened on Broadway at the St. James Theatre, in a limited run, starting on July 12, 2012, in previews, officially on August 1 through December 30, 2012.[24][25][26]","input":"What was the first bring it on movie called?"},{"output":"January 26, 2017","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nRiverdale is an American teen drama television series based on the characters of Archie Comics.

Positioned as reliable, easily maintained, mass-market transportation, it was a runaway success. In a matter of days after the release, 15,000 orders were placed.[12] The first production Model T was produced on August 12, 1908[13] and left the factory on September?27, 1908, at the Ford Piquette Avenue Plant in Detroit, Michigan. On May?26, 1927, Henry Ford watched the 15?millionth Model T Ford roll off the assembly line at his factory in Highland Park, Michigan.[14]\\r\\nSeveral cars were conceived by Henry Ford from the founding of the company in 1903 before the Model T was introduced. Although he started with the Model A, there were not 19 production models (A through T); some were only prototypes. The production model immediately before the Model T was the Model S,[15] an upgraded version of the company's largest success to that point, the Model N. The follow-up was the Ford Model A (rather than any Model U). The company publicity said this was because the new car was such a departure from the old that Henry wanted to start all over again with the letter A.\\r\\nThe Model T was Ford's first automobile mass-produced on moving assembly lines with completely interchangeable parts, marketed to the middle class.[16] Henry Ford said of the vehicle:\\r\\nI will build a car for the great multitude. It will be large enough for the family, but small enough for the individual to run and care for. It will be constructed of the best materials, by the best men to be hired, after the simplest designs that modern engineering can devise. But it will be so low in price that no man making a good salary will be unable to own one?ÿ and enjoy with his family the blessing of hours of pleasure in God's great open spaces.[17]\\r\\nAlthough credit for the development of the assembly line belongs to Ransom E. Olds with the first mass-produced automobile, the Oldsmobile Curved Dash, beginning in 1901, the tremendous advancements in the efficiency of the system over the life of the Model T can be credited almost entirely to the vision of Ford and his engineers.[18]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Model T was designed by Childe Harold Wills, and Hungarian immigrants Joseph A. Galamb[19] and Eugene Farkas.[20] Henry Love, C. J. Smith, Gus Degner and Peter E. Martin were also part of the team.[21] Production of the Model T began in the third quarter of 1908.[22] Collectors today sometimes classify Model Ts by build years and refer to these as \\"model years\\", thus labeling the first Model Ts as 1909 models. This is a retroactive classification scheme; the concept of model years as understood today did not exist at the time. The nominal model designation was \\"Model T\\", although design revisions did occur during the car's two decades of production.\\r\\nThe Model T had a front-mounted 177-cubic-inch (2.9?L) inline four-cylinder engine, producing 20?hp (15?kW), for a top speed of 40ÿ45?mph (64ÿ72?km/h).[23] According to Ford Motor Company, the Model T had fuel economy on the order of 13ÿ21?mpg?US (16ÿ25?mpg?imp; 18ÿ11?L/100?km).[24] The engine was capable of running on gasoline, kerosene, or ethanol,[25][26] although the decreasing cost of gasoline and the later introduction of Prohibition made ethanol an impractical fuel for most users. The engines of the first 2,447 units were cooled with water pumps; the engines of unit 2,448 and onward, with a few exceptions prior to around unit 2,500, were cooled by thermosiphon action.[27]\\r\\nThe ignition system used in the Model T was an unusual trembler coil system to drive the spark plugs, as used for stationary gas engines, rather than the expensive magnetos that were used on other cars. This ignition also made the Model T more flexible as to the quality or type of fuel it used. The need for a starting battery and also Ford's use of an unusual AC alternator located inside the flywheel housing encouraged the adoption of electric lighting (standard fitment as of 1915), rather than oil or acetylene lamps, but it also delayed the adoption of electric starting, which was not offered until 1919.[28] The Model T engine was produced for replacement needs, as well as stationary and marine applications until 1941, well after production of the Model T had ended. It was also utilized in the drivetrain of the Fordson tractor, which was produced in the US until 1928, and in Ireland until 1964.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe Model T was a rear-wheel drive vehicle. Its transmission was a planetary gear type billed as \\"three speed\\". In today's terms it would be considered a two-speed, because one of the three speeds was reverse.\\r\\nThe Model T's transmission was controlled with three foot pedals and a lever mounted to the road side of the driver's seat. The throttle was controlled with a lever on the steering wheel. The left pedal was used to engage the transmission. With the floor lever in either the mid position or fully forward and the pedal pressed and held forward, the car entered low gear. When held in an intermediate position, the car was in neutral. If the left pedal was released, the Model T entered high gear, but only when the lever was fully forward ÿ in any other position, the pedal would only move up as far as the central neutral position. This allowed the car to be held in neutral while the driver cranked the engine by hand. The car could thus cruise without the driver having to press any of the pedals.\\r\\nThe first 800 units were sent in reverse with a lever; all units after that were sent in reverse with a pedal between the clutch and brake pedals.[27] The middle pedal was used to engage reverse gear when the car was in neutral. The right pedal operated the transmission brake ÿ there were no brakes on the wheels. The floor lever also controlled the parking brake, which was activated by pulling the lever all the way back. This doubled as an emergency brake.\\r\\nAlthough it was uncommon, the drive bands could fall out of adjustment, allowing the car to creep, particularly when cold, adding another hazard to attempting to start the car: a person cranking the engine could be forced backward while still holding the crank as the car crept forward, although it was nominally in neutral. As the car utilized a wet clutch, this condition could also occur in cold weather, when the thickened oil prevents the clutch discs from slipping freely. Power reached the differential through a single universal joint attached to a torque tube which drove the rear axle; some models (typically trucks, but available for cars, as well) could be equipped with an optional two-speed Ruckstell rear axle shifted by a floor-mounted lever which provided an underdrive gear for easier hill climbing. All gears were vanadium steel running in an oil bath.\\r\\nTwo main types of band lining material were used:[29]\\r\\nModel T suspension employed a transversely mounted semi-elliptical spring for each of the front and rear beam axles which allowed a great deal of wheel movement to cope with the dirt roads of the time.\\r\\nThe front axle was drop forged as a single piece of vanadium steel. Ford twisted many axles through eight full rotations (2880 degrees) and sent them to dealers to be put on display to demonstrate its superiority. The Model T did not have a modern service brake. The right foot pedal applied a band around a drum in the transmission, thus stopping the rear wheels from turning. The previously mentioned parking brake lever operated band brakes acting on the inside of the rear brake drums, which were an integral part of the rear wheel hubs. Optional brakes that acted on the outside of the brake drums were available from aftermarket suppliers.\\r\\nWheels were wooden artillery wheels, with steel welded-spoke wheels available in 1926 and 1927.\\r\\nTires were pneumatic clincher type, 30?in (76?cm) in diameter, 3.5?in (8.9?cm) wide in the rear, 3?in (7.6?cm) in the front. Clinchers needed much higher pressure than today's tires, typically 60?psi (410?kPa), to prevent them from leaving the rim at speed. Horseshoe nails on the roads, together with the high pressure, made flat tires a common problem.\\r\\nBalloon tires became available in 1925. They were 21?in G?4.5?in (53?cm G?11?cm) all around. Balloon tires were closer in design to today's tires, with steel wires reinforcing the tire bead, making lower pressure possible ÿ typically 35?psi (240?kPa) ÿ giving a softer ride. The old nomenclature for tire size changed from measuring the outer diameter to measuring the rim diameter so 21?in (530?mm) (rim diameter) G 4.5?in (110?mm) (tire width) wheels has about the same outer diameter as 30 in (76?cm) clincher tires. All tires in this time period used an inner tube to hold the pressurized air; tubeless tires were not generally in use until much later.\\r\\nWheelbase was 100?inches (254?cm) and standard tread width was 56 in (142?cm); 60 in (152?cm) tread could be obtained on special order, \\"for Southern roads\\", identical to the pre-Civil War track gauge for many railroads in the former Confederacy.\\r\\nBy 1918, half of all the cars in the US were Model Ts. However, it was a monolithic bloc; Ford wrote in his autobiography that in 1909 he told his management team that in the future Any customer can have a car painted any color that he wants so long as it is black.[31]\\r\\nHowever, in the first years of production from 1908 to 1913, the Model T was not available in black[32] but rather only gray, green, blue, and red. Green was available for the touring cars, town cars, coupes, and Landaulets. Gray was only available for the town cars, and red only for the touring cars. By 1912, all cars were being painted midnight blue with black fenders. Only in 1914 was the \\"any color so long as it is black\\" policy finally implemented. It is often stated that Ford suggested the use of black from 1914 to 1926 due to the cheap cost and durability of black paint. During the lifetime production of the Model T, over 30 types of black paint were used on various parts of the car.[32] These were formulated to satisfy the different means of applying the paint to the various parts, and had distinct drying times, depending on the part, paint, and method of drying.\\r\\nAlthough Ford classified the Model T with a single letter designation throughout its entire life and made no distinction by model years, enough significant changes to the body were made over the production life that the car may be classified into several style categories. Among the most immediately visible and identifiable changes were in the hood and cowl areas, although many other modifications were made to the vehicle.\\r\\nThe styling on the last \\"generation\\" was a preview for the following Model A, but the two models are visually quite different, as the body on the A was much wider and had curved doors as opposed to the flat doors on the T.\\r\\nWhen the Model T was designed and introduced, the infrastructure of the world was quite different from today's. Pavement was a rarity except for sidewalks and a few big-city streets. (The sense of the term \\"pavement\\" as equivalent with \\"sidewalk\\" comes from that era, when streets and roads were generally dirt and sidewalks were a paved way to walk along them.) Agriculture was the occupation of many people. Power tools were scarce outside factories, as were power sources for them; electrification, like pavement, was found usually only in larger towns. Rural electrification and motorized mechanization were embryonic in some regions and nonexistent in most. Henry Ford oversaw the requirements and design of the Model T based on contemporary realities. Consequently, the Model T was (intentionally) almost as much a tractor and portable engine as it was an automobile. It has always been well regarded for its all-terrain abilities and ruggedness. It could travel a rocky, muddy farm lane, cross a shallow stream, climb a steep hill, and be parked on the other side to have one of its wheels removed and a pulley fastened to the hub for a flat belt to drive a bucksaw, thresher, silo blower, conveyor for filling corn cribs or haylofts, baler, water pump, electrical generator, and many other applications. One unique application of the Model T was shown in the October 1922 issue of Fordson Farmer magazine. It showed a minister who had transformed his Model T into a mobile church, complete with small organ.[33]\\r\\nDuring this era, entire automobiles (including thousands of Model Ts) were even hacked apart by their owners and reconfigured into custom machinery permanently dedicated to a purpose, such as homemade tractors and ice saws.[34] Dozens of aftermarket companies sold prefab kits to facilitate the T's conversion from car to tractor.[35] The Model T had been around for a decade before the Fordson tractor became available (1917ÿ18), and many Ts had been converted for field use. (For example, Harry Ferguson, later famous for his hitches and tractors, worked on Eros Model T tractor conversions before he worked with Fordsons and others.) During the next decade, Model T tractor conversion kits were harder to sell, as the Fordson and then the Farmall (1924), as well as other light and affordable tractors, served the farm market. But during the Depression (1930s), Model T tractor conversion kits had a resurgence, because by then used Model Ts and junkyard parts for them were plentiful and cheap.[36]\\r\\nLike many popular car engines of the era, the Model T engine was also used on home-built aircraft (such as the Pietenpol Sky Scout) and motorboats.\\r\\nAn armored-car variant (called the FT-B) was developed in Poland in 1920 due to the high demand during the Polish-Soviet war in 1920.\\r\\nMany Model Ts were converted into vehicles which could travel across heavy snows with kits on the rear wheels (sometimes with an extra pair of rear-mounted wheels and two sets of continuous track to mount on the now-tandemed rear wheels, essentially making it a half-track) and skis replacing the front wheels. They were popular for rural mail delivery for a time. The common name for these conversions of cars and small trucks was \\"snowflyers\\". These vehicles were extremely popular in the northern reaches of Canada, where factories were set up to produce them.[37]\\r\\nA number of companies built Model Tÿbased railcars.[38] In The Great Railway Bazaar, Paul Theroux mentions a rail journey in India on such a railcar. The New Zealand Railways Department's RM class included a few.\\r\\nThe knowledge and skills needed by a factory worker were reduced to 84 areas. When introduced, the T used the building methods typical at the time, assembly by hand, and production was small. The Ford Piquette Avenue Plant could not keep up with demand for the Model T, and only 11 cars were built there during the first full month of production. More and more machines were used to reduce the complexity within the 84 defined areas. In 1910, after assembling nearly 12,000 Model Ts, Henry Ford moved the company to the new Highland Park complex.\\r\\nAs a result, Ford's cars came off the line in three-minute intervals, much faster than previous methods, reducing production time from 12.5 hours before to 93 minutes by 1914, while using less manpower.[39] In 1914, Ford produced more cars than all other automakers combined. The Model T was a great commercial success, and by the time Henry made his 10 millionth car, half of all cars in the world were Fords. It was so successful Ford did not purchase any advertising between 1917 and 1923; instead, the Model T became so famous, people considered it a norm. More than 15?million Model Ts were manufactured in all, reaching a rate of 9,000 to 10,000 cars a day in 1925, or 2?million annually,[40][41][42] more than any other model of its day, at a price of just $260. Total Model T production was finally surpassed by the Volkswagen Beetle on February 17, 1972.\\r\\nHenry Ford's ideological approach to Model T design was one of getting it right and then keeping it the same; he believed the Model T was all the car a person would, or could, ever need. As other companies offered comfort and styling advantages, at competitive prices, the Model T lost market share. Design changes were not as few as the public perceived, but the idea of an unchanging model was kept intact. Eventually, on May 26, 1927, Ford Motor Company ceased US production[43][44][45] and began the changeovers required to produce the Model A.[46] Some of the other Model T factories in the world continued a short while.[47]\\r\\nModel T engines continued to be produced until August 4, 1941. Almost 170,000 were built after car production stopped, as replacement engines were required to service already produced vehicles. Racers and enthusiasts, forerunners of modern hot rodders, used the Model T's block to build popular and cheap racing engines, including Cragar, Navarro, and famously the Frontenacs (\\"Fronty Fords\\")[44] of the Chevrolet brothers, among many others.\\r\\nThe Model T employed some advanced technology, for example, its use of vanadium steel alloy. Its durability was phenomenal, and some Model Ts and their parts are in running order over a century later. Although Henry Ford resisted some kinds of change, he always championed the advancement of materials engineering, and often mechanical engineering and industrial engineering.\\r\\nIn 2002, Ford built a final batch of six Model Ts as part of their 2003 centenary celebrations. These cars were assembled from remaining new components and other parts produced from the original drawings. The last of the six was used for publicity purposes in the UK.\\r\\nAlthough Ford no longer manufactures parts for the Model T, many parts are still manufactured through private companies as replicas to service the thousands of Model Ts still in operation today.\\r\\nOn May 26, 1927, Henry Ford and his son Edsel, drove the 15-millionth Model T out of the factory. This marked the famous automobile's official last day of production at the main factory.\\r\\nThe moving assembly line system, which started on October 7, 1913, allowed Ford to sell his cars at a price lower than his competitors.[48] As he continued to fine-tune the system, Ford was able to keep reducing costs significantly.[49] As volume increased, he was able to also lower the prices due to fixed costs being spread over a larger number of vehicles. Other factors affected the price such as material costs and design changes.\\r\\nThe figures below are US production numbers compiled by R.E. Houston, Ford Production Department, August 3, 1927. The figures between 1909 and 1920 are for Ford's fiscal year. From 1909 to 1913, the fiscal year was from October 1 to September 30 the following calendar year with the year number being the year in which it ended. For the 1914 fiscal year, the year was October 1, 1913, through July 31, 1914. Starting in August 1914, and through the end of the Model T era, the fiscal year was August 1 through July 31. Beginning with January 1920, the figures are for the calendar year.\\r\\nHenry Ford used wood scraps from the production of Model Ts to make charcoal briquettes. Originally named Ford Charcoal, the name was changed to Kingsford Charcoal after the Iron Mountain Ford Plant closed in 1951 and the Kingsford Chemical Company was formed and continued the wood distillation process. E. G. Kingsford, Ford's cousin by marriage, brokered the selection of the new sawmill and wood distillation plant site.[53] Lumber for production of the Model T came from the same location, built in 1920 called the Iron Mountain Ford which incorporated a sawmill where lumber from Ford purchased land in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan was cut and dried. Scrap wood was distilled at the Iron Mountain plant for its wood chemicals, with the end by product being lump charcoal. This lump charcoal was modified and pressed into briquettes and mass marketed by Ford [54]\\r\\nThe Ford Model T was the first automobile built by various countries simultaneously since they were being produced in Walkerville, Canada, and in Trafford Park, Greater Manchester, England, starting in 1911 and were later assembled in Germany, Argentina,[55] France, Spain, Denmark, Norway, Belgium, Brazil, Mexico, and Japan, as well as several locations throughout the US.[56] Ford made use of the knock-down kit concept almost from the beginning of the company as freight and production costs from Detroit had Ford assembling vehicles in major metropolitan centers of the US.\\r\\nThe Aeroford was an English automobile manufactured in Bayswater, London, from 1920 to 1925. It was a Model T with distinct hood and grille to make it appear to be a totally different design, what later would have been called badge engineering. The Aeroford sold from S288 in 1920, dropping to S168ÿ214 by 1925. It was available as a two-seater, four-seater, or coup.[57][page?needed]\\r\\nFord created a massive publicity machine in Detroit to ensure every newspaper carried stories and advertisements about the new product. Ford's network of local dealers made the car ubiquitous in virtually every city in North America. A large part of the success of Ford's Model T stems from the innovative strategy which introduced a large network of sales hubs making it easy to purchase the car.[10] As independent dealers, the franchises grew rich and publicized not just the Ford but the very concept of automobiling; local motor clubs sprang up to help new drivers and to explore the countryside. Ford was always eager to sell to farmers, who looked on the vehicle as a commercial device to help their business. Sales skyrocketed?ÿ several years posted around 100 percent gains on the previous year.\\r\\nCars built before 1919 are classed as veteran cars and later models as vintage cars. Today, four main clubs exist to support the preservation and restoration of these cars: the Model T Ford Club International,[58] the Model T Ford Club of America[59] and the combined clubs of Australia. With many chapters of clubs around the world, the Model T Ford Club of Victoria[60] has a membership with a considerable number of uniquely Australian cars. (Australia produced its own car bodies, and therefore many differences occurred between the Australian bodied tourers[61] and the US/Canadian cars.) In the UK, the Model T Ford Register of Great Britain celebrated its 50th anniversary in 2010. Many steel Model T parts are still manufactured today, and even fiberglass replicas of their distinctive bodies are produced, which are popular for T-bucket style hot rods (as immortalized in the Jan and Dean surf music song \\"Bucket T\\", which was later recorded by The Who).[citation needed] In 1949, more than twenty years after the end of production, 200,000 Model Ts were registered in the United States.[62] In 2008, it was estimated that about 50,000 to 60,000 Ford Model Ts remain roadworthy.[63]\\r\\nModel T chronology\\r\\n1909 Touring - Second-oldest Ford Model T still in existence\\r\\n1910 Runabout\\r\\n1911 Touring\\r\\n1913 Runabout\\r\\n1914 Touring\\r\\n1915 Runabout - Note curved cowl panel\\r\\n1916 Touring\\r\\n1917 Runabout - Note new curved hood matches cowl panel\\r\\n1919 Runabout\\r\\n1920 Touring\\r\\n1921 Touring\\r\\n1922 Runabout\\r\\n1922 flatbed truck\\r\\n1923 Ford Model T Depot Hack\\r\\n1923 Runabout (early '23 model)\\r\\n1924 Touring - Note higher hood and slightly shorter cowl panel - late '23 models were similar\\r\\n1925 Touring\\r\\n1926 Ford T Roadster in Coimbatore, India\\r\\n1926 Runabout - Note higher hood and longer cowl panel\\r\\n1927 Runabout\\r\\n1927 Touring - Last Ford Model T built at Highland Park Ford Plant\\r\\n1928 Ford Model A Tudor Sedan - Shown for comparison, note wider body and curved doors","input":"When was the ford model t first made?"},{"output":"Eliza Gladys \\"Millvina\\" Dean","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nEliza Gladys \\"Millvina\\" Dean (2 February 1912 ÿ 31 May 2009) was a British civil servant, cartographer, and the last remaining survivor of the sinking of the RMS Titanic on 15 April 1912.[1] At 2 months old, she was also the youngest passenger aboard.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nDean was born in Branscombe, England, on 2 February 1912 to Bertram Frank Dean (1886ÿ1912) and Georgette Eva Light (1879ÿ1975). She had an older brother, Bertram Vere Dean, born 21 May 1910. She never married and had no children.[3] Her father died on the Titanic; her mother died on 16 September 1975, aged 96; and her brother died on 14 April 1992, age 81, the 80th anniversary of the iceberg collision.\\r\\n\\r\\nDean's parents decided to leave the United Kingdom and emigrate to Wichita, Kansas, where her father had relatives, and his cousin owned a tobacco shop that he was going to co-own.[4] They were not supposed to be aboard the Titanic, but due to a coal strike, they were transferred onto it and boarded it as third-class passengers at Southampton, England. Dean was barely two months old when she boarded the ship. Her father felt its collision with the iceberg on the night of 14 April 1912, and after investigating, returned to his cabin, telling his wife to dress the children and go up on deck. Dean, her mother, and her brother were placed in Lifeboat 10 and were among the first third-class passengers to escape.[i] Her father, however, did not survive, and his body, if recovered, was never identified.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt first, Dean's mother wanted to continue on to Kansas to fulfil her husband's wish of a new life in the United States. However, after losing him and being left with two small children for whom to care, they returned to Britain aboard the RMS?Adriatic. While aboard the ship, Dean attracted considerable attention. An article in the Daily Mirror dated 12 May 1912 described the ordeal:\\r\\n\\r\\nMillvina and Bertram were raised mostly on pension funds and educated in Southampton schools, including The Gregg School. It was not until she was eight years old, and her mother was planning to remarry, that Dean was told she had been a passenger on the Titanic.\\r\\n\\r\\nDean worked for the British government during the Second World War and later as a purchaser for a local engineering firm. Other careers she held were as a cartographer, a secretary, and an assistant to a tobacconist.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was not until Dean was in her seventies that she became involved in Titanic-related events. Over the years, she participated in numerous conventions, exhibitions, documentaries, radio and television interviews, and personal correspondence. In 1998, she travelled to the United States to participate in a Titanic convention in Springfield, Massachusetts, and another in 1999 in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. She had also been scheduled to appear at a commemoration of the 94th anniversary of the sinking in 2006, but a broken hip prevented her appearance.[6] She also appeared in the History special Titanic's Final Moments: Missing Pieces.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn October 2007, Dean became the last Titanic survivor following the death of Barbara West Dainton, who died at age 96 in England.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn December 2007, Dean criticised the BBC and its television programme Doctor Who for including an episode with a starship \\"cruise liner\\" called the Titanic, that was similar in appearance to the historical liner. Speaking from her nursing home, she said: \\"The Titanic was a tragedy which tore so many families apart. I lost my father and he lies on that wreck. I think it is disrespectful to make entertainment of such a tragedy.\\"[8] A spokeswoman for the show said: \\"No offence was intended. 'Voyage of the Damned' is set on a spaceship called The Titanic and not a boat.\\"[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn April 2008, Dean had accepted an invitation to speak in Southampton at an event commemorating the 96th anniversary of the sinking, but ill health resulting from a respiratory infection forced her to cancel.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn December 2008, at age 96, Dean was forced to sell several of her family's possessions to pay for her private medical care following a broken hip. These included a letter sent to her mother from the Titanic Relief Fund, and a suitcase given to her and her mother in New York following the sinking. Their sale raised approximately S32,000. In February 2009, she announced that she would be selling several more items to pay for her increasing medical costs which she said exceeded S3,000 a month.[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nDean died of pneumonia on the morning of 31 May 2009, 97 years and seven weeks after the Titanic sailed, at a care home in Ashurst, Hampshire.[2][11] She was cremated, and on 24 October 2009, her ashes were scattered from a launch at the docks in Southampton where the Titanic set sail.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn response to the escalating cost of Dean's healthcare, The Millvina Fund was set up in April 2009 by the Belfast, British, and International Titanic Societies with the exclusive aim of taking care of her nursing home bills. It was given a boost by the Irish author and campaigning journalist, Don Mullan, at the opening of his worldwide Nokia photographic exhibition, A Thousand Reasons for Living, (featuring a portrait of Dean) in Dublin on 22 April 2009.[13] Mullan introduced an additional portrait of Dean's hands, as she signed a card for a Titanic autograph collector, which he produced as a limited edition of 100 copies. He made the edition available at ?500 each and then challenged the director and stars of the film Titanic (1997) - James Cameron, Leonardo DiCaprio, and Kate Winslet - singer Celine Dion, and the corporations Sony Music, 20th Century Fox, and Paramount Pictures to match him euro-for-euro to support her with her bills.[14][15] DiCaprio and Winslet led the way with a joint contribution of US$20,000. Cameron and Dion donated US$10,000 each.","input":"Who was the last living person on the titanic?"},{"output":"Moolah","context":"The WWE Women's Championship was a women's professional wrestling championship in the World Wrestling Federation/Entertainment (WWF/E) promotion. The lineage of the Women's Championship dates back to September 18, 1956, when The Fabulous Moolah became the NWA World Women's Champion. The WWE did not exist at that time, and although they did not create their own women's championship until 1984 with The Fabulous Moolah as the first WWF Women's Champion, they claim 1956 for the championship's establishment and do not recognize any title changes from when Moolah became champion in 1956 until she lost it in 1984. This made the Women's Championship the oldest active professional wrestling championship in World Wrestling Entertainment history until its retirement in 2010 after unification with the WWE Divas Championship.[2] The final champion was Layla.\\r\\nA new WWE Women's Championship (now Raw Women's Championship) was created in 2016, and although both championships had shared the name and the original is considered to be the predecessor, the new championship does not carry the lineage of the original.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOn September 18, 1956, The Fabulous Moolah became the third NWA World Women's Champion .[4] At that time, the WWE did not exist and did not become a company until 1963 when it was established as the World Wide Wrestling Federation (WWWF). Moolah, who bought the rights to the championship in the 1970s, defended the championship as the NWA World Women's Champion up until 1984; by this time, the WWWF had been renamed to World Wrestling Federation (WWF). In 1983, the WWF disaffiliated with the NWA and Moolah sold the championship's rights to the WWF in 1984, and she was recognized as the WWF Women's Champion.[5] Instead of beginning her reign in 1984, the WWF claimed the lineage of her reign from when she first became champion in 1956. The preceding champions and the title changes between 1956 and when Moolah lost it in 1984 are not recognized by WWE (although they are recognized by the NWA[6]). As a result, The Fabulous Moolah's first reign is considered to have lasted 28 years by the promotion.[7]\\r\\nIn 1990, the Women's Championship became inactive after Rockin' Robin vacated the championship following her departure from the WWF.[8][9] Then in December 1993, the title was reactivated with Alundra Blayze winning a tournament for the vacant Women's Championship.[10] However, the Women's Championship became inactive again when Blayze was released from the WWF. Blayze, as Madusa, unexpectedly signed with World Championship Wrestling in 1995 and threw the championship belt, which was still in her possession, in a trash can on an episode of WCW Monday Nitro.[11] The Women's Championship was reactivated again in September 1998 when Jacqueline Moore defeated Sable to win the title.[11]\\r\\nAfter the WWF/WWE name change in 2002, the championship was subsequently referred to as the WWE Women's Championship. With the WWE Brand Extension in March 2002, the Women's Championship at first was still defended on both the Raw and SmackDown brands, while most titles were exclusive to one brand. In September, the Women's Championship became exclusive to only the Raw brand. The Women's Championship remained the sole championship contested by women, until July 4, 2008 when a counterpart to the championship, called the WWE Divas Championship, was created for the SmackDown brand. On April 13, 2009, the Women's Championship became exclusive to the SmackDown brand when reigning champion Melina was drafted from Raw to SmackDown during the 2009 WWE Draft to replace the current WWE Divas Champion Maryse, who had been drafted to Raw.\\r\\nThe Women's Championship was unified with the Divas Championship at Night of Champions in September 2010, creating the Unified WWE Divas Championship and making the Women's Championship defunct as the unified title followed the lineage of the Divas Championship; the title eventually dropped the \\"Unified\\" moniker.[2][12]\\r\\nOn April 3, 2016 at WrestleMania 32, a new WWE Women's Championship (now called the Raw Women's Championship) was introduced to succeed the Divas Championship. This new title does not carry the lineage of either the Divas Championship or the original Women's Championship, but is acknowledged by WWE as the successor of both.\\r\\nFollowing the WWE brand extension on March 25, all titles in WWE became exclusive to either the Raw brand or SmackDown brand. The following is a list of dates indicating the transitions of the Women's Championship between the Raw and SmackDown brands.\\r\\nAs per WWE's official title history, the inaugural champion was The Fabulous Moolah, who defeated Judy Grable on September 18, 1956.[13] Moolah had the longest reign by holding it for 10 years, although the WWE considers it to be longer at 28 years, as title changes between 1956 and 1984 are not recognized by the promotion. The Fabulous Moolah technically has the most reigns with 8, but because the WWE does not recognize the title changes between 1956 and 1984, Moolah only has 4 and Trish Stratus has the most reigns with 7. Mickie James has the shortest reign with 1 hour. While in Paris on April 24, 2007, James defeated then-champion Melina and Victoria in a Triple Threat Match. However, Jonathan Coachman, the Acting General Manager for Raw, said that since Mickie pinned Victoria, Melina deserved an immediate rematch, which she won.[14]\\r\\nThe only male Women's Champion was Harvey Wippleman. On January 30, 2000, Wippleman won the WWF Women's Championship from The Kat while he was in a disguise and used the name \\"Hervina\\" in a \\"Lumberjill Snow bunny\\" match; the match took place in a snow filled pool surrounded by female wrestlers whose purpose was to keep the competitors from leaving the pool.[15]\\r\\nThe women's division was deemed inactive in 1990 during Robin's reign.[16] Alundra Blayze won the Women's Championship after it was reactivated in 1993.[17] Chyna departed from the company during her reign. Trish Stratus won her seventh title reign in her final match at Unforgiven in 2006 against Lita before retiring the same night, thus vacating the championship the next day.[18] Michelle McCool unified the Women's and Divas Championships in Layla's place, thus leaving Layla the final and undefeated champion.[19][20]","input":"Who is the longest reigning wwe women's champion?"},{"output":"August 1968","context":"The construction of the first World Trade Center complex in New York City was conceived as an urban renewal project to help revitalize Lower Manhattan spearheaded by David Rockefeller. The project was developed by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. The idea for the World Trade Center arose after World War II as a way to supplement existing avenues of international commerce in the United States.\\r\\nThe World Trade Center was originally planned to be built on the east side of Lower Manhattan, but the New Jersey and New York state governments, which oversee the Port Authority, could not agree on this location. After extensive negotiations, the New Jersey and New York state governments agreed to support the World Trade Center project, which was built at the site of Radio Row in the Lower West Side of Manhattan, New York City. To make the agreement acceptable to New Jersey, the Port Authority agreed to take over the bankrupt Hudson & Manhattan Railroad, which brought commuters from New Jersey to the Lower Manhattan site and, upon the Port Authority's takeover of the railroad, was renamed PATH.\\r\\nThe Port Authority hired architect Minoru Yamasaki, who came up with the specific idea for twin towers. The towers were designed as framed tube structures, which provided tenants with open floor plans, uninterrupted by columns or walls. This was accomplished using numerous closely spaced perimeter columns to provide much of the strength to the structure, along with gravity load shared with the core columns. The elevator system, which made use of sky lobbies and a system of express and local elevators, allowed substantial floor space to be freed up for use as office space by making the structural core smaller. The design and construction of the World Trade Center, most centrally its twin towers, involved many other innovative techniques, such as the slurry wall for digging the foundation, and wind tunnel experiments.\\r\\nConstruction of the World Trade Center's North Tower began in August 1968, and the South Tower in 1969. Extensive use of prefabricated components helped to speed up the construction process. The first tenants moved into the North Tower in December 1970 and into the South Tower in January 1972. Four other low-level buildings were constructed as part of the World Trade Center in the early 1970s, and the complex was mostly complete by 1973. A seventh building, 7 World Trade Center, was opened in 1987.\\r\\nIn 1942, Austin J. Tobin became the Executive Director of the Port Authority, beginning a 30-year career during which he oversaw the planning and development of the World Trade Center.[1] The concept of establishing a \\"world trade center\\" was conceived during the postÿWorld War II period, when the United States thrived economically and international trade was increasing.[2] At the time, economic growth was concentrated in Midtown Manhattan, in part stimulated by Rockefeller Center, which had been developed in the 1930s.[3]\\r\\nIn 1946, a year after the war formally ended, the New York State Legislature passed a bill that called for a \\"world trade center\\" to be established. This trade center would increase New York City's role in transatlantic trade.[4][5] The World Trade Corporation was founded, and a board was appointed by New York Governor Thomas E. Dewey to develop plans for the project.[4][6] Less than four months after the board was named, plans for a \\"world trade center\\" were put on hold.[6] By then, architect John Eberson and his son Drew had devised a plan that included 21 buildings over a ten-block area, at an estimated cost of $150 million.[7][5] However, projections determined that such a complex would not be profitable due to a lack of demand; one estimated that the World Trade Center project would only be successful if at least 4,800 of the United States' largest 6,000 companies were involved.[5] In 1949, the World Trade Corporation was dissolved by the New York State Legislature.[8]\\r\\nMeanwhile, the Financial District of Lower Manhattan was left out of the economic boom of financial industries there.[3] Lower Manhattan also saw less economic growth than Midtown because many workers moved to the suburbs, and they found it easier to commute to midtown than to downtown. The writer Paul Goldberger states that the Financial District, in particular, was devoid of \\"almost any kind of urban amenity\\", including entertainment, cultural hubs, or housing.[9] Commercial industries along the ports of Lower Manhattan were also being replaced with industries elsewhere.[9] David Rockefeller, who led urban renewal efforts in Lower Manhattan, constructed the One Chase Manhattan Plaza in a bid to bring jobs back.[10][5] Rockefeller believed that the area would lose its status as the nation's financial hub if it were not redeveloped.[9] However, the 800-foot (240?m) skyscraper, which opened in 1960, attracted far fewer tenants than expected.[9][5]\\r\\nIn 1958, Rockefeller established the Downtown-Lower Manhattan Association (DLMA), which commissioned Skidmore, Owings and Merrill to draw up plans for revitalizing Lower Manhattan. The plans, made public in late June 1960, called for a World Trade Center to be built on a 13-acre (53,000?m2) site along the East River, at the South Street Seaport, one of the Lower Manhattan ports that had seen a continuous decline in business over the past decade.[11][12] The site would be bounded clockwise from the south by Old Slip, Water Street, Fulton Street, and South Street,[13][14] and the complex itself would be located on \\"a two-story platform that would supersede and displace the conventional street grid\\".[12] The proposed complex included a 900-foot-long (270?m) exhibition hall, as well as a 50- to 70-story building with a hotel located on some of its upper floors.[15] Other amenities would include a theater, shops, and restaurants.[16] The plan also called for a new securities exchange building, which the Downtown-Lower Manhattan Association hoped would house the New York Stock Exchange.[14]\\r\\nDavid Rockefeller suggested that the Port Authority would be a logical choice for taking on the project[14] because it had experience with similar large engineering projects, and also because the Port Authority, rather than Rockefeller, would be paying for the complex's construction.[11] Rockefeller argued that the Trade Center would provide great benefits in facilitating and increasing volume of international commerce coming through the Port of New York and New Jersey.[16] David's brother, New York Governor Nelson Rockefeller, formally asked the Port Authority to investigate the feasibility of this proposal.[11] Given the importance of New York City in global commerce, Port Authority director Austin J. Tobin remarked that the proposed project should be the World Trade Center, and not just a generic \\"world trade center\\".[17] Tobin commissioned an aide, Richard Sullivan, to lead a study on the feasibility of building a World Trade Center.[18]\\r\\nSullivan published his study, \\"A World Trade Center in the Port of New York\\", on March 10, 1961. The report recommended building a trade center along the waterfront to facilitate commerce within the Port of New York.[19] The study also stated that Rockefeller's suggested site near the South Street Seaport was the most ideal location for the trade center, but did not take locals' possible objections into account.[20] The Port Authority formally backed the project the next day.[21]\\r\\nThe States of New York and New Jersey also needed to approve the project, given their control and oversight role of the Port Authority. Objections to the plan came from New Jersey Governor Robert B. Meyner, who resented that New York would be getting the $355 million project.[22][23] Meyner would only agree if his own state were able to benefit.[11] He was particularly concerned about ridership on New Jersey's Hudson and Manhattan Railroad (H&M).[24] The H&M's ridership had declined substantially from a high of 113?million riders in 1927 to 26?million in 1958, after new automobile tunnels and bridges opened across the Hudson River.[25][26] The H&M's Hudson Terminal, a large and mostly decrepit office-building complex along Manhattan's Lower West Side, was located in a neighborhood referred to as the Radio Row, which was also seeing a general decline due to a loss of transportation options.[27] The ferries across the Hudson River, which had seen 51?million annual riders in 1920, had stopped running, while the area's elevated lines were being dismantled in favor of high-speed subways.[26] For many years, New Jersey residents and elected officials had proposed that the Port Authority purchase the H&M Railroad, but each time, the Port Authority had refused.[22] Meyner suggested that he would support the plans for the World Trade Center project if the Port Authority took over the H&M.[24][3] The Port Authority then started conducting another study on Meyner's suggestion of a H&M takeover.[28]\\r\\nIn February 1961, Governor Rockefeller introduced a bill that would combine the H&M's $70 million acquisition with the $335 million trade center at South Street. Even though Nelson Rockefeller had been warned of the hastiness of the deal, owing to the fact that it highlighted the price disparity between the two agreements, the New York state legislature approved the bill anyway.[28][29] Subsequently, negotiations with Governor Meyner regarding the World Trade Center project reached a stalemate.[28] Months later, Sullivan was contacted by a colleague, Sidney Schachter, who had surveyed Hudson Terminal. After taking a walk around the Radio Row neighborhood, Schachter concluded that the site could be used for the World Trade Center. This would carry multiple benefits: the obsolete Hudson Terminal could be replaced with more modern office buildings; the H&M would get a new railway terminal; and the World Trade Center could be built without objections from New Jersey.[27] Through the end of the year, the Port Authority continued to investigate the feasibility of taking over the H&M.[29]\\r\\nIn December 1961, Tobin had several meetings with newly elected New Jersey Governor Richard J. Hughes.[30][29] They ultimately agreed to a proposal to shift the World Trade Center project to the site of the H&M's Hudson Terminal. The new location not only was closer to New Jersey, but also was able to utilize the unused air rights above the Hudson Terminal: although other developers were theoretically allowed to build atop the terminal, none had done so.[24][29] In acquiring the Hudson & Manhattan Railroad, the Port Authority would also acquire the Hudson Terminal and other buildings, which were deemed obsolete.[30] On January 22, 1962, the two states reached an agreement to allow the Port Authority to take over the railroad and to build the World Trade Center on Manhattan's lower west side.[31] As part of the deal, the Port Authority renamed the H&M \\"Port Authority Trans-Hudson\\", or PATH for short.[32] The New Jersey state legislature approved this deal in February 1962.[33] After the World Trade Center legislation was approved by the New Jersey legislature, Chairman Tobin formed the World Trade Office to develop and operate the trade center, appointing Guy F. Tozzoli to lead the new office.[33][34]\\r\\nThe new site constituted a mostly trapezoidal plot of land, with an extension on the north that resembled a \\"cork\\".[35] The bulk of the land was a twelve-block area bounded by Vesey, Church, Liberty, and West Streets on the north, east, south, and west, respectively.[35][36] All of these blocks would be combined to form the superblock upon which the World Trade Center was built.[36] The \\"cork\\" was a smaller trapezoid bounded clockwise from the north by Barclay Street, West Broadway, Vesey Street, and Washington Street. This would become the site of 7 World Trade Center, although that building was not added until much later. The two blocks to the west and east of the \\"cork\\" were occupied by the New York Telephone Company Building and the Federal Building, respectively.[35]\\r\\nThe site for the World Trade Center was the location of Radio Row, which was home to 323 commercial or industrial tenants, over one thousand offices, many small businesses, and approximately 100 residents.[37][38] Estimates indicated that either 17,200 or 30,000 employees worked within the area that was to be occupied by the World Trade Center, and that the businesses employing them made a combined $300 million in profits every year.[38] The World Trade Center plans involved evicting these business owners, some of whom strongly dissented to the forced relocation.[39][37] The group protesting against the evictions was led by Oscar Nadel, one of the business owners who was facing eviction.[40][41][37] Newspapers published stories about small-business owners who would be affected by the evictions, while residents and tenants went around the neighborhood, carrying the effigy of a \\"Mr. Small Businessman\\" in a mock funeral.[37]\\r\\nThe Port Authority opened an office to assist tenants with relocation; although this offer was accepted by some tenants, it was protested by others.[42] The agency refused to meet with large groups of merchants, instead saying that concerned tenants meet with Port Authority officials one-by-one. Nadel believed that this would allow the Port Authority to convince individual tenants to move out, thus causing an exodus of merchants from the area.[43] As the merchants' de facto spokesperson, he requested a meeting with Tobin directly. However, when the meeting did occur in mid-June 1962, Nadel immediately rejected Tobin's proposal to give him a storefront space in the World Trade Center.[44] Two weeks later, a group representing approximately 325 shops and 1,000 other affected small businesses filed an injunction, challenging the Port Authority's power of eminent domain, or the takeover of private property for public use.[45][44]\\r\\nThe dispute with local business owners went through the court system to the New York State Court of Appeals. Although several lower courts refused to hear the merchants' cases, they also ruled that the World Trade Center did not serve a \\"public purpose\\" and that the plan had cause harm to Radio Row merchants, contrary to what Tobin had claimed.[46] In response, Tobin announced that the lower courts had ruled on the constitutional question of \\"public purpose\\", prompting an appellate judge to issue a public rebuke for Tobin's \\"extramural misrepresentation\\" of the outcome.[46][47] Tobin changed his offer to the merchants, offering to relocate them to a new electronics complex and delay demolition until 1964. However, in public, he acted as though the judges had already ruled in his favor on the constitutional question.[48] In February 1963, the New York Court of Appeals ruled that the World Trade Center did not constitute a \\"public purpose\\", thereby nullifying the Port Authority's land acquisition.[49] The Port Authority immediately appealed,[50] and in April, the same court reversed its previous decision, upholding the Port Authority's right of eminent domain and saying that the project had a \\"public purpose\\".[51] The merchants then appealed to the United States Supreme Court.[52] On November 12, 1963, the Supreme Court rejected the case, stating that it lacked proof of needing needing federal action.[53][54]\\r\\nUnder the state law, the Port Authority was required to assist business owners in relocating, something it had been doing since 1962.[42] However, many business owners regarded what the Port Authority offered as inadequate.[53][55] Questions continued while the World Trade Center was constructed, as to whether the Port Authority really ought to take on the project, described by some as a \\"mistaken social priority.\\"[56]\\r\\nAfter New Jersey approved of the World Trade Center project, the Port Authority started looking for tenants. First, the agency approached the United States Customs Service because the Customs Service had been dissatisfied with its current headquarters, the Alexander Hamilton U.S. Custom House on the tip of Lower Manhattan. The Port Authority then solicited the New York state government, since there were too few private companies willing to move to the World Trade Center.[57] The World Trade Center's planners were concerned that the World Trade Center would be underused, because at the time, less than 3.8% of the United States' gross national product came from international trade, and corporations with a worldwide presence comprised four-fifths of that sector.[58] In January 1964, the Port Authority certified a deal with the New York state government to relocate some offices to the World Trade Center.[59] The Port Authority began signing commercial tenants in the spring and summer of 1964, including several banks.[60] The Port Authority signed the United States Customs Service as a tenant a year later.[61]\\r\\nAfter considering these facts, Tobin and Tozzoli determined that the only way to make the World Trade Center appealing to private entities was to make the trade center the world's largest.[58] This resulted in an enlargement of plans for the entire trade center, which was originally supposed to include only 5 to 6?million square feet (0.46G10^6 to 0.56G10^6?m2) of floor space. After the release of the feasibility report for the new site, this figure increased to at least 6?million square feet (0.56G10^6?m2) of floor space, making the World Trade Center about as large as the Pentagon, the world's largest office building at the time. However, after directing his staff to inspect the proposed trade center's new site at Radio Row, Tobin decided to increase the amount of floor space further, to at least 10?million square feet (0.93G10^6?m2). Fearing controversy, Tobin kept this plan secret from the public.[62]\\r\\nTozzoli dismissed the three planners who had worked on the original World Trade Center study, due to their lack of creative designs for the World Trade Center complex.[63] He then went to Seattle to meet with architect Minoru Yamasaki. Tozzoli had a general idea of what should be in the trade center, but had not yet devised the specific details of the design.[64] Prior to this meeting, Yamasaki's only high-rise construction project was the Michigan Consolidated Gas Company's 30-story tower in Detroit. As a result, Yamasaki initially thought that the offer for him to build a $280,000,000 world trade center in New York City was a typo.[65] After it was clarified that the offer was not made in error, Yamasaki presented his \\"big and unmistakable, yet intimate and humane\\" proposal for the trade center to the Port Authority board in June 1962.[63] The author Paul Goldberger wrote that Yamasaki \\"presented himself as an aesthete\\" to the Port Authority board, which was mostly composed of engineers.[66] Following this meeting, a group of Port Authority planners began looking through Yamasaki's prior projects.[63]\\r\\nOn September 20, 1962,[67] after an exhaustive search for architects,[58][24] the Port Authority announced the selection of Yamasaki as lead architect, and Emery Roth & Sons as associate architects.[67] Originally, Yamasaki submitted to the Port Authority a concept incorporating twin towers, but with each building only 80 stories tall. Yamasaki remarked that the \\"obvious alternative, a group of several large buildings, would have looked like a housing project.\\"[68]\\r\\nThe Port Authority mandated that 10,000,000 square feet (930,000?m2) of office space be included in the new World Trade Center, but tasked Yamasaki with determining how to arrange that space.[64] As a result, Yamasaki tested out different possible designs, including spreading out the space across three or four towers, as well as condensing the space within two 80-story towers.[69] His other plans included a single, very large tower and ten moderately large buildings.[64] He favored the 80-story twin-tower plan, but found that it did not meet the Port Authority's requirements. At the time, it was not considered economical to build an office building with more than 80 floors.[69][64]\\r\\nAnother major limiting factor in the buildings' designs was elevators. As the building got taller, more elevators were needed to service the building, which required more elevator banks that in turn took up space.[68] Yamasaki and the engineers decided to use a new system that included sky lobbies, which are floors where people can switch from a large-capacity express elevator, which goes only to the sky lobbies, to a local elevator that goes to each floor in a section. Thus, the local elevators can be stacked within the same elevator shaft.[70] Located on the 44th and 78th floors of each tower, the sky lobbies enabled the elevators to be used efficiently, while also increasing the amount of usable space on each floor from 62 to 75 percent by reducing the number of required elevator shafts.[71] The World Trade Center towers were the second supertall buildings to use sky lobbies, after the John Hancock Center in Chicago.[72] This system was inspired by the New York City Subway, whose lines include local stations, where only local trains stop, and express stations, where all trains stop.[73] This allowed the towers' heights to be increased to 110 floors without the top floors being economically unfeasible.[69]\\r\\nYamasaki's final design for the World Trade Center was unveiled to the public on January 18, 1964, with an eight-foot model.[68] The towers had a square plan, approximately 207?feet (63?m) in dimension on each side.[74] The buildings were designed with narrow office windows, only 18?inches (45?cm) wide, which reflected on Yamasaki's fear of heights and desire to make building occupants feel secure.[75] The windows only covered 30% of the buildings' exteriors, making them look like solid metal slabs from a distance, though this was also a byproduct of the structural systems that held up the towers.[76] Yamasaki's design called for the building facades to be sheathed in aluminum-alloy.[77]\\r\\nYamasaki, who had previously designed Saudi Arabia's Dhahran International Airport with the Saudi Binladin Group, incorporated features of Arabic architecture into the design of the World Trade Center. The plaza was modelled after Mecca, incorporating features such as a vast delineated square, a fountain, and a radial circular pattern. Yamasaki described the plaza as \\"a mecca, a great relief from the narrow streets and sidewalks of the Wall Street area.\\"[78] He also incorporated other features of Arabic architecture into the building design, including pointed arches, interweaving tracery of prefabricated concrete, a minaret like flight tower, and arabesque patterns.[79]\\r\\nThe World Trade Center design brought criticism of its aesthetics from the American Institute of Architects and other groups.[77][80] Lewis Mumford, author of The City in History and other works on urban planning, criticized the project and described it and other new skyscrapers as \\"just glass-and-metal filing cabinets.\\"[81] Television broadcasters raised concerns that the World Trade Center twin towers would cause interference in television reception for viewers in the New York City area, who were getting their broadcasts from the Empire State Building at that time.[82] In response to these concerns, the Port Authority offered to provide new television transmission facilities at the World Trade Center.[83] The Linnaean Society of the American Museum of Natural History also opposed the Trade Center project, citing hazards the buildings would impose on migrating birds.[84]\\r\\nThe structural engineering firm Worthington, Skilling, Helle & Jackson worked to implement Yamasaki's design, developing a tube-frame structural system that was used in the buildings. The Port Authority's Engineering Department served as foundation engineers, Joseph R. Loring & Associates as electrical engineers, and Jaros, Baum & Bolles (JB&B) as mechanical engineers. Tishman Realty & Construction Company was the general contractor on the World Trade Center project. Guy F. Tozzoli, director of the World Trade Department at the Port Authority, and Rino M. Monti, the Port Authority's Chief Engineer, oversaw the project.[85]\\r\\nAs an interstate agency, the Port Authority was not subject to local laws and regulations of the City of New York, including building codes. Nonetheless, the Port Authority required architects and structural engineers to follow the New York City building codes. At the time when the World Trade Center was planned, new building codes were being devised to replace the 1938 version that was still in place. The structural engineers ended up following draft versions of the new 1968 building codes, which incorporated \\"advanced techniques\\" in building design.[86]\\r\\nThe World Trade Center towers included many structural engineering innovations in skyscraper design and construction, which allowed the buildings to reach new heights and become the tallest in the world. Traditionally, skyscrapers used a skeleton of columns distributed throughout the interior to support building loads, with interior columns disrupting the floor space.[70] The tube-frame concept, earlier introduced by Fazlur Khan, was a major innovation, allowing open floor plans and more space to rent. The buildings used high-strength, load-bearing perimeter steel columns called Vierendeel trusses. Although the columns themselves were lightweight, they were spaced closely together, forming a strong, rigid wall structure.[70][87] There were 60 perimeter columns, narrowly spaced, on each side of the buildings. In all, the perimeter walls of the towers were 210 feet (64?m) on each side, and the corners were beveled. The perimeter columns were designed to provide support for virtually all lateral loads (such as wind loads) and to share the gravity loads with the core columns.[87] Structural analysis of major portions of the World Trade Center were computed on an IBM 1620.[88]\\r\\nThe perimeter structure was constructed with extensive use of prefabricated modular pieces, which consisted of three columns, three stories tall, connected by spandrel plates. The perimeter columns had a square cross section, 14?inches (36?cm) on a side, and were constructed of welded steel plate.[89] The thickness of the plates and grade of structural steel varied over the height of the tower, ranging from 36,000 to 100,000?pounds per square inch (260 to 670?MPa).[a] The strength of the steel and thickness of the steel plates decreased with height because they were required to support lesser amounts of building mass on higher floors.[89] The tube-frame design required 40 percent less structural steel than conventional building designs.[90] From the 7th floor to the ground level, and down to the foundation, the columns were spaced 10?feet (3?m) apart.[91] All columns were placed on bedrock, which, unlike that in Midtown Manhattan, where the bedrock is shallow, is at 65ÿ85?feet (20ÿ26?m) below the surface.[92]\\r\\nThe spandrel plates were welded to the columns to create the modular pieces off-site at the fabrication shop.[93] The modular pieces were typically 52?inches (1.3?m) deep, and extended for two full floors and half of two more floors.[89] Adjacent modules were bolted together, with the splices occurring at mid-span of the columns and spandrels. The spandrel plates were located at each floor, transmitting shear stress between columns, allowing them to work together in resisting lateral loads. The joints between modules were staggered vertically, so the column splices between adjacent modules were not at the same floor.[89]\\r\\nThe building's core housed the elevator and utility shafts, restrooms, three stairwells, and other support spaces. The core of each tower was a rectangular area 87 by 135?feet (27 by 41?m), and contained 47 steel columns running from the bedrock to the top of the tower.[89] The columns tapered after the 66th floor, and consisted of welded box-sections at lower floors and rolled wide-flange sections at upper floors. The North Tower's structural core was oriented with the long axis east to west, while the South Tower's was oriented north to south. All elevators were located in the core. Each building had three stairwells, also in the core, except on the mechanical floors where the two outside stairwells temporarily left the core in order to avoid the express elevator machine rooms, and then rejoined the core by means of a transfer corridor.[94] It was this arrangement that allowed Stairwell A of the South Tower to remain passable after the aircraft impact on September 11, 2001.[95]\\r\\nThe large, column-free space between the perimeter and core was bridged by prefabricated floor trusses. The floors supported their own weight, as well as live loads, provided lateral stability to the exterior walls, and distributed wind loads among the exterior walls. The floors consisted of 4-inch (10?cm) thick lightweight concrete slabs laid on a fluted steel deck with shear connections for composite action.[89] A grid of lightweight bridging trusses and main trusses supported the floors. The trusses had a span of 60 feet (18?m) in the long-span areas and 35 feet (11?m) in the short span area.[89] The trusses connected to the perimeter at alternate columns, and were on 6-foot-8-inch (2.03?m) centers. The top chords of the trusses were bolted to seats welded to the spandrels on the exterior side and a channel welded to the core columns on the interior side. The floors were connected to the perimeter spandrel plates with viscoelastic dampers, which helped reduce the amount of sway felt by building occupants.[89]\\r\\nHat trusses (or \\"outrigger truss\\") located from the 107th floor to the top of the buildings were designed to support a tall communication antenna on top of each building.[89] Only the north tower, 1 World Trade Center, actually had an antenna fitted, which was added in 1978.[96] The truss system consisted of six trusses along the long axis of the core and four along the short axis. This truss system allowed some load redistribution between the perimeter and core columns and supported the transmission tower.\\r\\nThe tube frame design using steel core and perimeter columns protected with sprayed-on fire resistant material created a relatively lightweight structure that would sway more in response to the wind, compared to traditional structures such as the Empire State Building that have thick, heavy masonry for fireproofing of steel structural elements.[97] During the design process, wind tunnel tests were done at Colorado State University and at the National Physical Laboratory in the United Kingdom to establish design wind pressures that the World Trade Center towers could be subjected to and structural response to those forces.[98] Experiments were also done to evaluate how much sway occupants could tolerate. Subjects were recruited for \\"free eye exams,\\" while the real purpose of the experiment was to subject them to simulated building sway and find out how much they could comfortably tolerate.[99] Many subjects did not respond well, experiencing dizziness and other ill effects. One of the chief engineers Leslie Robertson worked with Canadian engineer Alan G. Davenport to develop viscoelastic dampers to absorb some of the sway. These viscoelastic dampers, used throughout the structures at the joints between floor trusses and perimeter columns, along with some other structural modifications reduced the building sway to an acceptable level.[100]\\r\\nThe structural engineers on the project also considered the possibility that an aircraft could crash into the building. In July 1945, a B-25 bomber that was lost in the fog had crashed into the 78th and 79th floors of the Empire State Building. A year later, another airplane crashed into the 40 Wall Street building, and there was another close call at the Empire State Building.[101] In designing the World Trade Center, Leslie Robertson considered the scenario of the impact of a jet airliner, the Boeing 707, which might be lost in the fog, seeking to land at JFK or at Newark airports.[102] The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) found a three-page white paper that mentioned another aircraft impact analysis, involving impact of a jet at 600?mph (970?km/h), was indeed considered, but NIST could not locate the documentary evidence of the aircraft impact analysis.[103]\\r\\nSprayed-fire resistant materials (SFRMs) were used to protect some structural steel elements in the towers, including all floor trusses and beams. Gypsum wallboard in combination with SFRMs, or in some cases gypsum wallboard alone, was used to protect core columns. Vermiculite plaster was used on the interior-side and SFRMs on the other three sides of the perimeter columns for fire protection.[94] The 1968 New York City building codes were more lenient in some aspects of fire protection, such as allowing three exit stairwells in the World Trade Center towers, instead of six as required under older building codes.[104]\\r\\nIn April 1970, the New York City Department of Air Resources ordered contractors building the World Trade Center to stop the spraying of asbestos as an insulating material.[105]\\r\\nMore fireproofing was added after a fire in February 1975 that spread to six floors before being extinguished.[106] After the 1993 bombing, inspections found fireproofing to be deficient. The Port Authority was in the process of replacing it, but replacement had been completed on only 18 floors in the North Tower, including all the floors affected by the aircraft impact and fires on September 11,[107] and on 13 floors in the South Tower, although only three of these floors (77, 78, and 85) were directly affected by the aircraft impact.[108][109]\\r\\nThe 1968 New York City building codes did not require sprinklers for high-rise buildings, except for underground spaces. In accordance with building codes, sprinklers were originally installed only in the underground parking structures of the World Trade Center.[110] Following a major fire in February 1975, the Port Authority decided to start installing sprinklers throughout the buildings. By 1993, nearly all of the South Tower and 85 percent of the North Tower had sprinklers installed[111] and the entire complex was retrofitted by 2001.[112]\\r\\nEven once the agreement between the states of New Jersey, New York, and the Port Authority had been finalized in 1962, the World Trade Center plan faced continued controversy. New York City Mayor Robert F. Wagner Jr. did not like that the city had a very small stake in the trade center's planning process.[113][32] Wagner had heard of the revised West Side site through the Newark Evening News, and he stated that the Port Authority had regarded the city as an \\"outsider rather than the central figure\\" during the planning process.[32] Wagner wanted the agreement to be delayed until the city could express its opinion regarding the deal.[114] The city and Port Authority hosted a series of meetings to discuss the details of the World Trade Center.[113] However, the city was at a disadvantage since it only had jurisdiction over the streets in the World Trade Center site, but had no say in the site's condemnations.[62][115] The city used this fact as leverage once private developers announced their opposition to the project.[116]\\r\\nBy 1964, by which time the intended scale of the scheme had been made public with plans for twin 110-story towers, private real estate developers and members of the Real Estate Board of New York also expressed concerns about the World Trade Center's much-\\"subsidized\\" office space going on the open market, competing with the many vacancies in the private sector.[117][118] One notable critic was Lawrence Wien, a co-owner of the Empire State Building, which would lose its title of tallest building in the world.[117][119] Wien organized a group of builders into a group called the \\"Committee for a Reasonable World Trade Center\\" to demand that the project be scaled down.[120][117] This group approached the city for assistance in trying to reduce the size of the World Trade Center project.[117] They claimed that the large amount of floor space in the World Trade Center would create an excess of real estate, causing a reduction in other developers' profits. The city and developers used a myriad of arguments to stall construction for two years.[116]\\r\\nWagner's successor, John Lindsay, and the New York City Council raised concerns about the limited extent that the Port Authority involved the city in the negotiations and deliberations. Negotiations between the New York City government and the Port Authority were centered on tax issues: the Port Authority offered to pay the city an extra $4 million per year in exchange for foregoing tax payments, while the city wanted four times the amount the Port Authority was offering. This dispute went on for two years, during which time the projected price of the World Trade Center increased sharply.[116] The original estimates put forth by the Port Authority had the costs for construction of the World Trade Center at $350 millionan optimistic figure.[121] In December 1966, the Port Authority announced increased cost estimates, bringing the estimated total to $575 million.[122] This announcement brought criticism of the project from private real estate developers, The New York Times, and others in New York City.[123] The critics stated that the Port Authority figure was an unrealistically low estimate, and they estimated the project would end up costing $750 million.[124] By the time the World Trade Center twin towers were ultimately completed, the total costs to the Port Authority had reached $900 million.[125]\\r\\nBy July 1966, neither the city or the Port Authority were able to come to an agreement.[115] However, negotiations soon resumed,[126] and a final agreement was made on August 3, 1966.[127] As part of the agreement, the Port Authority would make annual payments to the City, in lieu of taxes, for the portion of the World Trade Center leased to private tenants.[127][62] As part of the agreement, the city would build the New York Passenger Ship Terminal in Hell's Kitchen, Manhattan, while the Port Authority would build the South Brooklyn Marine Terminal.[126] In subsequent years, the payments would rise as the real estate tax rate increased.[128] The project would be financed through tax-exempt bonds issued by the Port Authority.[129]\\r\\nIn March 1965, the Port Authority began acquiring property at the World Trade Center site.[130] The Ajax Wrecking and Lumber Corporation was hired for the demolition work, which began on March 21, 1965 to clear the site for construction of the World Trade Center.[131]\\r\\nGroundbreaking was on August 5, 1966, marking the beginning of construction of the World Trade Center's foundations.[132] The site of the World Trade Center was located on landfill, with the bedrock located 65 feet (20?m) below grade.[133] In order to construct the World Trade Center, it was necessary to build \\"The Bathtub\\", with the slurry wall along the West Street side of the site, to keep water from the Hudson River out. This method was used in place of conventional dewatering methods because lowering the groundwater table would cause large settlements of nearby buildings not built on deep foundations.[134]\\r\\nThe slurry method involved digging a trench, and as excavation proceeded, filling the space with a \\"slurry\\" mixture. The mixture, composed of bentonite, plugged holes and kept water out. When the trench was dug out, a steel cage was inserted and concrete was poured in, forcing the \\"slurry\\" out. The \\"slurry\\" method was devised by Port Authority chief engineer John M. Kyle Jr. Towards the end of 1966, work began on building the slurry wall, led by Montreal-based Icanda, a subsidiary of an Italian engineering firm, Impresa Costruzioni Opere Specializzate (I.C.O.S.).[135] It took fourteen months for the slurry wall to be completed, which was necessary before excavation of material from the interior of the site could begin.[135] The original Hudson Tubes, which carried PATH trains into Hudson Terminal, remained in service as elevated tunnels until 1971 when a new PATH station was built.[136]\\r\\nConstruction work began on the North Tower in August 1968 with construction beginning on the South Tower by January 1969.[137] In January 1967, $74 million in contracts were awarded to the Pacific Car and Foundry Company, Laclede Steel Company, Granite City Steel Company, and Karl Koch Erecting Company to supply steel for the project.[138] The Port Authority chose to use many different steel suppliers, bidding on smaller portions of steel, rather than buy larger amounts from a single source such as Bethlehem Steel or U.S. Steel as a cost-saving measure.[139] Karl Koch was also hired to do all the work of erecting the steel, and a contract for work on the aluminum facade was awarded to the Aluminum Company of America.[138] Tishman Realty & Construction was hired in February 1967 to oversee construction of the project.[140]\\r\\nExtensive use of prefabricated parts for the perimeter framing and floor truss systems helped speed up the construction process and reduce costs, while providing greater quality control.[90] Steel components were freighted into a Penn Central yard in Jersey City. From there, they were brought in the early morning hours through the Holland Tunnel to the construction site, then lifted into place by a crane.[141] Larger pieces were brought to the construction site by tugboats.[142] A special type of crane, suitable for constructing such tall buildings, that used hydraulics to lift components and provided its own power was used in construction of the World Trade Center. The Favco Standard 2700 Crane, manufactured by Favelle Mort Ltd. of New South Wales, Australia was informally called a \\"kangaroo crane.\\"[143]\\r\\nIn 1970, tugboat workers went on strike, halting the transport of material to the construction site.[144] The Port Authority attempted other means of transporting material, including via helicopter. When this method was tried, the helicopter lost its load of steel into the Kill Van Kull.[145] Some other mishaps occurred during the construction process, including disruption of telephone service in Lower Manhattan when telephone cables were crushed by pile drivers.[146] On March 16, 1970, an explosion injured six workers when a truck hit a propane tank.[147] In all, 60 workers were killed in construction accidents while the World Trade Center was being built.[148]\\r\\nThe topping out ceremony of the North Tower (1 World Trade Center) took place on December 23, 1970, while the South Tower (2 World Trade Center)'s ceremony occurred on July 19, 1971.[137] The first tenants moved into the North Tower on December 15, 1970,[149] and into the South Tower in January 1972.[150] The buildings were dedicated on April 4, 1973; Tobin, who had resigned the year before, was absent from the ceremonies.[151]\\r\\nBuilding the World Trade Center involved excavating 1,200,000 cubic yards (920,000?m3) of material.[152] Rather than transporting this material at great costs out to sea or to landfills in New Jersey, the fill material was used to expand the Manhattan shoreline across West Street.[152] Work to demolish the piers began on January 5, 1967, including Pier 7 to Pier 11 which were all constructed around 1910.[153] The demolition work moved forward, despite conflicts between David Rockefeller, Governor Nelson Rockefeller, and Mayor John Lindsay regarding plans for Battery Park City.[154] Landfill material from the World Trade Center was used to add land, and a cellular cofferdam was constructed to retain the material.[133] The result was a 700-foot (210?m) extension into the Hudson River, running six blocks or 1,484 feet (452?m).[152] This land was a \\"gift\\" to New York City, allowing more tax-generating developments in Battery Park City.[155]\\r\\nThe World Trade Center complex included four other smaller buildings constructed during the 1970s. 3 World Trade Center was a 22-story building, which was home to the Marriott World Trade Center. It was designed by Skidmore, Owings and Merrill in 1978ÿ79.[156] 4 World Trade Center, 5 World Trade Center, and 6 World Trade Center were all 8ÿ9 story buildings that were designed by the same team as the Twin Towers, including Minoru Yamasaki; Emery Roth & Sons; and Skilling, Helle, Christiansen, Robertson.[157] 7 World Trade Center was built in the mid-1980s, just north of the main World Trade Center site. The 47-story building was designed by Emery, Roth & Sons, and constructed on top of a Con Edison power substation.[158]\\r\\nOver time, numerous structural modifications were made to suit the needs of tenants in the Twin Towers. Modifications were made in accordance with the Port Authority's Tenant Alteration Review Manual and were reviewed by the Port Authority to ensure the changes did not compromise structural integrity of the buildings. In many instances, openings were cut in the floors to accommodate new stairways to connect tenant floors. Some steel beams in the core were reinforced and strengthened to accommodate heavy live loads, such as large amounts of heavy files that tenants had on their floors.[159]\\r\\nRepairs to structural elements on the lower levels of 1 WTC were made following the 1993 bombing. The greatest damage occurred on levels B1 and B2, with significant structural damage also on level B3.[160] Primary structural columns were not damaged, but secondary steel members experienced some damage.[161] Floors that were blown out needed to be repaired to restore the structural support they provided to columns.[162] The slurry wall was in peril following the bombing and loss of the floor slabs which provided lateral support to counteract pressure from Hudson River water on the other side.[163] The refrigeration plant on sublevel B5, which provided air conditioning to the entire World Trade Center complex, was heavily damaged and replaced with a temporary system for the summer of 1993.[163] The fire alarm system for the entire complex needed to be replaced, after critical wiring and signaling in the original system was destroyed in the 1993 bombing. Installation of the new system took years to complete, and replacement of some components was still underway in September 2001.[164]\\r\\nCoordinates: 404242N 740049W? / ?40.71167N 74.01361W? / 40.71167; -74.01361","input":"When did the construction of the world trade center begin?"},{"output":"a sport utility vehicle (SUV)","context":"The Dodge Durango is a sport utility vehicle (SUV) produced by Dodge. The first two generations were very similar in that both were based on the Dodge Dakota, both featured a body-on-frame construction and both were produced at the Newark Assembly Plant in Newark, Delaware.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe third-generation Durango is built on the same platform as the Jeep Grand Cherokee, features unibody construction, and has been assembled at the Jefferson North Assembly Plant in Detroit, Michigan, since mid-2010. It continues as a mid-sized SUV [3].\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Durango was marketed as a sturdy truck-based SUV designed to hold up to seven passengers and tow up to 7,500?lb (3,400?kg) when properly equipped.[4] The Durango shared a front end, instrument panel, and front seats with the Dakota pickup on which it was based. Original designs of the eight-passenger Durango featured a rear-facing third row similar to many older station wagons. To make room for a more practical forward-facing third row, Dodge shortened the length of the front doors and raised the roof two inches (5?cm) beyond the front seats, allowing for stadium seating. The Durango's roof rack was designed to mask the appearance of the raised roof.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 4.7?L Magnum V8 replaced the 5.2?L Magnum V8 engine for 2000; however, the 5.2 was still available in the early 2000 models. In that same year, a special AWD performance version called the R/T was released with a 5.9?L Magnum V8. In 1999 and 2000, a limited-edition Shelby S.P.360 version was offered that featured a supercharged version of the 5.9?L Magnum V8 engine. Output is 360?hp (270?kW; 360?PS) and 412?lb?ft (559?N?m) of torque. Exterior modifications include unique wheels, tires, suspension, and bumpers. It came standard with Viper blue paint with two racing stripes down the center of the truck. It boasted a 0 to 60 mph time of 7.1 seconds. The top speed was 142?mph (229?km/h).\\r\\n\\r\\nFor 1999, the Durango was made available with two-wheel drive. A 3.9?L Magnum V6 engine was available, but few were sold. Minor changes were made for the second year, two new paint colors and notable options available including 6-by-9-inch (150?mm G?230?mm) heated rear view mirrors and steering wheel-mounted radio controls. Leather seats became standard on SLT?Plus models, and body-color wheel flares became standard on SLT Plus and four-wheel drive models.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 2000 model year included a new 4.7?L Magnum V8 engine, which replaced the reliable 5.2?L Magnum V8, as the standard engine for four-wheel drive models. The 3.9?L Magnum V6 engine was no longer available, leaving only V8s for the rest of the production run. The high-performance Durango R/T came equipped with a performance-tuned 5.9?L Magnum V8 and all-wheel drive.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor 2001, Dodge focused on interior upgrades as Durango's interior trim panels, dash-mounted controls, instrument panel, overhead console, and steering wheel were all redesigned. The transfer case selector on 4X4 models changed from a manual lever on the console to a switch on the dash. The instrument cluster was updated, and an electronic vehicle information center was incorporated into the overhead console. For improved rear passenger comfort, a dual-zone climate-control system was added as standard equipment. Sound systems were improved on all models and now came standard with SX speakers. Other minor changes include: door panels, revised seats, aluminium wheels, and minor changes to trim options.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2002, the new SXT version of the Durango was offered as the entry-level trim package. Optional side curtain airbags were added for safety. The 2003 Durango featured minor mechanical changes, most notable was the addition of four-wheel disc brakes.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1999, the following models: 4WD 5.2L V8, 4WD 5.9L V8 hold the best crash test results in this Durango year and manufacturing, with it holding a 6.8 out of 10 total rating.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe SLT, SLT Plus, and Sport trim levels offered the 3.9?L Magnum V6 engine as standard equipment (late availability starting in 1999), with the 5.2?L and 5.9?L Magnum V8 engines being available options, later switching to the 4.7?L Power-Tech V8 engine, with the 5.9?L Magnum V8 engine optional. The R/T and S.P. 360 trim levels included the 5.9?L Magnum V8 engine as standard equipment.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe second-generation Durango was first shown as a concept dubbed Dodge Durango R/T concept at the 2003 Detroit Auto Show. It debuted shortly before the companion Dakota. Like the Dakota, it has much in common with the large Dodge Ram pickup, including a fully boxed frame. It is 7?in (180?mm) longer, 2?in (51?mm) wider, and 3?in (76?mm) taller than the previous model. It also offered a third-row bench with three seats, giving it an eight-seat capacity. The design took its styling primarily from the Dodge Powerbox concept, which was itself based on the 1999 Dodge Power Wagon concept, and the 2003-2004 Durango R/T concept.\\r\\n\\r\\nDebuting for 2004 was a new coil-spring rear suspension for the solid rear axle. A Watt's linkage system is fitted to the rear axle, centering the axle and reducing rear-end skate over rough surfaces, and allowing a lower and wider cargo floor.\\r\\n\\r\\nSXT: 2003-2009: Most basic trim level, basic features.\\r\\n\\r\\nSLT: 2003-2009: Value-oriented trim level, value-added features, optional luxury features.\\r\\n\\r\\nAdventurer: 2005-2007: Value-oriented and \\"off-road-look\\" trim level, value-added features, optional luxury features.\\r\\n\\r\\nLimited: 2003-2009: Most luxurious trim level, luxury features.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll trim levels offered the 4.7L Power-Tech V8 engine as standard equipment, though the 5.7?L HEMI V8 engine was available on all trim levels, except for the base SXT trim level.

The Pentastar V6 engine is backed by a Mercedes W5A580 five-speed automatic, with Chrysler's controls and the driver-interactive control. The 5.7?L Hemi VVT V8 returned with 360?hp (268?kW; 365?PS) and 390?lb?ft (529?N?m) of torque, which features the 545RFE five-speed automatic. The Hemi V8 also comes with a \\"fuel-saver\\" (cylinder deactivation) mode. This feature is primarily used when the vehicle is cruising at constant speeds on level ground.\\r\\n\\r\\nDodge unveiled its revised 2014 model Durango at the 2013 New York International Auto Show. The 2014 Durango was redesigned with sportier-looking lines, an eight-speed automatic transmission, and a new design trim similar to the Rallye, with blackened plastic bumper and outline. The tail lights were reworked to feature a single LED 'Racetrack' tail lamp similar to the Charger and Dart. On the inside, Dodge added a revised steering wheel, instrument cluster, rotary shift knob, and a reconfigurable 7-in (780mm) thin film transistor display first seen on the Dart.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 2015 Durango received a new package available for the R/T trim, consisting of a Premium Nappa Leather Group option featuring radar red leather seats, 0.8-inch-lower ride height (20?mm), black headlamp bezels, HID low beams and LED DRLS, optional R/T embroidery on the seats, a nine-speaker sound system with a subwoofer, a 360-horsepower 5.7?L Hemi paired with ZF's eight-speed transmission, and a 20-inch (510?mm) Granite Crystal wheel finished in black.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nFor 2016 the Durango received the new Pentastar Upgrade V6 which adds Stop/Start, Variable Valve Lift and better drivability through a 15% enhanced torque curve and increasing the Variable Valve Timing from 50 degrees to 70 degrees. Other technologies include Cooled EGR and friction reduction. Despite the added tech, the engine weighs 4 lbs less. Power output remains the same at 293HP/260 ft/lbs torque (single exhaust) and 295HP/260 ft/lbs torque (dual exhaust). The Durango also added new packages to their two trims, with the Anodized Platinum package for the Citadel trim and the Brass Monkey package for the Limited trim.[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nFor 2017, the Dodge Durango Limited trim is discontinued and replaced by the new GT trim and the Base SXT trim level will now be available with three row seating fitting 7 passengers.[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn August 16, 2012, Chrysler recalled 1,661 2013-model Dodge Durango sport utility vehicles in the United States and Canada because some airbags may not deploy in an accident. The recall affects 1,449 of the seven-passenger versions of the SUVs in the United States and 212 in Canada and other markets.[37]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn July 24, 2015, Chrysler recalled all 2014-2015 Dodge Durangos with the 8.4-inch (210?mm) touch-screens due to security concerns with the software that controls the vehicle because it could be hacked. The vulnerability was discovered by software engineers Charlie Miller and Chris Valasek and initially posted on Wired. This vulnerability would allow hackers to remotely access and take over a variety of features, including those key parts of driving via a vulnerability in the Uconnect infotainment system.[38][39]","input":"What type of vehicle is a dodge durango?"},{"output":"three","context":"The five main latitude regions of the Earth's surface comprise geographical zones, divided by the major circles of latitude. The differences between them relate to climate. They are as follows:\\r\\nOn the basis of latitudinal extent, the globe is divided into three broad heat zones.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Torrid is also known as the Tropics. The zone is bounded on the north by the Tropic of Cancer and on the south by the Tropic of Capricorn; these latitudes mark the northern and southern extremes in which the sun seasonally passes directly overhead. This happens annually, but in the region between, the sun passes overhead twice a year.\\r\\nIn the Northern Hemisphere, in the sun's apparent northward migration after the March equinox, it passes overhead once, then after the June solstice, at which time it reaches the Tropic of Cancer, it passes over again on its apparent southward journey. After the September equinox the sun passes into the Southern Hemisphere. It then passes similarly over the southern tropical regions until it reaches the Tropic of Capricorn at the December solstice, and back again as it returns northwards to the Equator.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the two Temperate Zones, consisting of the tepid latitudes, the Sun is never directly overhead, and the climate is mild, generally ranging from warm to cool. The four annual seasons, spring, summer, autumn and winter, occur in these areas. The North Temperate Zone includes Europe, Northern Asia, and North and Central America. The South Temperate Zone includes Southern Australasia, southern South America, and Southern Africa.\\r\\nThe two Frigid Zones, or polar regions, experience the midnight sun and the polar night for part of the year - at the edge of the zone there is one day at the winter solstice when the Sun is invisible, and one day at the summer solstice when the sun remains above the horizon for 24 hours. In the center of the zone (the pole) the day is one year long with six months of daylight and six months of night. The Frigid Zones are the coldest regions of Earth and are generally covered in ice and snow.\\r\\nThe concept of a geographical zone was first hypothesized by the ancient Greek scholar Parmenides[1] and lastingly modified by Aristotle.[2] Both philosophers theorized the Earth divided into three types of climatic zones based on their distance from the equator.\\r\\nLike Parmeneides, thinking that the area near the equator was too hot for habitation, Aristotle dubbed the region around the equator (from 23.5 N to 23.5 S) the \\"Torrid Zone.\\" Both philosophers reasoned the region from the Arctic Circle to the pole to be permanently frozen. This region, thought uninhabitable, was called the \\"Frigid Zone.\\" The only area believed to be habitable was the northern \\"Temperate Zone\\" (the southern one not having been discovered), lying between the \\"Frigid Zones\\" and the \\"Torrid Zone\\". However, humans have inhabited almost all climates on Earth, including inside the Arctic Circle.\\r\\nAs knowledge of the Earth's geography improved, a second \\"Temperate Zone\\" was discovered south of the equator, and a second \\"Frigid Zone\\" was discovered around the Antarctic. Although Aristotle's map was oversimplified, the general idea was correct. Today, the most commonly used climate map is the K?ppen climate classification, developed by Russian climatologist of German descent and amateur botanist Wladimir K?ppen (1846ÿ1940), which divides the world into five major climate regions, based on average annual precipitation, average monthly precipitation, and average monthly temperature.","input":"How many heat zones are there on the earth?"},{"output":"12 hours","context":"On Earth, daytime is roughly the period of the day  during which any given point in the world experiences natural illumination from especially direct sunlight. Daytime occurs when the Sun appears above the local horizon, that is, anywhere on the globe's hemisphere facing the Sun. During daytime, an observer sees indirect sunlight while in the shade, which includes cloud cover. 'Day' is sometimes used instead of 'daytime', in this case 'day' will mean 'the period of light between dawn and nightfall; the interval from sunrise to sunset', which is synonymous with daytime.[1] However in this context, in order to be clear \\"daytime\\" should be used distinguish it from \\"day\\" which typically refers to a 24-hour period.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nOther planets and natural satellites that rotate relative to a luminous  primary body, such as a local star, also experience daytime of some sort, but this article primarily discusses daytime on Earth.\\r\\n\\r\\nApproximately half of the Earth is illuminated at any time by the Sun. The area subjected to direct illumination is almost exactly half the planet; but because of atmospheric and other effects that extend the reach of indirect illumination, the area of the planet covered by either direct or indirect illumination amounts to slightly more than half the surface.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe hemisphere of the Earth experiencing daytime at any given instant changes continuously as the planet rotates on its own axis. The axis of the Earth's rotation is not perpendicular to the plane of its orbit around the Sun (which is parallel with the direction of sunlight), and so the length of the daytime period varies from one point on the planet to another. Additionally, since the axis of rotation is relatively fixed in comparison to the stars, it moves with respect to the Sun as the planet orbits the star. This creates seasonal variations in the length of the daytime period at most points on the planet's surface.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe period of daytime from the standpoint of a surface observer is roughly defined as the period between sunrise, when the Earth's rotation towards the east first causes the Sun's disc to appear above the horizon, to sunset, when the continuing rotation of the Earth causes the Sun's disc to disappear below the horizon to the west. Because the Sun is a luminous disc as seen from the Earth, rather than a point source of light, sunrise and sunset are not instantaneous and the exact definition of both can vary with context. Additionally, the Earth's atmosphere further bends and diffuses light from the Sun and lengthens the period of sunrise and sunset. For a certain period after sunset and before sunrise, indirect light from the Sun lightens the sky on Earth; this period is often referred to as twilight. Certain groups, such as Earthly astronomers, do not consider daytime to be truly ended until the Sun's disc is actually well below the Earth's horizon, because of this indirect illumination.\\r\\n\\r\\nGiven that Earth's own axis of rotation is tilted about 23.5 to the line perpendicular to its orbital plane, called the ecliptic, the length of daytime varies with the seasons on the planet's surface, depending on the observer's latitude. Areas tilted toward the Sun are experiencing summer. Their tilt toward the Sun leads to more than half of the day seeing daylight and warmer temperatures, due to the higher directness of solar rays, the longer period of daytime itself, and less absorption of sunlight in the atmosphere. While increased daylight can have some effect on the higher temperatures in the summer, most of temperature rise results from the directness of the Sun, not the increased daylight. The high angles (around the zenith) of the Sun causes the tropics to be warm, while low angles (barely above the horizon) causes the polar regions to be cold. The slight effect of daylight hours on average seasonal temperature can be seen with the poles and tropical regions. The poles are still cold during their respective summers, despite seeing 24 hours of daylight for six months, while the Equator remains warm throughout the year, with only 12 hours of daylight per day. \\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough the daytime length at the Equator remains 12 hours in all seasons, the duration at all other latitudes varies with the seasons. During the winter, daytime lasts shorter than 12 hours; during the summer, it lasts longer than 12 hours. Northern winter and southern summer concur, while northern summer and southern winter concur. \\r\\n\\r\\nAt the Equator, the daytime period always lasts about 12 hours, regardless of season. As viewed from the Equator, the Sun always rises and sets vertically, following an apparent path nearly perpendicular to the horizon. Due to the axial tilt of Earth, Sun always lies within 23.5 north or south of the celestial equator, so the subsolar point always lies within the tropics.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom the March equinox to the September equinox, the Sun rises within 23.5 north of due east, and sets within 23.5 north of due west. From the September equinox to the March equinox, the Sun rises within 23.5 south of due east and sets within 23.5 south of due west. The Sun's path lies entirely in the northern half of the celestial sphere from the March equinox to the September equinox, but lies entirely in the southern half of the celestial sphere from the September equinox to the March equinox. On the equinoxes, the equatorial Sun culminates at the zenith, passing directly overhead at solar noon.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe fact that the equatorial Sun is always so close to the zenith at solar noon explains why the tropical zone contains the warmest regions on the planet overall. Additionally, the Equator sees the shortest sunrise or sunset because the Sun's path across the sky is so nearly perpendicular to the horizon. On the equinoxes, the solar disk takes only two minutes to traverse the horizon (from top to bottom at sunrise and from bottom to top at sunset).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe tropics occupy a zone of Earth's surface between 23.5 north and 23.5 south of the Equator. Within this zone, the Sun will pass (or culminate) almost directly overhead on at least one day per year. The line of 23.5 north latitude is called the Tropic of Cancer, because when it was named, the Sun passed overhead at this location at the time of year when it was within the zodiac sign of Cancer. The equivalent line of south latitude is called the Tropic of Capricorn, for similar reasons. If they had been named today using the constellation in which the sun is currently in at the time it is directly overhead the tropic line, they would have been called, respectively, the Tropics of Gemini and Sagittarius.[citation needed] The sun enters and leaves each sign of the zodiac slightly later each year at the rate of about 1 day every 72 years. For more information, see precession of the equinoxes.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the Tropical Circles, the Sun is directly overhead only once per year, on the corresponding solstice. At latitudes closer to the Equator and on the Equator itself, it will be overhead twice per year (on the equinoxes in the case of the Equator). Outside the tropics, the Sun never passes directly overhead.\\r\\n\\r\\nAround the poles, which coincide with the rotational axis of Earth as it passes through the surface, the seasonal variations in the length of daytime are extreme. In fact, within 23.5 latitude of the poles, there will be at least some days each year during which the sun never goes below the horizon. There will also be days when the Sun never rises above the horizon. This number will be fewer, but close to the number of days in the summer where the sun doesn't set (for example the sunrise is usually a few days before the spring equinox and extends a few days past the fall equinox). This phenomenon of more daylight than night is not unique to the poles. In fact, at any given time slightly more than half of the earth is in daylight. The 24 hours of summer daylight is known as the midnight sun that is famous in some northern countries. To the north, the Arctic Circle marks this 23.5 boundary. To the south, the Antarctic Circle marks the boundary. These boundaries correspond to 66.5 north or south latitude, respectively. Because the Sun's disc itself is about half a degree in diameter and is very bright, truly dark days during which the sun never seems to rise are only seen beyond 72 north or south latitude.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt and near the poles, the Sun never rises very high above the horizon, even in summer, which is one of reasons why these regions of the world are consistently cold in all seasons (others include the effect of albedo, the relative increased reflection of solar radiation of snow and ice). Even at the summer solstice, when the Sun reaches its highest point above the horizon at noon, it is still only 23.5 above the horizon at the poles. Additionally, as one approaches the poles the apparent path of the Sun through the sky each day diverges increasingly from the vertical. As summer approaches, the Sun rises and sets become more northerly in the north and more southerly in the south. At the poles, the path of the Sun is indeed a circle, which is roughly equidistant above the horizon for the entire duration of the daytime period on any given day. The circle gradually sinks below the horizon as winter approaches, and gradually rises above it as summer approaches. At the poles, apparent sunrise and sunset may last for several days.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt middle latitudes, far from both the Equator and the poles, variations in the length of daytime are moderate. In the higher middle latitudes where Montreal, Paris and Ushuaia are located, the difference in the length of the day from summer to winter can be very noticeable: the sky may still be lit at 10 pm in summer, but may be dark at 5 pm in winter. In the lower middle latitudes where Southern California, Egypt and South Africa are located, the seasonal difference is smaller, but still results in approximately 4 hours difference in daylight between the winter and summer solstices. The difference becomes less pronounced the closer one gets to the equator.  An approximation to the monthly change can be obtained from the rule of 12ths.  With 4 hours change over the six months from winter to summer the day lengthens by about 4*1/12 of an hour (20 mins) in the first month, 4*2/12 (40 mins) in the second month, 4*3/12 (1 hr) in the third month, then 1 hr, 40 mins and 20 mins in the fourth, fifth and six months.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlso in the middle latitudes, the seasonal climate variations produced by changes in the length of daytime are the most marked, with very distinct periods of cold and heat, and other secondary seasonal changes such as snow and ice in winter that disappear in summer and so on. At high latitudes, it is cold most of the time, with constant snow and ice, so the seasons are less obvious; and in the tropics, it is hot most of the time, with no snow or ice at all, so again the seasons are less obvious.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe exact instant of solar noon, when the Sun reaches its highest point in the sky, varies with the seasons. This variation is called the equation of time; the magnitude of variation is about 30 minutes over the course of a year.","input":"How long is a day on the equator?"},{"output":"bean,","context":"A peanut (Arachis hypogaea), also known as a groundnut or goober,[2] is a legume crop grown mainly for its edible seeds. It is widely grown in the tropics and subtropics, being important to both small and large commercial producers. It is classified as both a grain legume[3] and, because of its high oil content, an oil crop.[4] World annual production of shelled peanuts was 42 million tonnes in 2014. Atypically among crop plants, peanut pods develop underground rather than above ground. It is this characteristic that the botanist Linnaeus used to assign the specific name hypogaea, which means \\"under the earth.\\"\\r\\nAs a legume, the peanut belongs to the botanical family Fabaceae; this is also known as Leguminosae, and commonly known as the bean, or pea, family.[1] Like most other legumes, peanuts harbor symbiotic nitrogen-fixing bacteria in root nodules.[5] This capacity to fix nitrogen means peanuts require less nitrogen-containing fertilizer and improve soil fertility, making them valuable in crop rotations.\\r\\nPeanuts are similar in taste and nutritional profile to tree nuts such as walnuts and almonds, and are often served in similar ways in Western cuisines. The botanical definition of a \\"nut\\" is a fruit whose ovary wall becomes very hard at maturity. Using this criterion, the peanut is not a true nut,[6] but rather a legume. However, for culinary purposes and in common English language usage, peanuts are usually referred to as nuts.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCultivated peanut (A. hypogaea) arose from a hybrid between two wild species of peanut, thought to be A. duranensis and A. ipaensis.[7][8][9] The initial hybrid would have been sterile, but spontaneous chromosome doubling restored its fertility,[citation needed] forming what is termed an amphidiploid or allotetraploid. Genetic analysis suggests the hybridization event probably occurred only once and gave rise to A. monticola, a wild form of peanut that occurs in a few restricted locations in northwestern Argentina, and by artificial selection to A. hypogaea.[7][8][10][11] The process of domestication through artificial selection made A. hypogaea dramatically different from its wild relatives. The domesticated plants are bushier and more compact, and have a different pod structure and larger seeds. The initial domestication may have taken place in northwestern Argentina, or in southeastern Bolivia, where the peanut landraces with the most wild-like features are grown today.[12][13] From this primary center of origin, cultivation spread and formed secondary and tertiary centers of diversity in Peru, Ecuador, Brazil, Paraguay, and Uruguay. Over time, thousands of peanut landraces evolved; these are classified into six botanical varieties and two subspecies (as listed in the peanut scientific classification table). Subspecies A. h. fastigiata types are more upright in their growth habit and have shorter crop cycles. Subspecies A. h. hypogaea types spread more on the ground and have longer crop cycles.[12][13]\\r\\nThe oldest known archeological remains of pods have been dated at about 7,600 years old. These may be pods from a wild species that was in cultivation, or A. hypogaea in the early phase of domestication.[14] They were found in Peru, where dry climatic conditions are favorable to the preservation of organic material. Almost certainly, peanut cultivation antedated this at the center of origin where the climate is moister. Many pre-Columbian cultures, such as the Moche, depicted peanuts in their art.[15] Cultivation was well established in Mesoamerica before the Spanish arrived. There, the conquistadors found the tlalcacahuatl (the plant's Nahuatl name, whence Mexican Spanish cacahuate, Castillian Spanish cacahuete, and French cacahute) being offered for sale in the marketplace of Tenochtitlan. The peanut was later spread worldwide by European traders, and cultivation is now very widespread in tropical and subtropical regions. In West Africa, it substantially replaced a crop plant from the same family, the Bambara groundnut, whose seed pods also develop underground. In Asia, it became an agricultural mainstay and this region is now the largest producer in the world.[16]\\r\\nIn the English-speaking world, peanut growing is most important in the United States. Although it was mainly a garden crop for much of the colonial period, it was mostly used as animal feed stock until the 1930s.[17] The US Department of Agriculture initiated a program to encourage agricultural production and human consumption of peanuts in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. George Washington Carver developed hundreds of recipes for peanuts during his tenure in the program.\\r\\nPeanut is an annual herbaceous plant growing 30 to 50?cm (1.0 to 1.6?ft) tall.[18] As a legume, it belongs to the botanical family Fabaceae (also known as Leguminosae, and commonly known as the bean or pea family).[1] Like most other legumes, peanuts harbor symbiotic nitrogen-fixing bacteria in their root nodules.[5] The leaves are opposite and pinnate with four leaflets (two opposite pairs; no terminal leaflet); each leaflet is 1 to 7?cm (? to 2? in) long and 1 to 3?cm (? to 1?in) across. Like many other legumes, the leaves are nyctinastic, that is, they have \\"sleep\\" movements, closing at night.\\r\\nPeanut pods develop underground, an unusual feature known as geocarpy.[19] The flowers are 1.0 to 1.5?cm (0.4 to 0.6 in) across, and yellowish orange with reddish veining.[12][13] They are borne in axillary clusters on the stems above ground and last for just one day. The ovary is located at the base of what appears to be the flower stem but is actually a highly elongated floral cup. After fertilization, a short stalk at the base of the ovary (termed a pedicel) elongates to form a thread-like structure known as a \\"peg\\". This peg grows down into the soil, and the tip, which contains the ovary, develops into a mature peanut pod.[19] Pods are 3 to 7?cm (1.2 to 2.8 in) long, and normally contain one to four seeds.[12][13]\\r\\nParts of the peanut include:\\r\\nPeanuts grow best in light, sandy loam soil with a pH of 5.9ÿ7. Their capacity to fix nitrogen means that, providing they nodulate properly, peanuts benefit little or not at all from nitrogen-containing fertilizer,[20] and they improve soil fertility. Therefore, they are valuable in crop rotations. Also, the yield of the peanut crop itself is increased in rotations, through reduced diseases, pests and weeds. For instance, in Texas, peanuts in a three-year rotation with corn yield 50% more than nonrotated peanuts.[20] Adequate levels of phosphorus, potassium, calcium, magnesium, and micronutrients are also necessary for good yields.[20] To develop well, peanuts need warm weather throughout the growing season. They can be grown with as little as 350?mm of water,[21] but for best yields need at least 500?mm.[22] Depending on growing conditions and the cultivar of peanut, harvest is usually 90 to 130 days after planting for subspecies A. h. fastigiata types, and 120 to 150 days after planting for subspecies A. h. hypogaea types.[21][23][24] Subspecies A. h. hypogaea types yield more, and are usually preferred where the growing seasons are long enough.\\r\\nPeanut plants continue to produce flowers when pods are developing, therefore even when they are ready for harvest, some pods are immature. The timing of harvest is an important decision to maximize yield. If it is too early, too many pods will be unripe. If too late, the pods will snap off at the stalk, and will remain in the soil.[25] For harvesting, the entire plant, including most of the roots, is removed from the soil.[25] The pods are covered with a network of raised veins and are constricted between seeds.\\r\\nHarvesting occurs in two stages:[26] In mechanized systems, a machine is used to cut off the main root of the peanut plant by cutting through the soil just below the level of the peanut pods. The machine lifts the \\"bush\\" from the ground and shakes it, then inverts the bush, leaving the plant upside down on the ground to keep the peanuts out of the soil. This allows the peanuts to dry slowly to a little less than a third of their original moisture level over a period of three to four days. Traditionally, peanuts were pulled and inverted by hand.\\r\\nAfter the peanuts have dried sufficiently, they are threshed, removing the peanut pods from the rest of the bush.[25] It is particularly important that peanuts are dried properly and stored in dry conditions. If they are too high in moisture, or if storage conditions are poor, they may become infected by the mold fungus Aspergillus flavus. Many strains of this fungus release toxic and highly carcinogenic substances called aflatoxins.\\r\\nThere are many peanut cultivars grown around the world. The market classes grown in the United States are Spanish, Runner, Virginia, and Valencia.[27] Peanuts produced in the United States are divided into three major areas: the southeastern United States region which includes Alabama, Georgia, and Florida; the southwestern United States region which includes New Mexico, Oklahoma, and Texas; and the third region in the general eastern United States which include Virginia, North Carolina, and South Carolina.[27]\\r\\nCertain cultivar groups are preferred for particular characteristics, such as differences in flavor, oil content, size, shape, and disease resistance.[26] Most peanuts marketed in the shell are of the Virginia type, along with some Valencias selected for large size and the attractive appearance of the shell. Spanish peanuts are used mostly for peanut candy, salted nuts, and peanut butter.\\r\\nThe small Spanish types are grown in South Africa, and in the southwestern and southeastern US. Prior to 1940, 90% of the peanuts grown in Georgia, USA, were Spanish types, but the trend since then has been larger-seeded, higher-yielding, more disease-resistant cultivars. Spanish peanuts have a higher oil content than other types of peanuts. In the United States, the Spanish group is primarily grown in New Mexico, Oklahoma, and Texas.[27]\\r\\nCultivars of the Spanish group include 'Dixie Spanish', 'Improved Spanish 2B', 'GFA Spanish', 'Argentine', 'Spantex', 'Spanette', 'Shaffers Spanish', 'Natal Common (Spanish)', \\"White Kernel Varieties', 'Starr', 'Comet', 'Florispan', 'Spanhoma', 'Spancross', 'OLin', 'Tamspan 90', 'AT 9899ÿ14', 'Spanco', 'Wilco I', 'GG 2', 'GG 4', 'TMV 2', and 'Tamnut 06'.\\r\\nSince 1940, the southeastern US region has seen a shift to production of Runner group peanuts. This shift is due to good flavor, better roasting characteristics and higher yields when compared to Spanish types, leading to food manufacturers' preference for the use in peanut butter and salted nuts. Georgia's production is now almost 100% Runner type.[26]\\r\\nCultivars of Runners include 'Southeastern Runner 56-15', 'Dixie Runner', 'Early Runner', 'Virginia Bunch 67', 'Bradford Runner', 'Egyptian Giant' (also known as 'Virginia Bunch' and 'Giant'), 'Rhodesian Spanish Bunch' (Valencia and Virginia Bunch), 'North Carolina Runner 56-15', 'Florunner', 'Virugard', 'Georgia Green', 'Tamrun 96', 'Flavor Runner 458', 'Tamrun OL01', 'Tamrun OL02' 'AT-120', 'Andru-93', 'Southern Runner', 'AT1-1', 'Georgia Brown', 'GK-7', and 'AT-108'.\\r\\nThe large-seeded Virginia group peanuts are grown in the US states of Virginia, North Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, New Mexico, Oklahoma, and parts of Georgia. They are increasing in popularity due to demand for large peanuts for processing, particularly for salting, confections, and roasting in the shells.\\r\\nVirginia group peanuts are either bunch or running in growth habit. The bunch type is upright to spreading. It attains a height of 45 to 55?cm (18 to 22?in), and a spread of 70 to 80?cm (28 to 31?in), with 80-to-90?cm (31-to-35?in) rows that seldom cover the ground. The pods are borne within 5 to 10?cm of the base of the plant.\\r\\nCultivars of Virginia type peanuts include 'NC 7', 'NC 9', 'NC 10C', 'NC-V 11', 'VA 93B', 'NC 12C', 'VA-C 92R', 'Gregory', 'VA 98R', 'Perry', 'Wilson, 'Hull', 'AT VC-2' and' Shulamit'.\\r\\nValencia group peanuts are coarse, and they have heavy reddish stems and large foliage. In the United States, large commercial production is primarily in the South Plains of West Texas and eastern New Mexico near and south of Portales, New Mexico, but they are grown on a small scale elsewhere in the South as the best-flavored and preferred type for boiled peanuts[by whom?]. They are comparatively tall, having a height of 125?cm (49?in) and a spread of 75?cm (30?in). Peanut pods are borne on pegs arising from the main stem and the side branches. Most of the pods are clustered around the base of the plant, and only a few are found several inches away. Valencia types are three- to five-seeded and smooth, with no constriction of the shell between the seeds. Seeds are oval and tightly crowded into the pods. Typical seed weight is 0.4 to 0.5?g. This type is used heavily for sale roasted and salted in-shell peanuts and peanut butter. Varieties include 'Valencia A' and 'Valencia C'.\\r\\nThese are alike, except for the color of the seed. Sometimes known also as Texas Red or White, the plants are similar to Valencia types, except the stems are green to greenish brown, and the pods are rough, irregular, and have a smaller proportion of kernels.\\r\\nIn 2014, world production of peanuts (in shells) was 43.9 million tonnes, led by China with 38% of the global total followed by India (15%) (table). Other significant producers were Nigeria, the United States, and Sudan. Major exporters in 2013 were India with 541,337 tonnes, which accounts for 32% of world total exports (1.7 million tonnes), and the United States with 19% of total exports.[28] The European Union imported 52% of the world supply of shelled peanuts in 2013, with the Netherlands alone accounting for 40% of the European total.[28]\\r\\nIn the United States, Georgia is the leading peanut-producing state, followed by Texas and Alabama, respectively.[29] About half of all peanuts produced in the US are grown within a 100?mi (160?km) radius of Dothan, Alabama.[30] Dothan is home to the National Peanut Festival established in 1938 and held each fall to honor peanut growers and celebrate the harvest.[31]\\r\\nPeanut oil is often used in cooking, because it has a mild flavor and a relatively high smoke point. Due to its high monounsaturated content, it is considered healthier than saturated oils, and is resistant to rancidity. The several types of peanut oil include: aromatic roasted peanut oil, refined peanut oil, extra virgin or cold-pressed peanut oil, and peanut extract. In the United States, refined peanut oil is exempt from allergen labeling laws.[32]\\r\\nPeanut flour is lower in fat than peanut butter, and has high protein content making it suitable as a flavor enhancer.[citation needed] Peanut flour is used as a gluten-free solution.\\r\\nBoiled peanuts are a popular snack in the southern United States, as well as in India, China, and West Africa. In the US South, boiled peanuts are often prepared in briney water, and sold in streetside stands.\\r\\nDry peanuts can be roasted in the shell or shelled in a home oven if spread out one layer deep in a pan and baked at a temperature of 350?F or 177?C for 15 to 20 min (shelled) and 20 to 25 min (in shell).\\r\\nPeanuts are particularly common in Peruvian and Mexican cuisine, both of which marry indigenous and European ingredients. For instance, in Peru, a popular traditional dish is picante de cuy,[33] a roasted guinea pig served in a sauce of ground peanuts (ingredients native to South America) with roasted onions and garlic (ingredients from European cuisine). Also, in the city of Arequipa in Peru, a well known dish called ocopa consists of a smooth sauce of roasted peanuts and hot peppers (both native to the region) with roasted onions, garlic, and oil, poured over meat or potatoes.[34] Another example is a fricassee combining a similar mixture with sauted seafood or boiled and shredded chicken. These dishes are generally known as ajes, meaning \\"hot peppers\\", such as aj de pollo and aj de mariscos (seafood ajes may omit peanuts). Likewise, during colonial times, the Spanish in Peru used peanuts to replace nuts unavailable in Peru, but used extensively in Spanish cuisine, such as almonds, pine nuts, and other nuts, typically ground or as paste and mixed with rice, meats, and vegetables for dishes such as rice pilaf.\\r\\nThroughout the region, many candies and snacks are made using peanuts as a base.\\r\\nCrunchy coated peanuts, called kabukim in Hebrew, are a popular snack in Israel. Kabukim are commonly sold by weight at corner stores where fresh nuts and seeds are sold, though they are also available packaged. The coating typically consists of flour, salt, starch, lecithin, and sometimes sesame seeds. The origin of the name is obscure (it may be derived from kabuk which means nutshell or husk in Turkish). An additional variety of crunchy coated peanuts popular in Israel is \\"American peanuts\\". The coating of this variety is thinner, but harder to crack.\\r\\nBamba puffs are a popular snack in the Middle East. Their shape is similar to Cheez Doodles, but are made of corn and flavored with peanut butter.\\r\\nPeanuts are also widely used in Southeast Asian cuisine, such as in Malaysia, Vietnam, and Indonesia, where they are typically made into a spicy sauce. Peanuts originally came to Indonesia from the Philippines, where the legume came from Mexico in times of Spanish colonization. One of the most famous Philippine dishes using peanuts is kare-kare, a mixture of meat and peanut butter.\\r\\nCommon Indonesian peanut-based dishes include gado-gado, pecel, karedok, and ketoprak, all vegetable salads mixed with peanut sauce, and the peanut-based sauce for satay.\\r\\nIn the Indian subcontinent, peanuts are known as a light snack by themselves, usually roasted and salted (sometimes with the addition of chilli powder), and often sold roasted in pod, or boiled with salt. They are also made into little dessert or sweet snack pieces by processing with refined sugar and jaggery. Indian cuisine uses roasted, crushed peanuts to give a crunchy body to salads; they are added whole (without pods) to leafy vegetable stews for the same reason. Another use of peanut oil as cooking oil. Most Indians use mustard, sunflower, and peanut oil for cooking. In South india, groundnut 'chutney' is a popular combination, usually partaken with dosa and idli at breakfast.\\r\\nPeanuts grow well in southern Mali and adjacent regions of the Ivory Coast, Burkina Faso, Ghana, Nigeria, and Senegal; peanuts are similar in both agricultural and culinary qualities to the Bambara groundnut native to the region, and West Africans have adopted the crop as a staple. Peanut sauce, prepared with onions, garlic, peanut butter/paste, and vegetables such as carrots, cabbage, and cauliflower, can be vegetarian (the peanuts supplying ample protein) or prepared with meat, usually chicken.\\r\\nPeanuts are used in the Malian meat stew maafe. In Ghana, peanut butter is used for peanut butter soup nkate nkwan.[35] Crushed peanuts may also be used for peanut candies nkate cake and kuli-kuli, as well as other local foods such as oto.[35] Peanut butter is also an ingredient in Nigeria's \\"African salad\\".\\r\\nPeanut powder is an important ingredient in the spicy coating for kebabs in Nigeria and Ghana.\\r\\nPeanuts are a common ingredient of several types of relishes (dishes which accompany nshima) eaten by the tribes in Malawi and in the eastern part of Zambia, and these dishes are now common throughout both countries. Thick peanut butter sauces are also made in Uganda to go with rice and other starchy foods. Groundnut stew, locally called ebinyebwa in Uganda, is made by boiling ground peanut flour with other ingredients, such as cabbage, mushrooms, dried fish, meat or other vegetables.[36] Across East Africa, roasted peanuts, often in cones of newspaper, are a popular snack sold in the street.\\r\\nIn Canada and the US, peanuts are used in candies, cakes, cookies, and other sweets. They are also enjoyed roasted and salted. Peanut butter is one of the most popular peanut-based foods in the US, and recipes for peanut soup are present in the United States south, Virginia in particular. In some southern portions of the US, peanuts are boiled for several hours until soft and moist. Peanuts are also deep-fried, shell and all.\\r\\nPeanuts are used to help fight malnutrition. Plumpy Nut, MANA Nutrition,[37] and Medika Mamba[38] are high-protein, high-energy, and high-nutrient peanut-based pastes developed to be used as a therapeutic food to aid in famine relief. The World Health Organization, UNICEF, Project Peanut Butter, and Doctors Without Borders have used these products to help save malnourished children in developing countries.\\r\\nPeanuts can be used like other legumes and grains to make a lactose-free, milk-like beverage, peanut milk, which is promoted in Africa as a way to reduce malnutrition among children.\\r\\nPeanut plant tops and crop residues can be used for hay.[39]\\r\\nThe protein cake (oilcake meal) residue from oil processing is used as an animal feed and as a soil fertilizer. Groundnut cake is a livestock feed, mostly used by cattle as protein supplements.[40] It is one of the most important and valuable feed for all types of livestocks and one of the most active ingredient for poultry rations.[41] Poor storage of the cake may sometimes results in its contamination by aflatoxin, a naturally occurring mycotoxin that is produced by Aspergillus flavus and Aspergillus parasiticus.[42] The major constituents of the cake are essential amino acids such as lysine and glutamine. Other components are crude fiber, crude protein, and fat.[43]\\r\\nSome peanuts can also be fed whole to livestock, for example those in excess of the peanut quota in the USA, or those with a higher aflatoxin content than that permitted by the food regulations.[44]\\r\\nPeanut processing often requires dehulling: the hulls generated in large amounts by the peanut industries can then be used to feed livestock, particularly ruminants.[45]\\r\\nPeanuts have a variety of industrial end uses. Paint, varnish, lubricating oil, leather dressings, furniture polish, insecticides, and nitroglycerin are made from peanut oil. Soap is made from saponified oil, and many cosmetics contain peanut oil and its derivatives. The protein portion is used in the manufacture of some textile fibers. Peanut shells are used in the manufacture of plastic, wallboard, abrasives, fuel, cellulose (used in rayon and paper), and mucilage (glue).\\r\\nPeanuts are rich in essential nutrients (right table, USDA nutrient data). In a 100 g serving, peanuts provide 570 calories and are an excellent source (defined as more than 20% of the Daily Value, DV) of several B vitamins, vitamin E, several dietary minerals, such as manganese (95% DV), magnesium (52% DV) and phosphorus (48% DV), and dietary fiber (right table). They also contain about 25 g protein per 100 g serving, a higher proportion than in many tree nuts.[46]\\r\\nSome studies show that regular consumption of peanuts is associated with a lower risk of mortality specifically from certain diseases.[47][48] However, the study designs do not allow cause and effect to be inferred. According to the US Food and Drug Administration, \\"Scientific evidence suggests but does not prove that eating 1.5 ounces per day of most nuts (such as peanuts) as part of a diet low in saturated fat and cholesterol may reduce the risk of heart disease.\\"[49]\\r\\nPeanuts contain polyphenols, polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fats, phytosterols and dietary fiber in amounts similar to several tree nuts.[48]\\r\\nPeanut skins contain resveratrol which is under preliminary research for its potential effects in humans.[50][51]\\r\\nA common cooking and salad oil, peanut oil is 46% monounsaturated fats (primarily oleic acid), 32% polyunsaturated fats (primarily linoleic acid), and 17% saturated fats (primarily palmitic acid).[52][53] Extractable from whole peanuts using a simple water and centrifugation method, the oil is being considered by NASA's Advanced Life Support program for future long-duration human space missions.[54]\\r\\nPeanuts are one of eight foods responsible for more than 90 percent of food allergies, including cow's milk, eggs, wheat, and peanuts.[55] Some adults (0.6% of the United States population)[55] report that they experience mild to severe allergic reactions to peanut exposure; symptoms can range from watery eyes to anaphylactic shock, which can be fatal if untreated.[55] For these individuals, eating a small amount of peanut can cause a reaction. Because of their widespread use in prepared and packaged foods, the avoidance of peanuts is difficult. Some foods processed in facilities which also handle peanuts may carry such warnings on their labels. In some 22% of maturing children with peanut sensitivity, the allergy can be outgrown, and people with a history of peanut allergy have a 50% chance of the allergy disappearing.[55]\\r\\nThe hygiene hypothesis of allergy states that a lack of early childhood exposure to infectious agents like germs and parasites could be causing the increase of food allergies.[56]\\r\\nStudies comparing age of peanut introduction in the UK with introduction in Israel showed that delaying exposure to peanuts in childhood can dramatically increase the risk of developing peanut allergies.[57][58]\\r\\nPeanut allergy has been associated with the use of skin preparations containing peanut oil among children, but the evidence is not regarded as conclusive.[59] Peanut allergies have also been associated with family history and intake of soy products.[59]\\r\\nSome school districts in the United States and elsewhere have banned peanuts.[60][61][62] However, the efficacy of the bans in reducing allergic reactions is uncertain. A recent study in Canada has shown that there is no difference in the percentage of accidental exposures occurring in schools prohibiting peanuts than in schools allowing them.[63]\\r\\nRefined peanut oil will not cause allergic reactions in most people with peanut allergies.[64] However, crude (unrefined) peanut oils have been shown to contain protein, which may cause allergic reactions.[65] In a randomized, double-blind crossover study, 60 people with proven peanut allergy were challenged with both crude peanut oil and refined peanut oil. The authors concluded, \\"Crude peanut oil caused allergic reactions in 10% of allergic subjects studied and should continue to be avoided.\\" They also stated, \\"Refined peanut oil does not seem to pose a risk to most people with peanut allergy.\\" However, they point out that refined peanut oil can still pose a risk to peanut-allergic individuals if oil that has previously been used to cook foods containing peanuts is reused.[66]\\r\\nIf peanut plants are subjected to severe drought during pod formation, or if pods are not properly stored, they may become contaminated with the mold Aspergillus flavus which may produce carcinogenic substances called aflatoxins. Lower-quality peanuts, particularly where mold is evident, are more likely to be contaminated.[67] The United States Department of Agriculture tests every truckload of raw peanuts for aflatoxin; any containing aflatoxin levels of more than 15 parts per billion are destroyed. The peanut industry has manufacturing steps in place to ensure all peanuts are inspected for aflatoxin.[68]\\r\\nA warning sign for the presence of peanuts and peanut dust\\r\\nArachis hypogaea flower\\r\\nPeanut pegs penetrating the ground\\r\\nDeveloping pods of Peanut\\r\\nTrack-type peanut harvester\\r\\nHarvesting peanuts\\r\\nA bowl of sev mamra, consisting of puffed rice, peanuts and fried seasoned noodles\\r\\nPeanut sweet known as chikki made from peanuts and jaggery","input":"Is a peanut a bean or a nut?"},{"output":"may be mounted on a stand or bolted to the floor or workbench","context":"A drill is a tool fitted with a cutting tool attachment or driving tool attachment, usually a drill bit or driver bit, used for making holes in various materials or driving screws. The attachment is gripped by a chuck at one end of the drill and rotated while pressed against the target material. The tip, and sometimes edges, of the cutting tool does the work of cutting into the target material. This may be slicing off thin shavings (twist drills or auger bits), grinding off small particles (oil drilling), crushing and removing pieces of the workpiece (SDS masonry drill), countersinking, counterboring, or other operations.\\r\\n\\r\\nDrills are commonly used in woodworking, metalworking, construction and do-it-yourself projects. Specially designed drills are also used in medicine, space missions and other applications.  Drills are available with a wide variety of performance characteristics, such as power and capacity.\\r\\n\\r\\nAround 35,000 BC, Homo sapiens discovered the benefits of the application of rotary tools. This would have rudimentarily consisted of a pointed rock being spun between the hands to bore a hole through another material.[1] This led to the hand drill, a smooth stick, that was sometimes attached to flint point, and was rubbed between the palms. This was used by many ancient civilizations around the world including the Mayans.[2] The earliest perforated artifacts, such as bone, ivory, shells and antlers found, are from the Upper Paleolithic era.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nBow drill  (strap-drills) are the first machine drills, as they convert a back and forth motion to a rotary motion, and they can be traced back to around 10,000 years ago. It was discovered that tying a cord around a stick, and then attaching the ends of the string to the ends of a stick(a bow), allowed a user to drill quicker and more efficiently.  Mainly used to create fire, bow-drills were also used in ancient woodwork, stonework and dentistry.  Archaeologists discovered a Neolithic grave yard in Mehrgrath, Pakistan dating from the time of the Harappans, around 7,500ÿ9,000 years ago,  containing 9 adult bodies with a total of 11 teeth that had been drilled.[4] There are hieroglyphs depicting Egyptian carpenters and bead makers in a tomb at Thebes using bow-drills. The earliest evidence of these tools being used in Egypt dates back to around 2500 BCE.[5] The usage of bow-drills was widely spread through Europe, Africa, Asia and North America, during ancient times and is still used today. Over the years many slight variations of bow and strap drills have developed for the various uses of either boring through materials or lighting fires.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe core drill was developed in ancient Egypt by 3000 BC(5016 years before now).[6] The pump drill was invented during Roman times. It consists of a vertical spindle aligned by a piece of horizontal wood and a flywheel to maintain accuracy and momentum.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe hollow-borer tip, first used around the 13th century, consisted of a stick with a tubular shaped piece of metal on the end, such as copper. This allowed a hole to be drilled while only actually grinding the outer section of it. This completely separates the inner stone or wood from the rest, allowing the drill to pulverize less material to create a similarly sized hole.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile the pump-drill and the bow-drill were used in Western Civilization to bore smaller holes for a larger part of human history, the Auger was used to drill larger holes starting sometime between Roman and Medieval ages.[9] The auger allowed for more torque for larger holes. It is uncertain when the Brace and Bit was invented; however, the earliest picture found so far dates from the 15th century.[9] It is a type of hand crank drill that consists of two parts as seen in the picture. The brace, on the upper half, is where the user holds and turns it and on the lower part is the bit. The bit is interchangeable as bits wear down. The auger uses a rotating helical screw similar to the Archimedean screw-shaped bit that is common today. The gimlet is also worth mentioning as it is a scaled down version of an auger.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the East, churn drills were invented as early as 221 BC during the Chinese Qin Dynasty,[10] capable of reaching a depth of 1500 m.[6] Churn drills in ancient China were built of wood and labor-intensive, but were able to go through solid rock.[11] The churn drill appears in Europe during the 12th century.[6] In 1835 Isaac Singer is reported to have built a steam powered churn drill based off the method the Chinese used.[12] Also worth briefly discussing are the early  drill presses; they were machine tools that derived from bow-drills but were powered by windmills and water wheels. Drill presses consisted of the powered drills that could be raised or lowered into a material, allowing for less force by the user.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next great advancement in drilling technology, the electric motor, led to the invention of the electric drill. It is credited to Arthur James Arnot  and William Blanch Brain of Melbourne, Australia who patented the electric drill in 1889.[13] In 1895, the first portable handheld drill was created by brothers Wilhem & Carl Fein of Stuttgart, Germany. In 1917 the first trigger-switch, pistol-grip portable drill was patented by Black & Decker.[14] This was the start of the modern drill era. Over the last century the electric drill has been created in a variety of types and multiple sizes for an assortment of specific uses.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are many types of drills: some are powered manually, others use electricity (electric drill) or compressed air (pneumatic drill) as the motive power, and a minority are driven by an internal combustion engine (for example, earth drilling augers). Drills with a percussive action (hammer drills) are mostly used in hard materials such as masonry (brick, concrete and stone) or rock. Drilling rigs are used to bore holes in the earth to obtain water or oil.  Oil wells, water wells, or holes for geothermal heating are created with large drilling rigs. Some types of hand-held drills are also used to drive screws and other fasteners. Some small appliances that have no motor of their own may be drill-powered, such as small pumps, grinders, etc.\\r\\n\\r\\nA variety of hand-powered drills have been employed over the centuries.  Here are a few, starting with approximately the oldest:\\r\\n\\r\\nDrills with pistol grips are the most common type in use today, and are available in a huge variety of subtypes. A less common type is the right-angle drill, a special tool used by tradesmen such as plumbers and electricians. The motor used in corded drills is often a universal motor due to its high power to weight ratio.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor much of the 20th century, many attachments could commonly be purchased to convert corded electric hand drills into a range of other power tools, such as orbital sanders and power saws, more cheaply than purchasing conventional, self-contained versions of those tools  (the greatest saving being the lack of an additional electric motor for each device).  As the prices of power tools and suitable electric motors have fallen, however, such attachments have become much less common.  A similar practice is currently employed for cordless tools where the battery, the most expensive component, is shared between various motorised devices, as opposed to a single electric motor being shared between mechanical attachments.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe hammer drill is similar to a standard electric drill, with the exception that it is provided with a hammer action for drilling masonry. The hammer action may be engaged or disengaged as required. Most electric hammer drills are rated (input power) at between 600 and 1100 watts. The efficiency is usually 50-60% i.e. 1000 watts of input is converted into 500-600 watts of output (rotation of the drill and hammering action).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe hammer action is provided by two cam plates that make the chuck rapidly pulse forward and backward as the drill spins on its axis. This pulsing (hammering) action is measured in Blows Per Minute (BPM) with 10,000 or more BPMs being common. Because the combined mass of the chuck and bit is comparable to that of the body of the drill, the energy transfer is inefficient and can sometimes make it difficult for larger bits to penetrate harder materials such as poured concrete. The operator experiences considerable vibration, and the cams are generally made from hardened steel to avoid them wearing out quickly. In practice, drills are restricted to standard masonry bits up to 13?mm (1/2?inch) in diameter.  A typical application for a hammer drill is installing electrical boxes, conduit straps or shelves in concrete.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn contrast to the cam-type hammer drill, a rotary/pneumatic hammer drill accelerates only the bit. This is accomplished through a piston design, rather than a spinning cam.  Rotary hammers have much less vibration and penetrate most building materials. They can also be used as \\"drill only\\" or as \\"hammer only\\" which extends their usefulness for tasks such as chipping brick or concrete. Hole drilling progress is greatly superior to cam-type hammer drills, and these drills are generally used for holes of 19?mm (3/4?inch) or greater in size.  A typical application for a rotary hammer drill is boring large holes for lag bolts in foundations, or installing large lead anchors in concrete for handrails or benches.\\r\\n\\r\\nA standard hammer drill accepts 6?mm (1/4?inch) and 13?mm (1/2?inch) drill bits, while a rotary hammer uses SDS or Spline Shank bits.  These heavy bits are adept at pulverising the masonry and drill into this hard material with relative ease.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, there is a big difference in cost. In the UK a cam hammer typically costs S12 or more, while a rotary/pneumatic costs S35 or more. In the US a typical hammer drill costs between $70 and $120, and a rotary hammer between $150 and $500 (depending on bit size). For DIY use or to drill holes less than 13?mm (1/2?inch) in size, the hammer drill is most commonly used.\\r\\n\\r\\nA magnetic drilling machine is a portable drilling machine for drilling holes in large and heavy workpieces which are difficult to move or bring to the stationary conventional drilling machine. It has a magnetic base and drills holes with the help of cutting tools like annular cutters (broach cutters) or with twist drill bits. There are various types  depending on their operations and specializations like magnetic drilling cum tapping machines, cordless, pneumatic, compact horizontal, automatic feed, cross table base etc.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is also commonly known as a magnetic core drilling machine, magnetic base drilling machine, mag base drilling machine, mag base, magnetic broach cutter machine, magnetic drill or mag drill.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe rotary hammer drill (also known as a rotary hammer, roto hammer drill or masonry drill) combines a primary dedicated hammer mechanism with a separate rotation mechanism, and is used for more substantial material such as masonry or concrete. Generally, standard chucks and drills are inadequate and chucks such as SDS and carbide drills that have been designed to withstand the percussive forces are used. Some styles of this tool are intended for masonry drilling only and the hammer action cannot be disengaged. Other styles allow the drill to be used without the hammer action for normal drilling, or hammering to be used without rotation for chiselling. In 1813 Richard Trevithick designed a steam-driven rotary drill, also the first drill to be powered by steam.[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nA cordless drill is an electric drill which uses rechargeable batteries. These drills are available with similar features to an AC mains-powered drill. These are the most common type of drill. They are available in the hammer drill configuration and most have a clutch, which aids in driving screws into various substrates while not damaging them. Also available are right angle drills, which allow a worker to drive screws in a tight space. While 21st century battery innovations allow significantly more drilling, large diameter holes (typically 12ÿ25?mm (0.5ÿ1.0?in) or larger) may drain current cordless drills quickly.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor continuous use, a worker will have one or more spare battery packs charging while drilling, and quickly swap them instead of having to wait an hour or more for recharging, although there are now Rapid Charge Batteries that can charge in 10ÿ15 minutes.\\r\\n\\r\\nEarly cordless drills used interchangeable 7.2?V battery packs. Over the years battery voltages have increased, with 18?V drills being most common, but higher voltages are available, such as 24?V, 28?V, and 36?V. This allows these tools to produce as much torque as some corded drills.\\r\\n\\r\\nCommon battery types of are nickel-cadmium (NiCd) batteries and lithium-ion batteries, with each holding about half the market share. NiCd batteries have been around longer, so they are less expensive (their main advantage), but have more disadvantages compared to lithium-ion batteries. NiCd disadvantages are limited life, self-discharging, environment problems upon disposal, and eventually internally short circuiting due to dendrite growth. Lithium-ion batteries are becoming more common because of their short charging time, longer life, absence of memory effect, and low weight. Instead of charging a tool for an hour to get 20 minutes of use, 20 minutes of charge can run the tool for an hour. Lithium-ion batteries also hold a charge for a significantly longer time than nickel-cadmium batteries, about two years if not used, vs. 1 to 4 months for a nickel-cadmium battery.\\r\\n\\r\\nA drill press (also known as a pedestal drill, pillar drill, or bench drill) is a fixed style of drill that may be mounted on a stand or bolted to the floor or workbench. Portable models with a magnetic base grip the steel workpieces they drill. A drill press consists of a base, column (or pillar), table, spindle (or quill), and drill head, usually driven by an induction motor. The head has a set of handles (usually 3) radiating from a central hub that, when turned, move the spindle and chuck vertically, parallel to the axis of the column. The drill press is typically measured in terms of swing.  Swing is defined as twice the throat distance, which is the distance from the center of the spindle to the closest edge of the pillar. For example, a 16-inch (410?mm) drill press has an 8-inch (200?mm) throat distance.\\r\\n\\r\\nA drill press has a number of advantages over a hand-held drill:\\r\\n\\r\\nFor most drill pressesespecially those meant for woodworking or home usespeed change is achieved by manually moving a belt across a stepped pulley arrangement. Some drill presses add a third stepped pulley to increase the number of available speeds. Modern drill presses can, however, use a variable-speed motor in conjunction with the stepped-pulley system.  Medium-duty drill presses such as those used in machine shop (tool room) applications are equipped with a continuously variable transmission.  This mechanism is based on variable-diameter pulleys driving a wide, heavy-duty belt.  This gives a wide speed range as well as the ability to change speed while the machine is running.  Heavy-duty drill presses used for metalworking are usually of the gear-head type described below.\\r\\n\\r\\nDrill presses are often used for miscellaneous workshop tasks other than drilling holes.  This includes sanding, honing, and polishing.  These tasks can be performed by mounting sanding drums, honing wheels and various other rotating accessories in the chuck.  This can be unsafe in some cases, as the chuck arbor, which may be retained in the spindle solely by the friction of a taper fit, may dislodge during operation if the side loads are too high.\\r\\n\\r\\nA geared head drill press is a drill press in which power transmission from the motor to the spindle is achieved solely through spur gearing inside the machine's head.  No friction elements (e.g., belts) of any kind are used, which assures a positive drive at all times and minimizes maintenance requirements.  Gear head drills are intended for metalworking applications where the drilling forces are higher and the desired speed (RPM) is lower than that used for woodworking.\\r\\n\\r\\nLevers attached to one side of the head are used to select different gear ratios to change the spindle speed, usually in conjunction with a two- or three-speed motor (this varies with the material).  Most machines of this type are designed to be operated on three-phase electric power and are generally of more rugged construction than equivalently sized belt-driven units.  Virtually all examples have geared racks for adjusting the table and head position on the column.\\r\\n\\r\\nGeared head drill presses are commonly found in tool rooms and other commercial environments where a heavy duty machine capable of production drilling and quick setup changes is required.  In most cases, the spindle is machined to accept Morse taper tooling for greater flexibility.  Larger geared head drill presses are frequently fitted with power feed on the quill mechanism, with an arrangement to disengage the feed when a certain drill depth has been achieved or in the event of excessive travel.  Some gear-head drill presses have the ability to perform tapping operations without the need for an external tapping attachment. This feature is commonplace on larger gear head drill presses.  A clutch mechanism drives the tap into the part under power and then backs it out of the threaded hole once the proper depth is reached.  Coolant systems are also common on these machines to prolong tool life under production conditions.\\r\\n\\r\\nA radial arm drill press is a large geared head drill press in which the head can be moved along an arm that radiates from the machine's column.  As it is possible to swing the arm relative to the machine's base, a radial arm drill press is able to operate over a large area without having to reposition the workpiece.  This saves considerable time because it is much faster to reposition the drill head than it is to unclamp, move, and then re-clamp the workpiece to the table.  The size of work that can be handled may be considerable, as the arm can swing out of the way of the table, allowing an overhead crane or derrick to place a bulky workpiece on the table or base. A vise may be used with a radial arm drill press, but more often the workpiece is secured directly to the table or base, or is held in a fixture.  Power spindle feed is nearly universal with these machines and coolant systems are common.  Larger size machines often have power feed motors for elevating or moving the arm.  The biggest radial arm drill presses are able to drill holes as large as four inches (101.6 millimeters) diameter in solid steel or cast iron.  Radial arm drills are specified by the diameter of the column and the length of the arm.  The length of the arm is usually the same as the maximum throat distance.  The Radial Arm Drill pictured in this article is a 9-inch column x 3-foot arm.  The maximum throat distance of this drill would be approximately 36\\", giving a swing of 72\\" (6 feet)..\\r\\n\\r\\nMill drills are a lighter alternative to a milling machine. They combine a drill press (belt driven) with the X/Y coordinate abilities of the milling machine's table and a locking collet that ensures that the cutting tool will not fall from the spindle when lateral forces are experienced against the bit. Although they are light in construction, they have the advantages of being space-saving and versatile as well as inexpensive, being suitable for light machining that may otherwise not be affordable.\\r\\n\\r\\nA woodworkers brace has a U formed wrench/outline that is utilized to transform the hurl and drill into wood. The breadth handle of a brace gives more use which enables the brace to create more torque than a hand drill. The scope handle of a brace causes it to produce more torque than a hand drill, because of it having a more prominent separation from the focal point of revolution so giving more use than the turning handle of a hand drill . Wood screw bits can be utilized with a brace to drill vast distance across gaps.\\r\\nThe more noteworthy torque connected to the bit in the hurl improves braces suited than hand drills for use with a twist drill bit for drilling huge distance across gaps in the wood. Selection of screwdriver bits that can be utilized with a brace to drive screws into or expel them from a workpiece.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlso called the rotational hammer drill, an SDS (Self Direct System) drill is perfect for drilling through stonework and cement. They have a hammer work that beats the drill bit as it pivots, helping them travel through the denser materials. Also, you can isolate out the pivot from this hammer work, enabling you to just drill through lighter materials. Or, on the other hand, you can kill the pivot and utilize an etch bit to help wear down your block or solid dividers ÿ this is useful if you have to make a station in a divider to shroud wires or links.[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nDrills are often used simply as motors to drive a variety of applications, in much the same way that tractors with generic PTOs are used to power ploughs, mowers, trailers, etc.\\r\\n\\r\\nAccessories available for drills include:\\r\\n\\r\\nDrilling capacity indicates the maximum diameter a given power drill or drill press can produce in a certain material.  It is essentially a proxy for the continuous torque the machine is capable of producing.  Typically a given drill will have its capacity specified for different materials,  i.e., 10mm for steel, 25mm for wood, etc.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor example, the maximum recommended capacities for the DeWalt DCD790 cordless drill for specific drill bit types and materials are as follows:[17]","input":"What is a bench drill press used for?"},{"output":"Robert Hooke,","context":"In biology, cell theory is the historic scientific theory, now universally accepted, that living organisms are made up of cells. Cells are the basic unit of structure in all organisms and also the basic unit of reproduction. With continual improvements made to microscopes over time, magnification technology advanced enough to discover cells in the 17th century. This discovery is largely attributed to Robert Hooke, and began the scientific study of cells, also known as cell biology. Over a century later, many debates about cells began amongst scientists. Most of these debates involved the nature of cellular regeneration, and the idea of cells as a fundamental unit of life. Cell theory was eventually formulated in 1839. This is usually credited to Matthias Schleiden and Theodor Schwann. However, many other scientists like Rudolf Virchow contributed to the theory.\\r\\nThe three tenets to the cell theory are as described below:\\r\\nThe first of these tenets is disputed, as non-cellular entities such as viruses are sometimes considered life-forms.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe discovery of the cell was made possible through the invention of the microscope. In the first century BC, Romans were able to make glass, discovering that objects appeared to be larger under the glass. In Italy during the 12th century, Salvino DArmate made a piece of glass fit over one eye, allowing for a magnification effect to that eye. The expanded use of lenses in eyeglasses in the 13th century probably led to wider spread use of simple microscopes (magnifying glasses) with limited magnification.[2] Compound microscope, which combine an objective lens with an eyepiece to view a real image achieving much higher magnification, first appeared in Europe around 1620[3][4] In 1665, Robert Hooke used a microscope about six inches long with two convex lenses inside and examined specimens under reflected light for the observations in his book Micrographia. Hooke also used a simpler microscope with a single lens for examining specimens with directly transmitted light, because this allowed for a clearer image.[5]\\r\\nExtensive microscopic study was done by Anton van Leeuwenhoek, a draper who took the interest in microscopes after seeing one while on an apprenticeship in Amsterdam in 1648. At some point in his life before 1668, he was able to learn how to grind lenses. This eventually led to Leeuwenhoek making his own unique microscope. His were a single lens simple microscope, rather than a compound microscope. This was because he was able to use a single lens that was a small glass sphere but allowed for a magnification of 270x. This was a large progression since the magnification before was only a maximum of 50x. After Leeuwenhoek, there was not much progress for the microscopes until the 1850s, two hundred years later. Carl Zeiss, a German engineer who manufactured microscopes, began to make changes to the lenses used. But the optical quality did not improve until the 1880s when he hired Otto Schott and eventually Ernst Abbe.[6]\\r\\nOptical microscopes can focus on objects the size of a wavelength or larger, giving restrictions still to advancement in discoveries with objects smaller than the wavelengths of visible light. Later in the 1920s, the electron microscope was developed, making it possible to view objects that are smaller than optical wavelengths, once again, changing the possibilities in science.[6]\\r\\nThe cell was first discovered by Robert Hooke in 1665, which can be found to be described in his book Micrographia. In this book, he gave 60 observations in detail of various objects under a coarse, compound microscope.[5] One observation was from very thin slices of bottle cork. Hooke discovered a multitude of tiny pores that he named \\"cells\\". This came from the Latin word Cella, meaning a small room like monks lived in and also Cellulae, which meant the six sided cell of a honeycomb. However, Hooke did not know their real structure or function.[7] What Hooke had thought were cells, were actually empty cell walls of plant tissues. With microscopes during this time having a low magnification, Hooke was unable to see that there were other internal components to the cells he was observing. Therefore, he did not think the \\"cellulae\\" were alive.[8] His cell observations gave no indication of the nucleus and other organelles found in most living cells. In Micrographia, Hooke also observed mould, bluish in color, found on leather. After studying it under his microscope, he was unable to observe seeds that would have indicated how the mould was multiplying in quantity. This led to Hooke suggesting that spontaneous generation, from either natural or artificial heat, was the cause. Since this was an old Aristotelian theory still accepted at the time, others did not reject it and was not disproved until Leeuwenhoek later discovers generation is achieved otherwise.[5]\\r\\nAnton van Leeuwenhoek is another scientist who saw these cells soon after Hooke did. He made use of a microscope containing improved lenses that could magnify objects almost 300-fold, or 270x.[8] Under these microscopes, Leeuwenhoek found motile objects. In a letter to The Royal Society on October 9, 1676, he states that motility is a quality of life therefore these were living organisms. Over time, he wrote many more papers in which described many specific forms of microorganisms. Leeuwenhoek named these animalcules, which included protozoa and other unicellular organisms, like bacteria.[6] Though he did not have much formal education, he was able to identify the first accurate description of red blood cells and discovered bacteria after gaining interest in the sense of taste that resulted in Leeuwenhoek to observe the tongue of an ox, then leading him to study \\"pepper water\\" in 1676. He also found for the first time the sperm cells of animals and humans. Once discovering these types of cells, Leeuwenhoek saw that the fertilization process requires the sperm cell to enter the egg cell. This put an end to the previous theory of spontaneous generation. After reading letters by Leeuwenhoek, Hooke was the first to confirm his observations that were thought to be unlikely by other contemporaries.[5]\\r\\nThe cells in animal tissues were observed after plants were because the tissues were so fragile and susceptible to tearing, it was difficult for such thin slices to be prepared for studying. Biologists believed that there was a fundamental unit to life, but were unsure what this was. It would not be until over a hundred years later that this fundamental unit was connected to cellular structure and existence of cells in animals or plants.[9] This conclusion was not made until Henri Dutrochet. Besides stating the cell is the fundamental element of organization,[10] Dutrochet also claimed that cells were not just a structural unit, but also a physiological unit.\\r\\nIn 1804, Karl Rudolphi and J.H.F. Link were awarded the prize for \\"solving the problem of the nature of cells\\", meaning they were the first to prove that cells had independent cell walls by the K?nigliche Societ?t der Wissenschaft (Royal Society of Science), G?ttingen.[11] Before, it had been thought that cells shared walls and the fluid passed between them this way.\\r\\nCredit for developing cell theory is usually given to two scientists: Theodor Schwann and Matthias Jakob Schleiden.[12] While Rudolf Virchow contributed to the theory, he is not as credited for his attributions toward it. In 1839, Schleiden suggested that every structural part of a plant was made up of cells or the result of cells. He also suggested that cells were made by a crystallization process either within other cells or from the outside.[13] However, this was not an original idea of Schleiden. He claimed this theory as his own, though Barthelemy Dumortier had stated it years before him. This crystallization process is no longer accepted with modern cell theory. In 1839, Theodor Schwann states that along with plants, animals are composed of cells or the product of cells in their structures.[14] This was a major advancement in the field of biology since little was known about animal structure up to this point compared to plants. From these conclusions about plants and animals, two of the three tenets of cell theory were postulated.[9]\\r\\n1. All living organisms are composed of one or more cells\\r\\n2. The cell is the most basic unit of life\\r\\nSchleiden's theory of free cell formation through crystallization was refuted in the 1850s by Robert Remak, Rudolf Virchow, and Albert Kolliker.[6] In 1855, Rudolf Virchow added the third tenet to cell theory. In Latin, this tenet states Omnis cellula e cellula.[9] This translated to:\\r\\n3. All cells arise only from pre-existing cells\\r\\nHowever, the idea that all cells come from pre-existing cells had in fact already been proposed by Robert Remak; it has been suggested that Virchow plagiarized Remak and did not give him credit.[15] Remak published observations in 1852 on cell division, claiming Schleiden and Schawnn were incorrect about generation schemes. He instead said that binary fission, which was first introduced by Dumortier, was how reproduction of new animal cells were made. Once this tenet was added, the classical cell theory was complete.\\r\\nThe generally accepted parts of modern cell theory include:\\r\\nThe modern version of the cell theory includes the ideas that:\\r\\nThe cell was first discovered by Robert Hooke in 1665 using a microscope. The first cell theory is credited to the work of Theodor Schwann and Matthias Jakob Schleiden in the 1830s. In this theory the internal contents of cells were called protoplasm and described as a jelly-like substance, sometimes called living jelly. At about the same time, colloidal chemistry began its development, and the concepts of bound water emerged. A colloid being something between a solution and a suspension, where Brownian motion is sufficient to prevent sedimentation. The idea of a semipermeable membrane, a barrier that is permeable to solvent but impermeable to solute molecules was developed at about the same time. The term osmosis originated in 1827 and its importance to physiological phenomena realized, but it wasnt until 1877, when the botanist Pfeffer proposed the membrane theory of cell physiology. In this view, the cell was seen to be enclosed by a thin surface, the plasma membrane, and cell water and solutes such as a potassium ion existed in a physical state like that of a dilute solution. In 1889 Hamburger used hemolysis of erythrocytes to determine the permeability of various solutes. By measuring the time required for the cells to swell past their elastic limit, the rate at which solutes entered the cells could be estimated by the accompanying change in cell volume. He also found that there was an apparent nonsolvent volume of about 50% in red blood cells and later showed that this includes water of hydration in addition to the protein and other nonsolvent components of the cells.\\r\\nTwo opposing concepts developed within the context of studies on osmosis, permeability, and electrical properties of cells.[20] The first held that these properties all belonged to the plasma membrane whereas the other predominant view was that the protoplasm was responsible for these properties. The membrane theory developed as a succession of ad-hoc additions and changes to the theory to overcome experimental hurdles. Overton (a distant cousin of Charles Darwin) first proposed the concept of a lipid (oil) plasma membrane in 1899. The major weakness of the lipid membrane was the lack of an explanation of the high permeability to water, so Nathansohn (1904) proposed the mosaic theory. In this view, the membrane is not a pure lipid layer, but a mosaic of areas with lipid and areas with semipermeable gel. Ruhland refined the mosaic theory to include pores to allow additional passage of small molecules. Since membranes are generally less permeable to anions, Leonor Michaelis concluded that ions are adsorbed to the walls of the pores, changing the permeability of the pores to ions by electrostatic repulsion. Michaelis demonstrated the membrane potential (1926) and proposed that it was related to the distribution of ions across the membrane.[21] Harvey and Danielli (1939) proposed a lipid bilayer membrane covered on each side with a layer of protein to account for measurements of surface tension. In 1941 Boyle & Conway showed that the membrane of frog muscle was permeable to both K+ and Cl-, but apparently not to Na+, so the idea of electrical charges in the pores was unnecessary since a single critical pore size would explain the permeability to K+, H+, and Cl- as well as the impermeability to Na+, Ca+, and Mg++. Over the same time period, it was shown (Procter & Wilson, 1916) that gels, which do not have a semipermeable membrane, would swell in dilute solutions. Loeb (1920) also studied gelatin extensively, with and without a membrane, showing that more of the properties attributed to the plasma membrane could be duplicated in gels without a membrane. In particular, he found that an electrical potential difference between the gelatin and the outside medium could be developed, based on the H+ concentration. Some criticisms of the membrane theory developed in the 1930s, based on observations such as the ability of some cells to swell and increase their surface area by a factor of 1000. A lipid layer cannot stretch to that extent without becoming a patchwork (thereby losing its barrier properties. Such criticisms stimulated continued studies on protoplasm as the principal agent determining cell permeability properties. In 1938, Fischer and Suer proposed that water in the protoplasm is not free but in a chemically combined formthe protoplasm represents a combination of protein, salt and waterand demonstrated the basic similarity between swelling in living tissues and the swelling of gelatin and fibrin gels. Dimitri Nasonov (1944) viewed proteins as the central components responsible for many properties of the cell, including electrical properties. By the 1940s, the bulk phase theories were not as well developed as the membrane theories. In 1941, Brooks & Brooks published a monograph The Permeability of Living Cells, which rejects the bulk phase theories.\\r\\nWith the development of radioactive tracers, it was shown that cells are not impermeable to Na+. This was difficult to explain with the membrane barrier theory, so the sodium pump was proposed to continually remove Na+ as it permeates cells. This drove the concept that cells are in a state of dynamic equilibrium, constantly using energy to maintain ion gradients. In 1935, Karl Lohmann discovered ATP and its role as a source of energy for cells, so the concept of a metabolically-driven sodium pump was proposed. The tremendous success of Hodgkin, Huxley, and Katz in the development of the membrane theory of cellular membrane potentials, with differential equations that modeled the phenomena correctly, provided even more support for the membrane pump hypothesis.\\r\\nThe modern view of the plasma membrane is of a fluid lipid bilayer that has protein components embedded within it. The structure of the membrane is now known in great detail, including 3D models of many of the hundreds of different proteins that are bound to the membrane. These major developments in cell physiology placed the membrane theory in a position of dominance and stimulated the imagination of most physiologists, who now apparently accept the theory as factthere are, however, a few dissenters.[citation needed]\\r\\nIn 1956, Afanasy S. Troshin published a book, The Problems of Cell Permeability, in Russian (1958 in German, 1961 in Chinese, 1966 in English) in which he found that permeability was of secondary importance in determination of the patterns of equilibrium between the cell and its environment. Troshin showed that cell water decreased in solutions of galactose or urea although these compounds did slowly permeate cells. Since the membrane theory requires an impermanent solute to sustain cell shrinkage, these experiments cast doubt on the theory. Others questioned whether the cell has enough energy to sustain the sodium/potassium pump. Such questions became even more urgent as dozens of new metabolic pumps were added as new chemical gradients were discovered.\\r\\nIn 1962, Gilbert Ling became the champion of the bulk phase theories and proposed his association-induction hypothesis of living cells.\\r\\nCells can be subdivided into the following subcategories:\\r\\nAnimals have evolved a greater diversity of cell types in a multicellular body (100ÿ150 different cell types), compared with 10ÿ20 in plants, fungi, and protoctista.[24]","input":"Who was the first person to observe living cells?"},{"output":"had been friends","context":"Nathan Riggs M.D., is a fictional character from the medical drama television series Grey's Anatomy, which airs on the American Broadcasting Company (ABC) in the United States. The character was created by series producer Shonda Rhimes and is portrayed by actor Martin Henderson. He was introduced in the episode \\"The Me Nobody Knows\\" as a cardiothoracic surgeon who had worked overseas with April Kepner during her time in Jordan. After bringing a patient to Grey-Sloan Memorial, he begins working there as an attending under Maggie Pierce. At the hospital, he begins a romantic relationship with Meredith Grey, now a widow after the death of Derek Shepherd, until his missing fiance, Megan Hunt, is found and brought home. Nathan makes his last appearance in the episode \\"Danger Zone\\" when he and Megan start their life anew with her son in Los Angeles.\\r\\n\\r\\nNathan Riggs is introduced in the sixth episode of the show's twelfth season as a new cardio attending at Grey-Sloan Memorial. It is quickly learned that he and Owen Hunt (Kevin McKidd) had been friends, but that their friendship ended acrimoniously. It is later revealed that Nathan and Owen's feud was caused by the disappearance of Owen's sister, Megan. Megan, who had been engaged to Nathan at the time of her abduction, had discovered Nathan's infidelity before running off and ultimately getting kidnapped. Owen has long blamed Riggs for the fate of his sister, who has been presumed dead for 10 years now. However, as time goes on, Nathan and Owen learn to work together and eventually tentatively reinstate their friendship.\\r\\n\\r\\nTowards the end of Season 12, Nathan sleeps with Meredith Grey (Ellen Pompeo) in the back of her car. After the incident, they both agree that it was a one-time thing, as Meredith still has trouble moving on from her late husband, Derek Shepherd (Patrick Dempsey). Meredith also learns that her half-sister, Maggie Pierce (Kelly McCreary), has developed a crush on Nathan, further separating Nathan and Meredith. Still, Nathan continues to pursue Meredith, and although she resists, they eventually begin a relationship after sleeping together again. The two stay together for some time, but just when things are on the verge of getting serious, Megan is found in the Season 13 finale. Meredith sends Nathan off to Megan, insisting that she would have done the same thing had it been Derek. Nathan and Megan initially have trouble resuming their relationship, as she believes that he is still in love with Meredith, but they finally get back together when he brings her son, Farouk, to her from Iraq, proving his loyalty to her. In \\"Danger Zone\\", Nathan moves to Los Angeles with Megan and Farouk to start their lives together.\\r\\n\\r\\nNathan made his last appearance in the season 14 episode \\"Danger Zone\\". The episode was designed as the departure for series regular Martin Henderson,[1] having joined the cast in 2015 and conceived originally as the love interest for Meredith.\\r\\n\\r\\nShonda Rhimes announced the exit of Martin Henderson as Nathan Riggs via Twitter: \\"I loved that we were able to give Riggs a happy ending worthy of his character and talent. As for Martin, this is not an ending for our relationship. He has been  part of the Shondaland family since the pilot of Inside the Box and he will always be family. I cant wait to find a new project to work with him on in the future.\\" Henderson indicated in an interview with Deadline that his departure was a storytelling based decision, as he was given a \\"short-term contract\\", adding, \\"This [was] my final year so I was expecting Nathans storyline to be wrapped up.\\"[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nHenderson shared his thoughts on his relationships with both Megan and Meredith\\r\\n\\r\\nI think there was clearly something for Nathan in those relationships. Feelings like that, I dont think they go away. The nature of his previous commitment to Megan and his feelings around that put him in a horrible state of having to choose between two people he cares about, but honoring his commitment to Megan and following through on that is the right thing to do. It doesnt negate his feelings for Meredith. The complications of Merediths emotions, the loss of Derek and moving on from that still plagues her. And theres as much ambiguity around all those feelings. The two of them found each other and that provided good drama. I feel bad for fans who were keen on Meredith and Nathan making it, and not being privy to where each character would go. Its hard to hear those outpourings from those who didnt know it was going to end up like this. But it makes for nice drama and its something that Shonda does brilliantly: Dashing peoples hopes and expectations. Thats why the show continues to be successful.

The series revolves around a large blended family with six children. Considered one of the last of the old-style family sitcoms, the series aired for five seasons and, after its cancellation in 1974, went into syndication in September 1975.[3] While the series was never a critical or ratings success during its original run, it has since become a popular staple in syndication, especially among children and teenaged viewers.\\r\\nThe Brady Bunch's success in syndication led to several television reunion films and spin-off series: The Brady Bunch Hour (1976ÿ77), The Brady Girls Get Married (1981), The Brady Brides (1981), A Very Brady Christmas (1988), and The Bradys (1990). In 1995, the series was adapted into a satirical comedy theatrical film titled The Brady Bunch Movie, followed by A Very Brady Sequel in 1996. A second sequel, The Brady Bunch in the White House, aired on Fox in November 2002 as a made-for-television film. In 1997, \\"Getting Davy Jones\\" (season three, episode 12) was ranked number 37 on TV Guide's 100 Greatest Episodes of All-Time.[4] The durability of the show has resulted in it becoming widely recognized as an American cultural icon.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1966, following the success of his TV series Gilligan's Island, Sherwood Schwartz conceived the idea for The Brady Bunch after reading in The Los Angeles Times that \\"30% of marriages [in the United States] have a child or children from a previous marriage.\\" He set to work on a pilot script for a series tentatively titled Mine and Yours.[5] Schwartz then developed the script to include three children for each parent. While Mike Brady is depicted as being a widower, Schwartz originally wanted the character of Carol Brady to have been a divorce, but the network objected to this. A compromise was reached whereby Carol's marital status (whether she was divorced or widowed) was never directly revealed.\\r\\nSchwartz shopped the series to the \\"big three\\" television networks of the era. ABC, CBS, and NBC all liked the script, but each network wanted changes before they would commit to filming, so Schwartz shelved the project.[6] Although similarities exist between the series and two 1968 theatrical release films, United Artists' Yours, Mine and Ours (starring Henry Fonda and Lucille Ball) and CBS's With Six You Get Eggroll (starring Brian Keith and Doris Day), the original script for The Brady Bunch predated the scripts for both of these films. Nonetheless, the outstanding success of the United Artists film (the 11th-highest-grossing film of 1968) was a factor in ABC's decision to order episodes for the series.[5]\\r\\nAfter receiving a commitment for 13 weeks of television shows from ABC in 1968, Schwartz hired film and television director John Rich to direct the pilot, cast the six children from 264 interviews during that summer, and hired the actors to play the mother role, the father role, and the housekeeper role.[7] As the sets were built on Paramount Television stage 5, adjacent to the stage where H.R. Pufnstuf was filmed by Sid and Marty Krofft, who later produced The Brady Bunch Hour,[8] the production crew prepared the back yard of a home in Sherman Oaks, Los Angeles, as the exterior location for the chaotic backyard wedding scene. Filming of the pilot began on Friday, October 4, 1968, and lasted eight days.\\r\\nMike Brady (Robert Reed), a widowed architect with three sons, Greg (Barry Williams), Peter (Christopher Knight), and Bobby (Mike Lookinland), marries Carol Martin (Florence Henderson), who herself has three daughters: Marcia (Maureen McCormick), Jan (Eve Plumb), and Cindy (Susan Olsen). The wife and daughters take the Brady surname. Included in the blended family are Mike's live-in housekeeper, Alice Nelson (Ann B. Davis), and the boys' dog, Tiger. (In the pilot episode, the girls also have a pet: a cat named Fluffy. Fluffy never appeared in any episodes following the pilot.) The setting is a large, suburban, two-story house designed by Mike, in a Los Angeles suburb.[9]\\r\\nIn the first season, awkward adjustments, accommodations, gender rivalries, and resentments inherent in blended families dominate the stories. In an early episode, Carol tells Bobby that the only \\"steps\\" in their household lead to the second floor (in other words, that the family contains no \\"stepchildren\\", only \\"children\\"). Thereafter, the episodes focus on typical preteen and teenaged adjustments such as sibling rivalry, puppy love, self-image, character building, and responsibility. Noticeably absent was any political commentary, especially regarding the Vietnam War, which was being waged at its largest extent during the height of the series.[10]\\r\\nThe regular cast appeared in an opening title sequence in which video head shots were arranged in a three-by-three grid, with each cast member appearing to look at the other cast members. The sequence used the then-new \\"multi-dynamic image technique\\" created by Canadian filmmaker Christopher Chapman; as a result of the popular attention it garnered in this sequence, it has been referred to in the press as \\"the Brady Bunch effect\\".[11][12] In a 2010 issue of TV Guide, the show's opening title sequence ranked number eight on a list of TV's top-10 credits sequences, as selected by readers.[13]\\r\\nThe theme song, penned by Schwartz and Frank De Vol, and originally arranged, sung, and performed by Paul Parrish, Lois Fletcher, and John Beland[not in citation given] under the name the Peppermint Trolley Company,[17] quickly communicated to audiences that the Bradys were a blended family. The Brady family is shown in a tic-tac-toe board with Carol on the top center, Alice in the middle block, and Mike on bottom middle. To the right are three blocks with the boys from the oldest on top to the youngest. To the left are three blocks with the girls from the oldest to the youngest. In season two, the Brady kids took over singing the theme song. In season three, the boys sing the first verse, girls sing the second verse, and all sing together for the third and last verse. The sequence was created and filmed by Howard A. Anderson, Jr., a visual effects pioneer who worked on the title sequences for many popular television series.[18]\\r\\nThe end credits feature an instrumental version of the theme song's third verse. In season one, it was recorded by the Peppermint Trolley Company. From season two on, the theme was recorded in-house by Paramount musicians.\\r\\nThe house used in exterior shots, which bears little relation to the interior layout of the Bradys' home, is located in Studio City, within the city limits of Los Angeles. According to a 1994 article in the Los Angeles Times, the San Fernando Valley house was built in 1959 and selected as the Brady residence because series creator Schwartz felt it looked like a home where an architect would live.[19] A false window was attached to the front's A-frame section to give the illusion that it had two full stories.[20] Contemporary establishing shots of the house were filmed with the owner's permission for the 1990 TV series The Bradys. The owner refused to allow Paramount to restore the property to its 1969 look for The Brady Bunch Movie in 1995, so a facade resembling the original home was built around an existing house.\\r\\nIn the series, the address of the house was given as 4222 Clinton Way (as read aloud by Carol from an arriving package in the first-season episode entitled \\"Lost Locket, Found Locket\\").[21] Although no city was ever specified, it was presumed from references to the Los Angeles Dodgers, the Los Angeles Rams, and a Hollywood movie studio, among many others, that the Bradys lived in Southern California, most likely Los Angeles or one of its suburbs.[22][23]\\r\\nThe interior of the Brady house was used at least three times for other Paramount shows, twice for Mannix and once for Mission: Impossible, while The Brady Bunch was in production. In the case of Mission: Impossible, the Brady furniture was also used.[24][25][26] A re-creation of the Brady house was constructed for the X-Files episode \\"Sunshine Days\\", which also revolved around The Brady Bunch.\\r\\n\\r\\nRatings data prior to 1973 is scarce for shows which did not place in the Top 30. The only year on file was the final 1973-74 season which The Brady Bunch reached 54th Place with a 16.1 rating. [27] The Brady Bunch never achieved high ratings during its primetime run (never placing in the top 30 during the five years it aired) and was cancelled in 1974 after five seasons and 117 episodes; it was cancelled shortly after the series crossed the minimum threshold for syndication. At that point in the story, Greg graduated from high school and was about to enroll in college.[28]\\r\\nWhen the episodes were repeated in syndication, they usually appeared every weekday in late-afternoon or early-evening slots on local stations. This enabled children to watch the episodes when they came home from school, making the program widely popular and giving it iconic status among those who were too young to have seen the series during its primetime run.\\r\\nAccording to Schwartz, the reason the show has become a part of Americana, even though other shows have run longer, were rated higher, and were critically acclaimed, is that the episodes were written from the standpoint of the children and addressed situations that children could understand (such as boy trouble, sibling rivalry, and meeting famous people such as a rock star or baseball players). The Bradys are also portrayed as a harmonious family, though they do have times when one of the children does not cooperate with his or her parents or the other children.\\r\\nSince its first airing in syndication in September 1975, an episode of the show has been broadcast somewhere in the United States and abroad every day of the year.[29] Episodes were also shown on ABC daytime from July 9, 1973 to April 18, 1975 and from June 30-August 29, 1975, at 11:30?a.m. EST/10:30 CST.\\r\\nThe show was aired on TBS starting in the 1980s until 1997, Nick at Nite in 1995 (for a special event), and again from 1998 to 2003 (and briefly during the spring of 2012), TeenNick (under the channel's former name The N) from March to April 2004, on TV Land on and off from 2002 to 2015, Nick Jr. (as part of the NickMom block from 2012 to 2013), and Hallmark Channel from January to June 2013 and again starting September 5, 2016, until September 30, 2016.\\r\\nEpisodes in the syndicated version have been edited for time to allow for commercial breaks, down from the original version of 25ÿ26 minutes.\\r\\nSince its launch as a national network in 2010, the Weigel Broadcasting owned classic TV network MeTV airs a weekly two-hour block of the show every Sunday morning/early afternoon promoted as the \\"Brady Bunch Brunch\\". In the years following, Me-TV has also periodically aired the series weekday mornings.[30] Decades - a sister network of MeTV - also occasionally airs the show.\\r\\nOnline, the show is available on Hulu and CBS All Access, though not all episodes are available for either service.\\r\\nDuring the series' original run, the Brady kids recorded several albums on Paramount's record label. While session musicians provided backing, the actors from the series provided their own singing voices (which was not always the case for early 1970s television crossover acts). None of the albums or singles from The Brady Kids ever became hits on any national music charts.\\r\\nAlso includes solo recordings as indicated\\r\\nSeveral spin-offs and sequels to the original series have been made, featuring all or most of the original cast. These include another sitcom, an animated series, a variety show, television movies, a dramatic series, a stage play, and theatrical movies: \\r\\nA final-season Brady Bunch episode, \\"Kelly's Kids\\", was intended as a pilot for a prospective spin-off series of the same name. Ken Berry starred as Ken Kelly, a friend and neighbor of the Bradys, who with his wife Kathy (Brooke Bundy) adopted three orphaned boys of different racial backgrounds. One of the adopted sons was played by Todd Lookinland, the younger brother of Mike Lookinland. While Kelly's Kids was not subsequently picked up as a full series, producer Sherwood Schwartz reworked the basic premise for the short-lived 1980s sitcom Together We Stand starring Elliott Gould and Dee Wallace.[31]\\r\\nA 22-episode animated Saturday morning cartoon series, produced by Filmation and airing on ABC from September 1972 to August 1974, is about the Brady kids having various adventures.[32] The family's adults were never seen or mentioned, and the \\"home\\" scenes were in a very large, well-appointed tree house. Several animals were regular characters, including two non-English-speaking pandas (Ping and Pong), a talking bird (Marlon) which could do magic, and an ordinary pet dog (Mop Top, not Tiger). The first 17 episodes featured the voices of all six of the original child actors from the show, but Barry Williams, Maureen McCormick, and Christopher Knight were replaced for the last five episodes due to a contract dispute.\\r\\nOn November 28, 1976, a two-hour television special entitled The Brady Bunch Variety Hour aired on ABC. Eve Plumb was the only regular cast member from the original show who declined to be in the series and the role of Jan was recast with Geri Reischl.[33] Produced by Sid and Marty Krofft, the sibling team behind H.R. Pufnstuf, Donny and Marie, and other variety shows and children's series of the era, the show was intended to air every fifth week in the same slot as The Hardy Boys/Nancy Drew Mysteries, but ended up being scheduled sporadically throughout the season, leading to inconsistent ratings and its inevitable cancellation.\\r\\nIn 2009, Brady Bunch cast member Susan Olsen, with Lisa Sutton, published a book, Love to Love You Bradys, which dissects and celebrates the Variety Hour as a cult classic.[34]\\r\\nA TV reunion movie called The Brady Girls Get Married was produced in 1981. Although scheduled to be shown in its original full-length movie format, NBC at the last minute divided it into half-hour segments and showed one part a week for three weeks, and the fourth week debuted a spin-off sitcom titled The Brady Brides. The reunion movie featured the entire original cast; this proved to be the only time the entire cast worked together on a single project following the cancellation of the original series. The movie's opening credits featured the season-one \\"Grid\\" and theme song, with the addition of The Brady Girls Get Married title.[37] The movie shows what the characters had been doing since the original series ended: Mike is still an architect, Carol is a real-estate agent, Greg is a doctor, Marcia is a fashion designer, Peter is in the Air Force, Jan is also an architect, Bobby and Cindy are in college, and Alice has married Sam. Eventually, they all reunite for Marcia and Jan's double wedding.\\r\\nThe Brady Brides features Maureen McCormick (Marcia) and Eve Plumb (Jan) in regular roles. The series begins with Marcia and Jan and their new husbands buying a house and living together. The clashes between Jan's uptight and conservative husband, Philip Covington III (a college professor in science who is several years older than Jan, played by Ron Kuhlman) and Marcia's slovenly and more bohemian husband, Wally Logan (a fun-loving salesman for a large toy company, played by Jerry Houser), were the pivot on which many of the stories were based, not unlike The Odd Couple. Florence Henderson and Ann B. Davis also appeared regularly. Ten episodes were aired before the sitcom was cancelled. This was the only Brady show in sitcom form to be filmed in front of a live studio audience. Bob Eubanks guest-starred as himself in an episode where the two couples appear on The Newlywed Game.\\r\\nThroughout the late 1980s and 1990s, The Brady Girls Get Married was rerun on various networks in its original full-length movie format.\\r\\nA second TV reunion movie, A Very Brady Christmas, aired in December 1988 on CBS and featured all the regular cast (except Susan Olsen, who was on her honeymoon at the time of filming; the role of Cindy was played by Jennifer Runyon), as well as three grandchildren, Peter's girlfriend, Valerie, and the spouses of Greg, Marcia, and Jan (Nora, Wally, and Phillip, respectively).[38] The Nielsen ratings for A Very Brady Christmas were the highest of any television movie that season for CBS.[39]\\r\\nDue to the success of A Very Brady Christmas, CBS asked Brady Bunch creator Sherwood Schwartz and his son Lloyd to create a new series for the network. According to Lloyd Schwartz, his father and he initially balked at the idea because they felt a new series would harm the Brady franchise. They finally relented because CBS was \\"desperate for programming\\". A new series featuring the Brady clan was created entitled The Bradys. All the original Brady Bunch cast members returned for the series, except for Maureen McCormick (Marcia), who was replaced with Leah Ayres.\\r\\nAs with A Very Brady Christmas, The Bradys also featured elements of comedy and drama and featured storylines that were of a more serious nature than that of the original series and its subsequent spin-offs. Lloyd Schwartz later said he compared The Bradys to another dramedy of the time, thirtysomething. The two-hour series premiere episode aired on February 9, 1990, at 9 pm on CBS and initially drew respectable ratings. Subsequent episodes were moved to 8 pm, where ratings quickly declined. Due to the decline, CBS cancelled the series after six episodes.[40]\\r\\nThe Day by Day episode, titled \\"A Very Brady Episode\\" (February 5, 1989), on NBC, reunited six of the original The Brady Bunch cast members: Robert Reed, Florence Henderson, Ann B. Davis, Christopher Knight, Mike Lookinland and Maureen McCormick [41][42]\\r\\nTwenty years following the conclusion of the original series, a film adaptation, The Brady Bunch Movie went into production and was released in 1995 from Paramount Pictures. The film is set in the present day (1990s) and the Bradys, still living their lives as if it were the 1970s, are unfamiliar with their surroundings. It stars Gary Cole and Shelley Long as Mike and Carol Brady, with Christopher Daniel Barnes (Greg), Christine Taylor (Marcia), Paul Sutera (Peter), Jennifer Elise Cox (Jan), Jesse Lee (Bobby), Olivia Hack (Cindy), Henriette Mantel (Alice), and cameo appearances from Ann B. Davis as a long-haul truck driver and Florence Henderson as Carol's mother.\\r\\nA sequel, A Very Brady Sequel, was released in 1996. The cast of the first film returned for the sequel. A second sequel, The Brady Bunch in the White House was made-for-television and was aired on Fox in 2002. Shelley Long and Gary Cole returned for the third film, while the Brady kids and Alice were recast.\\r\\nParamount Home Entertainment released all five seasons on DVD in Region 1 from 2005 to 2006, before CBS DVD took over DVD rights to the Paramount Television library (though CBS DVD releases are still distributed by Paramount). Paramount/CBS has released the series on DVD in other countries as well.\\r\\nA Complete Series box set was released in 2007 by CBS and Paramount, which includes the TV movies A Very Brady Christmas and \\"The Brady 500\\" (an episode of The Bradys), as well as two episodes of The Brady Kids animated series. The box art for the set features green shag carpeting and 1970s-style wood paneling.\\r\\nThe first two seasons are also available on Region 2 DVD for the Nordic countries, with audio in English and subtitle choices in Norwegian, Swedish, Danish, or Finnish.[43][44] The series has also been released on VHS, but the VHS tapes have gone out of print.\\r\\nOn April 7, 2015, CBS Home Entertainment released a repackaged version of the complete series set, at a lower price, but it does not include the bonus disc that was part of the original complete series release.[45]\\r\\nSeasons one and two have also been released in the UK.\\r\\n15min Behind the scenes Feature\\r\\n15min Behind the scenes Feature (Series One)\\r\\nA Very Brady Christmas\\r\\n\\"The Brady 500\\"\\r\\nTwo episodes of The Brady Kids","input":"What street did the brady bunch live on?"},{"output":"20 June 1941","context":"The United States Air Force became a separate military service on 18 September 1947 with the implementation of the National Security Act of 1947.[1][2] The Act created the National Military Establishment, later renamed the United States Department of Defense, which was composed of four of the five branches, the Army, Marine Corps, Navy, and a newly created Air Force.[3] Prior to 1947, the responsibility for military aviation was divided between the Army (for land-based operations) and the Navy, and Marine Corps, for sea-based operations from aircraft carrier and amphibious aircraft. The Army created the first antecedent of the Air Force on 1 August 1907, which through a succession of changes of organization, titles, and missions advanced toward eventual separation 40 years later. The predecessor organizations leading up to today's U.S. Air Force are:\\r\\n* The Air Corps became a subordinate element of the Army Air Forces on 20 June 1941, and was abolished as an administrative organization on 9 March 1942. It continued to exist as a branch of the Army (similar to the infantry, quartermaster, or artillery) until reorganization provisions of the National Security Act of 1947 (61 Stat. 495), 26 July 1947.[4]\\r\\n**The Army Air Forces were abolished by Transfer Order 1, Office of the Secretary of Defense, 26 September 1947, implementing the same provisions. Transfer Order 1 was the first of 200 Army-Air Force transfer agreements drawn up in June and July 1947, and ordered the transfer of all military and civilian personnel of the Army Air Forces to the Department of the Air Force and the USAF.[4] The final transfer order was signed 22 June 1949.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1917, upon the United States' entry into World War I, the first major U.S. aviation combat force was created when an Air Service was formed as part of the American Expeditionary Force (AEF). Major General Mason Patrick commanded the Air Service of the AEF; his deputy was Brigadier General Billy Mitchell. These aviation units, some of which were trained in France, provided tactical support for the U.S. Army, especially during the Battle of Saint-Mihiel and the Meuse-Argonne offensives. Among the aces of the AEF Air Service were Captain Eddie Rickenbacker and 2nd Lieutenant Frank Luke. Concurrent with the creation of this combat force, the U.S. Army's aviation establishment in the United States was removed from control of the Signal Corps and placed directly under the United States Secretary of War. An assistant secretary was created to direct the Army Air Service, which had dual responsibilities for development and procurement of aircraft, and raising and training of air units. With the end of the First World War, the AEF's Air Service was dissolved and the Army Air Service in the United States largely demobilized.\\r\\nIn 1920, the Air Service became a branch of the Army and in 1926 was renamed the Army Air Corps. During this period, the Air Corps began experimenting with new techniques, including air-to-air refueling and the development of the B-9 and the Martin B-10, the first all-metal monoplane bombers, and new fighters.\\r\\nAmericans were fascinated with aviation in the 1920s and 1930s and refused to allow War Department conservatism to block innovation. General Billy Mitchell, the deputy director of the Air Service sought to wrest control of coastal defense away from the Navy. He went public insisting that his planes could sink battleships any day, a claim proven with a series of tests that culminated in the sinking of the Ostfriesland. Mitchell lost his self-control in 1925 when he accused the Navy in a press release of \\"incompetency, criminal negligence and almost treasonable administration of the national defense.\\"[5] He received the highly publicized court martial he wanted, and was allowed to expound his theory that air power alone would suffice to win the next big war. He was convicted, and resigned. He became a popular hero and public opinion forced the War Department to strengthen the Air Corps. Mitchell's main argument was air power had to be autonomoushad to be controlled by fliers who understood the new technology, new tactics, new strategies, and who would not waste precious air assets in trying to assist old-fashioned armies and navies. Until his death in 1936 Mitchell, as a civilian, was a tireless prophet of airpower before numerous civilian audiences, but he lost touch with aviation developments and ceased to be influential inside the services.[6] Indeed, his almost hysterical attacks made many generals hostile. The Air Corps managed a few publicity stunts, but always seemed to be overshadowed by glamorous civilians like Charles Lindbergh, Howard Hughes or Amelia Earhart. In 1934 President Franklin Roosevelt, feuding with the airline industry, suddenly turned the delivery of air mail over to the Air Corps. Multiple crashes by inexperienced Air Corps pilots in mediocre planes with poor navigation gear emphasized the fragility of the new service, and undercut its claims that in wartime it could perform miracles. Roosevelt, however, had become a firm believer in air power and had behind him both public opinion and Congress. When mobilization began in spring 1940 Roosevelt was as energetic as anyone in expanding the Air Corps role, calling for 50,000 planes a year, and sending the best new models to Britain for its war against the Luftwaffe.[7]\\r\\nIn 1935, as a result of recommendations from two civilian review boards, the next advancement toward independence for the Air Force occurred when all flying units, which heretofore had been distributed to various ground commands, were grouped together as an aerial task force under one air commander as the General Headquarters Air Force. The Air Corps, headed by the Chief of the Air Corps, continued as before but now held responsibility only for supply, airfields, and training, in effect splitting the Air Force into two parts. Both were commanded by major generals (Frank Andrews and Oscar Westover, followed by Henry H. (\\"Hap\\") Arnold).\\r\\nIn 1937, the B-17 Flying Fortress made its first appearance. In a feat of navigation impressive for the time, three B-17s intercepted the Italian passenger liner Rex at sea. Though intended to demonstrate the ability of the Air Corps to defend the nation's coasts, the mission also indicated the emerging doctrine within the Air Corps of the supremacy of strategic bombing.\\r\\nDuring World War I, aviation technology developed rapidly; however, the Army's reluctance to use the new technology began to make airmen think that as long as the Army controlled aviation, development would be stunted and a potentially valuable force neglected. Air Service senior officer Billy Mitchell began to campaign for an independent Air Force, co-equal to the Army and Navy. But his campaign offended many and resulted in a court martial in 1925 that effectively ended his career. His followers, including future aviation leaders \\"Hap\\" Arnold and Carl Spaatz, saw the lack of public, congressional, and military support that Mitchell received and decided that America was not ready for an independent air force. Under the leadership of its chief of staff Mason Patrick and, later, Arnold, the Air Corps waited until the time to fight for independence arose again.\\r\\nThe Air Force came of age in World War II. President Franklin D. Roosevelt took the lead, calling for a vastly enlarged air force based on long-range strategic bombing. Organizationally it became largely independent from the Army in 1941, when the Army Air Corps became a part of the new U.S. Army Air Forces (AAF), and the GHQ Air Force was redesignated the subordinate Combat Command. In the major reorganization of the Army by War Department Circular 59, effective March 9, 1942, the newly created Army Air Forces gained equal voice with the Army and Navy on the Joint Chiefs of Staff and complete autonomy from the Army Ground Forces and the Services of Supply, serving as a separate service in all but name. The reorganization also eliminated both Combat Command and the Air Corps as organizations (the latter remained a combat branch of the Army until 1947) in favor of a streamlined system of commands and numbered air forces for decentralized management of the burgeoning Army Air Forces.\\r\\nThe reorganization merged all aviation elements of the former Air Corps into the Army Air Forces. Although the Air Corps still legally existed as an Army branch, the position and Office of the Chief of the Air Corps was dissolved.\\r\\nMajor General Carl A. Spaatz took command of the Eighth Air Force in London in 1942; with Brigadier General Ira Eaker as second in command, he supervised the strategic bombing campaign. In late 1943, Spaatz was made commander of the new U.S. Strategic Air Forces, reporting directly to the Combined Chiefs of Staff. Spaatz began daylight bombing operations using the prewar doctrine of flying bombers in close formations, relying on their combined defensive firepower for protection from attacking enemy aircraft rather than supporting fighter escorts. The doctrine proved flawed when deep-penetration missions beyond the range of escort fighters were attempted, because German fighter planes overwhelmed U.S. formations, shooting down bombers in excess of \\"acceptable\\" loss rates, especially in combination with the vast number of flak anti-aircraft batteries defending Germany's major targets. American fliers took heavy casualties during raids on the oil refineries of Ploie?ti, Romania, and the ball-bearing factories at Schweinfurt and Regensburg, Germany, and it was the loss rate in crews and not materiel that brought about a pullback from the strategic offensive in the autumn of 1943.\\r\\nThe Eighth Air Force had attempted to use both the P-47 and P-38 as escorts, but while the Thunderbolt was a capable dog-fighter it lacked the range, even with the addition of drop tanks to extend its range, and the Lightning proved mechanically unreliable in the frigid altitudes at which the missions were fought. Bomber protection was greatly improved after the introduction of North American P-51 Mustang fighters in Europe. With its built-in extended range and competitive or superior performance characteristics in comparison to all existing German piston-engined fighters, the Mustang was an immediately available solution to the crisis. In January 1944 the Eighth Air Force obtained priority in equipping its groups, so that ultimately 14 of its 15 groups fielded Mustangs. P-51 escorts began operations in February 1944 and increased their numbers rapidly, so that the Luftwaffe suffered increasing fighter losses in aerial engagements beginning with Big Week in early 1944. Allied fighters were also granted free rein in attacking German fighter airfields, both in pre-planned missions and while returning to base from escort duties, and the major Luftwaffe threat against Allied bombers was severely diminished by D-Day.\\r\\nIn the Pacific Theater of Operations, the AAF provided major tactical support under General George Kenney to Douglas MacArthur in the Southwest Pacific theater. Kenney's pilots invented the skip-bombing technique against Japanese ships. Kenney's forces claimed destruction of 11,900 Japanese planes and 1.7 million tons of shipping. The first development and sustained implementation of airlift by American air forces occurred between May 1942 and November 1945 as hundreds of transports flew more than half a million tons of supplies from India to China over the Hump.\\r\\nThe AAF created the Twentieth Air Force to employ long-range B-29 Superfortress bombers in strategic attacks on Japanese cities. The use of forward bases in China (needed to be able to reach Japan by the heavily laden B-29's) was ineffective because of the difficulty in logistically supporting the bases entirely by air from its main bases in India, and because of a persistent threat against the Chinese airfields by the Japanese army. After the Mariana Islands were captured in mid-1944, providing locations for air bases that could be supplied by sea, Arnold moved all B-29 operations there by April 1945 and made General Curtis LeMay his bomber commander (reporting directly to Arnold, who personally commanded Twentieth Air Force until July). LeMay reasoned that the Japanese economy, much of which was cottage industry in dense urban areas where manufacturing and assembly plants were also located, was particularly vulnerable to area attack and abandoned inefficient high-altitude precision bombing in favor of low-level incendiary bombings aimed at destroying large urban areas. On the night of March 9ÿ10, 1945, the bombing of Tokyo and the resulting conflagration resulted in the death of over 100,000 persons. 350,000 people died in 66 other Japanese cities as a result of this shift to incendiary bombing. At the same time, the B-29 was also employed in widespread mining of Japanese harbors and sea lanes. In early August 1945, the Twentieth Air Force conducted atomic bomb attacks on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in response to Japan's rejection of the Potsdam Declaration which outlined the terms of surrender for Japan.[8][9] Both cities were destroyed with enormous loss of life and psychological shock. On August 15, Emperor Hirohito announced the surrender of Japan, stating:\\r\\nMoreover, the enemy has begun to employ a new and most cruel bomb, the power of which to do damage is indeed incalculable, taking the toll of many innocent lives. Should We continue to fight, it would not only result in an ultimate collapse and obliteration of the Japanese nation, but also it would lead to the total extinction of human civilization. Such being the case, how are We to save the millions of Our subjects; or to atone Ourselves before the hallowed spirits of Our Imperial Ancestors? This is the reason why We have ordered the acceptance of the provisions of the Joint Declaration of the Powers.\\r\\nIn practice, the Army Air Forces became virtually independent of the Army during World War II, but its leaders wanted formal independence. In November 1945, General Dwight D. Eisenhower became Army Chief of Staff, while General Carl Spaatz began to assume the duties of Commanding General, Army Air Forces, in anticipation of General Arnolds announced retirement. One of General Eisenhowers first actions was to appoint a board of officers, headed by Lieutenant General William H. Simpson, to prepare a definitive plan for the reorganization of the Army and the Air Force that could be effected without enabling legislation and would provide for the separation of the Air Force from the Army. On 29 January 1946 \\"Generals Eisenhower and Spaatz agreed on an Air Force organization composed of Strategic Air Command, Air Defense Command, Tactical Air Command, Air Transport Command, Air Technical Service Command, Air Training Command, the Air University, and the Air Force Center.\\"[10]\\r\\nOver the continuing objections of the Navy, which feared losing its air arm and strategic role to the new service, the United States Department of the Air Force was created by the National Security Act of 1947. That act became effective 18 September 1947 when the first secretary of the Air Force, Stuart Symington, took office. In 1948, the service chiefs agreed on usage of air assets under the Key West Agreement.\\r\\n\\"In 1947 President Truman signed the National Security Act which established this new defense organization, and along with it the creation of the US Air Force as an independent service, equal to the US Army and US Navy. The official birthday of the US Air Force is 18 September 1947.\\"[11]\\r\\nOn 18 September 1947, the Army Air Forces became the United States Air Force as a separate and equal element of the United States Armed Forces. The fledgling Air Force quickly established its own identity. Army Air Fields were renamed Air Force Bases and personnel were soon being issued new uniforms with new rank insignia. Once the new Air Force was free of army domination, its first job was to discard the old and inadequate ground army organizational structure. This was the \\"Base Plan\\" where the combat group commander reported to the base commander, who was often regular army, with no flying experience.\\r\\nGeneral Carl A. Spaatz established a new policy, \\"No tactical commander should be subordinate to the station commander.\\" This resulted in a search for a better arrangement. The commander of the 15th Air Force, Major General Charles Born,[12] proposed the Provisional Wing Plan, which basically reversed the situation and put the wing commander over the base commander. The USAF basic organizational unit became the Base-Wing.\\r\\nUnder this plan, the base support functions ÿ supply, base operations, transportation, security, and medical were assigned to squadrons, usually commanded by a Major or Lieutenant Colonel. All of these squadrons were assigned to a Combat Support Group, commanded by a Base Commander, usually a Colonel. Combat fighter or bomber squadrons were assigned to the Combat Group, a retention of the USAAF Group. All of these groups, both combat and combat support, were in turn assigned to the Wing, commanded by a Wing Commander. This way the Wing Commander commanded both the combat operational elements on the base as well as the non-operational elements. The Wing Commander was an experienced air combat leader, usually a Colonel or Brigadier General. All of the hierarchical organizations carried the same numerical designation. In this manner, for example, the 28th became the designation for the Wing and all the subordinate groups and squadrons beneath it. As a result, the base and the wing became one and the same unit. On 16 June 1952, the legacy combat groups were inactivated and the operational Combat Squadrons were assigned directly to the Wing. The World War II history, lineage and honors of the combat group were bestowed on the Wing upon its inactivation.\\r\\nThe USAAF Wing then was redesignated as an Air Division, which was commanded Brigadier General or higher, who commanded two or more wings usually, but not always, on a single base. Numbered Air Forces (NAF) commanded both Air Divisions or Wings directly, and the NAF was under the Major Command (SAC, TAC, ADC, etc.).\\r\\nAfter World War II, relations between the United States and the Soviet Union began to deteriorate, and the period in history known as the Cold War began. The United States entered an arms race with the Soviet Union and competition aimed at increasing each nation's influence throughout the world. In response, the United States expanded its military presence throughout the world. The USAF opened air bases throughout Europe, and later in Japan and South Korea. The United States also built air bases on the British overseas territories of British Indian Ocean Territory and Ascension Island in the South Atlantic.\\r\\nThe first test for the USAF during the Cold War came in 1948, when Communist authorities in East Germany cut off road and air transportation to West Berlin. The USAF, along with the Royal Air Force (RAF) and Commonwealth air forces, supplied the city during the Berlin airlift under Operation Vittles, using C-54 Skymasters. The efforts of these air forces saved the city from starvation and forced the Soviets to back down in their blockade.\\r\\nConflict over post-war military administration, especially with regard to the roles and missions to be assigned to the Air Force and the U.S. Navy, led to an episode called the \\"Revolt of the Admirals\\" in the late 1940s, in which high-ranking Navy officers argued unsuccessfully for the case for carrier-based aircraft rather than strategic bombers.\\r\\nIn 1947, the USAF began Project Sign, a study of unidentified flying objects what would be twice revived (first as Project Grudge and finally as Project Blue Book) and which would last until 1969.[13]\\r\\nIn 1948 the Women's Armed Services Integration Act gave women permanent status in the Regular and Reserve forces of the Air Force.[14] On 8 July 1948, Esther McGowin Blake became the first woman in the Air Force, enlisting the first minute of the first hour of the first day regular Air Force duty was authorized for women.[14][15][16]\\r\\nDuring the Korean War, which began in June 1950, the Far East Air Forces (FEAF) were among the first units to respond to the invasion by North Korea, but quickly lost its main airbase at Kimpo, South Korea. Designated to provide close air support to the defenders of the Pusan pocket from bases in Japan, the FEAF also conducted a strategic bombing campaign against North Korea's war-making potential simultaneously. General Douglas MacArthur's landing at Inchon in September 1950 enabled the FEAF to return to Korea and develop bases from which they supported MacArthur's drive to the Korean-Chinese border.\\r\\nWhen the Chinese People's Liberation Army attacked in December 1950, the USAF provided tactical air support. The introduction of Soviet-made MiG-15 jet fighters caused problems for the B-29s used to bomb North Korea, but the USAF countered the MiGs with its new F-86 Sabre jet fighters. Although both air superiority and close air support missions were successful, a lengthy attempt to interdict communist supply lines by air attack was not as successful and was replaced by a systematic campaign to inflict as much economic cost to North Korea and the Chinese forces as long as war persisted, including attacks on the capital city of Pyongyang and against the North Korean hydroelectric system.\\r\\nThe USAF was heavily deployed during the Vietnam War. The first bombing raids against North Vietnam occurred in 1964, following the Gulf of Tonkin Incident. In March 1965, a sustained bombing campaign began, code-named Operation Rolling Thunder. This campaign's purpose was to destroy the will of the North Vietnamese to fight, destroy industrial bases and air defenses, and to stop the flow of men and supplies down the Ho Chi Minh Trail, while forcing North Vietnam into peace negotiations. The USAF dropped more bombs in all combat operations in Vietnam during the period 1965ÿ68 than it did during World War II,[17] and the Rolling Thunder campaign lasted until the U.S. presidential election of 1968. Except for heavily damaging the North Vietnamese economy and infrastructure, Rolling Thunder failed in its political and strategic goals.\\r\\nThe USAF also played a critical role in defeating the Easter Offensive of 1972. The rapid redeployment of fighters, bombers, and attack aircraft help the South Vietnamese Army repel the invasion. Operation Linebacker demonstrated to both the North and South Vietnamese that even without significant U.S. Army ground forces, the United States could still influence the war. The air war for the United States ended with Operation Linebacker II, also known as the \\"Christmas Bombings.\\" These helped to finalize the Paris peace negotiations.\\r\\nThe insurgent nature of combat operations early in the war, and the necessity of interdicting the North Vietnamese regular army and its supply lines in third-party countries of Southeast Asia led to the development of a significant special operations capability within the USAF. Provisional and experimental concepts such as air commandos and aerial gunships, tactical missions such as the partially successful Operation Ivory Coast deep inside enemy territory, and a dedicated Combat Search and Rescue mission resulted in development of operational doctrines, units, and equipment.\\r\\nThe USAF modernized its tactical air forces in the late 1970s with the introduction of the F-15, A-10, and F-16 fighters, and the implementation of realistic training scenarios under the aegis of Red Flag. In turn, it also upgraded the equipment and capabilities of its Air Reserve Components (ARC) by the equipping of both the Air National Guard and Air Force Reserve with first-line aircraft.\\r\\nExpanding its force structure in the 1980s to 40 fighter wings and drawing further on the lessons of the Vietnam War, the USAF also dedicated units and aircraft to Electronic Warfare (EW) and the Suppression of Enemy Air Defenses (SEAD). The humiliating failure in April 1980 of the Operation Eagle Claw rescue mission in Iran resulted directly in an increased USAF emphasis on participation in the doctrine, equipment, personnel, and planning of Joint Special Operations.\\r\\nThe USAF provided attack, airlift, and combat support capability for operations in Grenada in 1983 (Operation Urgent Fury), Libya in 1986 (Operation El Dorado Canyon), and Panama in 1989 (Operation Just Cause). Lessons learned in these operations were applied to its force structure and doctrine, and became the basis for successful air operations in the 1990s and after September 11, 2001.\\r\\nThe development of satellite reconnaissance during the Cold War, the extensive use of both tactical and strategic aerial reconnaissance during numerous combat operations, and the nuclear war deterrent role of the USAF resulted in the recognition of space as a possible combat arena. An emphasis on \\"aerospace\\" operations and doctrine grew in the 1980s. Missile warning and space operations were combined to form Air Force Space Command in 1982. In 1991, Operation Desert Storm provided emphasis for the command's new focus on supporting combat operations.\\r\\nThe creation of the internet and the universality of computer technology as a basic warfighting tool resulted in the priority development of cyber warfare techniques and defenses by the USAF.\\r\\nThe USAF provided the bulk of the Allied air power during the Gulf War in 1991, flying alongside aircraft of the U.S. Navy and the RAF. The F-117 Nighthawk stealth fighter's capabilities were shown on the first night of the air war when it was able to bomb central Baghdad and avoid the sophisticated Iraqi anti-aircraft defenses. The USAF, along with the U.S. Navy and the RAF, later patrolled the skies of northern and southern Iraq after the war to ensure that Iraq's air defense capability could not be rebuilt. Operation Provide Comfort 1991-96 and Operation Northern Watch 1997-2003 - no-fly zones north of the 36th parallel north and Operation Southern Watch - no-fly zone south of the 33rd parallel north.\\r\\nFaced with declining budgets for personnel and resources in the late 1990s, the Air Force realized that it had to change the way it did business if it was to remain in business providing air power in support of America's national and international interests.\\r\\nIn the mid-1990s, the Air Force was carrying out the \\"deny-flight\\" patrols of Operations Northern and Southern Watch over Iraq. These air patrols were tedious and placed additional burdens on an Air Force that had been significantly downsized after the end of the Cold War and Operation Desert Storm.\\r\\nAs the mission continued into one of multi-year duration, the drain on equipment and manpower forced the Air Force to reconsider how it was going to meet its future worldwide commitments. The Air Expeditionary Force (AEF) concept was developed that would mix Active-Duty, Reserve and Air National Guard into a combined force. Instead of entire permanent units deploying for years on end, units composed of \\"aviation packages\\" from several wings, including active-duty Air Force, the Air Force Reserve Command and the Air National Guard, would be married together to carry out the assigned deployment rotation.\\r\\nIn this way, the Air Force and its reserve components did not have to provide complete units of their own to meet the requirements placed before it by the Air Staff and the combatant commanders. Unlike the overseas major commands already established such as PACAF or USAFE, CENTAF (later AFCENT) would not consist of permanently assigned units. Instead of the \\"Provisional\\" deployed units attached to the command during the 1991 (Persian) Gulf War, \\"Air Expeditionary\\" units would be the force projection components of CENTAF.\\r\\nAir Expeditionary Force units are composed primarily of Air Combat Command or ACC gained components, but also components deployed from other major commands as necessary to meet mission requirements. AEF organizations are defined as temporary in nature, organized to meet a specific mission or national commitment. As such, they are activated and inactivated as necessary and do not carry any official lineage or history.\\r\\nKnowing that overseas basing was not something that could always be counted on due to the volatility of U.S. relations with host nations, the Air Force decided that keeping units fixed in static locations was no longer a viable option. Instead of using the Cold War model of a large number of permanent bases with units assigned, the Air Force modified its war plans to include the use of fewer, temporary bases that would be used by multiple AEF units rotating in for a finite amount of time then inactivating afterwards.\\r\\nAnother not-to-be-forgotten benefit of the Air Expeditionary Force concept, at least for the reserve components - is that their members are all volunteers. When an AFRC or ANG unit is assigned to the AEF rotation cycle, it is the unit's responsibility to obtain the needed personnel to fulfill the requirement. Other than units activated by presidential order, the utilization of ANG and AFRC personnel to support the AEF rotation cycles has always been accomplished on a completely voluntary basis.\\r\\nIn addition, the various Air Expeditionary Wings formed by the Air Force for the purpose of meeting the various deployment rotations allowed the deployment burden to remote combat areas of AFCENT be spread more evenly over the total force, while providing meaningful training opportunities for reserve component units that otherwise would not have had them.\\r\\nIn 1996, Operation Desert Strike and 1998 Operation Desert Fox, the USAF bombed Saddam Hussein's Iraq.\\r\\nThe USAF led NATO action in Bosnia with no-fly zones (Operation Deny Flight) 1993-96 and in 1995 with air strikes against the Bosnian Serbs (Operation Deliberate Force). This was the first time that USAF aircraft took part in military action as part of a NATO mission. The USAF led the strike forces as the NATO Air Force (otherwise mainly composed of RAF and Luftwaffe aircraft) with the greatest capability to launch air strikes over a long period of time. In 1999, the USAF led NATO air strikes against Serbia during the Kosovo War (Operation Allied Force).\\r\\nIn 2001, the USAF was deployed against the Taliban forces in Afghanistan. Operating from Diego Garcia, B-52 Stratofortress and B-1 Lancer bombers attacked Taliban positions. The USAF deployed daisy cutter bombs, dropped from C-130 Hercules cargo planes, for the first time since the Vietnam War. During this conflict, the USAF opened up bases in Central Asia for the first time.\\r\\nThe USAF was deployed in the 2003 invasion of Iraq. Following the defeat of Saddam Husseins regime, the USAF took over Baghdad International Airport as a base. USAF aircraft are used to provide support to Coalition and Iraqi forces in major operations to eliminate insurgent centers of activity and supply in north and west Iraq. Operations in both Afghanistan and Iraq demonstrated the effective utility of Unmanned air vehicles, the most prominent of which was the MQ-1 Predator. Fifty-four USAF personnel died in the Iraq War.[18]\\r\\nThe USAF maintains a Combined Air & Space Operations Center in Qatar to direct air combat operations and Predator actions.[19][20][21]\\r\\nIn March 2011, USAF jets bombed military targets in Libya as part of the international effort to enforce a United Nations resolution that imposed no-fly zone over the country and protected its people from the civil war that occurred when its dictator, Muammar Gaddafi suppressed the protests calling for the end of his regime. Protests were inspired by the revolutions in Tunisia and Egypt.\\r\\nIn the summer of 2014 President Obama announced the return of US Forces to Iraq. The US Air Force is undertaking a significant humanitarian effort in order to assist Iraq's imperiled minority groups.[22] When permission was later granted for USAF airstrikes, it was on condition that the types of aircraft not be announced so as to obscure which countries they were based in.[23]\\r\\nToday, the United States Air Force is the largest, most capable, and most technologically advanced air force in the world, with about 5,778 manned aircraft in service, approximately 156 Unmanned Combat Air Vehicles, 2,130 Air-Launched Cruise Missiles, and 450 intercontinental ballistic missiles. The USAF has 328,439 personnel on active duty, 74,000 in the Selected and Individual Ready Reserves, and 106,000 in the Air National Guard. In addition, the Air Force employs 168,900 civilian personnel including indirect hire of foreign nationals. However, after two decades of failure to recapitalize its aircraft under Clinton and the two Bushes, the USAF has its oldest and most outdated fleet ever. Tactical aircraft purchases were put off while Fifth-generation jet fighters were facing delays, cost overruns and cutbacks and the programs to replace the 1950s bomber and tanker fleets have just been started over again after many aborted attempts.[24]\\r\\nAn Air Force fighter pilot died 20 February 2008 after two F-15C jets collided during a training exercise over the Gulf of Mexico.[25]\\r\\nThe U.S. Air Force on 29 February 2008 announced one of the largest military acquisition programs in U.S. history, saying the service had chosen Northrop Grumman over Boeing to replace its aging air refueling tanker fleet.[26]\\r\\nThe pilot of an F-16C fighter General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon#F-16C/D jet that crashed in a remote area about 80 miles northwest of Phoenix, Arizona was killed when his plane went down. The plane was spotted late 13 March 2008. Rescuers could reach the site only by helicopter and arrived at daybreak 15 March 2008. There have been 17 other crashes of Luke Air Force Base F-16s since 1998, and only one of those resulted in a fatality. That crash happened in May 2004, when a pilot with the Republic of Singapore Air Force died after his jet went down during a training mission at an Air Force bombing range in southwest Arizona. The most recent crashes came in 2006. A pilot ejected safely from an F-16 in April 2006 after the lone engine on the jet exploded just after takeoff from the base. The aircraft came down in a cornfield.[27]\\r\\nOn 5 June 2008 Robert Gates announced the results of an investigation into the misshipment of four MK-12 forward-section reentry vehicle assemblies to Taiwan. The investigation, conducted by Admiral Kirkland H. Donald, director of the US Naval Nuclear Propulsion Program, found that the Taiwan missile incident was, in Gates' words, \\"A degradation of the authority, standards of excellence and technical competence within the nation's ICBM force. Similar to the bomber-specific August 2007 Minot-Barksdale nuclear weapons transfer incident, this incident took place within the larger environment of declining Air Force nuclear mission focus and performance\\" and that \\"the investigation identified commonalities between the August 2007 Minot incident and this [the Taiwan] event.\\" In his investigation report, Donald stated that the issues identified by his investigation were, \\"Indicative of an overall decline in Air Force nuclear weapons stewardship, a problem that has been identified but not effectively addressed for over a decade. Both the Minot-Barksdale nuclear weapons transfer incident and the Taiwan misshipment, while different in specifics, have a common origin: the gradual erosion of nuclear standards and a lack of effective oversight by Air Force leadership\\"[28]\\r\\nAs a result of the investigation, Gates announced that, \\"A substantial number of Air Force general officers and colonels have been identified as potentially subject to disciplinary measures, ranging from removal from command to letters of reprimand,\\" and that he had accepted the resignations of USAF Secretary Michael Wynne and USAF Chief of Staff Michael Moseley. Gates added that he had asked James R. Schlesinger to lead a senior-level task force to recommend improvements in the stewardship and operation of nuclear weapons, delivery vehicles and sensitive components by the US DoD. Members of the task force came from the Defense Policy Board and the Defense Science Board.[29]\\r\\nIn 2012, the USAF discovered that their billion dollar investment in the Expeditionary Combat Support System \\"has not yielded any significant military capability\\" and that it would take another billion dollar investment to gain even one quarter of the planned capability.[30]\\r\\nIn 2012 the USAF received push back from the Congress over a plan to retire multiple reserve squadrons, leading to the formation of the National Commission on the Structure of the Air Force to resolve the proper balance between active and reserve air forces.[31] This was followed in 2013 by the Total Force Task Force in an attempt to handle budget disagreements between the active and reserve forces.[32]\\r\\nIn 2014, the USAF's 30 year strategy document cited a need for both low end and high end capabilities, and so called for cuts in high demand UAVs in favor of retaining \\"outdated fighter aircraft that would not be survivable in a high end conflict\\".[33]","input":"When did army air corps become air force?"},{"output":"September 13, 1990","context":"Law & Order is an American police procedural and legal drama television series, created by Dick Wolf and part of the Law & Order franchise. It originally aired on NBC and, in syndication, on various cable networks. Law & Order premiered on September 13, 1990, and completed its 20th and final season on May 24, 2010. At the time of its cancellation, Law & Order was the longest-running crime drama on American primetime television. Its record of 20 seasons is a tie with Gunsmoke (1955ÿ75) for the longest-running live-action scripted American prime-time series with ongoing characters. Although it has fewer episodes than Gunsmoke, Law & Order ranks as the longest-running hour-long primetime TV series. Gunsmoke, for its first six seasons, was originally a half-hour program.\\r\\nSet and filmed in New York City, the series follows a two-part approach: the first half-hour is the investigation of a crime (usually murder) and apprehension of a suspect by New York City Police Department detectives; the second half is the prosecution of the defendant by the Manhattan District Attorney's Office. Plots are often based on real cases that recently made headlines, although the motivation for the crime and the perpetrator may be different.\\r\\nThe show has been noted for its revolving cast over the years. Among the longest-running main cast members were Steven Hill as District Attorney Adam Schiff (seasons 1ÿ10), Jerry Orbach as Detective Lennie Briscoe (seasons 3ÿ14), S. Epatha Merkerson as Lieutenant Anita Van Buren (seasons 4ÿ20), Sam Waterston as Executive Assistant District Attorney Jack McCoy (seasons 5ÿ20; later District Attorney) and Jesse L. Martin as Detective Ed Green (seasons 10ÿ18).\\r\\nThe success of the series has led to the creation of additional shows, making Law & Order a franchise, with also a television film, several video games, and international adaptations of the series. It has won and has been nominated for numerous awards over the years, including a number of Emmy Awards. On May 14, 2010, NBC announced that it had canceled Law & Order and would air the final episode on May 24, 2010.[1][2][3][4] Immediately following the show's cancellation, Wolf stated that he was attempting to find a new home for the series and would also consider a \\"last resort\\" plan to conclude the show with a two-hour TV film to air on NBC.[5] In July 2010, however, he indicated that those attempts had failed and declared that the series had now \\"moved to the history books\\".[6]\\r\\nHowever, in February 2015, rumors started that NBC was planning to bring the series back for 10 episodes.[7] In May 2015, former star Sam Waterston (EADA/DA Jack McCoy) announced to The Hollywood Reporter that he supports and would join a revival of Law & Order, saying: \\"You're darn right. Sure, I'd love it. Got to break the record.\\"[8] Creator Dick Wolf has expressed wanting to use a L&O revival to do a \\"ripped from the headlines\\" storyline surrounding the murder trial of Robert Durst, Wolf said \\"[Of all my past projects] I'd bring back Law & Order. Everybody who knows me knows it's something I want to do,\\" he continued, \\"my only regret looking backward is all the great stories that we haven't been able to do for the past five years.\\"[9] At the 2015 Television Critics Association summer press tour, Wolf noted everyone wants a revival, \\"It is a question of...most of the people involved are very successful in their careers. To try to get everything in sequence is much more difficult than it looks on the outside. I am always an optimist. I would love to do it if we can make it work.\\"[10]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1988, Dick Wolf developed a concept for a new television series that would depict a relatively optimistic picture of the American criminal justice system. He initially toyed with the idea of calling it Night & Day but then hit upon the title Law & Order. The first half of each episode would follow two detectives (a senior and a junior detective) and their commanding officer as they investigate a violent crime. The second half of the episode would follow the District Attorney's Office and the courts as two prosecutors, with advice from the District Attorney himself, attempt to convict the accused. Through this, Law & Order would be able to investigate some of the larger issues of the day by focusing on stories that were based on real cases making headlines.[11]\\r\\nWolf took the idea to then-president of Universal Television Kerry McCluggage, who pointed out the similarity to a 1963 series titled Arrest and Trial, which lasted one season. The two watched the pilot of that series, in which a police officer (Ben Gazzara) arrested a man for armed robbery in the first half, and the defense attorney, played by Chuck Connors gets the perpetrator off as the wrong guy in the second half; this was the formula of the show every week. Wolf decided that, while his detectives would occasionally also be fallible, he wanted a fresh approach to the genre, to go from police procedural to prosecution with a greater degree of realism. In addition, the prosecution would be the hero, a reversal of the usual formula in lawyer dramas.[12]\\r\\nInitially, Fox ordered thirteen episodes based on the concept alone, with no pilot. Then-network head Barry Diller reversed the decision. Although he loved the idea, he didn't believe it was a \\"Fox show\\". Wolf then went to CBS, which ordered a pilot, \\"Everybody's Favorite Bagman\\", written by Wolf about corrupt city officials involved with the mob. The network liked the pilot but did not order it because there were no breakout stars. In the summer of 1989, NBC's top executives, Brandon Tartikoff and Warren Littlefield, screened the pilot and liked it; but they were concerned the intensity of the series could not be repeated week after week.[12] However, by 1990, NBC executives had enough confidence that the innovative show could appeal to a wide audience that they ordered the series for a full season.[13]\\r\\nThe series was shot on location in New York City and is known for its extensive use of local color.[14][15] In later seasons, New York City mayors Rudy Giuliani and Michael Bloomberg, attorney William Kunstler and Bronx Congressman Jos Serrano all appeared on the show as themselves. Local personalities also had recurring cameos as fictional characters, such as Donna Hanover and Fran Lebowitz as judges. On September 14, 2004, in New York City, a road leading to Pier 62 at Chelsea Piers (where the series was mostly shot) was renamed \\"Law & Order Way\\" in tribute to the series.[16]\\r\\nAudio samples of Law & Order ?(media help)\\r\\nThe music for Law & Order was composed by veteran composer Mike Post, and was deliberately designed to be minimal to match the abbreviated style of the series.[17] Post wrote the theme song using electric piano, guitar, and clarinet.[18] In addition, scene changes were accompanied by a tone generated by Post. He refers to the tone as \\"The Clang,\\" while Entertainment Weekly critic Ken Tucker has referred to the sound as the \\"ominous chung CHUNG\\",[17] actor Dann Florek (in a promo) as the \\"doink doink\\",[19] and Richard Belzer as \\"the Dick Wolf Cash Register Sound.\\"[20] The tone moves the viewer from scene to scene, jumping forward in time with all the importance and immediacy of a judge's gavel ÿ which is exactly what Post was aiming for when he created it. \\"The Clang\\" is an amalgamation of nearly a dozen sounds, including an actual gavel, a jail door slamming, and five hundred Japanese monks walking across a hardwood floor.[17][21][22][23] The sound has become so associated with the Law & Order brand that it was also carried over to other series of the franchise.[22]\\r\\nThe UK-aired Channel Five versions of seasons 7ÿ16 of Law & Order[24] and Seasons 1ÿ9 of Law & Order: Special Victims Unit[25] feature the song \\"I'm Not Driving Anymore\\" by Rob Dougan in the opening credits with \\"Urban Warfare\\" by Paul Dinletir being used for Seasons 10ÿ11 after that Seasons 16ÿ20 of Law & Order and Seasons 12+ of SVU used the US theme. Another Rob Dougan track, \\"There's Only Me\\", was used as the theme for seasons 1ÿ6 of Law & Order: Criminal Intent,[26] with Urban Warfare again being used for Seasons 7ÿ8 and the US theme being used for Seasons 9ÿ10.\\r\\nFor the 1988 pilot, George Dzundza and Chris Noth were cast as the original detectives, Sergeant Max Greevey and Detective Mike Logan.[27] The producers felt that Dzundza would be a perfect senior police officer as he was someone the producers felt they could see themselves riding along with in a police cruiser.[28] Noth and Michael Madsen were candidates for the role of Logan. Madsen initially was considered the perfect choice for the role, but, in a final reading, it was felt that Madsen's acting mannerisms were repetitive, and Noth received the role instead.[29] Rounding out the police cast, Dann Florek was cast as Captain Donald Cragen.[27]\\r\\nOn the prosecutor's side, Michael Moriarty was Dick Wolf's choice to play Executive Assistant District Attorney Benjamin \\"Ben\\" Stone. The network, however, preferred James Naughton, but, in the end, Wolf's choice would prevail, and Moriarty received the role.[27] As his ADA, Richard Brooks and Eriq La Salle were being considered for the role of Paul Robinette. The network favored La Salle but, once again, the producers' choice prevailed, and Brooks received the role.[30] As their boss, Roy Thinnes was cast as District Attorney Alfred Wentworth.[27]\\r\\nNearly two years passed between the pilot and production of the series. The producers held options on Dzundza, Noth, Moriarty and Brooks. Each was paid holding money for the additional year and brought back. Florek also returned. Thinnes, however, was starring in Dark Shadows and declined to return. In his place, the producers tapped Steven Hill to play District Attorney Adam Schiff,[30] a character loosely based on real-life New York County District Attorney Robert Morgenthau. Hill brought prestige and experience to the show and, as such, the producers allowed Hill to give insight on the direction he thought the character should go.[31]\\r\\nDzundza was disappointed when he realized that the show would be more of an ensemble show rather than a show starring him. Though the cast liked his performance, they increasingly felt uncomfortable around Dzundza, who was also under stress due to the constant commute between New York City and his home in Los Angeles. Dzundza quit after only one season on the show, and Sergeant Greevey was written off as being killed in the line of duty.[32] He was replaced by Paul Sorvino as Sergeant Phil Cerreta, who was considered more even tempered than either Max Greevey or Mike Logan. Sorvino was initially excited about the role, but would leave midway through the next season, citing the exhausting schedule demanded by the filming of the show, a need to broaden his horizons, and the desire to preserve his vocal cords for singing opera as reasons for leaving the show. Sergeant Cerreta was written off as having been shot in the line of duty and transferring to a desk job at another precinct.[33] To replace Sorvino on the series, Wolf cast Jerry Orbach (who had previously guest starred as a defense attorney in the Season 2 episode \\"The Wages of Love\\") in the role of Detective Leonard W. \\"Lennie\\" Briscoe.[34] Orbach's characterization of the world-weary, wisecracking Detective Briscoe was based on a similar NYPD character he portrayed in the 1981 film Prince Of The City, which Wolf had personally requested Orbach to replicate for the show.[35]\\r\\nIntroduced on a recurring basis during Season 2 was Carolyn McCormick as Dr. Elizabeth Olivet, a police psychologist brought in on a case-by-case basis. NBC had been pushing for the producers to add female characters to the all-male cast.[36] She was added to the opening credits as \\"also starring\\" in Season 3 and 4[37] but, despite the attempts of the producers to include her in as many episodes as possible, it was found to be difficult to incorporate her into the show due to the format leaning heavily on the police and prosecutors.[36] She was removed from the credits in Season 5.[37] McCormick stayed with the show on a recurring basis, but believed that the character had become less profound and complex, and that her role had been reduced mostly to \\"psychobabble.\\" She left to star on Cracker after Season 7.[38] After the cancellation of Cracker, she returned beginning in Season 13 and appeared occasionally until Season 20.[39]\\r\\nBy the end of Season 3, NBC executives still felt the show did not have enough female characters. On the orders of then-network president Warren Littlefield, new female characters had to be added to the cast or the show would face possible cancellation on its relegated Friday night time slot. Wolf realized that, since there were only six characters on the show, someone had to be dismissed. He chose to dismiss Florek and Brooks from the regular roster, and later said it was the hardest two phone calls he had ever made. Though producers initially claimed the firings, especially that of Brooks, who was said not to get along with Moriarty, were for other reasons, Wolf confirmed that the firings were on the orders of Littlefield.[40] To replace Florek, S. Epatha Merkerson was cast as new squad leader Lieutenant Anita Van Buren. (Merkerson had previously guest starred as a mother of a gunshot victim in the Season 1 episode \\"Mushrooms.\\")[41] To replace Brooks, Jill Hennessy was cast as Assistant District Attorney Claire Kincaid. Though no initial explanation was given on the show for the departures of Florek's or Brooks's characters, they would both later return in guest appearances, with Captain Cragen having been reassigned to the Internal Affairs Bureau and ADA Robinette having become a defense attorney. Florek also returned to direct a few episodes, and his character was eventually added to the cast of Law & Order: Special Victims Unit.[42]\\r\\nMeanwhile, Moriarty's behavior both on and off the set became problematic for Wolf. After a public statement in which Moriarty called Attorney General Janet Reno a \\"psychopathic Nazi\\" for her efforts to censor television violence, Moriarty engaged in a verbal confrontation with Reno at a dinner in Washington, D.C. Wolf asked Moriarty to tone down his comments, and Moriarty responded by quitting the show the next week. The final storyline for Ben Stone involved him resigning over guilt after a woman he compelled to testify against a Russian mobster was murdered by his cohorts. To replace Moriarty, Sam Waterston was Wolf's first choice for the role of Executive Assistant District Attorney John J. \\"Jack\\" McCoy Jr.; Waterston's character was markedly different from Moriarty's in that Jack McCoy was conceived as more emotionally stable and having more sex appeal.[43]\\r\\nWolf dismissed Noth when his contract expired at the end of Season 5, because he felt that Lennie Briscoe and Mike Logan had become too similar to each other and the writers were having difficulty in writing their dialogue together. Furthermore, Noth had been disgruntled with the show since the dismissals of Florek and Brooks, and remained embittered against Wolf, who he felt was not a friend to his actors. The final story line for Detective Logan involved him being banished to work on Staten Island in a domestic violence crimes unit as punishment for punching a city council member who had orchestrated the murder of a gay colleague and had managed to get acquitted of the charges. (The made-for-television film Exiled: A \\"Law & Order\\" Movie, in which Noth starred, centered around Logan attempting to get back into the department's good graces.) Noth was replaced by Benjamin Bratt as Detective Reynaldo \\"Rey\\" Curtis, who was hired in an attempt to find an actor even sexier than Noth to join the cast.[44]\\r\\nHennessy chose not to renew her three-year contract at the end of Season 6 to pursue other projects, and Claire Kincaid was written off as being killed in a drunk driving accident.[45] She was replaced by Carey Lowell as Assistant District Attorney Jamie Ross. Lowell remained with the show until the end of Season 8, when she left to spend more time with her daughter. (Jamie Ross was written off as leaving the D.A.'s office for similar reasons.)[46] Lowell (who later returned for a couple guest appearances) was replaced by Angie Harmon as Assistant District Attorney Abigail \\"Abbie\\" Carmichael, who was conceived as being much louder and outspoken than any of her predecessors. Harmon auditioned with 85 other women, including Vanessa Williams, for the role, and was picked after Wolf heard her Texas accent.[47]\\r\\nBratt left the series at the end of Season 9, stating it was an amicable departure and he expected to eventually return for guest appearances. (He ultimately returned for the Season 20 episode \\"Fed.\\") Detective Curtis was written off as leaving the force in order to take care of his wife, who was suffering from multiple sclerosis, in her final days.[48] He was replaced by Jesse L. Martin as Detective Ed Green, who was conceived of as more of a loose cannon in the mold of Mike Logan than Rey Curtis was.[49] (Briscoe was described as being a recovering alcoholic, as Cragen had been; Green was described as being a recovering compulsive gambler.) In 2000, Hill announced he was leaving the series after Season 10. Hill, who was the last remaining member of the original cast, said his departure was mutual with the producers. He was replaced by Dianne Wiest as Interim District Attorney Nora Lewin, and Adam Schiff was written out off-screen as departing to work with Jewish charities and human-rights organizations in Europe.[50]\\r\\nThe following year, Harmon left the show after three seasons (with Abbie Carmichael written off as being called on to serve the U.S. Attorney's office) and was replaced by Elisabeth R?hm as Assistant District Attorney Serena Southerlyn.[51] The year after that, Wiest left the show after two seasons and was replaced by retiring U.S. Senator Fred Thompson as District Attorney Arthur Branch, whose character was conceived of as being much more right-leaning than his predecessors in the DA's office, and was a direct reaction to the September 11 attacks.[52] No mention was made on the show of what happened to Nora Lewin, though producers said her character was only supposed to be an interim DA.\\r\\nAfter 12 years on Law & Order, Orbach announced in March 2004 that he was leaving the show at the end of Season 14 for the spin-off Law & Order: Trial by Jury. Lennie Briscoe was written off as retiring from the NYPD and later taking a position as an investigator for the DA's office. He was replaced at the 27th Precinct by Detective Joe Fontana, played by Dennis Farina.[53] At the time, Orbach would not state the reason for his departure,[53] but it was eventually revealed that he had been battling prostate cancer (for over 10 years) and that his role on Trial by Jury was designed to be less taxing on him than his role on the original series was. However, Orbach died from his cancer on December 28, 2004 and was featured in only the first two episodes of Trial by Jury. (His character was subsequently written off as having also died off-screen, though this was not revealed on the original series until the Season 18 episode \\"Burn Card.\\")[54]\\r\\nSeason 15 would see the departure of R?hm mid-season. R?hm's final scene on the show, in the episode \\"Ain't No Love,\\" sparked controversy within the fanbase, as ADA Southerlyn asked Arthur Branch if she was being fired because she was gay, a fact the scripts had never even hinted at until then.[55] Wolf said R?hm's departure was unexpected, and she exited the show in January 2005. Her replacement was Annie Parisse as Assistant District Attorney Alexandra Borgia. Later that season, Martin departed early to film Rent. Ed Green was temporarily written off as being shot in the line of duty and being replaced during his recovery by Detective Nick Falco, played by Michael Imperioli, who had previously guest starred as a murder suspect in the Season 6 episode \\"Atonement.\\"[56] Parisse left the series at the end of Season 16 (with ADA Borgia written off as being murdered), and Farina announced shortly afterward that he too was leaving Law & Order to pursue other projects. (Detective Fontana was written off as having retired off-screen.)[57]\\r\\nBy this point, NBC executives believed the series was beginning to show its age, as the ratings had been declining since Orbach's departure.[58] Farina had never been popular with fans when he replaced Orbach, and it was felt that the cast just did not seem to mesh well together anymore.[55] In an effort to revitalize the show, Wolf replaced Parisse with Alana de la Garza as Assistant District Attorney Consuela \\"Connie\\" Rubirosa, while Martin's character was promoted to senior detective and partnered with Detective Nina Cassady, played by Milena Govich, who had worked with Wolf on the short-lived series Conviction and served as the show's first female detective of the main cast.[58]\\r\\nHowever, Govich proved to be even more unpopular with fans than her predecessor was, and she left the show after one season, with the explanation being that Detective Cassady's assignment to the precinct had been temporary and had been transferred out. She was replaced by Jeremy Sisto, who had previously guest starred as a defense attorney in the Season 17 episode \\"The Family Hour,\\" as Detective Cyrus Lupo.[59] Around the same time, Thompson announced he would leave the show to seek the 2008 Republican presidential nomination. (No explanation was given within the show regarding Arthur Branch's off-screen departure.) Waterston's character was promoted to Interim District Attorney (later made full District Attorney in Season 20) and his former position was filled in by Executive Assistant District Attorney Michael Cutter, played by Linus Roache.[60][61]\\r\\nMartin later announced that he would leave the show for the second and last time near the end of Season 18 to pursue other endeavors, and Detective Green was written off as resigning from the force due to burnout. He was replaced by Anthony Anderson as Detective Kevin Bernard.[55] In 2010, Merkerson announced that she would leave the show at the end of Season 20, with Lieutenant Van Buren given a season-long story arc involving her battling cervical cancer.[62] However, the cancellation of the show rendered this moot.\\r\\n??????????Opening narration, spoken by Steven Zirnkilton.[63][64]\\r\\nLaw & Order episodes are typically segmented into two parts, roughly at the halfway point; the first part follows police and detective work, and the second follows the legal and courtroom proceedings of the case. The show dwells little on the characters' back-stories or social lives, focusing mainly on their lives at work.\\r\\nFor most of Law & Order's run, the cold open or lead-in of the show began with the discovery of a crime, usually a murder. The scene typically began with a slice of everyday life in New York City. Some civilians would then discover the crime victim, or sometimes the crime would occur in a public place and they would be witnesses or a victim of a crime. The only exceptions to this are in the early seasons, mostly Seasons 1 & 2, the crime would usually be discovered by a pair of patrol officers or beat cops, or in later seasons when the cold open was replaced with rapid cuts of the victim's final moments, similar to Law & Order: Criminal Intent.\\r\\nThe police are represented in the show by the New York City Police Department 27th Precinct homicide department. In the show it is common that the detectives also investigate cases other than homicide or attempted homicides, like kidnappings and rape, the latter especially in the first nine seasons of the show, before Law & Order: Special Victims Unit premiered. However, in the real world these cases are handled by other units and divisions.\\r\\nThe viewers are introduced to two homicide detectives, a senior detective (usually a veteran cop) and a junior detective (usually a young but capable detective), who report directly to their boss at their precinct (either a Lieutenant or a Captain). During the preliminary crime scene examination, the featured detectives make their first observations and will come up with theories followed by a witticism or two, before the title sequence begins.\\r\\nThe detectives often have few or no good cluesthey might not even know the victim's identityand must usually chase several dead ends before finding a likely suspect(s).\\r\\nThey start their investigations at the crime scene by talking to any witnesses while the Crime Scene Unit (CSU) technicians start processing the scene by collecting forensic evidence. The medical examiner (M.E.)'s office will also be shown to collect the body from the crime scene.\\r\\nLater the medical examiner will perform an autopsy on the victim, offering more clues to the victim's cause and time of death (sometimes obtaining the victim's identity from dental records or fingerprints) which the detectives will read about in the M.E.'s autopsy report and by talking to the M.E. who performed it. When the detectives know the victim's identity they will inform their relatives or loved ones of their death and attempt to get more information on the victim's life and possible suspects.\\r\\nThe detectives continue their investigation by interviewing witnesses and possible suspects, all the while tracing the victim's last known movements and victim's state of mind (by talking to the victim's family, friends and co-workers). Sometimes they will have someone they suspect of the crime and will trace their last known movements and state of mind by talking to the people in the suspect's life, until they are either ruled out or dead certain of their guilt. They also visit the crime laboratory to submit and view evidence (e.g. fingerprints, DNA and ballistics, etc.), they may also look into any background information such as financial details and criminal history on both the victim and lead suspect. In some instances, psychologists and/or psychiatrists are called in for insight into the criminal's behavior or modus operandi. All the while, the detectives report to their commanding officer, keeping them informed and being advised on how best to proceed next.\\r\\nWhen the detectives are certain they have the right suspect(s), the police will take the case to their boss, who decides if there is enough for a search and/or arrest warrant (though sometimes the commanding officer will consult with the New York City District Attorney's office to see if the case is strong enough) and whether or not any backup (such as uniformed officers or an armed tactical team) is needed. The detectives will then arrest the suspects(s), with the police sometimes having to chase the accused through the streets of New York. The scene then shifts to the interrogation room where the detectives interrogate the suspect(s) until they ask for a lawyer, their defense attorney shows up and asks the suspect not to talk anymore, or the Assistant District Attorney from the D.A.'s office decides they have enough to press charges.\\r\\nTowards the middle of a show, the police will begin to work with the prosecutors to make the arrest, though sometimes the Assistant District Attorney will appear earlier to arrange a plea-for-information deal or to decide if the detectives have enough evidence for search or arrest warrants before arresting the suspects. An arraignment court scene will follow, in which the defendants plead (usually not guilty) and bail conditions are set.\\r\\nThe matter is then taken over by a pair of representatives from the New York County District Attorney's Office, an Executive Assistant District Attorney and an Assistant District Attorney. They discuss deals, prepare the witnesses and evidence, and conduct the People's case in the trial. The District Attorneys work together and with the Medical Examiner's office, the crime laboratory (including fingerprint analysts, DNA profilers and ballistics analysts), and psychologists or psychiatrists (if the defendant uses an insanity plea), all of whom may be needed to testify in court for the prosecution. The police may also reappear to testify in court or to arrest another suspect, but most investigation in the second segment is done by the D.A.'s office, in consultation with the District Attorney for advice on the case, as the D.A., being an elected official, sometimes brings political considerations to bear concerning decisions to prosecute various alleged offenders. If the case is very weak then the police would re-investigate.\\r\\nUnlike many other legal dramas (e.g., The Defenders, Matlock, Perry Mason and L.A. Law), the court proceedings are shown from the prosecution's point of view, with the regular characters trying to prove the defendant's guilt, not innocence. After the arraignment of defendants, the D.A.s proceed to trial preparation, including legal research and plea negotiations. Some episodes include legal proceedings beyond the testimony of witnesses, including motion hearings, (often concerning admissibility of evidence); jury selection; and allocutions, usually as a result of plea bargains. Many episodes employ motions to suppress evidence as a plot device, and most of these end with evidence or statements being suppressed, often on a technicality. This usually begins with the service of the motion to the D.A. team, follows with argument and case citations of precedent before a judge in court, and concludes with visual reaction of the winning or losing attorney.\\r\\nMany episodes use outlandish defense scenarios such as diminished responsibility (e.g. \\"Genetics\\"/\\"Television\\"/\\"God\\"/\\"the devil made me do it\\" and intoxication defence) and temporary insanity (e.g. \\"Black Rage\\"/\\"White Rage\\"/\\"Sports Rage\\"). Some episodes revolve around moral and ethical debates including the right to die (euthanasia), the right to life (abortion), and the right to bear arms (gun control). Episodes usually end with the verdict being read by the jury foreperson and a shot of both the winning and losing parties. The scene then shifts to the District Attorney's office, where the team is leaving the office to go home while contemplating either the true guilt of the accused, the defense scenarios that were used, or the moral or ethical issue that was central to the episode.\\r\\nOften the plot of an initial portion of an episode resembles a recognizable aspect of an actual case.[65] In early seasons, the details of these cases often closely followed the real stories, such as the season one episode \\"Subterranean Homeboy Blues,\\" which had a woman shooting two attempted muggers, paralleling the Bernhard Goetz case. Another early episode, \\"Out of the Half-Light,\\" focused on a racially charged rape case that mimicked the Tawana Brawley case. This \\"ripped from the headlines\\" style is reflected in the opening credits sequence that evolves from newspaper halftones to high-resolution photos. Another first-season episode, \\"Poison Ivy,\\" was based on the Edmund Perry case where an NYPD officer fatally shot a black honor student who was committing a crime in front of the officer upon returning to the city after recently graduating from an Ivy League prep school. Later seasons would take real-life cases as inspiration but diverge more from the facts. Often this would be done by increasing the severity of the crime in question, usually by adding a murder. As a result, the plot would tend to veer significantly from the actual events that may have inspired the episode.[65] Promotional advertisements of episodes with close real-life case parallels regularly use the \\"ripped from the headlines\\" phrase, although a textual disclaimer, within the actual episode, emphasizes that the story and characters are fictional. This format lends itself to exploring different outcomes or motives that similar events could have had under other circumstances.\\r\\nSome real-life crime victims have felt used and exploited,[65] with one lawyer, Ravi Batra, going so far as to sue the show in 2004 for libel.[66]\\r\\nLaw & Order premiered September 13, 1990, and aired on NBC, with 456 episodes having been produced.\\r\\nThe show premiered September 13, 1990, and ended on May 24, 2010. 456 episodes were aired and produced. The show ran for twenty seasons on NBC. It was NBC's longest running crime drama, and tied for longest running primetime scripted drama with Gunsmoke. The first two seasons were broadcast Tuesdays at 10 p.m. From season 3 through 16 the show aired Wednesday at 10 p.m. For season 17 it moved to Fridays at 10 p.m. For seasons 18 and 19 the show shifted back to Wednesdays at 10 p.m. For season 20 the show was broadcast Fridays at 8 p.m., while in the spring it moved to Mondays at 10 p.m., where it broadcast its series finale on May 24, 2010.\\r\\nRepeats of Law & Order were first broadcast weekdays on A&E beginning in the mid 1990s and are credited with drawing a new audience to the current weekly NBC episodes. As of January 1, 2014, the series is being telecast on SundanceTV, TNT, WE tv, and WGN America.\\r\\nOn May 13, 2010, reports surfaced of the possibility that Law & Order could be canceled after 20 seasons on the air, preventing it from unseating Gunsmoke as longest running American primetime drama unless another network picked it up.[72] This is due to disagreements between NBC and Wolf in regards to the show's finance in order to continue on for another season. Negotiations were made for the TNT Network to finance newer episodes in order to continue getting reruns of the show. When those plans fell through, NBC discussed with Wolf the possibility of him personsally financing, given all the earnings he's made as executive producers for all the L&O shows. Wolf had refused with reps issuing how that deal was Never going to happen.\\r\\nBy May 14, 2010, The New York Times, Daily Variety and the Los Angeles Times reported official cancellation of the series.[73] Continuation of characters on spin-off seriesincluding Law & Order: Los Angeleshas been mentioned as a possible means of providing closure beyond the series finale.[73]\\r\\nOn May 14, 2010, NBC officially canceled the show, opting instead to pick up Law & Order: Los Angeles for a first season, and renewed Law & Order: Special Victims Unit for a twelfth.[1] The cancellation was announced after last-minute talks between NBC and Dick Wolf to extend the series failed to lead to an agreement.\\r\\nThe chairman of NBC Universal Television Entertainment, Jeff Gaspin, stated: \\"The full measure of the collective contributions made by Dick Wolf and his Law & Order franchise over the last two decades to the success of NBC and Universal Media Studios cannot be overstated. The legacy of his original Law & Order series will continue to make an impact like no other series before.\\"[74]\\r\\nAngela Bromstad, President, Primetime Entertainment, NBC and Universal Media Studios, said, \\"Law & Order has been one of the most successful franchises in the history of television, which is why it is so critical that we continue this important brand and our relationship with Dick Wolf and his team with L&O: LA and Law & Order: SVU.\\"[74]\\r\\nFollowing the cancellation announcement, Wolf announced that he still hoped to continue the series, and stated that he was seeking \\"other offers\\" from potential outlets to air the series. Wolf also discussed the possibility of airing a two-hour TV film on NBC to conclude Law & Order, but said that such a plan had been delayed until he had exhausted every other possibility for continuing the series. Wolf did not specify whether NBC had already offered to air such a movie.[5]\\r\\nDick Wolf stated that, \\"The flagship series is in a medically induced coma, waiting for a life-saving medicine.\\" Wolf was pressuring the series' producer NBC/Universal Media Studios to make a deal with TNT, which holds syndication rights to the show, for originals if an acceptable license fee could be bargained. Talks between the two started up after upfronts.[75] However, TNT said in a statement it was not interested in picking up a 21st season for the series.[76]\\r\\nExecutive producer Ren Balcer spoke to Neal Conan on Talk of the Nation on May 24, stating that \\"we're not dead yet\\" and noting that there were still ongoing negotiations with cable outlets to see if the original series could be refloated. Balcer referenced the \\"medically induced coma\\" brought up by Wolf, calling the show's cancellation \\"corporately-induced\\".[77]\\r\\nAlthough NBC cancelled the series, AMC started talking about reviving Law & Order;[78] however, attempts to revive it failed, and according to creator Dick Wolf, the series \\"moved into the history books\\".[6][79]\\r\\nAlmost exactly one year later, on May 13, 2011, NBC canceled Law & Order: LA following a decline in the ratings after the show had been retooled and moved to Monday nights.[80]\\r\\nIn February 2015, rumors started that NBC was planning to bring Law & Order back for 10 episodes, as a limited series.[81]\\r\\nThe longevity and success of Law & Order has spawned five American television series (Law & Order: Special Victims Unit, Law & Order: Criminal Intent, Law & Order: Trial by Jury, Law & Order: Los Angeles, and Law & Order True Crime), as well as a television film (Exiled: A Law & Order Movie), all of which use the name Law & Order. Although there were fears initially that the failure of such shows could hurt the original series, it was felt the brand name was needed because of the commercial desirability such a brand name creates.[82] To differentiate it from other series in the franchise, Law & Order is often referred to as \\"The Mother Ship\\" by producers and critics.[83]\\r\\nThe series (and its spin-offs) shared a universe with the series Homicide: Life on the Street, with the two sharing several crossover episodes.\\r\\nThe original series has also been adapted for British television as Law & Order: UK, with the setting changed to London. Similarly, Law & Order: Criminal Intent has been adapted for French and Russian television under the respective titles Paris enqutes criminelles and y  Ť. 楰ѿŤֳ ֶ춶, and Law & Order: Special Victims Unit has also had a Russian version, y  楾: ҳ춶 Ť־ 󶶿־ҳ.\\r\\nSeasonal rankings (based on average total viewers per episode) of Law & Order on NBC.\\r\\nNote: Each U.S. network television season starts in late September and ends in late May, which coincides with the completion of May sweeps. Season 18 started in January and was held back as a mid-season replacement when NBC announced their 2007ÿ08 schedule in May 2007. The 20th-season premiere was on Friday, September 25, 2009 at 8:00?pm (ET) and 7:00?pm (CT) on NBC.\\r\\nLaw & Order has been nominated for numerous awards in the television industry over the span of its run. Among its wins are the 1997 Emmy Award for Outstanding Drama Series, Screen Actors Guild Awards for Outstanding Male Actor in a Drama Series for Sam Waterston in 1999 and Jerry Orbach in 2005 (awarded after his death), and numerous Edgar Awards for Best Episode in a Television Series Teleplay.\\r\\nIn 2002, Law & Order was ranked No. 24 on TV Guide's 50 Greatest TV Shows of All Time.[101] The show also placed No. 27 on Entertainment Weekly's \\"New TV Classics\\" list.[102]\\r\\nIn 2013, TV Guide ranked Law & Order #14 on their list of the 60 Greatest Shows of All Time.[103]\\r\\nUniversal Studios Home Entertainment has released fourteen seasons on DVD in Region 1, along with the complete series.

Nepal is governed according to the Constitution which came into effect on Sept 20, 2015, replacing the Interim Constitution of 2007. The constitution of Nepal is divided into: 35 parts, 308 Articles and 9 Schedules .\\r\\nThe Constitution was drafted by the Second Constituent Assembly following the failure of the First Constituent Assembly to produce a constitution in its mandated period.[1] The constitution was endorsed by 90% of the total lawmakers. Out of 598 CA members, 538 voted in favor of the constitution while 60 voted against it, including few Terai based political parties refrained from the voting process.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Interim Constitution provides for a Constituent Assembly, which was charged with writing Nepal's permanent constitution. Under the terms of the Interim Constitution, the new constitution was to be promulgated by April 28, 2010, but the Constituent Assembly postponed the promulgation by a year because of disagreements. On May 25, 2011, the Supreme Court of Nepal ruled that the 2010 extension of the Interim Constitution was not right. Since May 29, 2011 the Constituent Assembly repeatedly extended the Interim Constitution.\\r\\nOn May 28, 2012, the Constituent Assembly was dissolved after it failed to finish the constitution after the latest extension, ending four years of constitution drafting and leaving the country in a legal vacuum.[3][4] New elections were held on November 19, 2013 to the Second Nepalese Constituent Assembly and political leaders pledged to draft a new constitution within a year.[5][needs update]. The new assembly expressly committed that the new constitution would be promulgated on January 22, 2015. However, due to continued differences on key issues including system of governance, judicial system and federation issues like number, name and areas of the states to be carved, the constitution could not be finalized and promulgated in time.\\r\\nThe constitution is largely written in gender neutral term. Some of the important aspects of the constitution include the following:\\r\\nWe, the Sovereign People of Nepal, Internalizing the people's sovereign right and right to autonomy and self-rule, while maintaining freedom, sovereignty, territorial integrity, national unity, independence and dignity of Nepal, Recalling the glorious history of historic people's movements, armed conflict, dedication and sacrifice undertaken by the Nepalese people at times for the interest of the nation, democracy and progressive changes, and respecting for the martyrs and disappeared and victim citizens, Ending all forms of discrimination and oppression created by the feudalistic, autocratic, centralized, unitary system of governance, Protecting and promoting social and cultural solidarity, tolerance and harmony, and unity in diversity by recognizing the multi-ethnic, multi-lingual, multi-religious, multi-cultural and diverse regional characteristics, resolving to build an egalitarian society founded on the proportional inclusive and participatory principles in order to ensure economic equality, prosperity and social justice, by eliminating discrimination based on class, caste, region, language, religion and gender and all forms of caste- based untouchability, and Being committed to socialism based on democratic norms and values including the people's competitive multiparty democratic system of governance, civil liberties, fundamental rights, human rights, adult franchise, periodic elections, full freedom of the press, and independent, impartial and competent judiciary and concept of the rule of law, and build a prosperous nation,Do hereby pass and promulgate this Constitution, through the Constituent Assembly, in order to fulfil the aspirations for sustainable peace, good governance, development and prosperity through the federal, democratic, republican, system of governance.\\r\\nIn the 68 years history of constitutional development onto this Constitution, Nepal experienced 7 different constitutions in different time period. Previous constitutions of Nepal were enacted in 1948, 1951, 1959, 1962, 1990 and 2007.[6]\\r\\nIn 1948, the Government of Nepal Act was enacted. Since the mid-nineteenth century, the country had been a monarchy where the prime ministers, from the Rana dynasty, had sweeping control over the affairs of the state.[7] The 1948 document introduced limited democratic elements, but the experiment was not successful due to the misgivings of the Rana rulers to give away power.[8]\\r\\nThe Interim Government of Nepal Act 1951 was promulgated after the Revolution of 1951 at the end of the Rana period.[9] This text strengthened the authority of the king, and introduced relevant reforms such as the creation of the Supreme Court and the inclusion of fundamental rights and socio-economic goals to be pursued by the state.[10]\\r\\nThe Constitution of the Kingdom of Nepal, 1959 followed the previously mentioned interim text. Interestingly, despite the establishment of a bicameral parliament, the king continued to hold important powers such as the prerogative to appoint half of the members of the Senate and the suspension of parliament under certain circumstances.[11]\\r\\nThe democratic experiment was short-lived, as in 1962 a new constitution came in to eliminate political parties, and to introduce the so-called panchayat system. In this model, panchayats were councils organized at the local level, presumably to ensure the representation of citizens. However, the king exercised much stronger authority than in the 1959 regime. and could modify the constitution or suspend it in case of emergency.[12]\\r\\nIn 1990, the first Jana Andolan, Popular Revolt, brought multi-party democracy back to Nepal. The Constitution of the Kingdom of Nepal, 1990 lifted the ban on political parties, described a democratic representative system where the authority of the king was curtailed, and enshrined fundamental rights.[13] Although the 1990 constitution substantially increased the democratic character of the state in comparison with the Panchayat Regime, critiques have argued that this text did not adequately represent all sectors of society, even though Nepal is a multi-cultural country where diverse social groups coexist [14]\\r\\nAgain following the 2007 democracy movement in Nepal, Interim Constitution was promulgated in 2007.\\r\\nThe promulgation of the new constitution was immediately followed by virtual blockade of all checkpoints at Nepal-India border. Various Human Rights Activists and some ethnic groups in lowland Nepal have accused the Constitution of being gender discriminatory especially in regards to citizenship provisions. They allege new constitution makes it difficult for woman to pass on citizenship to their children as compared to men.[15]\\r\\nSimilarly, Madhesi and indigenous population view that the new constitution fails to address demands of marginalized communities and support status-quo of the ruling groups. They are protesting mainly over the federal delineation of new states as proposed in the constitution fearing existing demarcation could affect their political representation.[16][17] With the protest ongoing since August 15, 2015 or earlier, at least 45 people, including 8 security personals and one Indian National, have been killed. Human Rights Watch has criticized the Nepal Government as well as the protesters for violation of human rights during the protest.[18][19] Additionally, there is controversy over Nepalese citizenship rules, which Nepal deems to protect the state from being overwhelmed by Indian immigrants, and which India claims discriminates against Madhesis of Indian origins, the draft constitution and final constitution that passed differ on this issue.\\r\\nThe conditions to be fulfilled to be a Nepalese Citizen are outlined below (Copied from Section 11, Part 2, Constitution of Nepal, 2015)(final) [20]\\r\\n(1) The persons who have acquired citizenship of Nepal at the commencement of this Constitution and the persons who are eligible to acquire citizenship of Nepal under this Part shall be deemed to be the citizens of Nepal.\\r\\n(2) The following persons who have their permanent domicile in Nepal shall be deemed to be citizens of Nepal by descent:-\\r\\n(a) A person who has acquired the citizenship of Nepal by descent before the commencement of this constitution.\\r\\n(b) Any person whose father or mother was a citizen of Nepal at the birth of such a person.\\r\\n(3) A child of a citizen who has acquired citizenship of Nepal by birth before the commencement of this Constitution shall, if his/her father and mother both are the citizens of Nepal, shall be entitled to Nepali citizenship by descent upon his/her attaining the age of majority.\\r\\n(4) Every child found in Nepal whereabouts of whose paternity and maternity is not known shall, until the mother or father is traced, be deemed a citizen of Nepal by descent.\\r\\n(5) A person born to a Nepali citizen mother and having his/her domicile in Nepal but whose father is not traced, shall be conferred the Nepali citizenship by descent.\\r\\nProvided that in case his/her father is found to be a foreigner, the citizenship of such a person shall be converted to naturalized citizenship according to the Federal law.\\r\\n(6) If a foreign woman married to a Nepali citizen so wishes, she may acquire naturalized citizenship of Nepal as provided for in a Federal law.\\r\\n(7) Notwithstanding anything contained elsewhere in this Article, in case of a person born to Nepali woman citizen married to a foreign citizen, he/she may acquire naturalized citizenship of Nepal as provided for by a Federal law if he/she is having the permanent domicile in Nepal and he/she has not acquired citizenship of the foreign country.\\r\\nProvided that if his/her father and mother both are the citizen of Nepal at the time of acquisition of the citizenship, he/she, if born in Nepal, may acquire citizenship by descent.\\r\\n(8) Except provided for in this Article, Government of Nepal may confer naturalized citizenship of Nepal according to Federal law.\\r\\n(9) Government of Nepal may confer honorary citizenship according to Federal law.\\r\\n(10) In case any area is annexed into Nepal by merger, the persons having domicile in such area shall be citizens of Nepal subject to a Federal law.","input":"When was the constitution of nepal 2072 declared?"},{"output":"Constantine the Great","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Church of the Holy Sepulchre[b] (Arabic: ????????? ???????????? Kanؐsatu al-Qiymah; Greek: ϫ?? ?? ?ϫ?? Naos tes Anastaseos; Armenian: ????? ????????? ????? Surb Harut'yan ta??ar; Latin: Ecclesia Sancti Sepulchri; Hebrew: ?????? ?????, Knesiyat ha-Kever; also called the Church of the Resurrection or Church of the Anastasis by Orthodox Christians) is a church[1] in the Christian Quarter of the Old City of Jerusalem. The church contains, according to traditions dating back to at least the fourth century, the two holiest sites in Christianity: the site where Jesus of Nazareth was crucified,[2] at a place known as \\"Calvary\\" or \\"Golgotha\\", and Jesus's empty tomb, where he is said to have been buried and resurrected.[3] The tomb is enclosed by the 19th-century shrine, called the Aedicule (Edicule). The Status Quo, a 150-year-old understanding between religious communities, applies to the site.[4][5]\\r\\n\\r\\nWithin the church proper are the last four (or, by some definitions, five) Stations of the Via Dolorosa, representing the final episodes of Jesus' Passion. The church has been a major Christian pilgrimage destination since its creation in the fourth century, as the traditional site of the Resurrection of Christ, thus its original Greek name, Church of the Anastasis.\\r\\n\\r\\nToday, the wider complex accumulated during the centuries around the Church of the Holy Sepulchre also serves as the headquarters of the Greek Orthodox Patriarch of Jerusalem, while control of the church itself is shared among several Christian denominations and secular entities in complicated arrangements essentially unchanged for over 160 years, and some for much longer. The main denominations sharing property over parts of the church are the Greek Orthodox, Armenian Apostolic and Roman Catholic, and to a lesser degree the Coptic Orthodox, Syriac Orthodox and Ethiopian Orthodox. Meanwhile, Protestants, including Anglicans, have no permanent presence in the Church. Some Protestants prefer The Garden Tomb, elsewhere in Jerusalem, as a more evocative site to commemorate Jesus' crucifixion and resurrection.\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to Eusebius of Caesarea, the Roman emperor Hadrian in the 2nd century AD built a temple dedicated to the goddess Venus in order to bury the cave in which Jesus had been buried.[6][7] The first Christian emperor, Constantine the Great, ordered in about 325/326 that the temple be replaced by a church.[8] During the building of the Church, Constantine's mother, Helena, is believed to have rediscovered the tomb (although there are some discrepancies among authors).[6] Socrates Scholasticus (born c. 380), in his Ecclesiastical History, gives a full description of the discovery.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nConstantine's church was built as two connected churches over the two different holy sites, including a great basilica (the Martyrium visited by Egeria in the 380s), an enclosed colonnaded atrium (the Triportico) with the traditional site of Golgotha in one corner, and a rotunda, called the Anastasis (\\"Resurrection\\" in Greek), which contained the remains of a rock-cut room that Helena and Macarius identified as the burial site of Jesus.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to tradition, Constantine arranged for the rockface to be removed from around the tomb, without harming it, in order to isolate the tomb; in the centre of the rotunda is a small building called the Kouvouklion in Greek[10] or the Aedicula in Latin,[c] which encloses this tomb. The remains are completely enveloped by a marble sheath placed some 500 years before[when?] to protect the ledge from Ottoman attacks. However, there are several thick window wells extending through the marble sheath, from the interior to the exterior that are not marble clad. They appear to reveal an underlying limestone rock, which may be part of the original living rock of the tomb.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe church was built starting in 325/326, and was consecrated on 13 September 335. From pilgrim reports it seems that the chapel housing the tomb of Jesus was freestanding at first, and that the Rotunda was only erected around the chapel in the 380s.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nEach year, the Eastern Orthodox Church celebrates the anniversary of the consecration of the Church of the Resurrection (Holy Sepulchre) on 13 September.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nThis building was damaged by fire in May of 614 when the Sassanid Empire, under Khosrau II, invaded Jerusalem and captured the True Cross. In 630, the Emperor Heraclius restored it and rebuilt the church after recapturing the city. After Jerusalem came under Arab rule, it remained a Christian church, with the early Muslim rulers protecting the city's Christian sites. A story reports that the Caliph Umar ibn al-Khattab visited the church and stopped to pray on the balcony; but at the time of prayer, he turned away from the church and prayed outside. He feared that future generations would misinterpret this gesture, taking it as a pretext to turn the church into a mosque. Eutychius added that Umar wrote a decree prohibiting Muslims from praying at this location. The building suffered severe damage due to an earthquake in 746.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nEarly in the ninth century, another earthquake damaged the dome of the Anastasis. The damage was repaired in 810 by Patriarch Thomas. In the year 841, the church suffered a fire. In 935, the Orthodox Christians prevented the construction of a Muslim mosque adjacent to the Church. In 938, a new fire damaged the inside of the basilica and came close to the rotunda. In 966, due to a defeat of Muslim armies in the region of Syria, a riot broke out, which was followed by reprisals. The basilica was burned again. The doors and roof were burnt, and the Patriarch John VII was murdered.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 18 October 1009, Fatimid caliph Al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah ordered the complete destruction of the church as part of a more general campaign against Christian places of worship in Palestine and Egypt.[13] The damage was extensive, with few parts of the early church remaining.[14] Christian Europe reacted with shock and expulsions of Jews (for example, Cluniac monk Rodulfus Glaber blamed the Jews, with the result that Jews were expelled from Limoges and other French towns[citation needed]) and an impetus to later Crusades.[15][16]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn wide-ranging negotiations between the Fatimids and the Byzantine Empire in 1027ÿ28, an agreement was reached whereby the new Caliph Ali az-Zahir (Al-Hakim's son) agreed to allow the rebuilding and redecoration of the Church.[17] The rebuilding was finally completed with the financing at a huge expense by Emperor Constantine IX Monomachos and Patriarch Nicephorus of Constantinople in 1048.[18] As a concession, the mosque in Constantinople was re-opened and the khutba sermons were to be pronounced in az-Zahir's name.[17] Muslim sources say a by-product of the agreement was the recanting of Islam by many Christians who had been forced to convert under Al-Hakim's persecutions. In addition, the Byzantines, while releasing 5,000 Muslim prisoners, made demands for the restoration of other churches destroyed by Al-Hakim and the re-establishment of a Patriarch in Jerusalem. Contemporary sources credit the emperor with spending vast sums in an effort to restore the Church of the Holy Sepulchre after this agreement was made.[17] Despite the Byzantines spending vast sums on the project, \\"a total replacement was far beyond available resources. The new construction was concentrated on the rotunda and its surrounding buildings: the great basilica remained in ruins.\\"[14] The rebuilt church site consisted of \\"a court open to the sky, with five small chapels attached to it.\\"[19] The chapels were to the east of the court of resurrection, where the wall of the great church had been. They commemorated scenes from the passion, such as the location of the prison of Christ and of his flagellation, and presumably were so placed because of the difficulties of free movement among shrines in the streets of the city. The dedication of these chapels indicates the importance of the pilgrims' devotion to the suffering of Christ. They have been described as 'a sort of Via Dolorosa in miniature'...?since little or no rebuilding took place on the site of the great basilica. Western pilgrims to Jerusalem during the eleventh century found much of the sacred site in ruins.\\"[14] Control of Jerusalem, and thereby the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, continued to change hands several times between the Fatimids and the Seljuk Turks (loyal to the Abbasid caliph in Baghdad) until the arrival of the Crusaders in 1099.[20]\\r\\n\\r\\nMany historians maintain that the main concern of Pope Urban II, when calling for the First Crusade, was the threat to Constantinople from the Turkish invasion of Asia Minor in response to the appeal of Byzantine Emperor Alexios I Komnenos. Historians agree that the fate of Jerusalem and thereby the Church of the Holy Sepulchre was of concern if not the immediate goal of papal policy in 1095. The idea of taking Jerusalem gained more focus as the Crusade was underway. The rebuilt church site was taken from the Fatimids (who had recently taken it from the Abassids) by the knights of the First Crusade on 15 July 1099.[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe First Crusade was envisioned as an armed pilgrimage, and no crusader could consider his journey complete unless he had prayed as a pilgrim at the Holy Sepulchre. Crusader Prince Godfrey of Bouillon, who became the first crusader monarch of Jerusalem, decided not to use the title \\"king\\" during his lifetime, and declared himself \\"Advocatus Sancti Sepulchri\\" (\\"Protector [or Defender] of the Holy Sepulchre\\"). By the crusader period, a cistern under the former basilica was rumoured to have been the location where Helena had found the True Cross, and began to be venerated as such; although the cistern later became the \\"Chapel of the Invention of the Cross,\\" there is no evidence of the rumour before the 11th century, and modern archaeological investigation has now dated the cistern to 11th century repairs by Monomachos.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to the German clergyman and orient pilgrim Ludolf von Sudheim, the keys of the Chapel of the Holy Sepulchre were in hands of the \\"ancient Georgians\\" and the food, alms, candles and oil for lamps were given them by the pilgrims in the south door of the church.[21]\\r\\n\\r\\nWilliam of Tyre, chronicler of the Crusader Kingdom of Jerusalem, reports on the renovation of the Church in the mid-12th century. The crusaders investigated the eastern ruins on the site, occasionally excavating through the rubble, and while attempting to reach the cistern, they discovered part of the original ground level of Hadrian's temple enclosure; they decided to transform this space into a chapel dedicated to Helena (the Chapel of Saint Helena), widening their original excavation tunnel into a proper staircase. The crusaders began to refurnish the church in a Romanesque style and added a bell tower.[22] These renovations unified the small chapels on the site and were completed during the reign of Queen Melisende in 1149, placing all the Holy places under one roof for the first time. The church became the seat of the first Latin Patriarchs, and was also the site of the kingdom's scriptorium. The church was lost to Saladin,[22] along with the rest of the city, in 1187, although the treaty established after the Third Crusade allowed for Christian pilgrims to visit the site. Emperor Frederick II (r. 1220ÿ50) regained the city and the church by treaty in the 13th century while he himself was under a ban of excommunication, with the curious consequence that the holiest church in Christianity was laid under interdict. The church seems to have been largely in Greek Orthodox Patriarch Athanasius II of Jerusalem's hands, c. 1231ÿ47, during the Latin control of Jerusalem.[23] Both city and church were captured by the Khwarezmians in 1244.[22]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Franciscan friars renovated it further in 1555, as it had been neglected despite increased numbers of pilgrims. The Franciscans rebuilt the Aedicule, extending the structure to create an ante-chamber.[24] After the renovation of 1555, control of the church oscillated between the Franciscans and the Orthodox, depending on which community could obtain a favorable \\"firman\\" from the \\"Sublime Porte\\" at a particular time, often through outright bribery, and violent clashes were not uncommon. There was no agreement about this question, although it was discussed at the negotiations to the Treaty of Karlowitz in 1699.[25] In 1767, weary of the squabbling, the \\"Porte\\" issued a \\"firman\\" that divided the church among the claimants.\\r\\n\\r\\nA fire severely damaged the structure again in 1808, causing the dome of the Rotunda to collapse and smashing the Aedicule's exterior decoration. The Rotunda and the Aedicule's exterior were rebuilt in 1809ÿ1810 by architect Nikolaos Ch. Komnenos of Mytilene in the then current Ottoman Baroque style. The fire did not reach the interior of the Aedicule, and the marble decoration of the Tomb dates mainly to the 1555 restoration, although the interior of the ante-chamber, now known as the \\"Chapel of the Angel,\\" was partly rebuilt to a square ground-plan, in place of the previously semi-circular western end. Another decree in 1853 from the sultan solidified the existing territorial division among the communities and set a \\"status quo\\" for arrangements to \\"remain forever,\\" causing differences of opinion about upkeep and even minor changes,[26] including disagreement on the removal of the \\"Immovable Ladder\\", an exterior ladder under one of the windows; this ladder has remained in the same position since then.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe cladding of red marble applied to the Aedicule by Komnenos has deteriorated badly and is detaching from the underlying structure; since 1947 it has been held in place with an exterior scaffolding of iron girders installed by the British authorities. A careful renovation is undergoing, funded by a $4 million gift from King Abdullah II of Jordan and a $1.3-million gift from Mica Ertegun.[27]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe current dome dates from 1870, although it was restored between 1994ÿ1997, as part of extensive modern renovations to the church which have been ongoing since 1959. During the 1970ÿ1978 restoration works and excavations inside the building, and under the nearby Muristan, it was found that the area was originally a quarry, from which white meleke limestone was struck.[28] To the east of the Chapel of Saint Helena, the excavators discovered a void containing a 2nd-century drawing of a Roman ship, two low walls which supported the platform of Hadrian's 2nd-century temple, and a higher 4th-century wall built to support Constantine's basilica.[24][29] After the excavations of the early 1970s, the Armenian authorities converted this archaeological space into the Chapel of Saint Vartan, and created an artificial walkway over the quarry on the north of the chapel, so that the new Chapel could be accessed (by permission) from the Chapel of Saint Helena.[29]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2016, restoration works were performed in the Aedicule. For the first time since at least 1555, marble cladding which protected the estimated burial bed of Jesus from vandalism and souvenir takers[30] was removed.[31][32] When the cladding was first removed on 26 October, an initial inspection by the National Technical University of Athens team showed only a layer of fill material underneath. By the night of 28 October, the original limestone burial bed was revealed intact. This suggested that the tomb location has not changed through time and confirmed the existence of the original limestone cave walls within the Aedicule.  The tomb was resealed shortly thereafter.[31]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe courtyard facing the entrance to the church is known as the parvis.\\r\\n\\r\\nLocated around the parvis are a few smaller structures.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nSouth of the parvis, opposite the church:\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the eastern side of the parvis, south to north:\\r\\n\\r\\nNorth of the parvis, in front of the church fa?ade or against it:\\r\\n\\r\\nA group of three chapels is bordering the parvis on its west side. They originally formed the baptistery complex of the Constantinian church. The southernmost chapel was the vestibule, the middle chapel the actual baptistery, and the north chapel the chamber in which the patriarch chrismated the newly baptized before leading them into the rotunda north of this complex.[citation needed] Now they are dedicated as (from south to north)\\r\\n\\r\\nThe church's bell tower is located to the left of the fa?ade. It is currently almost half its original size.[33]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe entrance to the church, a single door in the south transeptthrough the crusader fa?adeis found past a group of streets winding through the outer Via Dolorosa, by way of a local souq in the Muristan. This narrow way of access to such a large structure has proven to be hazardous at times. For example, when a fire broke out in 1840, dozens of pilgrims were trampled to death.[34]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe \\"Immovable Ladder\\", in its latest incarnation, stands beneath a window on the fa?ade.\\r\\n\\r\\nHistorically, two large, arched doors allowed access to the church. However, only the left-hand entrance is currently accessible, as the right door has long since been bricked up. These entrances are located in the parvis of a larger courtyard, or plaza.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nJust inside the church is a stairway climbing to Calvary (Golgotha), traditionally regarded as the site of Jesus' crucifixion and the most lavishly decorated part of the church. The exit is via another stairway opposite the first, leading down to the ambulatory. The Golgotha and its chapels are just south of the main altar of the Catholicon.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the ground floor, underneath the Golgotha chapel proper, are the Chapel of Adam and the Treasury of the Greek Orthodox Patriarchate, holding many relics including an alleged fragment of the Holy Cross.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe raised Chapel of the Calvary, or Golgotha Chapel, contains the apex of the Rock of Calvary (12th Station of the Cross). It is split into two halves, one Greek Orthodox and one Catholic, each one with its own altar. The northern half with the main altar belongs to the Greek Orthodox. The rock can be seen under glass on both sides of the altar, and beneath the altar there is a hole in the rock, said to be the place where the cross was raised. Due to the significance of this, it is the most visited site in the Church of the Holy Sepulchre along with the Tomb of Jesus. The Roman Catholic (Franciscan) Chapel of the Nailing of the Cross (11th Station of the Cross) stretches south of it. Between the Catholic and the Orthodox altar, there is a statue of Mary, believed by some to be miraculous. It marks the 13th Station of the Cross, where Jesus' body was removed from the cross and given to his family and disciples.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nBeneath the Calvary and the two chapels there, on the main floor, there is the Chapel of Adam. According to tradition, Jesus was crucified over the place where Adam's skull was buried. According to some, at the crucifixion, the blood of Christ ran down the cross and through the rocks to fill the skull of Adam.[35] The Rock of Calvary appears cracked through a window on the altar wall, with the crack traditionally claimed to be caused by the earthquake that occurred when Jesus died on the cross, while some scholars claim it to be the result of quarrying against a natural flaw in the rock.[36]\\r\\n\\r\\nJust inside the entrance to the church is the Stone of Anointing (also Stone of the Anointing or Stone of Unction), which tradition believes to be the spot where Jesus' body was prepared for burial by Joseph of Arimathea. However, this tradition is only attested since the crusader era (notably by the Italian Dominican pilgrim Riccoldo da Monte di Croce in 1288), and the present stone was only added in the 1810 reconstruction.[24]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe wall behind the stone is defined by its striking blue balconies and tau cross-bearing red banners (depicting the insignia of the Brotherhood of the Holy Sepulchre), and is decorated with lamps. The modern three-part mosaic along the wall depicts the anointing of Jesus' body, preceded on the right by the Descent from the Cross, and succeeded on the left by the Burial of Jesus.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe wall was a temporary addition to support the arch above it, which had been weakened after the damage in the 1808 fire; it blocks the view of the rotunda, separates the entrance from the Catholicon, sits on top of the now-empty and desecrated graves of four 12th-century crusader kingsincluding Godfrey of Bouillon and Baldwin I of Jerusalemand is no longer structurally necessary. There is a difference of opinion as to whether it is to be seen as the 13th Station of the Cross, which others identify as the lowering of Jesus from the cross and locate between the 11th and 12th stations on Calvary.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe lamps that hang over the Stone of Unction, adorned with cross-bearing chain links, are contributed by Armenians, Copts, Greeks and Latins.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nImmediately to the left of the entrance is a bench that has traditionally been used by the church's Muslim doorkeepers, along with some Christian clergy, as well as electrical wiring. To the right of the entrance is a wall along the ambulatory containing, to the very right, the staircase leading to Golgotha. Further along the same wall is the entrance to the Chapel of Adam.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Rotunda is located in the centre of the Anastasis, beneath the larger of the church's two domes. In the center of the Rotunda is the chapel called the Aedicule, which contains the Holy Sepulchre itself. The Aedicule has two rooms, the first holding the Angel's Stone, which is believed to be a fragment of the large stone that sealed the tomb; the second is the tomb itself. Possibly due to the fact that pilgrims laid their hands on the tomb or to prevent eager pilgrims from removing bits of the original rock as souvenirs, a marble plaque was placed in the fourteenth century on the tomb to prevent further damage to the tomb.[37]\\r\\n\\r\\nUnder the status quo, the Eastern Orthodox, Roman Catholic, and Armenian Apostolic Churches all have rights to the interior of the tomb, and all three communities celebrate the Divine Liturgy or Holy Mass there daily. It is also used for other ceremonies on special occasions, such as the Holy Saturday ceremony of the Holy Fire led by the Greek Orthodox Patriarch (with the participation of the Coptic and Armenian patriarchs).[38] To its rear, in a chapel constructed of iron latticework upon a stone base semicircular in plan, lies the altar used by the Coptic Orthodox.[citation needed] Historically, the Georgians also retained the key to the Aedicule.[39][40][41]\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom May 2016 to March 2017, the Aedicule underwent restoration and repairs after the Israel Antiquities Authority declared the structure unsafe. Much of the $3 million project was funded by the World Monuments Fund.[42]\\r\\n\\r\\nWest of the Aedicule, to the rear of the Rotunda, is a chapel (see \\"Syriac Chapel with Tomb of Joseph of Arimathea\\") located in a Constantinian apse and containing an opening to a rock-cut ancient Jewish tomb. This chapel is where the Syriac Orthodox celebrate their Liturgy on Sundays.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo the right of the Sepulchre on the northwestern edge of the Rotunda is the Chapel of the Apparition, which is reserved for Roman Catholic use (see \\"Franciscan area north of the Aedicule\\").[43]\\r\\n\\r\\nEast of this is a large iconostasis demarcating the Orthodox sanctuary before which is set the throne of the Greek Orthodox Patriarch of Jerusalem on the south side facing the throne of the Greek Orthodox Patriarch of Antioch on the north side.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nFurther to the east in the ambulatory are three chapels (from south to north):[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is accessed from the Rotunda, by a door west of the Aedicule. On the far side of the chapel is the low entrance to an almost complete 1st-century Jewish tomb, initially holding six kokh-type funeral shafts radiating from a central chamber, of which two are still exposed. Although this space was discovered recently[when?] and contains no identifying marks, many Christians believe[vague] that Saints Joseph of Arimathea and Nicodemus were buried here.\\r\\n\\r\\nSince Jews always buried their dead outside the city, the presence of this tomb proves that the Holy Sepulchre site was outside the city walls at the time of the crucifixion.\\r\\n\\r\\nSouth of the Aedicule is the \\"Place of the Three Marys\\", marked by a stone canopy and a large modern wall mosaic. From here one can enter the Armenian monastery which stretches over the ground and first upper floor of the church's southeastern part.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Sultan's firman (decree) of 1853, known as the \\"status quo\\", pinned down the now permanent statutes of property and the regulations concerning the roles of the different denominations and other custodians.[47]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe primary custodians are the Greek Orthodox, Armenian Apostolic, and Roman Catholic Churches, with the Greek Orthodox Church having the lion's share. In the 19th century, the Coptic Orthodox, the Ethiopian Orthodox and the Syriac Orthodox acquired lesser responsibilities, which include shrines and other structures in and around the building. Times and places of worship for each community are strictly regulated in common areas.[citation needed] The Greek Orthodox act through the Greek Orthodox Patriarchate as well as through the Brotherhood of the Holy Sepulchre. The Roman Catholics act through the Franciscan Custody of the Holy Land.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe establishment of the 1853 status quo did not halt controversy and sometimes violence, which continues to break out occasionally. On a hot summer day in 2002, a Coptic monk moved his chair from its agreed spot into the shade. This was interpreted as a hostile move by the Ethiopians, and eleven were hospitalized after the resulting fracas.[48]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn another incident in 2004, during Orthodox celebrations of the Exaltation of the Holy Cross, a door to the Franciscan chapel was left open. This was taken as a sign of disrespect by the Orthodox and a fistfight broke out. Some people were arrested, but no one was seriously injured.[49]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn Palm Sunday, in April 2008, a brawl broke out when a Greek monk was ejected from the building by a rival faction. Police were called to the scene but were also attacked by the enraged brawlers.[50] On Sunday, 9 November 2008, a clash erupted between Armenian and Greek monks during celebrations for the Feast of the Cross.[51][52]\\r\\n\\r\\nA less grave sign of this state of affairs is located on a window ledge over the church's entrance. A wooden ladder was placed there at some time before 1852, when the status quo defined both the doors and the window ledges as common ground. This ladder, the \\"Immovable Ladder\\", in its latest incarnation, remains to this day, in almost exactly the same position it occupied in century-old photographs and engravings,[53][54] as it must be replaced whenever it falls apart. An engraving by David Roberts in 1839 also shows the same ladder in the same position.[55]\\r\\n\\r\\nNo one controls the main entrance. In 1192, Saladin assigned door-keeping responsibilities to the Muslim Nuseibeh family. The wooden doors that compose the main entrance are the original, highly carved doors.[56] The Joudeh Al-Goudia family were entrusted as custodian to the keys of the Holy Sepulchre by Saladin in 1187.[57]\\r\\n\\r\\nDespite occasional disagreements, the religious services take place in the Church with regularity and coexistence is generally peaceful. An example of concord between the Church custodians is the recent (2016ÿ17) full restoration of the Aedicule.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn late February 2018 after a tax dispute over 152 million euros of uncollected taxes on church properties the Church had closed until further notice. The city hall stressed that the Church of the Holy Sepulchre and all other churches are exempt from the taxes, with the changes only affecting establishments like \\"hotels, halls and businesses\\" owned by the churches.[58] NPR had reported that the Greek Orthodox Church calls itself the second-largest landowner in Israel, after the Israeli government.[59]\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was a lock in protest against an Israeli legislative proposal which would expropriate church lands that had been sold to private companies since 2010, a measure which church leaders assert constitutes a serious violation of their property rights and the status quo. In a joint official statement the church authorities protested what they considered to be the peak of a systematic campaign in\\r\\n\\r\\n'a discriminatory and racist bill that targets solely the properties of the Christian community in the Holy Land,' adding, 'This reminds us all of laws of a similar nature which were enacted against the Jews during dark periods in Europe.'[60]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 2018 Taxation affair does not cover any church buildings or religious related facilities (because they are exempt by law),[61] but commercial facilities such as the Notre Dame Hotel which was not paying the arnona tax, and any land which is owned and used as a commercial land.[61] The church hold the rights to land where private homes have been constructed, and some of the disagreement had been raised after the Knesset had proposed a bill that will make it harder for a private company not to extend a lease for land used by homeowners.[62] According to the JPost \\r\\n'The stated aim of the bill is to protect homeowners against the possibility that private companies will not extend their leases of land on which their houses or apartments stand.'\\r\\n The church leaders have said that such a bill will make it harder for them to sell church owned lands.[62]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe site of the Church had been a temple of Venus before Constantine's edifice was built. Hadrian's temple had actually been located there because it was the junction of the main north-south road with one of the two main east-west roads and directly adjacent to the forum (which is now the location of the (smaller) Muristan); the forum itself had been placed, as is traditional in Roman towns, at the junction of the main north-south road with the (other) main east-west road (which is now El-Bazar/David Street). The temple and forum together took up the entire space between the two main east-west roads (a few above-ground remains of the east end of the temple precinct still survive in the Alexander Nevsky Church complex of the Russian Mission in Exile).\\"Church of the Holy Sepulcher\\". Generation Word. Retrieved 31 May 2018.?\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom the archaeological excavations in the 1970s, it is clear that construction took over most of the site of the earlier temple enclosure and that the Triportico and Rotunda roughly overlapped with the temple building itself; the excavations indicate that the temple extended at least as far back as the Aedicule, and the temple enclosure would have reached back slightly further. Virgilio Canio Corbo, a Franciscan priest and archaeologist, who was present at the excavations, estimated from the archaeological evidence that the western retaining wall of the temple itself would have passed extremely close to the east side of the supposed tomb; if the wall had been any further west any tomb would have been crushed under the weight of the wall (which would be immediately above it) if it had not already been destroyed when foundations for the wall were made.[63]\\r\\n\\r\\nOther archaeologists have criticized Corbo's reconstructions. Dan Bahat, the former city archaeologist of Jerusalem, regards them as unsatisfactory, as there is no known temple of Aphrodite matching Corbo's design, and no archaeological evidence for Corbo's suggestion that the temple building was on a platform raised high enough to avoid including anything sited where the Aedicule is now; indeed Bahat notes that many temples to Aphrodite have a rotunda-like design, and argues that there is no archaeological reason to assume that the present rotunda was not based on a rotunda in the temple previously on the site.[64]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe New Testament describes Jesus's tomb as being outside the city wall,[65] as was normal for burials across the ancient world, which were regarded as unclean.[66] Today, the site of the Church is within the current walls of the old city of Jerusalem. It has been well documented by archaeologists that in the time of Jesus, the walled city was smaller and the wall then was to the east of the current site of the Church.[citation needed] In other words, the city had been much narrower in Jesus' time, with the site then having been outside the walls; since Herod Agrippa (41ÿ44) is recorded by history as extending the city to the north (beyond the present northern walls), the required repositioning of the western wall is traditionally attributed to him as well.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe area immediately to the south and east of the sepulchre was a quarry and outside the city during the early 1st century as excavations under the Lutheran Church of the Redeemer across the street demonstrated.[67]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe church is a part of the UNESCO World Heritage Site Old City of Jerusalem.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Christian Quarter and the (also Christian) Armenian Quarter of the Old City of Jerusalem are both located in the northwestern and western part of the Old City, due to the fact that the Holy Sepulchre is located close to the northwestern corner of the walled city. The adjacent neighbourhood within the Christian  Quarter is called the Muristan, a term derived from the Persian word for hospitalChristian pilgrim hospices have been maintained in this area near the Holy Sepulchre since at least the time of Charlemagne.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom the 9th century, the construction of churches inspired in the Anastasis was extended across Europe.[68] One example is Santo Stefano in Bologna, Italy, an agglomeration of seven churches recreating shrines of Jerusalem.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nSeveral churches and monasteries in Europe, for instance, in Germany and Russia, and at least one church in the United States have been modeled on the Church of the Resurrection, some even reproducing other holy places for the benefit of pilgrims who could not travel to the Holy Land. They include the Heiliges Grab of G?rlitz, constructed between 1481 and 1504, the New Jerusalem Monastery in Moscow Oblast, constructed by Patriarch Nikon between 1656 and 1666, and Mount St. Sepulchre Franciscan Monastery built by the Franciscans in Washington, DC in 1898.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nGates1.

The initial \\"We Got Next\\" advertisement ran before each WNBA season until it was replaced with the \\"We Got Game\\" campaign.\\r\\nTwo teams were added in 1998 (Detroit and Washington)[9] and two more in 1999 (Orlando and Minnesota), bringing the number of teams in the league up to twelve.[10] The 1999 season began with a collective bargaining agreement between players and the league,[11] marking the first collective bargaining agreement to be signed in the history of women's professional sports.[citation needed] The WNBA also announced in 1999 that it would add four more team for the 2000 season (the Indiana Fever, the Seattle Storm, the Miami Sol, and the Portland Fire), bringing the league up to 16 teams, with WNBA President Val Ackerman discussing expansion: \\"This won't be the end of it. We expect to keep growing the league.\\"[12]\\r\\nIn 1999, the league's chief competition, the American Basketball League, folded. Many of the ABL's star players, including several Olympic gold medalists (such as Nikki McCray and Dawn Staley) and a number of standout college performers (including Kate Starbird and Jennifer Rizzotti), then joined the rosters of WNBA teams and, in so doing, enhanced the overall quality of play in the league. When a lockout resulted in an abbreviated NBA season, the WNBA saw faltering TV viewership.\\r\\nOn May 23, 2000, the Houston Comets became the first WNBA team to be invited to the White House Rose Garden. Before this invitation, only men's sports teams had traveled to the White House.\\r\\nAt the end of the 2000 season, the Houston Comets won their fourth championship, capturing every title since the league's inception. Led by the \\"Big Three\\" of Sheryl Swoopes, Tina Thompson, and four-time Finals MVP Cynthia Cooper, the Comets dominated every team in the league. Under head coach Van Chancellor, the team posted a 98ÿ24 record through their first four seasons (16ÿ3 in the Playoffs). After 2000, Cooper retired from the league and the Comets dynasty came to an end.\\r\\nThe top contender in the 2001 season was the Los Angeles Sparks. Led by Lisa Leslie, the Sparks posted a regular-season record of 28ÿ4. They advanced to their first ever WNBA Finals and swept the Charlotte Sting.\\r\\nLooking to repeat in 2002, the Sparks again made a strong run toward the postseason, going 25ÿ7 in the regular season under head coach Michael Cooper, formerly of the Los Angeles Lakers. Again, Leslie dominated opponents throughout the Playoffs, leading the Sparks to a perfect 6ÿ0 record through all three rounds, beating the New York Liberty in the 2002 Finals.\\r\\nTeams and the league were collectively owned by the NBA until the end of 2002, when the NBA sold WNBA teams either to their NBA counterparts in the same city or to a third party, as a result of the dot-com bubble. This led to two teams moving: Utah moved to San Antonio, and Orlando moved to Connecticut and became the first WNBA team to be owned by a third party instead of an NBA franchise. This sale of teams also led to two teams folding, the Miami Sol and Portland Fire, because new owners could not be found.\\r\\nThe WNBA Players Association threatened to strike in 2003 if a new deal was not worked out between players and the league. The result was a delay in the start of the 2003 preseason. The 2003 WNBA Draft was also delayed and negative publicity was gained from this strike.[13]\\r\\nAfter taking over a struggling franchise in 2002, former Detroit Pistons forward Bill Laimbeer had high hopes for the Detroit Shock in 2003. The team was just 9ÿ23 in 2002. The Shock had three all-stars in the 2003 All-Star Game (Swin Cash, Cheryl Ford, and Deanna Nolan). Laimbeer orchestrated a worst-to-first turnaround and the Shock finished the season 25ÿ9 in first place in the Eastern Conference. Winning the first two rounds of the Playoffs, the Shock faced two-time champion Los Angeles Sparks and Lisa Leslie in the 2003 Finals. The Shock beat the Sparks, winning game three on a three-pointer by Deanna Nolan.\\r\\nAfter the 2003 season, the Cleveland Rockers, one of the league's original eight teams, folded because the owners were unwilling to continue operating the franchise.\\r\\nVal Ackerman, the first WNBA president, resigned effective February 1, 2005, citing the desire to spend more time with her family. Ackerman later became president of USA Basketball. On February 15, 2005, NBA Commissioner David Stern announced that Donna Orender, who had been serving as the Senior Vice President of the PGA Tour and who had played for several teams in the now-defunct Women's Pro Basketball League, would be Ackerman's successor as of April 2005.\\r\\nThe WNBA awarded a expansion team to Chicago (later named the Sky) in February 2006. In the off-season, a set of rule changes was approved that made the WNBA more like the NBA.[14]\\r\\nIn 2006, the league became the first team-oriented women's professional sports league to exist for ten consecutive seasons.[citation needed] On the occasion of the tenth anniversary, the WNBA released its All-Decade Team, comprising the ten WNBA players to have contributed, through on-court play and off-court activities, the most to women's basketball during the league's existence.\\r\\nAfter missing out on the Finals in 2004 and 2005, the Shock bounced back in 2006 behind newly acquired Katie Smith, along with six remaining members from their 2003 Finals run (Cash, Ford, Holland-Corn, Nolan, Powell, and Riley). The Shock finished second in the Eastern Conference, and knocked off first-seeded Connecticut in the second round of the Playoffs. The Shock faced reigning champion Sacramento Monarchs in a five-game series. The Shock won game five on their home floor.\\r\\nIn December 2006, the Charlotte Bobcats organization announced it would no longer operate the Charlotte Sting. Soon after, the WNBA announced that the Sting would not operate for 2007. A dispersal draft was held January 8, 2007. Teams selected in inverse order of their 2006 records; Chicago received the first pick.\\r\\nFormer Los Angeles Lakers championship coach Paul Westhead was named head coach of the Phoenix Mercury on October 11, 2005, bringing his up-tempo style of play to the WNBA. This fast-paced offense was perfect for his team, especially after the league shortened the shot clock from 30 seconds to 24 seconds in 2006. Much like the early Houston Comets championship teams, the Phoenix Mercury had risen to prominence led by their own \\"Big Three\\" of Cappie Pondexter, Diana Taurasi, and Penny Taylor.\\r\\nThe Mercury were well-suited for fast offense behind these three players. Phoenix averaged a league-record 88.97 points per game in 2007; teams could not keep up with the new style of play, and the Mercury were propelled into first place in the Western Conference. Facing the reigning champion Detroit Shock, the Mercury imposed their high-scoring offense with hopes of capturing their first title in franchise history. Averaging 93.2 points per game in the Finals series, the Mercury beat Detroit on their home floor in front of 22,076 fans in game five to claim their first ever WNBA title.\\r\\nIn October 2007 the WNBA awarded another expansion franchise to Atlanta. Atlanta businessman Ron Terwilliger was the original owner of the new team. Citizens of Atlanta were able to vote for their choices for the new team's nickname and colors.[15] The Dream, as they were named, played their first regular season game on May 17, which was a 67ÿ100 loss to the Connecticut Sun.\\r\\nPaul Westhead resigned from the Mercury after capturing the 2007 title and Penny Taylor opted to stay home to prepare for the 2008 Summer Olympics, causing the Mercury to falter in 2008. The team posted a 16ÿ18 record and became the first team in WNBA history to miss the Playoffs after winning the championship in the previous season. In their place, the Detroit Shock won their third championship under coach Bill Laimbeer, solidifying their place in WNBA history before Laimbeer resigned early in 2009, effectively ending the Shock dynasty.\\r\\nDuring the 2008 regular season, the first ever outdoor professional basketball game in North America was played at Arthur Ashe Stadium in New York City.[citation needed][16] The Indiana Fever defeated the New York Liberty 71ÿ55 in front of over 19,000 fans.\\r\\nLate in 2008, the WNBA took over ownership of one of the league's original franchises, the Houston Comets. The Comets ceased operations on December 1, 2008 after no owners for the franchise could be found.[17] A dispersal draft took place on December 8, 2008 and with the first pick, Sancho Lyttle was taken by the Atlanta Dream.\\r\\nAfter an unsatisfying conclusion in 2008, the Mercury looked to bounce back to championship caliber. New head coach Corey Gaines implemented Paul Westhead's style of play, and the Mercury averaged 92.82 points per game throughout the 2009 season. Helped by the return of Penny Taylor, the Mercury once again locked up first place in the Western Conference and advanced to the 2009 Finals. The championship series was a battle of contrasting styles as the Mercury (number one league offense, 92.82 points per game) had to face the Indiana Fever (number three league defense, 73.55 points per game). The series went five games, including arguably one of the most thrilling games in WNBA history in game one of the series (Phoenix won in overtime, 120ÿ116. The Mercury beat the Fever in game five, this time on their home court, to capture their second WNBA championship.\\r\\nNot only did Paul Westhead's system influence his Mercury team, but it created a domino effect throughout the league. Young athletic players were capable of scoring more and playing at a faster pace. As a league, the 2010 average of 80.35 points per game was the best ever, far surpassing the 69.2 average in the league's inaugural season.\\r\\nOn October 20, 2009, the WNBA announced that the Detroit Shock would relocate to Tulsa, Oklahoma; the team is called the Tulsa Shock.[18] On November 20, 2009, the WNBA announced that the Sacramento Monarchs had folded due to lack of support from its current owners, the Maloof family, who were also the owners of the Sacramento Kings at the time. The league announced it would seek new owners to relocate the team to the San Francisco Bay area; however, no ownership was found and a dispersal draft was held on December 14, 2009.\\r\\nThe 2010 season saw a tight race in the East, with three teams being tied for first place on the final day of the regular season. Five of the six teams in the East were in first place at some point during the season. The East held a .681 winning percentage over the West, its highest ever. In the 2010 Finals, two new teams represented each conference: the Seattle Storm and the Atlanta Dream. Seattle made their first finals appearance since winning it all in 2004 and Atlanta, coming into the playoffs as a four seed, impressively swept its opponents in the first two rounds to advance to the Finals in only the third year of the team's existence.\\r\\nAfter the 2010 season, President Orender announced she would be resigning from her position as of December 31. On April 21, 2011, NBA commissioner David Stern announced that former Girl Scouts of the USA Senior Vice President and Chief Marketing Officer Laurel J. Richie would assume duties as President on May 16, 2011.\\r\\nThe 2011 season began with strong publicity helped by the rising young stars of the league and the NBA lockout.[19] The 2011 NBA lockout began on July 1, 2011. Unlike the previous lockout, which affected the WNBA, president Laurel J. Richie confirmed that this lockout would have no effect on the WNBA. If the NBA season was shortened or canceled, the 2012 WNBA season (including the WNBA teams still owned by NBA owners) would run as planned. The lockout ended on November 26, and NBA teams would play a 66-game regular season following the lockout.\\r\\nMany news outlets began covering the league more frequently. NBA TV, the television home of the NBA scheduled over 70 regular season games to be televised (along with a dozen more on ESPN2 and ABC). The new influx of young talent into the league gave many teams something to be excited about. Players like Candace Parker of the Sparks, Maya Moore of the Lynx, DeWanna Bonner of the Mercury, Angel McCoughtry of the Dream, Sylvia Fowles of the Sky, Tina Charles of the Sun, and Liz Cambage of the Shock brought a new level of excitement to the game, adding talent to the teams of young veterans such as Diana Taurasi, Seimone Augustus and Cappie Pondexter. The level of play was getting better, as evidenced by higher scoring, better defense, and higher shooting percentages. Fans responded to the new stars in the league; by the end of the 2011 regular season, nine of the twelve teams in the league had increased attendance over their 2010 averages.[20]\\r\\nThe new influx of talented young players showed that the league's longevity gave young girls something to work towards. Rookies coming into the league had the luxury of growing up watching veterans like Cynthia Cooper, Lisa Leslie and Teresa Weatherspoon. For the first time ever, young girls could now look at the WNBA as an opportunity for basketball to continue after college.\\r\\nThe new players delivered in 2011. Connecticut Sun center Tina Charles set a league record for double-doubles in a season with 23. Also, Sylvia Fowles of the Chicago Sky became only the second player in WNBA history to finish a season averaging at least 20 points (20.0ppg) and 10 rebounds (10.2rpg) per game. The San Antonio Silver Stars experienced boosts from their young players as well; rookie Danielle Adams scored 32 points off the bench in June and fellow rookie Danielle Robinson had a 36-point game in September. Atlanta Dream forward Angel McCoughtry was the first player in league history to average over 20 points per game (21.6ppg) while playing under 30 minutes per game (27.9mpg).\\r\\nMcCoughtry led her team to the Finals for the second straight year, but despite breaking her own Finals scoring record, the Dream was swept for the second straight year, this time by the Minnesota Lynx, which won its first title behind a fully healthy Seimone Augustus.\\r\\n2012 featured a long Olympic break, but still saw the league grow. The Indiana Fever won the WNBA championship.\\r\\nThe much publicized 2013 WNBA Draft produced Baylor University star Brittney Griner, Delaware's Elena Delle Donne, and Notre Dame All American Skylar Diggins (now Diggins-Smith) as the top three picks, the draft was the first to be televised in primetime on ESPN. Griner, Delle Donne, and Diggins were thus labelled \\"The Three To See\\", but with the draft also came standouts such as Tayler Hill, Layshia Clarendon and Alex Bentley. The retirement of legends Katie Smith, Tina Thompson, Ticha Penicheiro, and Sheryl Swoopes coupled with the arrival of highly touted rookies and new rule changes effectively marked the end of an era for the WNBA and the ushering of another.[citation needed]\\r\\nOn the court, the Minnesota Lynx won their second title in three years, defeating the Atlanta Dream in the Finals, and becoming the first team to sweep the playoff since the Seattle Storm.\\r\\nThe promotion of Griner, Delle Donne, and Diggins helped boost television ratings for the league by 28 percent, and half of teams ended the season profitable.[21][22] The improved health of the league was on display after the season, when the Los Angeles Sparks' ownership group folded; it took the league only a few weeks to line up Guggenheim Partners to purchase the team, and the franchise also garnered interest from the ownership of the Golden State Warriors.\\r\\nThe WNBA originated with 8 teams in 1997, and through a sequence of expansions, contractions, and relocations currently consists of 12 teams. There have been a total of 18 franchises in WNBA history.\\r\\nAs of the leagues next season in 2018, the Las Vegas team (formerly the Utah Starzz and San Antonio Silver Stars/Stars), Los Angeles Sparks, New York Liberty, and Phoenix Mercury are the only remaining franchises that were founded in 1997.\\r\\nArenas reflect those to be used in the 2018 season.\\r\\nAn asterisk (*) denotes a franchise move. See the respective team articles for more information.\\r\\nSeven WNBA teams are associated with the NBA team from the same market and are known as sister teams. These teams include the Indiana Pacers and Fever, the Los Angeles Lakers and Sparks, the Minnesota Timberwolves and Lynx, the New York Knicks and Liberty, the Phoenix Suns and Mercury, the Atlanta Hawks and the Dream, and the Washington Wizards and Mystics. Of these teams, only the Dream and the Sparks are owned separately. Through the 2017 season, the San Antonio Spurs and Stars were also paired, but that relationship ended in October 2017 when the Stars were bought by MGM Resorts International and moved to Las Vegas.[24]\\r\\nThree WNBA teams are in the same market as an NBA team but are not affiliated. Though located in the same market, the Chicago Sky are not affiliated with the Bulls, as evidenced by their differing home arenas: the Sky will move from Allstate Arena in nearby Rosemont to Wintrust Arena in Chicago's Near South Side for 2018 and beyond, while the Bulls play at United Center in the city's Near West Side. The Dallas Wings, which had been the Tulsa Shock before moving to the DallasÿFort Worth Metroplex after the 2015 season, are not affiliated with the existing NBA team in the Metroplex, the Dallas Mavericks. As with the Sky and Bulls, the Wings and Mavericks play in different arenas, with the Wings playing at College Park Center in Arlington as opposed to the Mavericks playing just outside downtown Dallas at American Airlines Center.\\r\\nThe remaining WNBA team, the Seattle Storm, was formerly the sister team of the now relocated SuperSonics but was sold to a Seattle-based group before the SuperSonics moved and become the Oklahoma City Thunder.\\r\\nThe now defunct Utah Starzz, Charlotte Sting, Miami Sol, Portland Fire, Cleveland Rockers, Orlando Miracle, Houston Comets and Sacramento Monarchs were also sister teams of the Jazz, Hornets, Heat, Trail Blazers, Cavaliers, Magic, Rockets and Kings, respectively. The Detroit Shock was the sister team of the Pistons until the teams' owner sold the Shock to investors who moved the team to Tulsa, Oklahoma. During its tenure in Tulsa, it was not affiliated with Oklahoma's NBA team, the Oklahoma City Thunder.\\r\\nThe Liberty, Sparks, and Wings are currently the only teams that share a market with an NBA G League team; the Liberty share the New York City market with Long Island Nets and the Westchester Knicks, the Sparks share the Los Angeles market with the Agua Caliente Clippers and South Bay Lakers, and the Wings share the Dallas market with the Texas Legends. In addition, four teams are located within 150 miles of WNBA teams (the Delaware 87ers, Fort Wayne Mad Ants, Austin Spurs, and Northern Arizona Suns being near the Mystic, Fever, Stars, and Mercury, respectively).\\r\\nThe Mystics will be joined by a new team in 2018ÿ19, and the Dream will be joined by the Erie BayHawks upon the BayHawks' relocation to the Atlanta area in 2019ÿ20. The Shock shared the Tulsa market with the Tulsa 66ers until the latter team was relocated to become the Oklahoma City Blue in 2014.\\r\\nTeams hold training camps in May. Training camps allow the coaching staff to prepare the players for the regular season, and determine the 12-woman roster with which they will begin the regular season. After training camp, a series of preseason exhibition games are held.\\r\\nThe WNBA regular season begins in May. During the regular season, each team plays 34 games, 17 each home and away. Each team plays one in-conference team 4 times and the remaining in-conference teams 3 times each (12 games). Each team then plays the six out-of-conference teams 3 times (18 games). As in the NBA, each team hosts and visits every other team at least once every season.\\r\\nIn 1999 the league held its first ever All Star Game where the best players of the Eastern Conference played against the best players of the Western Conference. Since the All Star games were ongoing, the west has been dominant until 2006 the east finally won a game.\\r\\nIn July, the regular season pauses to celebrate the annual WNBA All-Star Game. The game is part of a weekend-long event, held in a selected WNBA city each year. The actual game is played on the selected WNBA team's home court. The All-Star Game features star players from the Western Conference facing star players from the Eastern Conference. During the season, fans vote for the players they would like to see start the game. In 2004, The Game at Radio City was in held in place of a traditional All-Star Game. The 2006 All-Star Game was the first game to feature custom uniforms that match the decade anniversary logo. No WNBA All-Star Game is held in every Olympic year since 2008. In 2010, an exhibition game (Stars at the Sun) was held.\\r\\nShortly after the All-Star break is the trading deadline. After this date, teams are not allowed to exchange players with each other for the remainder of the season, although they may still sign and release players. Major trades are often completed right before the trading deadline.\\r\\nDuring years in which the Summer Olympics are held, the WNBA takes a month off in the middle of the season to allow players to practice and compete with their respective national teams.\\r\\nThe WNBA Playoffs begin in late September, with eight teams qualifying for the playoffs. Having a higher seed offers several advantages. Since the first two seeds get double byes, and the next two seeds get first-round byes, having a higher seed generally means one will be facing a weaker team. The team in each series with the better record has home court advantage. Since 2016 Verizon is the official sponsor.\\r\\nThe first two playoff rounds follow a tournament format with each team playing a rival in a single elimination game, whichever team that wins, advances into the next round, while losers are eliminated from the playoffs. For the first round, the matchups by seed are 5th vs 8th and 6th vs 7th. In the second round, the matchups by seed are 3rd vs the lowest remaining seed and 4th vs the highest remaining seed. In the semifinals, the matchups by seed are 1st vs the lowest remaining seed and 2nd vs the highest remaining seed. This leaves two teams left to play each other in the WNBA Finals. In the first and second rounds, is a single elimination game. In the semifinals, the best-of-five series follows a 2ÿ2ÿ1 home-court pattern, meaning that the higher-seeded team will have home court in games 1, 2, and 5 while the other team plays at home in game 3 and 4. This pattern has been in place since 2016 (changed from the best-of-three series 1ÿ1ÿ1 format for four teams in each conferences, where the higher seed hosted the opening game in the first two rounds).\\r\\nThe final playoff round, a best-of-five series between the victors of each conference, is known as the WNBA Finals, and is held annually, currently scheduled for October. Each player on the winning team receives a championship ring. In addition, the league awards a WNBA Finals Most Valuable Player Award. For this round, the series follows a 2ÿ2ÿ1 pattern, meaning that one team will have home court in games 1, 2, and 5, while the other plays at home in games 3 and 4. The 2ÿ2ÿ1 pattern in the WNBA Finals has been in place since 2005.\\r\\nThe Houston Comets and Minnesota Lynx hold the distinction of having won the most championships with 4 titles each. The Comets folded in 2008. The Lynx have the most appearances in the championship with 6, all occurring in the 7-year period from 2011-2017.\\r\\nCurrent teams that have no WNBA Finals appearances:\\r\\nFormer teams that have no WNBA Finals appearances:\\r\\nIn 2011, a decade and a half after the launch of the WNBA, only two players remained from the league's inaugural season in 1997: Sheryl Swoopes and Tina Thompson. Thompson holds the record for the number of years in the league (fifteen). Lisa Leslie was the longest-tenured player from the 1997 draft class; she spent her entire career (1997ÿ2009) with the Los Angeles Sparks. Tangela Smith has played the most games in her career (415).\\r\\nThe members of the WNBA's All-Decade Team were chosen in 2006 on the occasion of the tenth anniversary of the WNBA from amongst 30 nominees compiled by fan, media, coach, and player voting. The team was to comprise the 10 best and most influential players of the first decade of the WNBA, with consideration also given to sportsmanship, community service, leadership, and contribution to the growth of women's basketball.\\r\\nPlayers for the WNBA's Top 15 Team were chosen in 2011 on the anniversary of the league's fifteenth season from amongst 30 nominees compiled in a similar manner to that of the All-Decade Team process.\\r\\nOver 30 players have scored more than 3,000 points or more in their WNBA careers. Only six WNBA players have reached the 6,000 point milestone: Tina Thompson, Diana Taurasi, Tamika Catchings, Katie Smith, Lisa Leslie, and Lauren Jackson.\\r\\nIn 2007, Paul Westhead of the Phoenix Mercury became the first person to earn both NBA and WNBA championship rings as a coach.\\r\\nIn 2008, 50-year-old Nancy Lieberman became the oldest player to play in a WNBA game. She signed a seven-day contract with the Detroit Shock and played one game, tallying two assists and two turnovers in nine minutes of action. By playing in the one game Lieberman broke a record that she herself had set in 1997, when she was the league's oldest player at 39.\\r\\nTicha Penicheiro (Portugal) provided 2,599 assists in 454 games playing for the Sacramento Monarchs, Los Angeles Sparks and Chicago Sky since 1998. she also holds the record for most assists per game, with 5.7.[25]\\r\\nAround the beginning of September, the regular season ends. It is during this time that voting begins for individual awards. The Sixth Woman of the Year Award is given to the best player coming off the bench (must have more games coming off the bench than actual games started).[27] The Rookie of the Year Award is awarded to the most outstanding first-year player. The Most Improved Player Award is awarded to the player who is deemed to have shown the most improvement from the previous season. The Defensive Player of the Year Award is awarded to the league's best defender. The Kim Perrot Sportsmanship Award is awarded to the player who shows the outstanding sportsmanship on and off the court. The Coach of the Year Award is awarded to the coach that has made the most positive difference to a team. The Most Valuable Player Award is given to player deemed the most valuable for (her team) that season.\\r\\nAlso named are the All-WNBA Teams, the All-Defensive Teams, and the All-Rookie Team; each consists of five players. There are two All-WNBA teams, consisting of the top players at each position, with first-team status being the most desirable. There are two All-Defensive teams, consisting of the top defenders at each position. There is one All-Rookie team, consisting of the top first-year players regardless of position.\\r\\nWinners are from the most recent season unless otherwise indicated.\\r\\nA number of international players that have played in the WNBA have earned multiple all-stars or won MVP awards:\\r\\nSome of these players, among them Penicheiro, Sutton-Brown, and Young, played U.S. college basketball.\\r\\nRules are governed by standard basketball rules as defined by the NBA, with a few notable exceptions:\\r\\nGames are divided into four 10-minute quarters as opposed to the league's original two 20-minute halves of play, similar to FIBA and NCAA women's college rules (many WNBA players play in European, Chinese, or Australian leagues, which all use the FIBA rule set).\\r\\nA recent trend with new WNBA rules has been to match them with a similar NBA rule. Beginning with the 2006 WNBA season:[28]\\r\\nThe 2007 WNBA season brought changes that included:[29]\\r\\nIn 2012, the WNBA added the block/charge arc under the basket. As of 2013 the defensive three-second rule and anti-flopping guidelines were introduced. The three-point line was also extended.\\r\\nStarting in 2017, Tissot will be the official timekeeper for the league, as it will use a unified game clock/shot clock system.\\r\\nThe WNBA did not start out able to support itself. During the mid-2000s, the NBA spent more than $10 million per year to keep the WNBA financially solvent.[30] In 2007, teams were estimated to be losing $1.5 million to $2 million a year.[31]\\r\\nThe league has begun to do better financially in recent years. In December 2010 Donna Orender said that the league had its first-ever \\"cash flow positive\\" team (Connecticut Sun) for the 2010 season.[32] In 2011, three teams were profitable, and in 2013, six of the league's 12 teams reported a profit.[33] The league has also signed extended television contracts with ESPN and sponsorship agreements with Boost Mobile.\\r\\nOn June 1, 2009, the Phoenix Mercury was the first team in WNBA history to announce a marquee sponsorship. The team secured a partnership with LifeLock to brand their jerseys and warm-ups.[34] It was the first branded jersey in WNBA history. Following the expiration of the LifeLock deal, the Mercury secured a new uniform sponsorship deal with Casino Arizona and Talking Stick Resort on February 3, 2014.[35]\\r\\nOther teams eventually followed in the Mercury's footsteps to bring the total to nine current teams with sponsorship deals:\\r\\nThe now-relocated Tulsa Shock (Osage Casino) and currently active Washington Mystics (Inova Health System) had jersey sponsorships at one time.\\r\\nOn August 22, 2011, the WNBA announced a league-wide marquee sponsorship with Boost Mobile.[36] The deal would allow the Boost Mobile logo to be placed on eleven of the 12 teams' jerseys (excluding San Antonio) in addition to branding on the courts and in arenas. A source said the deal is a \\"multiyear, eight-figure deal.\\"[37]\\r\\nOn March 14, 2016, the WNBA was completing a deal with Verizon Wireless to place them on 10 of the 12 team jerseys. The deal includes a space on the front of 10 jerseys, excluding the Stars and Sun, in-arena advertising, and reserved commercial space during WNBA broadcasts. The deal also includes the sponsorship of the All-Star Game, Inspiring Women Luncheon, and other unspecified events, The deal will not include the Monthly and Yearly Awards.[38]\\r\\nOn March 28, the league introduced new uniforms, with the new Verizon sponsor, which eliminated white jerseys and made the secondary color a basis for a uniform. The jersey font will remain unchanged as well as the primary color used for the away uniform. Teams can use either jersey for home and away games. Pictures of the jerseys can be seen on the WNBA website, although the Storm and Wings have not released their jerseys yet.\\r\\nIn 2009, the Phoenix Mercury became the first American professional basketball team to feature advertisements on their uniform when they sold an ad to LifeLock Insurance on the front of their jerseys, leading many people to wonder if ads on NBA uniforms were coming soon. Since then several other WNBA teams have followed suit. The NBA announced in the summer of 2016 that they will begin to feature advertisements on jerseys, with the first team to do so being the Philadelphia 76ers (with a StubHub sticker now on their jerseys). Before the start of the 2011 season, every team announced a new look for their uniforms. The supplier of the uniforms for the league, Adidas, upgraded all teams to new high-tech designs, much like they did for the NBA prior to the start of their season.\\r\\nSponsorships have come from major companies such as; Boost Mobile and Farmers Insurance. Pepsi and Nike have also partnered up with the WNBA.\\r\\nPrior to the 2009 season, the maximum team roster size was changed from 13 players (11 active and 2 inactive) to 11 players (all active). Any team that falls below nine players able to play due to injury or any other factor outside of the control of the team will, upon request, be granted a roster hardship exception allowing the team to sign an additional player or players so that the team will have nine players able to play in an upcoming game or games. As soon as the injured (or otherwise sidelined) player(s) is able to play, the roster hardship player(s)not any other player on the rostermust be waived. In March 2014, the WNBA and players signed a new, 8-year collective bargaining agreement, increasing the number of players on a roster to 12.[39]\\r\\nThe WNBA Draft is held annually every spring. The draft is three rounds long with each of the 12 teams in the league (trades aside) getting three picks each. The draft order for the eight teams that made the playoffs the previous year are based on team records, and the team with the highest previous record will pick last. For the remaining top four picks, a selection process similar to the NBA Draft Lottery is conducted for the four teams that did not qualify for the playoffs.\\r\\nIn 2008, a new six-year collective bargaining agreement was agreed upon between the players and the league. The salary cap for an entire team in 2010 is $827,000 (although it was later lowered to $775,000). By 2013 (the sixth year under this agreement), the cap for an entire team will be $900,000. In 2010, the minimum salary for a player with three-plus years of experience is $51,000 while the maximum salary for a six-plus year player is $101,500 (the first time in league history that players are able to receive over $100,000). The minimum salary for rookies is $35,190.[40][41] Many WNBA players supplement their salaries by playing in European, Australian, or more recently Chinese women's basketball leagues during the WNBA off-season. The WNBA has been criticized for paying female players less than their NBA counterparts.[42]\\r\\nThe decision of superstar Diana Taurasi to sit out the 2015 WNBA season was seen by some in the media as a harbinger of salary-related troubles in the future. The Russian club for which she was playing at the time, UMMC Ekaterinburg, offered her a bonus well in excess of the league's salary cap to sit out that season. Taurasi accepted largely because she had not had an offseason since she was playing college basketball more than a decade earlier. Such offers have often been made to star American players, including Taurasi herself, but none were accepted until Taurasi did so in 2015.[43]\\r\\nWNBA players are awarded bonuses for certain achievements. Some of the bonuses given by the league (amount is per player) include: WNBA champion: $10,500; Runner-up: $5,250; Most valuable player: $15,000; All-WNBA First Team member: $10,000; All-Star Game participant: $2,500.[44]\\r\\nThe following shows the top jersey sales since the start of the 2017 season.\\r\\nThe following shows the top teams sales since the start of the 2017 season.\\r\\nIn 2012, however, average attendance per game dropped from 7,955 to 7,457 (-6.3%). Attendance per game stayed consistent at around 7,520 per game. However, in 2015 the WNBAs attendance per game decreased by 3.4 percent to 7,318. This is a record low for the WNBA since it was created in 1997. Many teams have experienced drops within their attendance; (San Antonio Stars: -37.4%, Washington Mystics: -7.9%, Tulsa Shock: -7.2%)[45] these losses have caused the attendance of the WNBA to drop.\\r\\nPresident Laurel Richie stated that after the 2015 season ends they will create an expansion committee and begin evaluating if and how the WNBA should go about expanding their reach.\\r\\nCurrently, WNBA games are televised throughout the U.S. by ABC, ESPN2 and NBA TV.\\r\\nIn the early years, two women's-oriented networks, Lifetime and Oxygen, also broadcast games including the first game of the WNBA. NBC showed games from 1997 to 2002 as part of their NBA on NBC coverage before the league transferred the rights to ABC/ESPN.\\r\\nIn 2007, the WNBA and ESPN came to an 8-year television agreement. The agreement would be the first to pay television rights fees to the league's teams. Never before has an agreement promised rights fees to a women's professional league. The agreement runs from 2009 to 2016 and is worth millions of dollars.[50]\\r\\nIn June 2007, the WNBA signed a contract extension with ESPN. The new television deal runs from 2009 to 2016. A minimum of 18 games will be broadcast on ABC, ESPN, and ESPN2 each season; the rights to broadcast the first regular season game and the All-Star game are held by ABC. Additionally, a minimum of 11 postseason games will be broadcast on any of the three stations.[51] Along with this deal, came the first ever rights fees to be paid to a women's professional sports league. Over the eight years of the contract, \\"millions and millions of dollars\\" will be \\"dispersed to the league's teams.\\"[50]\\r\\nIn 2013 the WNBA and ESPN signed a six-year extension on the broadcast deal to cover 2017ÿ2022. In the new deal, a total of 30 games would be shown each season on ESPN networks. Each team would receive around $1 million per year.[52]\\r\\nSome teams offer games on local radio, while all teams have some games broadcast on local television stations:\\r\\nFrom 2010 to 2011 the regular season broadcast drew 270,000 viewers a growth of 5 percent from 2010s numbers.[53] As sponsorships continued to grow with deals from ESPN to air WNBA games on ESPN and ESPN 2. The league did experience some success on the digital forefront. Its saw increases on it mobile page views by 26 percent along with a major increase in its social media space; Instagram grew by 51 percent this past year.\\r\\nIn 2009, the WNBA announced the launch of WNBA LiveAccess, a feature on WNBA.com that provides fans with access to more than 200 live game webcasts throughout the WNBA season. All of the WNBA LiveAccess games are then archived for on-demand viewing. Most games (except broadcasts on ABC, ESPN or ESPN2, which are available on ESPN3) are available via this system. The first use of LiveAccess was the E League versus Chicago Sky preseason game.[54]\\r\\nPrior to the 2011 season, LiveAccess was given an overhaul, and the system became more reliable and many new features were added. Before the 2012 season, it was announced that users of LiveAccess would have to pay a $4.99 subscription fee to use the service. In 2013, this was increased to $14.99. In 2014 the streaming service was renamed WNBA League Pass.\\r\\nOn the 2008 season opening day (May 17), ABC broadcast the Los Angeles Sparks and Phoenix Mercury matchup to showcase new rookie sensation Candace Parker. The game received a little over 1 million viewers.\\r\\nRatings still remain poor in comparison to NBA games. In 2008, WNBA games averaged just 413,000 viewers, compared to 1.46 million viewers on ESPN and over 2.2 million on ABC for NBA games.[60] In addition, WNBA games have much poorer visibility, attendance, and ratings than NCAA games.[61]","input":"Who are the oldest players in the wnba?"},{"output":"the eighth century BC","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nArchaic Greece was the period in Greek history lasting from the eighth century BC to the second Persian invasion of Greece in 480 BC,[1] following the Greek Dark Ages and succeeded by the Classical period. The period began with a massive increase in the Greek population[2] and a series of significant changes which rendered the Greek world at the end of the eighth century as entirely unrecognisable as compared to its beginning.[3] \\r\\nAccording to Anthony Snodgrass, the Archaic period in ancient Greece was bounded by two revolutions in the Greek world.  It began with a \\"structural revolution\\" which \\"drew the political map of the Greek world\\" and established the poleis, the distinctively Greek city-states, and ended with the intellectual revolution of the Classical period.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Archaic period saw developments in Greek politics, economics, international relations, warfare, and culture.  It laid the groundwork for the Classical period, both politically and culturally.  It was in the Archaic period that the Greek alphabet developed, that the earliest surviving Greek literature was composed, that monumental sculpture and red-figure pottery began in Greece, and that the hoplite became the core of Greek armies.  In Athens, the earliest institutions of the democracy were implemented under Solon, and the reforms of Cleisthenes at the end of the Archaic period brought in Athenian democracy as it was during the Classical period.  In Sparta, many of the institutions credited to the reforms of Lycurgus were introduced during the period, the region of Messenia was brought under Spartan control, helotage was introduced, and the Peloponnesian League was founded, making Sparta the dominant power in the region.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe word \\"archaic\\" derives from the Greek word archaios, which means \\"old\\". It refers to the period in ancient Greek history before the Classical. The period is generally considered to have lasted from the beginning of the eighth century BC until the beginning of the fifth century BC,[5] with the foundation of the Olympic Games in 776 BC and the Second Persian invasion of Greece in 480 BC forming notional start and end dates.[6] The Archaic period was long considered to have been less important and historically interesting than the Classical period, and was primarily studied as a precursor to it.[7] More recently, however, Archaic Greece has come to be studied for its own achievements.[4] With this reassessment of the significance of the Archaic period, some scholars have objected to the term \\"archaic\\", due to its connotations in English of being primitive and outdated. No term which has been suggested to replace it has gained widespread currency, however, and the term is still in use.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nMuch of our evidence about the Classical period of ancient Greece comes from written histories, such as Thucydides' History of the Peloponnesian War.  By contrast, we have no such evidence from the Archaic period.  We have written accounts of life in the period in the form of poetry, and epigraphical evidence, including parts of law codes, inscriptions on votive offerings, and epigrams inscribed on tombs.  However, none of this evidence is in the quantity for which we have it in the Classical period.[8]  What is lacking in written evidence, however, is made up for in the rich archaeological evidence from the Archaic Greek world.  Indeed, where much of our knowledge of Classical Greek art comes from later Roman copies, all of the surviving Archaic Greek art is original.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nOther sources for the period are the traditions recorded by later Greek writers such as Herodotus.[8]  However, these traditions are not part of any form of history as we would recognise it today; those transmitted by Herodotus he recorded whether or not he believed them to be accurate.[10]  Indeed, Herodotus does not even record any dates before 480 BC.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nPolitically, the Archaic period saw the development of the polis (or city-state) as the predominant unit of political organisation. Many cities throughout Greece came under the rule of autocratic leaders, called \\"tyrants\\". The period also saw the development of law and systems of communal decision-making, with the earliest evidence for law codes and constitutional structures dating to the period. By the end of the Archaic period, both the Athenian and Spartan constitutions seem to have developed into their classical forms.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Archaic period saw significant urbanisation, and the development of the concept of the polis as it was used in Classical Greece.  By Solon's time, if not before, the word \\"polis\\" had acquired its classical meaning,[12] and though the emergence of the polis as a political community was still in progress at this point,[13] the polis as an urban centre was a product of the eighth century.[14]  However, the polis did not become the dominant form of socio-political organisation throughout Greece in the Archaic period, and in the north and west of the country it did not become dominant until some way into the Classical period.[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe urbanisation process in Archaic Greece known as \\"synoecism\\" ÿ the amalgamation of several small settlements into a single urban centre ÿ took place in much of Greece in the eighth century BC.  Both Athens and Argos, for instance, began to coalesce into single settlements around the end of that century.[14]  In some settlements, this physical unification was marked by the construction of defensive city walls, as was the case in Smyrna by the middle of the eighth century BC, and Corinth by the middle of the seventh century BC.[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nIt seems that the evolution of the polis as a socio-political structure, rather than a simply geographical one, can be attributed to this urbanisation, as well as a significant population increase in the eighth century.  These two factors created a need for a new form of political organisation, as the political systems in place at the beginning of the Archaic period quickly became unworkable.[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nThough in the early part of the Classical period the city of Athens was both culturally and politically dominant,[9] it was not until the late sixth century BC that it became a leading power in Greece.[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe attempted coup by Cylon of Athens may be the earliest event in Athenian history which is clearly attested by ancient sources, dating to around 636.[17]  At this time, it seems that Athens' monarchy had already been ended and the archonship had replaced it as the most important executive office in the state,[18] though the archonship could only be held by members of the Eupatridae, the families which made up Athens' aristocracy.[19]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe earliest laws of Athens were established by Draco, in 621/0;[20] his law on homicide was the only one to have survived to the Classical period.  Draco's law code aimed to replace private revenge as the first and only response of an individual to an offence committed against them.[20]  The law code of Draco, however, failed to prevent the tensions between the rich and poor which were the impetus to Solon's reforms.[21]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 594/3 BC, Solon was appointed \\"archon and mediator\\".[22]  Exactly what his reforms consisted of is uncertain.  He claimed to have taken up the horoi to set the land free, but the exact meaning of horoi is unknown;[22] their removal seems, however, to have been part of the problem of hektemoroi ÿ another word whose meaning is obscure.[23]  Solon was also credited with abolishing slavery for debtors,[24] and establishing limits on who could be granted Athenian citizenship.[25]\\r\\n\\r\\nSolon instituted radical constitutional reform, replacing noble birth as a qualification for office with income.[25]  The poorest ÿ called thetes ÿ could hold no offices, although they could attend the Assembly and the law courts, while the richest class ÿ the pentacosiomedimni ÿ were the only people eligible to become treasurer, and possibly archon.[26]  He set up the Council of the Four Hundred,[27] responsible for discussing motions which were to come before the Assembly.[28]  Finally, Solon substantially reduced the powers of the archon by giving citizens the right of appeal; their case was judged by the Assembly.[29]\\r\\n\\r\\nSparta's constitution took on the form it would have in the Classical period during the eighth century BC.[30]  The First Messenian War, probably taking place from approximately 740 to 720 BC,[31] saw the strengthening of the powers of the Gerousia against the assembly,[32] and the enslavement of the Messenian population as Helots.[33]  Around the same time, the ephors gained the power to restrict the actions of the kings of Sparta.[30]  From around 560 BC, Sparta began to build a series of alliances with other Greek states, which became the Peloponnesian League: by 550, cities such as Elis, Corinth, and Megara would be part of the alliance.[34]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the eighth and seventh centuries BC, Greeks began to spread across the Mediterranean, the Sea of Marmara, and the Black Sea.[35]  This was not simply for trade, but also to found settlements.  These Greek colonies were not, as Roman colonies were, dependent on their mother-city, but were independent city-states in their own right.[35]\\r\\n\\r\\nGreeks settled outside of Greece in two distinct ways.  The first was in permanent settlements founded by Greeks, which formed as independent poleis.  The second form was in what historians refer to as emporia; trading posts which were occupied by both Greeks and non-Greeks and which were primarily concerned with the manufacture and sale of goods.  Examples of this latter type of settlement are found at Al Mina in the east and Pithekoussai in the west.[36]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe earliest Greek colonies were on Sicily.  Many of these were founded by people from Chalcis, but other Greek states, such as Corinth and Megara were also responsible for early colonies in the area.[37]  By the end of the eighth century BC, Greek settlements in southern Italy were also well established.[38] In the seventh century, Greek colonists expanded the areas that they settled.  In the west, colonies were founded as far afield as Marseilles. In the east, the north Aegean, the Sea of Marmara, and the Black Sea all saw colonies founded.[39] The dominant coloniser in these parts was Miletus.[40] At the same time, early colonies such as Syracuse and Megara Hyblaia began to themselves establish colonies.[39]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the west, Sicily and southern Italy were some of the largest recipients of Greek colonisers.  Indeed, so many Greek settlements were founded in southern Italy that it was known in antiquity as Magna Graecia ÿ \\"Great Greece\\".  It has been observed that in the last quarter of the eighth century, new Greek settlements were founded in Sicily and southern Italy at an average rate of one every other year, and Greek colonists continued to found cities in Italy until the mid-fifth century BC.[41]\\r\\n\\r\\nArchaic Greece from the mid-seventh century BC has sometimes been called an \\"Age of Tyrants\\".  The word ?ϫ? (tyrannos, whence the English \\"tyrant\\") first appeared in Greek literature in a poem of Archilochus, to describe the Lydian ruler Gyges.[42]  The earliest Greek tyrant was Cypselus, who seized power in a coup in 655 BC.[43]  He was followed by a series of others in the mid-seventh century BC, such as Orthagoras in Sicyon and Theagenes in Megara.[44]\\r\\n\\r\\nVarious explanations have been provided for the rise of tyranny in the seventh century BC.  The most popular of these explanations dates back to Aristotle, who argued that tyrants were set up by the people in response to the nobility becoming less tolerable.[45]  As there is no evidence from the time that the nobility were becoming increasingly arrogant during the period, modern explanations of seventh century tyranny have tried to find other reasons for unrest among the people.[46]  Against this position, Drews argues that tyrannies were set up by individuals who controlled private armies, and that early tyrants did not need the support of the people at all,[47] whilst Hammond suggests that tyrannies were established as a consequence of in-fighting between rival oligarchs, rather than between the oligarchs and the people.[48]\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, recently historians have begun to question the existence of a seventh century \\"age of tyrants\\".  In the Archaic period, the Greek word tyrannos, according to Victor Parker, did not have the negative connotations it had gained by the time Aristotle wrote his Constitution of the Athenians.  When Archilochus used the word tyrant, it was synonymous with anax (an Archaic Greek word meaning \\"king\\").[49] Parker dates the first use of the word tyrannos in a negative context to the first half of the sixth century, at least fifty years after Cypselus took power in Corinth.[50]  It was not until the time of Thucydides that tyrannos and basileus (\\"king\\") were consistently distinguished.[51] Similarly, Greg Anderson has argued that Archaic Greek tyrants were not considered illegitimate rulers,[52] and cannot be distinguished from any other rulers of the same period.[53]\\r\\n\\r\\nGreek population doubled during the eighth century, resulting in more and larger settlements than previously. This was part of a wider phenomenon of population growth across the Mediterranean region at this time, which may have been caused by a climatic shift that took place between 850 and 750, which made the region cooler and wetter. This led to the expansion of population into uncultivated areas of Greece and was probably also a driver for colonisation abroad.[54]\\r\\n\\r\\nEvidence from human remains shows that average age at death increased over the Archaic period, but there is no clear trend for other measures of health.[55] The size of houses gives some evidence for prosperity within society; in the eighth and seventh centuries, the average house size remained constant around 45ÿ50 m2, but the number of very large and very small houses increased, indicating increasing economic inequality. From the end of the seventh century, this trend reversed, with houses clustering closely around a growing average.[56]\\r\\n\\r\\nNot all arable land in Greece was yet under cultivation in the Archaic period. Farms appear to have been small, cohesive units, concentrated near settlements. They were highly diversified, growing a wide variety of crops simultaneously, in order to make consistent use of human resources throughout the year and to ensure that the failure of any one crop was not too much of a disaster. Crop rotation was practiced, alternating between legumes and cereals (barley and durum), and the land was left fallow every other year. Alongside these, farmers cultivated vines, olives, fruit, and vegetables as cash crops for sale in local centres and abroad.[57] Livestock were of secondary importance. Sheep and goats, in particular, were kept for meat, milk, wool, and fertiliser, but they were difficult to sustain and large herds were a sign of exceptional wealth.[58] A team of oxen could increase agricultural output significantly, but were expensive to maintain.[59] Horses and large herds of cattle were the preserve of the mega-rich.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis pattern had probably developed before the beginning of the period and remained relatively consistent throughout it. The idea that it was preceded by a period of pastoralism and that agriculture only became dominant in the course of the Archaic period is not supported by the archaeological or literary evidence.[60] No technological innovations in agriculture appear to have occurred, except possibly the increased use of iron tools and more intensive use of manure.[61]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe main source for the practice of agriculture in the period is Hesiod's Works and Days, which gives the impression of very small subsistence holdings in which the owner performed most of the labour personally; close reading reveals that much of the produce is to be sold for profit, much of the work to be performed by slaves (douloi or dmoes), and much of the owner's time to be spent away from the farm.[62] Slaves' labour was supplemented by labourers who worked for a wage, as sharecroppers (called hektemoroi at Athens), or to pay off debts; this practice seems to have increased in the eighth century as the growth of the population increased the number of workers available, and intensified in the seventh century with the development of legally enforced debts and the status of the labourers increasingly becoming a source of social strife.[63][54]\\r\\n\\r\\nBy the late eighth century BC, the Archaic Greek world had become involved in an active trade network around the Aegean.[64]  It was this trade network which was the source of the orientalizing influence on Greek art in the early part of the Archaic period.  Meanwhile, to the west, trade between Corinth and Magna Graecia in Southern Italy and Sicily was booming.[65]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe eastern trade mainly involved the Greek islands, with Aegina, for instance, acting as an intermediary between the east and the Greek mainland.[66]  East Greek states would go on to become extremely prosperous through the sixth century due to the trade with Asia and Egypt.[67]  Of the mainland cities, those on the coast were the biggest recipients of trade from the east, especially Corinth.[66]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the early part of the Archaic period, Athens does not seem to have been particularly actively involved in this eastern trade, and very few examples of eastern imports have been found in Athens from the eighth or early seventh centuries.[68]  By contrast, nearby Euboea had trade-links with the east as early as the first half of the eighth century,[69] and the earliest pottery from the Greek islands found at Al Mina in modern Syria is from Euboea.[70]\\r\\n\\r\\nBy the sixth century, Greece was part of a trade network spanning the entire Mediterranean.  Sixth century Laconian pottery has been found as far afield as Marseilles and Carthage to the west, Crete to the south and Sardis to the East.[71]\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the beginning of the Archaic period, coinage had not yet been invented. The Greeks measured the value of objects or fines using certain valuable objects, such as oxen, tripods, and metal spits, as units of account. As in the Near East, precious metal bullion was used as a medium of exchange, principally gold at first, but mainly silver by the beginning of the sixth century. The weight of this bullion (often known as hacksilber) was measured using standard units, named for their value in terms of metal spits (obeloi) and handfuls (drachmai) of metal spits; these terms would later be used as names for Greek coin denominations.[72]\\r\\n\\r\\nCoinage was invented in Lydia around 650 BC. It was quickly adopted by Greek communities in western Asia Minor, although the older system of bullion remained in use as well.[73] The island of Aegina began to issue its distinctive \\"turtle\\" coins before 550 BC, and from there coinage spread to Athens, Corinth and the Cycladic Islands in the 540s BC,[74] Southern Italy and Sicily before 525 BC,[75] and Thrace before 514 BC.[76] Most of these coinages were very small and were mostly only used within the community that issued them, but the \\"turtles\\" of Aegina (from 530 or 520 BC) and the \\"owls\\" of Athens (from 515 BC) were issued in great quantity and exported throughout the Greek world.[77]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe images on coins initially changed rapidly, but increasingly each community settled on a single image or set of images.[78] Some of these were the symbol or image of an important deity in the city or visual puns on the city's name,[79] but in many cases their meaning is obscure and may not have been chosen for any special reason.[80]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe reasons for the rapid and widespread adoption of coinage by the Greeks are not entirely clear and several possibilities, which are not mutually exclusive, have been suggested. One possibility is the increased ease of commerce which coinage allowed. Coins were of standardised weights, which meant that their value could be determined without weighing them. Furthermore, it was not necessary for users of coinage to spend time determining whether the silver was pure silver; the fact that the coin had been issued by the community was a promise that it was worth a set value.[81] Another possibility is that coinage was adopted specifically to enable communities to make payments to their citizens, mercenaries and artisans in a transparent, fair and efficient way. Similarly, when wealthy members of the community were required to contribute wealth to the community for festivals and the equipment of navies, coinage made the process more efficient and transparent.[82] A third possibility, that coinage was adopted as an expression of a community's independence and identity, seems to be anachronistic.[83]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the visual arts, the Archaic period is characterised by a shift towards representational and naturalistic styles.  It was the period in which monumental sculpture was introduced to Greece, and in which Greek pottery styles went through great changes, from the repeating patterns of the late geometric period to the earliest red figure vases.  The early part of the Archaic period saw distinctive orientalizing influences,[84] both in pottery and in sculpture.  The period was also an innovative period in Greek literature, with the development of the Greek alphabet, and the composition of the earliest surviving Greek poetry.\\r\\n\\r\\nLife-size human sculpture in hard stone began in Greece in the Archaic period.[85]  This was inspired in part by ancient Egyptian stone sculpture:[86] the proportions of the New York Kouros exactly correspond to Egyptian rules about the proportion of human figures.[87]  In Greece, these sculptures best survive as religious dedications and grave markers, but the same techniques would have also been used to make cult images.[85]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe best-known types of Archaic sculpture are the kouros and kore, near life-size frontal statues of a young man or woman,[88] which were developed around the middle of the seventh century BC in the Cyclades.[89]  Probably the earliest kore produced was the Dedication of Nikandre, which was dedicated to Artemis at her temple on Delos between 660 and 650 BC,[90] while kouroi began to be created shortly after this.[91]  Kouroi and korai were used to represent both humans and divinities.[92]  Some kouroi, such as the Colossus of the Naxians from around 600 BC, are known to represent Apollo,[89] while the Phrasikleia Kore was meant to represent a young woman whose tomb it originally marked.[93] Early in the seventh century around 650 BC when kore are widely introduced, Daedalic style made an appearance in Greek sculpture.[94] This style consisted most noticeably of a geometric pattern of female subjects' hair framing their face. On male sculptures they were often posed with one foot in front, as if in motion.[94]\\r\\n\\r\\nOver the course of the sixth century, kouroi from Attica become more lifelike and naturalistic.  However, this trend does not appear elsewhere in the Greek world.[95]  The genre began to become less common over the last part of the sixth century as the elites who commissioned kouroi declined in influence, and by around 480 kouroi were no longer made.[96]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe period saw a shift in the decoration of Greek pottery from abstract to figurative styles.[97]\\r\\nDuring the Greek Dark Ages, following the fall of the Mycenaean civilisation, Greek pottery decoration had been based around increasingly elaborate geometrical patterns.[98]  Human figures first appeared on Greek pots in Crete in the early part of the ninth century BC, but did not become common on mainland Greek pottery until the middle of the eighth century BC.[99]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe eighth century saw the development of the orientalizing style, which signalled a shift away from the earlier geometric style and the accumulation of influences derived from Phoenicia and Syria.  This orientalizing influence seems to have come from goods imported to Greece from the Near East.[100]\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the beginning of the seventh century BC, vase painters in Corinth began to develop the black figure style.[101]  At the same time, potters began to use incisions in the clay of vases in order to draw outlines and interior detailing.[101]  This adoption of incision, probably taken from eastern metalwork, allowed potters to show fine details of their decorations.[102]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the Archaic period drew to a close, red-figure pottery was invented in Athens, with the first examples being produced about 525 BC, probably by the Andokides painter.[103] The invention of the red-figure technique in Athens came at around the same time as the development of other techniques such as the white ground technique and Six's technique.[104]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe earliest extant Greek literature comes from the Archaic period.  Poetry was the predominant form of literature in the period.[105]  Alongside the dominant lyric and epic traditions, tragedy began to develop in the archaic period, borrowing elements from the pre-existing genres of archaic Greek poetry.[106]  By the sixth century BC the first written prose in Greek literature appeared.[105]\\r\\n\\r\\nThough there would certainly have been a pre-existing literary tradition in Greece, the earliest surviving works are by Homer.[107]  Homer's poetry, though it dates to around the time that the Greeks developed writing, would have been composed orally ÿ the earliest surviving poetry to have certainly been composed in writing is that of Archilochus, from the mid-seventh century BC.[108]  In contrast with the Classical period, in which the literary culture of Athens dominated the Greek world, Archaic poetic tradition was geographically spread out.  Sappho and Alcaeus, for instance, were from Lesbos, while Pindar came from Thebes, and Alcman from Sparta.[109]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the end of the Mycenaean period, the art of writing was lost in Greece: by the ninth century probably no Greeks understood the Bronze Age Linear B writing system.[110]  From the ninth century BC, however, objects inscribed with Phoenician writing began to be brought into the Greek world, and it was from this Phoenician script that the Greek alphabet developed in the eighth century BC.  By the middle of the eighth century BC, pottery inscribed in Greek begins to occur in the archaeological record.[111]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe earliest known inscriptions in Greek tend to identify or explain the object on which they are inscribed.[112]  Possibly the earliest known Greek inscription is found on a jug from the first half of the eighth century BC, discovered in Osteria dell'Osa in Latium.[113]  Most early inscriptions were written in verse, though some from Ionia were in prose, influenced by the prose traditions of Ionia's eastern neighbours.[112]  From the beginning of the seventh century, curses and dedications began to be inscribed on objects,[113] and by the sixth century, surviving inscriptions include public records such as law codes, lists of officials, and records of treaties.[112]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the Archaic period, the most significant military development was the adoption of hoplite warfare by the Greek states.  This occurred in the early part of the seventh century BC.[114]  The panoply, or hoplite's armour, began to appear in the eighth century,[115] and the earliest known example comes from Argos in the late eighth century.[116]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile the pieces which made up the panoply were all in use in Greece by the end of the eighth century, our first evidence for it being worn as a complete set of armour does not come until around 675 BC, where it is depicted on a Corinthian vase painting.[117]  The adoption of the phalanx tactics which would be used by hoplites in the Classical period does not appear to have taken place until the mid-seventh century;[117] before this point, the older style of combat in which spears were thrown at the enemy before closing quarters was still used.[118]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the naval sphere, the Archaic period saw the development of the trireme in Greece.  In the eighth century, Greek navies began to use ships with two banks of oars, and the three banked trireme seems to have become popular in the seventh century.[119]  Corinth was probably the first place in the Greek world to adopt the trireme in the mid seventh century BC.[119]  It was not until the mid-sixth century, however, that the trireme became the most popular design for Greek battleships, due to its expense.[119]  According to Thucydides, the period saw the first Greek naval battles; he dates the first to around 664 BC.[120]","input":"When did the archaic period in greece begin?"},{"output":"108-year","context":"","input":"How long did it take the cubs to win a world series?"},{"output":"Abraham Lincoln","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nAmerican Indian WarsAmerican Civil War\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the American Civil War, the Union Army referred to the United States Army, the land force that fought to preserve the Union of the collective states. Also known as the Federal Army, it proved essential to the preservation of the United States of America as a working, viable republic.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Union Army was made up of the permanent regular army of the United States, but further fortified, augmented, and strengthened by the many temporary units of dedicated volunteers as well as including those who were drafted in to service as conscripts. To this end, the Union Army fought and ultimately triumphed over the efforts of the Confederate States Army in the American Civil War. \\r\\n\\r\\nOver the course of the war, 2,128,948 men enlisted in the Union Army,[1] including 178,895 colored troops; 25% of the white men who served were foreign-born.[2] Of these soldiers, 596,670 were killed, wounded or went missing.[3] The initial call-up was for just three months, after which many of these men chose to reenlist for an additional three years.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the American Civil War began in April 1861, there were only 16,367 men in the U.S. Army, including 1,108 commissioned officers. Approximately 20% of these officers, most of them Southerners, resigned (willfully abandoning their legal commitments and responsibilities as officers in the military of the United States, to which each and every one of them had sworn an oath), choosing to tie their lives and fortunes to Army of the Confederacy.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn addition, almost 200 West Point graduates who had previously left the Army, including Ulysses S. Grant, William Tecumseh Sherman, and Braxton Bragg, would return to service at the outbreak of the war. This group's loyalties were far more sharply divided, with 92 donning Confederate gray and 102 putting on the blue of the Union Army. The U.S. Army consisted of ten regiments of infantry, four of artillery, two of cavalry, two of dragoons, and three of mounted infantry. The regiments were scattered widely. Of the 197 companies in the army, 179 occupied 79 isolated posts in the West, and the remaining 18 manned garrisons east of the Mississippi River, mostly along the CanadaÿUnited States border and on the Atlantic coast.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith the Southern slave states declaring secession from the Union, and with this drastic shortage of men in the army, President Abraham Lincoln called on the states to raise a force of 75,000 men for three months to put down this subversive insurrection. Lincoln's call forced the border states to choose sides, and four seceded, making the Confederacy eleven states strong. It turned out that the war itself proved to be much longer and far more extensive in scope and scale than anyone on either side, Union North or Confederate South, expected or even imagined at the outset on the date of July 22, 1861. That was the day that Congress initially approved and authorized subsidy to allow and support a volunteer army of up to 500,000 men to the cause. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe call for volunteers initially was easily met by patriotic Northerners, abolitionists, and even immigrants who enlisted for a steady income and meals. Over 10,000 Germans in New York and Pennsylvania immediately responded to Lincoln's call, and the French were also quick to volunteer. As more men were needed, however, the number of volunteers fell and both money bounties and forced conscription had to be turned to. Nevertheless, between April 1861 and April 1865, at least 2,500,000 men served in the Union Army, of whom the majority were volunteers.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is a misconception that the South held an advantage because of the large percentage of professional officers who resigned to join the Confederate army. At the start of the war, there were 824 graduates of the U.S. Military Academy on the active list; of these, 296 resigned or were dismissed, and 184 of those became Confederate officers. Of the approximately 900 West Point graduates who were then civilians, 400 returned to the Union Army and 99 to the Confederate. Therefore, the ratio of Union to Confederate professional officers was 642 to 283.[5] (One of the resigning officers was Robert E. Lee, who had initially been offered the assignment as commander of a field army to suppress the rebellion. Lee disapproved of secession, but refused to bear arms against his native state, Virginia, and resigned to accept the position as commander of Virginian C.S. forces. He eventually became the commander of the Confederate army.) The South did have the advantage of other military colleges, such as The Citadel and Virginia Military Institute, but they produced fewer officers. Though officers were able to resign, enlisted soldiers did not have this right; which meant that they usually had to either desert or wait until their enlistment term was over in order to join the Confederate States Army. While the total number of those is unknown, only 26 enlisted men and non-commissioned officers of the regular army are known to have legally left the army to join the Confederate army when the war began.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Union Army was composed of numerous organizations, which were generally organized geographically.\\r\\n\\r\\nEach of these armies was usually commanded by a major general. Typically, the Department or District commander also had field command of the army of the same name, but some conflicts within the ranks occurred when this was not true, particularly when an army crossed a geographic boundary.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe regular army, the permanent United States Army, was intermixed into various formations of the Union Army, forming a cadre of experienced and skilled troops. They were regarded by many as elite troops and often held in reserve during battles in case of emergencies. This force was quite small compared to the massive state-raised volunteer forces that comprised the bulk of the Union Army.\\r\\n\\r\\nRough unit sizes for Union combat units during the war:[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nSoldiers were organized by military specialty. The combat arms included infantry, cavalry, artillery, and other such smaller organizations such as the United States Marine Corps, which, at some times, was detached from its navy counterpart for land based operations. The Signal Corps was created and deployed for the first time, through the leadership of Albert J. Myer.\\r\\n\\r\\nBelow major units like armies, soldiers were organized mainly into regiments, the main fighting unit with which a soldier would march and be deployed with, commanded by a colonel, lieutenant colonel, or possibly a major. According to W. J. Hardee's \\"Rifle and Light Infantry Tactics\\" (1855), the primary tactics for riflemen and light infantry in use immediately prior and during the Civil War, there would typically be, within each regiment, ten companies, each commanded by a captain, and deployed according to the ranks of captains. Some units only possessed between four and eight companies and were generally known as battalions.[8] Regiments were almost always raised within a single state, and were generally referred by number and state, e.g. 54th Massachusetts, 20th Maine, etc.\\r\\n\\r\\nRegiments were usually grouped into brigades under the command of a brigadier general. However, brigades were changed easily as the situation demanded; the regiment was the main form of permanent grouping. Brigades were usually formed once regiments reached the battlefield, according to where the regiment might be deployed, and alongside which other regiments.\\r\\n\\r\\nSeveral men served as generals-in-chief of the Union Army throughout its existence:\\r\\n\\r\\nThe gap from March 11 to July 23, 1862, was filled with direct control of the army by President Lincoln and United States Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton, with the help of an unofficial \\"War Board\\" that was established on March 17, 1862. The board consisted of Ethan A. Hitchcock, the chairman, with Department of War bureau chiefs Lorenzo Thomas, Montgomery C. Meigs, Joseph G. Totten, James W. Ripley, and Joseph P. Taylor.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nScott was an elderly veteran of the War of 1812 and the MexicanÿAmerican War and could not perform his duties effectively. His successor, Maj. Gen. McClellan, built and trained the massive Union Army of the Potomac, the primary fighting force in the Eastern Theater. Although he was popular among the soldiers, McClellan was relieved from his position as general-in-chief because of his overcautious strategy and his contentious relationship with his commander-in-chief, President Lincoln. (He remained commander of the Army of the Potomac through the Peninsula Campaign and the Battle of Antietam.) His replacement, Major General Henry W. Halleck, had a successful record in the Western Theater, but was more of an administrator than a strategic planner and commander.\\r\\n\\r\\nUlysses S. Grant was the final commander of the Union Army. He was famous for his victories in the West when he was appointed lieutenant general and general-in-chief of the Union Army in March 1864. Grant supervised the Army of the Potomac (which was formally led by his subordinate, Maj. Gen. George G. Meade) in delivering the final blows to the Confederacy by engaging Confederate forces in many fierce battles in Virginia, the Overland Campaign, conducting a war of attrition that the larger Union Army was able to survive better than its opponent. Grant laid siege to Lee's army at Petersburg, Virginia, and eventually captured Richmond, the capital of the Confederacy. He developed the strategy of coordinated simultaneous thrusts against wide portions of the Confederacy, most importantly the Georgia and Carolinas Campaigns of William Tecumseh Sherman and the Shenandoah Valley campaign of Philip Sheridan. These campaigns were characterized by another strategic notion of Grant's-better known as total wardenying the enemy access to resources needed to continue the war by widespread destruction of its factories and farms along the paths of the invading Union armies.\\r\\n\\r\\nGrant had critics who complained about the high numbers of casualties that the Union Army suffered while he was in charge, but Lincoln would not replace Grant, because, in Lincoln's words: \\"I cannot spare this man. He fights.\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAmong memorable field leaders of the army were Nathaniel Lyon (first Union general to be killed in battle during the war), William Rosecrans, George Henry Thomas and William Tecumseh Sherman. Others, of lesser competence, included Benjamin F. Butler.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe decisive victories by Grant and Sherman resulted in the surrender of the major Confederate armies. The first and most significant was on April 9, 1865, when Robert E. Lee surrendered the Army of Northern Virginia to Grant at Appomattox Court House. Although there were other Confederate armies that surrendered in the following weeks, such as Joseph E. Johnston's in North Carolina, this date was nevertheless symbolic of the end of the bloodiest war in American history, the end of the Confederate States of America, and the beginning of the slow process of Reconstruction.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn his 1997 book examining the motivations of the American Civil War's soldiers, For Cause and Comrades, historian James M. McPherson states that Union soldiers fought to preserve the United States, as well as to end slavery, stating that:\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile restoration of the Union was the main goal for which they fought, they became convinced that this goal was unattainable without striking against slavery.\\r\\nMcPherson states that witnessing the slave system of the Confederacy first-hand also strengthened the anti-slavery views of Union soldiers,[10] who were appalled by its brutality.[10] He stated that \\"Experience in the South reinforced the antislavery sentiments of many soldiers.\\"[10] One Pennsylvanian Union soldier spoke to a slave woman whose husband was whipped, and was appalled by what she had to tell him of slavery. He stated that \\"I thought I had hated slavery as much as possible before I came here, but here, where I can see some of its workings, I am more than ever convinced of the cruelty and inhumanity of the system.\\"[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Union Army was composed of many different ethnic groups, including large numbers of immigrants. About 25% of the white men who served in the Union Army were foreign-born.[11] This means that about 1,600,000 enlistments were made by men who were born in the United States, including about 200,000 African Americans.  About 200,000 enlistments were by men born in one of the German states (although this is somewhat speculative since anyone serving from a German family tended to be identified as German regardless of where they were actually born).[12] About 200,000 soldiers and sailors were born in Ireland.  Although some soldiers came from as far away as Malta, Italy, India, and Russia, most of the remaining foreign-born soldiers came from England, Scotland and Canada.\\r\\n\\r\\nMany immigrant soldiers formed their own regiments, such as the Irish Brigade (69th New York, 63rd New York, 88th New York, 28th Massachusetts, 116th Pennsylvania); the Swiss Rifles (15th Missouri); the Gardes Lafayette (55th New York); the Garibaldi Guard (39th New York); the Martinez Militia (1st New Mexico); the Polish Legion (58th New York); the German Rangers (52nd New York); the Cameron Highlanders (79th New York Volunteer Infantry); and the Scandinavian Regiment (15th Wisconsin). But for the most part, the foreign-born soldiers were scattered as individuals throughout units.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor comparison, the Confederate Army was not very diverse: 91% of Confederate soldiers were native born white men and only 9% were foreign-born white men, Irish being the largest group with others including Germans, French, Mexicans (though most of them simply happened to have been born when the Southwest was still part of Mexico), and British. Some Confederate propaganda condemned foreign-born soldiers in the Union Army, likening them to the hated Hessians of the American Revolution. Also, a relatively small number of Native Americans (Cherokee, Chickasaw, Choctaw, and Creek) fought for the Confederacy.\\r\\n\\r\\nVarious organizational and administrative issues arose during the war, which had a major effect on subsequent military procedures.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe inclusion of blacks as combat soldiers became a major issue. Eventually, it was realized, especially after the valiant effort of the 54th Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry in the Battle of Fort Wagner, that blacks were fully able to serve as competent and reliable soldiers. This was partly due to the efforts of Robert Smalls, who, while still a slave, won fame by defecting from the Confederacy, and bringing a Confederate transport ship which he was piloting. He later met with Edwin Stanton, Secretary of War, to argue for including blacks in combat units. This led to the formation of the first combat unit for black soldiers, the 1st South Carolina Volunteers. Regiments for black soldiers were eventually referred to as United States Colored Troops. Black Soldiers were paid less than white Soldiers until late in the war and were, in general, treated harshly.\\r\\n\\r\\nBattlefield supplies were a major problem. They were greatly improved by new techniques in preserving food and other perishables, and in transport by railroad. General Montgomery C. Meigs was one of the most important Union Army leaders in this field.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Civil War drove many innovations in military tactics.[19] W. J. Hardee published the first revised infantry tactics for use with modern rifles in 1855. However, even these tactics proved ineffective in combat, as it involved massed volley fire, in which entire units (primarily regiments) would fire simultaneously. These tactics had not been tested before in actual combat, and the commanders of these units would post their soldiers at incredibly close range, compared to the range of the rifled musket, which led to very high mortality rates. In a sense, the weapons had evolved beyond the tactics, which would soon change as the war drew to a close.[20]  Railroads provided the first mass movement of troops. The electric telegraph was used by both sides, which enabled political and senior military leaders to pass orders to and receive reports from commanders in the field.[21]\\r\\n\\r\\nThere were many other innovations brought by necessity. Generals were forced to reexamine the offensive minded tactics developed during the MexicanÿAmerican War where attackers could mass to within 100 yards of the defensive lines, the maximum effective range of smoothbore muskets.  Attackers would have to endure one volley of inaccurate smoothbore musket fire before they could close with the defenders.  But by the Civil War, the smoothbores had been replaced with rifled muskets, using the quick loadable mini ball, with accurate ranges up to 900 yards.  Defense now dominated the battlefield.  Now attackers, whether advancing in ordered lines or by rushes, were subjected to three or four aimed volleys before they could get among the defenders.  This made offensive tactics that were successful only 20 years before nearly obsolete.[22]\\r\\n\\r\\nDesertion was a major problem for both sides. The daily hardships of war, forced marches, thirst, suffocating heat, disease, delay in pay, solicitude for family, impatience at the monotony and futility of inactive service, panic on the eve of battle, the sense of war-weariness, the lack of confidence in commanders, and the discouragement of defeat (especially early on for the Union Army), all tended to lower the morale of the Union Army and to increase desertion.[23][24]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1861 and 1862, the war was going badly for the Union Army and there were, by some counts, 180,000 desertions. In 1863 and 1864, the bitterest two years of the war, the Union Army suffered over 200 desertions every day, for a total of 150,000 desertions during those two years. This puts the total number of desertions from the Union Army during the four years of the war at nearly 350,000. Using these numbers, 15% of Union soldiers deserted during the war. Official numbers put the number of deserters from the Union Army at 200,000 for the entire war, or about 8% of Union Army soldiers. Since desertion is defined as being AWOL for 30 or more days and some soldiers returned within that time period, as well as some deserters being labeled missing-in-action or vice versa, accurate counts are difficult to determine. Many historians estimate the \\"real\\" desertion rate in the Union Army as between 9-12%.[25] About 1 out of 3 deserters returned to their regiments, either voluntarily or after being arrested and being sent back. Many of the desertions were by \\"professional\\" bounty men, men who would enlist to collect the often large cash bonuses and then desert at the earliest opportunity to do the same elsewhere. If not caught and executed, it could prove a very lucrative criminal enterprise.[26][27]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Irish were the main participants in the famous \\"New York Draft Riots\\" of 1863.[28] Stirred up by the instigating rhetoric of Democrat politicians,[29] the Irish had shown the strongest support for Southern aims prior to the start of the war and had long opposed abolitionism and the free black population, regarding them as competition for jobs and blaming them for driving down wages. Alleging that the war was merely an upper class abolitionist war to free slaves who might move north and compete for jobs and housing, the poorer classes did not welcome a draft, especially one from which a richer man could buy an exemption.  The poor formed clubs that would buy exemptions for their unlucky members. As a result of the Enrollment Act, rioting began in several Northern cities, the most heavily hit being New York City. A mob reported as consisting principally of Irish immigrants rioted in the summer of 1863, with the worst violence occurring in July during the Battle of Gettysburg. The mob set fire to everything from African American churches and an orphanage for  \\"colored children\\" as well as the homes of certain prominent Protestant abolitionists. A mob was reportedly repulsed from the offices of the staunchly pro-Union New York Tribune by workers wielding and firing two Gatling guns. The principal victims of the rioting were African Americans and activists in the anti-slavery movement. Not until victory was achieved at Gettysburg could the Union Army be sent in; some units had to open fire to quell the violence and stop the rioters. By the time the rioting was over, perhaps up to 1,000 people had been killed or wounded.[30]  There were a few small scale draft riots in rural areas of the Midwest and in the coal regions of Pennsylvania.[31][32]","input":"Who was the president of the union army?"},{"output":"11 April 1955","context":"General Choi Hong Hi (9 November 1918?ÿ 15 June 2002) was a South Korean Army general and martial artist who is a controversial figure in the history of the Korean martial art of taekwondo.[a] Choi is regarded by many as the \\"Founder of Taekwondo\\"most often by International Taekwon-Do Federation (ITF) organizations.[1][2][3][4][5] Others, such as the South Korean World Taekwondo Federation (WTF) organization, portray Choi as either an unimportant or a dishonorable figure in taekwondo history, whether by omitting him from their versions of taekwondo history[6] or through explicit statements.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChoi was born on 9 November 1918 in Hwa Dae, My?ngch'?n county, in what is now North Korea, which was then under Japanese rule.[8] At the time, the place was named Meigawa-gun (Myongchon-kun), Kankyo-hokudo (Hamgyong-Pukto), Chosen, as part of the Empire of Japan. Choi's father sent him to study calligraphy under Han Il Dong, who was also \\"a master of Taek Kyon, the ancient Korean art of foot fighting\\" (Park, 1993, p.?241).[8] Choi travelled to Japan, where he studied English, mathematics, and karate.[8][9] In Kyoto, he met a fellow Korean with the surname Kim, who was a karate instructor and taught Choi this martial art.[8] Choi also learned Shotokan karate under Funakoshi Gichin.[10] Just before he had left Korea, Choi apparently had a disagreement with a wrestler named Hu, and the possibility of a future confrontation inspired him to train; in his own words, \\"I would imagine that these were the techniques I would use to defend myself against the wrestler, Mr. Hu, if he did attempt to carry out his promise to tear me limb from limb when I eventually returned to Korea\\" (Park, 1993, p.?242).[8] Choi attained the rank of 1st dan in karate in 1939, and then 2nd dan soon after.[8][b]\\r\\nChoi had been forced to serve in the Japanese army during World War II, but was implicated in a rebellion and imprisoned, during which time he continued practicing martial arts.[8] Following the war, in January 1946, Choi was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the Korean army.[8] From 1946 to 1951, Choi received promotions to first lieutenant, captain, major, lieutenant colonel, colonel, and then brigadier general.[8] Choi was promoted to major general in 1954.[citation needed]\\r\\nChoi combined elements of Taekkyeon and Karate to develop a martial art that he called \\"Taekwon-Do\\" (???; ??), which means \\"foot, fist, art\\" or \\"the way of hand and foot\\" and it was so named on 11 April 1955.[8][11] Choi founded the Oh Do Kwan, and held an honorary 4th dan ranking in the Chung Do Kwan. Due to accusations of dishonesty, Choi was stripped of his rank and position in the Chung Do Kwan.[7] During the 1960s, Choi and Nam Tae Hi led the original masters of taekwondo in promoting their martial art around the world, though these would be only the first of many such endeavors.[citation needed]\\r\\nITF taekwondo organizations credit Choi with starting the spread of taekwondo internationally by stationing Korean taekwondo instructors around the world,[8] and have consistently claimed that ITF-style taekwondo is the only authentic style of taekwondo, most notably in early sections of its textbooks.[12] He was also the author of the first English taekwondo syllabus book, Taekwon-Do, published by Daeha Publication Company in 1965. In 1972, Choi went into exile in Canada after the South Korean government objected to his introduction of the sport into North Korea, and the South Korea government formed the WTF in 1973.[9] He moved again in 1979 to North Korea where he was welcomed by the government and supported in his project of spreading Taekwondo to the world.[13] He was remembered as the founder and champion of taekwondo.[citation needed]\\r\\nChoi died of cancer on 15 June 2002 in Pyongyang, North Korea.

Truman in 1946,[3] and entered the federal government into schools dietary programs on June 4, 1946.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe majority of the support provided to schools participating in the program comes in the form of a cash reimbursement for each meal served. Schools are also entitled to receive commodity foods and additional commodities as they are available from surplus agricultural stocks. The National School Lunch Program serves 30.5?million children each day at a cost of $8.7?billion for fiscal year 2007. Most participants are also eligible for food during the summer through the Summer Food Service Program.\\r\\n\\r\\nSchool feeding in the United States underwent the same evolution as in Europe, beginning with sporadic food services undertaken by private societies and associations interested in child welfare and education. The Children's Aid Society of New York initiated a program in 1853, serving meals to students attending the vocational school.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1894, the Starr Center Association in Philadelphia began serving penny lunches in one school, later expanding the service to another. Soon a lunch committee was established within the Home and School League, and lunches were extended to include nine schools in the city.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1909, Dr. Cheesman A. Herrick, who was principal of the William Penn High School for Girls was credited with accomplishing the transfer of responsibilities for operation and support of the lunch program from charitable organizations to the Philadelphia School Board. He requested that a system be established to assure that the lunches served would be based upon sound principles of nutrition and required that the program be under the direction of a home economics graduate. The Board granted his request on an experimental basis and on the condition that the program would be self-supporting. The experiment proved successful, and the following year lunch services were extended to the Southern Manual Training School and later to three additional units.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the spring of 1912, the School Board established a Department of High School Lunches and directed that the food services be inaugurated in all the high schools of the city. During all this time the Home and School League had continued operating the feeding program in the nine elementary schools, and continued to do so until May 1915, when it reported to the Board that the need for a lunch system had been clearly demonstrated and that it could not be successfully operated by an organization outside the school system. As a result, the School Board placed the operation of both high school and elementary lunch programs under the supervision of the Department of High School Lunches and authorized the extension of the program to other elementary schools.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn September 1908, the Women's Educational and Industrial Union in Boston begun to supply hot lunches to high schools which were under the supervision of the Boston School Committee.A central kitchen system was used and lunches were transported to the participating schools.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn January 1910, an experimental program for elementary schools took the form of a mid-morning lunch prepared by the class in Home Economics three days each week. On two days of each week sandwiches and milk were served. The children ate their meals at their desks, there being no lunchroom in the building. Before the end of the school year (1909ÿ10) five additional schools were benefiting from the program, and a total of 2,000 pupils were being served each day, according to a report submitted by Ellen H. Richards in the \\"Journal of Home Economics\\" for December 1910.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the scope of the meal supply expanded, local governments and school district boards could not provide the funds necessary to carry the increasing load. Supplementary contributions by charitable organizations and individuals did not suffice. Aid from Federal sources became inevitable. The earliest Federal aid came from the Reconstruction Finance Corporation in 1932 and 1933 when it granted loans to several towns in southwestern Missouri to cover the cost of labor employed in preparing and serving school lunches. Such Federal assistance was expanded to other areas in 1933 and 1934 under the operations of the Civil Works Administration and the Federal Emergency Relief Administration, reaching into 39 States and covering the employment of 7,442 women.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe depression of the 1930s brought on widespread unemployment. Much of the production of the farm went begging for a market, surpluses of farm products continued to mount, prices of farm products declined to a point where farm income provided only a meager subsistence. Millions of school children were unable to pay for their school lunches, and with but limited family resources to provide meals at home, the danger of malnutrition among children became a national concern.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nPublic Law 320 passed by the 74th Congress and approved August 24, 1936, made available to the Secretary of Agriculture an amount of money equal to 30 percent of the gross receipts from duties collected under the customs laws during each calendar year.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nNeedy families and school lunch programs became constructive outlets for the commodities purchased by the USDA under the terms of such legislation. Many needy school children could not afford to pay for lunches and were sorely in need of supplementary foods from a nutritional standpoint. Thus they would be using foods at school which would not otherwise be purchased in the market place and farmers would be helped by obtaining an outlet for their products at a reasonable price. The purchase and distribution program was assigned in 1935 to the Federal Surplus Commodities Corporation which had been established in 1933 as the Federal Surplus Relief Corporation to distribute surplus pork, dairy products, and wheat to the needy. These funds came from customs duties and were specifically designated to encourage agricultural surplus consumption via exports and domestic donations. In March 1937, there were 3,839 schools receiving commodities for lunch programs serving 342,031 children daily. Two years later, the number of schools participating had grown to 14,075 and the number of children had risen to 892,259. From 1939 to 1942the number of schools participating increased by 78,841, and the number of pupils participating increased by 5,272,540.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn July 1943, in an attempt to salvage the deterioration of school lunches, Congress passed Public Law 129 to amend the Agricultural Act of 1935. This law re-established school lunch programs using $60 million to cover the purchase of food, but not labor. The next year, Congress appropriated another $50 million and allowed child-care centers to participate.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nSince the Act passed, Congress has modified several aspects of the policy. Congress amended the NSLP in 1962 to adjust fund distribution. They decided that the budget allocated to each state should be influenced by the state's need for further assistance. Rather than just factoring in the number of participants, Congress took into account the state poverty level compared to the national poverty level. Then, in 1968, Congress improved the NSLP food options to accommodate students with special dietary needs.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nMost recently, in 2012, First Lady Michelle Obama took on the issue of school lunches. Changes that she initiated primarily focused on more specific nutritional requirements. The changes include updated food group nutrition standards, such as vegetable subgroups, re-adjusted meat and grain serving sizes to reflect different school grade ranges, an implemented requirement for whole grains, and milk-fat restrictions. Lower calorie ranges and a 10-year progressive sodium reduction plan also started in 2012.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nAny school is eligible to receive NSLP for its students; meals come from a number of different sources, they can come from on-site production, vended meal from a NSLP caterer or in most schools provided by the local school board centralized kitchen.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is usually regulated by each state's Department of Education's nutrition services. Regardless of who provides the food (on-site production, catered-vended, or school board kitchen), the raw materials come from USDA as donated commodities; in the case of vended meals, the caterer must use and credit the school for the commodities received.\\r\\n\\r\\nDriven to increase the quality of food in the NSLP, the USDA Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) undertook an ambitious agenda to provide schools with a consistent supply of safe, low-fat ground beef. Beginning in 2002, AMS established a statistically based vendor certification and supply chain quality management program for the purchase of ground beef and pork for NSLP under the Technical Requirements Schedule (GB?2006, the current version). The program has enjoyed considerable success in reducing pathogen levels and controlling fat content in lean beef and pork that is provided to school children.\\r\\n\\r\\nUnder the program, Meat Grading and Certification (MGC) Branch agents enforce continuous auditing and in-plant monitoring as long as the contractor is in the program. Microbial and fat SPC charts and graphs for microbial levels and fat content are monitored for process assessment purposes on a daily basis.[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nNutrition standards for the National School Lunch Program and National School Breakfast program were updated in 2012.[citation needed] This update in nutritional standards was funded through a federal statute signed into law by President Barack Obama. The bill called the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010 funds free lunch programs in public schools for the next five years. [11] The new guidelines require students to choose either a serving of fruit or vegetables every meal. Also, the portions must now be larger. [12]\\r\\n\\r\\nAlong with larger portions of fruits and vegetables, the National School Lunch Program now enforces a variety of other nutritional requirements. Food products and ingredients used to prepare school meals must contain zero grams of added trans fat per serving (less than 0.5 grams per serving as defined by FDA). Furthermore, a meal can provide no more than 30 percent of calories from fat and less than 10 percent from saturated fat.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn late 2009, the Institute of Medicine of the National Academies released School Meals: Building Blocks For Healthy Children.[13] This report reviews and provides recommendations to update the nutrition standard and the meal requirements for the National School Lunch Program and School Breakfast Program. School Meals also sets standards for menu planning that focus on food groups, calories, saturated fat, and sodium, and that incorporate Dietary Guidelines for Americans and the Dietary Reference Intakes.\\r\\n\\r\\nNutrition plays a critical role in cognitive development and academic performance for children; undernourished children are more likely to be less energetic and less able to concentrate.[14] The day-to-day observation of teachers and administrators of the relationship between inadequate nutrition and behavior and ability to learn is substantiated by scientific studies. Twenty Cape Town, South Africa, children were studied for 11 years, beginning in 1955.-The study was based on the hypothesis \\"that the ill effects of under-nutrition are determined by (1) its occurrence during the period of maximum growth and (2) the duration of under-nutrition relative to the total period of growth. . . Evidence is cumulative and impressive that severe under-nutrition during the first 2 years of life, when brain growth is most active, results in a permanent reduction of brain size and restricted intellectual development.\\" [15] Some basic micronutrients are necessary for children to maintain a good status of learning, such as iron and vitamin B-12.[16] Iron deficiency puts a child at risk of cognitive delay and lower math scores.[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn December 2009, a report was released that showed that fast food restaurants were far more rigorous in checking for bacteria and dangerous pathogens in beef and chicken than the school lunch program. \\"We simply are not giving our kids in schools the same level of quality and safety as you get when you go to many fast-food restaurants,\\" said J.?Glenn Morris, director of the Emerging Pathogens Institute at the University of Florida. \\"We are not using those same standards.\\"[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn November 2011, an agriculture appropriations bill passed by Congress garnered controversy for blocking a proposed change by the Obama administration to school lunch regulations, whereby 1/8 cup of tomato paste would no longer have been considered as having the nutritional equivalent of 1/2 a cup of vegetables, but instead only as having the nutritional equivalent of 1/8 cup of vegetables (i.e.,?schools can only credit a volume of vegetables as equivalent to its actual size). Critics of this move by Congress claim that pressure was placed upon officials voting on the bill by lobbyists representing pizza manufacturers and cheese producers, as it was seen to threaten the ability of schools to serve pizza and credit it with the same level of nutritional value as they heretofore had.[citation needed] Many critics have sardonically summarized the situation as \\"Pizza is now a vegetable\\" or \\"Congress decides pizza is a vegetable\\".[citation needed] However, others have pointed out that 1/8 cup of tomato paste stacks up remarkably well against a 1/2 cup of vegetables nutritionally, albeit with an excessive amount of sodium that could be argued to reduce its nutritional value.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1967ÿ68, the national enrollment in public and private schools was approximately 50.7 million, according to a survey of School Food Services in March 1968. About 36.8 million children, or 73 percent, were enrolled in schools participating in the National School Lunch Program with an actual average participation in the program of 18.9 million children, or about 37 percent of the national enrollment.[18]\\r\\n\\r\\nReasons for non-participation in the program were numerous but, in low-income areas and large urban centers, low participation was particularly evident. Many of the school buildings in these areas, as well as the small schools in rural areas, were built many years before there were plans for operating a school lunch program, and the buildings did not lend themselves to remodeling for that purpose - neither were local funds available for it. Many of the elementary school buildings in urban centers were built with the idea that the children could and should go home for lunch (\\"neighborhood schools\\") and lunchroom facilities were not available. Many of these conditions hold true today.[18]\\r\\n\\r\\nSome school authorities hold to the idea that a school lunch program must be self-supporting, and others feel that the school has no responsibility in this area. According to a junior high school principal, \\"We think this is the responsibility of parents and child. We do not check them to see if a student eats. As a whole, we are doing it as a service rather than a need.\\"[19]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe net result is that the children in the neediest areas must go without an adequate noonday meal at school, or perhaps an inadequate evening meal at home, or none at all. Many high school students prefer to bring a bag lunch from home or eat snacks and beverages at a nearby stand or from a vending machine in the school. In some instances the portions served to high school students are not adjusted to meet their needs and they seek other sources of service where their tastes and appetites can be satisfied.[18]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe predominate reason, however, appears to be inadequate funding at federal, state and local levels, with the end result that the children who cannot afford to pay are the losers.[18]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn December 2014, Indian Country Today reported that 68 percent of Native American and Alaska Native students \\"are eligible for free and reduced-price school lunches, compared with 28 percent of white students. USDA data indicate that 70 percent of children receiving free lunches through the NSLP are children of color, as are 50 percent of students receiving reduced-price lunches.\\"[20] The article expressed concern regarding efforts to undercut nutrition standards, and notes that several Native American schools are working to improve the quality of school lunches by using produce from school gardens, or tribally grown buffalo meat.[20]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe current challenges of the NSLP can be broken down into three major categories: caloric and nutritional needs, food waste, and rising costs.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor some time, the measurement from which the NSLP based its cash-reimbursements and meal provisions largely came from caloric requirements. However, while this worked in a time where malnutrition plagued the nation's poverty, the modern focus on caloric intake usurps the nation's stance on the growing obesity epidemic. Balancing nutrition and calories has always been a challenge for the NSLP and its participating schools. This struggle can undermine schools that wish to comply with the national standards while still advocating healthy lifestyles.[21]\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother problem that contributes to this challenge is that nutritious food is often considered less favorable than competitive food that is available to students. Given the choice, students will often prefer competitive foods that are not required to meet federal minimum nutrition standards.[22]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the US, the term competitive foods refers to any food source that competes with a lunch program's offerings.  Such competitive foods include fast food offerings, a la carte food lines, and vending machines.[23] A study was done in the 2009-2010 school year across 47 states and 622 districts to examine how much of districts' competitive food and drink policy complied with Dietary Guidelines for Americans (DGA) recommendations.[23] One of the major reasons for this study to be done is the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act which requires schools to establish a science-based nutrition standards for competitive foods called a wellness plan. These new provisions for competitive food and drinks included limits on specific nutrients in the food, such as sodium and fats.[23] Unfortunately, less than 5% of districts met or exceeded DGA requirements.[23] Only about 4% of districts across the nation required fruits and vegetables to be sold within the competitive foods which in no way helps the fruit and vegetable intake of students that is already sub-par.[23][24][25][26]\\r\\n\\r\\nChildren throw away much of the nutritious food that they are served. In a study of the Boston Public Schools, \\"on average, students discarded roughly 19 percent of their entres, 47 percent of their fruit, 25 percent of their milk, and 73 percent of their vegetables.\\" \\"It was estimated that $432,349.05 worth of food is wasted annually at lunch by students in Grades 6ÿ8 in [Boston Public Schools].\\" Overall, this sum makes up 26.1 percent of these three schools' food budgets, excluding labor and supplies. If translated nationally, Cohen estimates that roughly $1,238,846,400 in food is wasted on an annual basis. \\r\\n[27]\\r\\n\\r\\nOne reason that students discard this amount of food has to do with  la carte lines and vending machines. In a 1998 study of 16 randomly selected schools in St. Paul, Minnesota, the authors discovered a negative correlation between  la carte lines, vending machine use, and fruit and vegetable consumption. On average, students from schools without an  la carte line consumed nearly an entire serving more of fruit and vegetables than did students with such programs. Furthermore, students from all schools exceeded the daily USDA recommended calories from saturated fat, and students from schools with  la carte lines exceeded the recommendations by 1 percent more, on average. Concerning snack vending machines, the authors determined that with each vending machine present, \\"students' mean intake of fruit servings decreased by 11 percent.\\" Beverage machines showed no significant impact.[28]\\r\\n\\r\\nA challenge for schools that take part in the NSLP is rising costs of producing lunch. According to the School Lunch and Breakfast Cost Study (SLBCS), one in four school districts reported costs for school lunches above the program reimbursement rate.\\r\\nThe additional cost must then be supplemented by school district general funds, and this puts a strain on school district budgets. Additional costs also make it difficult to meet federally mandated nutrition requirements because using the best palatable foods for students becomes too expensive.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to the 2008 USDA report on the NSLP, \\"other sources of increasing costs include increases in health care costs for employees and, more recently, rising food costs.\\"[22] For example, in 2008, some school systems in Alabama, California, and Texas raised meal prices to keep up with \\"steep increases in food costs.\\" [29] The school districts raised prices for paying students, while keeping prices the same for students that qualified for reduced-price or free lunches. This method of cost adjustment leaves either the school district or paying students to bear the burden of the price increase.\\r\\n\\r\\nNational School Lunch Week takes place on the second Sunday in October.[30] On October 6, 2017, President Donald Trump proclaimed National School Lunch Week.[31][32][33]","input":"When was the national school lunch program established?"},{"output":"Twelve","context":"Future Diary (Japanese: ?^?, Hepburn: Mirai Nikki) is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Sakae Esuno.

The season consists of six episodes and concluded airing on February 22, 2016. When Fox initially announced the string of episodes, the network referred to them collectively as an \\"event series\\".[1] After the episodes' release, Fox began referring to the string of episodes on their website as \\"season 10\\",[2] as did streaming sites like Amazon.com and Hulu,[3][4] and myriad critics.[5]\\r\\nThe season, which takes place fourteen years after the ninth season (2001ÿ02) and seven years after the film The X-Files: I Want to Believe (2008), follows newly re-instated Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) as they learn more about the existence of extraterrestrials and their relationship with the government.\\r\\nEver since The X-Files: I Want to Believe debuted in theaters, there was talk of a third X-Files movie to wrap-up the series' remaining storylines. However, for years these talks never resulted in action until on March 24, 2015, Fox announced that the series would return as a short-format event series with six episodes. After the season aired, it received largely mixed reviews from critics. The second, third, and fourth episodes were met with mostly positive comments, with \\"Mulder and Scully Meet the Were-Monster\\" receiving overwhelmingly positive comments. Conversely, the first, fifth, and sixth episodes were largely derided by critics. The mythology episodes, in particular, were poorly received.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFourteen years after the closure of the X-Files, Mulder is contacted by Scully at the behest of FBI Assistant Director Walter Skinner, who wants him to meet a right-wing online webcaster named Tad O'Malley. Mulder and Scully reunite in Washington, D.C., where they are picked up by O'Malley in his limousine. They meet a young woman named Sveta, who claims to have fragmented memories of having her fetuses stolen from her during alien abductions and to possess alien DNA. O'Malley takes Mulder to a secret location where a triangular aircraft built from alien technology is being housed. Mulder now believes that Colonization and the alien invasion were all an elaborate hoax to distract. Instead, Mulder thinks it was a \\"conspiracy of men\\" who have used extraterrestrial technology on human parties for decades, and these events were subsequently made to look like alien abductions. Before O'Malley can go public with his claims, his website is shut down, the \\"ARV\\" craft and its scientists are destroyed by heavily armed men dressed in military uniforms, and a UFO intercepts Sveta while she is driving, destroying her car. Scully reveals that Sveta's re-tested DNA sample confirms that she does in fact possess extraterrestrial DNA; a test Scully has performed on herself has revealed that she does as well. Mulder states that Sveta is the key to exposing the conspiracy and those responsible. They then receive an urgent summons from Skinner requesting them to meet him. The Cigarette Smoking Man,now alive in the present day, receives word via telephone that the X-Files have been re-opened.[6]\\r\\nSix weeks after the events of \\"My Struggle\\", Scully arrives at FBI headquarters to find that Mulder has disappeared after watching an excerpt from Tad O'Malley's online news broadcast. As Scully informs Skinner and Einstein of Mulder's absence, Mulder attempts to leave Washingtonvisibly unwell and badly bruised. O'Malley explains to Scully that he suspects that alien DNA has been injected into every American citizen in order to facilitate the widespread outbreak of the Spartan Virus. Designed to strip humans of their immune systems, this contagion quickly manifests itself nationwide, with Scully and Einstein noting a sharp increase in the number of patients admitted to hospitals and triage centers. Miller finds a phone-tracking app on Mulder's computer, notes his position in Spartanburg, South Carolina. Scully receives a phone-call from former X-Files agent Monica Reyes (Annabeth Gish), to meet with her. Reyes reveals that Cigarette Smoking Man offered to secure both Scully and Reyes a place among the designated survivors of the end-times. Scully and Einstein attempt to develop a vaccine using Scully's DNA. Scully realizes that she is being protected from the contagion by a combination of the alien genomes that remained after she was abducted and experimented on, and the DNA anomalies instilled within her at the request of Reyes. Mulder approaches Cigarette Smoking Man, who offers him a chance to survive the outbreak. Mulder declines, and is found by Miller, who returns him to Washington with the hope of finding a cure. Scully travels to Mulder and Miller's location, finding them at the 14th Street Bridge. Miller asks how Mulder will survive, Scully replies that William, their son, will have to be the donor of a stem cell transplant. Mulder begins to succumb to the virus. Suddenly, a beam of light shines down onto Miller, Scully, and Mulder, and a triangle-shaped UFO slowly descends and hovers above them.

Following the series' seventh season, however, Duchovny scaled back his involvement substantially, appearing in only half of the eighth season's episodes, and only starring in two of season nine's.[15][16] Likewise, during the ninth season, both Anderson and Carter had signed on at the last minute, with their contract extensions only lasting until the end of 2002, and Anderson specifically stated that she would leave the show following the conclusion of the season.[17][18][19] During these final two seasons, FBI agents John Doggett (Robert Patrick) and Monica Reyes (Annabeth Gish) became the series' new leads.[20][21] Executive producer Frank Spotnitz speculated that the show could extend into a tenth and possibly eleventh season, if the show was able to attract an audience.[17] However, the show lost viewers and was eventually cancelled by Fox.[22]\\r\\nIn 2008, both Duchovny and Anderson reprised their roles as Mulder and Scully in the film The X-Files: I Want to Believe. In several interviews around the release, series creator Chris Carter said that if The X-Files: I Want to Believe proved successful at the box office, a third installment would be made going back to the TV series' mythology, focusing specifically on the alien invasion and colonization of Earth foretold in the series finale, due to occur on December 22, 2012.[23][24] In an October 2009 interview, Duchovny said he would want to do a 2012 X-Files film, but did not know if he would get the chance.[25][26] Anderson stated in August 2012 that a third X-Files film was \\"looking pretty good\\".[27] At the New York Comic Con held October 10ÿ13, 2013, Duchovny and Anderson reaffirmed that they and Carter are interested in making a third film, with Anderson saying \\"If it takes fan encouragement to get Fox interested in that, then I guess that's what it would be.\\"[28] On January 17, 2015, Fox Television Group chairman and CEO Gary Newman revealed that there was network interest in reviving The X-Files, not as a film franchise, but as a six-episode limited run.[29]\\r\\nThe season had a two-night premiere on Fox, debuting on Sunday, January 24, 2016, with the following episode airing on Monday at 8:00 pm, the timeslot in which the remaining episodes also aired.[30] The premiere episode was screened at New York Comic Con on October 10, 2015.[31]\\r\\nInternationally, the season premiered in Canada on CTV on January 24, 2016, simultaneous with the American broadcast.[32] It premiered in Ireland on RT2 on January 26, 2016, two days after its U.S. premiere.[33] It premiered in Australia on Network Ten on January 31, 2016.[34] It premiered in the United Kingdom on Channel 5 on February 8, 2016, where it became the highest-rated drama in the channel's history.[35]\\r\\nFox International Channels, where available, premiered the series the day after the American premiere.[36][37]\\r\\nOnce Newman revealed thoughts of bringing back the series, he noted that the revival would include \\"all key players\\": Carter, Duchovny, and Anderson.[38] Fox TV Group chairman Dana Walden later noted that finding the ideal time that the three key members of the series were free would pose a challenge.[39] At the time of the announcement, Duchovny was working on the NBC series Aquarius, and Anderson was involved in the BBC drama The Fall.[40] However, both co-stars expressed their desire to return to the series: prior to Newman's announcement, Anderson said that she would be \\"fucking overjoyed\\" if Fox brought back The X-Files, and Duchovny said that he would be \\"more than happy\\" to reprise his role as Mulder.[41][42] In a later interview with GQ magazine, Anderson revealed that, when asked about returning for a television continuation of the program, she was hesitant, since she assumed the network would want to order over twenty new episodes (the length of a season when the show had originally aired). When it was revealed that the network would only order a short run, she enthusiastically agreed to reprise her role.[43] Initially, Anderson was offered half the pay of Duchovny, but she negotiated her contract so that both leads received the same amount.[44]\\r\\nEarly on, it was reported that an offer went out for Mitch Pileggi, who played Walter Skinner, to reprise his role, and that \\"other key cast members will also return.\\"[45] William B. Davis, the actor who portrayed Cigarette Smoking Man, also noted that he was asked about his availability during the summer of 2015, hinting that his character would return in some form.[46] Later, Duchovny revealed during his March 31, 2015 appearance on Late Show with David Letterman that both Pileggi and Davis would return for the season.[47] Pileggi confirmed his return in April 2015.[48] In an interview with XFilesNews.com, Carter expressed hope in having Robert Patrick and Annabeth Gish reprise their roles as John Doggett and Monica Reyes, respectively, although their involvement would be contingent upon their current acting commitments.[49] Patrick ruled out a return, but it was confirmed in August 2015 that Gish was returning for at least one episode.[50][51] Laurie Holden did not rule out a return as Marita Covarrubias,[52] but did not appear in any of the episodes. Joel McHale was announced as a guest star in June 2015, playing Tad O'Malley, an Internet news anchor who is an ally of Mulder's.[53] Carter chose to cast McHale after his roast of Barack Obama at the 2014 White House Correspondents' Dinner.[54]\\r\\nChris Carter, on the nature of The X-Files revival.[49]\\r\\nCarter himself was also confirmed to be helming the project, serving as writer and executive producer.[45] Carter later confirmed that Darin Morgan and James Wong would return to the series as writers, and Glen Morgan would return in a \\"productorial position.\\"[49] Wong and Glen Morgan had served as writers for the series during its first, second, and fourth seasons,[55][56][57] and Darin Morgan had provided several scripts for the series during its second and third seasons.[56][58] Following the announcement of the season, it was speculated as to whether long-time Carter collaborator Frank Spotnitz would return to assist with the writing, although this did not come to pass.[45] In addition, former X-Files writer Vince Gilligan noted that he would have enjoyed returning to the series, but his busy work schedule did not allow it; he later said, \\"I'll be watching every episode and rooting them on\\".[59][60]\\r\\nMark Snow also reprised his role as the series' composer.[49] \\"There are some new musical elements I've brought in for certain moments in the episodes,\\" said Snow. \\"It's difficult to describe what is so completely different about them, except that there are some different sounds, different pulsing percussion elements, and different ambient designs, but the basic harmonic structure from the past is fairly intact.\\"[61]\\r\\nPrior to filming, Carter explained that he had \\"ideas for every [character]\\" and that the season would strive to tell fresh stories in a \\"very new political environment\\".[49] He explained that, since the original conclusion of the series back in 2002, he had been collecting noteworthy news stories for future use. Carter also revealed that the seasons' plot has no connection to the Season 10 comic book series, and is composed of both mythology episodes, as well as stand-alone \\"Monster-of-the-Week\\" episodes.[49] It was later confirmed by Carter that the first and sixth episodes would be mythology episodes, and others would be standalones.[8] Carter himself wrote the teleplays and directed the first, fifth, and sixth episodes.[60][62][63][64] The second, \\"Founder's Mutation\\", was written and directed by James Wong; the third, \\"Mulder and Scully Meet the Were-Monster\\", was written and directed by Darin Morgan; and the fourth episode, titled \\"Home Again\\", was written and directed by Glen Morgan.[65][66][67] Scientist and biology professor Anne Simon, who first consulted on the series' first-season finale episode \\"The Erlenmeyer Flask\\", and for the rest of the original series run, returned as a biology science advisor.[68] She later received writing credit for her contributions to the finale.[64] A seventh episode, based on a spec script, was written; however, it was not produced due to scheduling conflicts. According to Carter, if Fox orders more episodes, this unfilmed episode will be made.[69]\\r\\nIn March 2015, it was claimed by several sources that the network would order a short-run season of fewer than ten episodes, with an initial guess of six. The decision to cut the order down to only a few installments was reportedly done so that the network could work around the busy schedules of Duchovny and Anderson; Duchovny himself said he had no interest in doing a full season because: \\"We're all old, we don't have the energy for a full season.\\"[42][45][70] The article also claimed that, if all went as planned, the season would begin filming in the summer of 2015.[45][71] It was also confirmed by both Davis and Carter that the series would return to Vancouver for filming.[46][49] Filming began on June 8 and finished on September 3.[60][72][73][74]\\r\\nCritical reception to this season has been mixed. The first and last episodes were met with lukewarm to negative reviews from critics, whereas episodes two through five were generally well received.[75] Overall, the review aggregator Metacritic gave it a score of 60 out of 100 based on 35 reviews, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews.\\"[76] Likewise, Rotten Tomatoes gave the revival a 64% approval rating with an average score of 6.57 out of 10 based on 50 reviews. The site's consensus reads, \\"Gillian Anderson and David Duchovny's chemistry remains intact, but overall, The X-Files revival lacks the creative spark necessary to sustain the initial rush of nostalgia.\\"[75]\\r\\n\\"My Struggle\\" debuted to a select crowd at the 2015 New York Comic-Con, and critical reception was mostly positive. Sadie Gennis of TV Guide wrote, \\"The episode immediately establishes that this is not a reboot nor a mere cash grab, but a thoughtful continuation of the beloved franchise.\\"[77] Chris Eggerstein of HitFix wrote that the tone of the revival was very reminiscent of the show's original run, and that \\"if you were a fan of the old X-Files, you're probably going to like the new X-Files just fine.\\"[78] Jane Mulkerrins of The Telegraph called the debut \\"fresh\\" and \\"one of the highlights\\" of the convention. Furthermore, she noted that the premiere was popular with fans, who greeted the episode with a standing ovation.[79]\\r\\nHowever, pre-release reviews of \\"My Struggle\\" released after the New York Comic-Con were more critical, with the consensus of many reviewers being that the first episode was not good.[80] Reviewing the premiere episode, Brian Lowry of Variety panned the revival of the series, \\"It's simply hard to escape the prevailing malaise of this being a deal-driven exercise, a chance to cash in on the name recognition of the title in a format that mitigated the time commitment for all concerned.\\"[81] Similarly, Tim Goodman, writing for The Hollywood Reporter, described the premiere as \\"a very underwhelming hour that will force even diehard fans [...] to consider whether pushing onward is really worth the time.[82] Matt Fowler of IGN awarded it a 7.2 out of 10, denoting a \\"good\\" episode. Fowler wrote positively of Sveta's performance, and he also applauded the focus on the conspiracy as well as the episode's ending. However, he criticized it for having a \\"bored, disinterested tone\\".[83] Alex McCown of The A.V. Club reviewed the first three episodes of the revival and awarded them collectively a \\"B+\\". He largely derided the first episode, writing that \\"it indulges in all of [Chris Carter's] worst [writing] tendencies.\\"[84] He was particularly critical of the episodes's expository monologues. Ultimately, he wrote that \\"the first episode demonstrates some of The X-Files' weaker tendencies, though it possesses a hokey charm, one that comes from pretending as though the past 15 years of television never happened.\\"[84]\\r\\nPre-release reviews of the following two episodes were much more positive. McCown argued that it \\"immediately course corrects\\" with Wong's \\"Founder's Mutation\\"; he called the episode \\"smart\\" and \\"unsettling\\".[84] McCown lauded Morgan's \\"Mulder and Scully Meet the Were-Monster\\", writing that the episode ultimately \\"makes the case for why The X-Files is still worth having around.\\"[84] Brian Tallerico of RogerEbert.com wrote that \\"Founder's Mutation\\" \\"perfectly blends show mythology (including Mulder and Scully's kid) with a modern plot\\" and that \\"Mulder and Scully Meet the Were-Monster\\" is \\"hysterical, smart and so much fun.\\"[85] Darren Franich of Entertainment Weekly reiterated these thoughts, arguing that \\"Founder's Mutation\\" is \\"an improvement over the premiere\\", and that Darin Morgan's episode is \\"a wild, playful, brain-twisting, heart-pulling, and above all adventurous episode of television.\\"[86]\\r\\nBefore the season even began filming, an anonymous network insider revealed that Fox was interested in reviving the series because it would be a ratings success, noting: \\"The network feels that they can draw huge numbers and a PR drive to bring back a show which offers both drama and a built-in cult following.\\"[38] It was speculated that the success of the 24: Live Another Day event series, which aired in 2014, inspired Fox to revive The X-Files.[39]\\r\\n\\"My Struggle\\" debuted on January 24, 2016, and was watched by 16.19 million viewers. It scored a 6.1 Nielsen rating in the 18- to 49-year-old demographic (Nielsen ratings are audience measurement systems that determine the audience size and composition of television programming in the United States), which means that 6.1 percent of all individuals aged 18- to 49-years old were watching at the time of the episode's airing.[9] In terms of viewers, this made \\"My Struggle\\" the highest-rated premiere since the seventh season opener \\"The Sixth Extinction\\" in 1999, which was viewed by 17.82 million people,[88] as well as the most-watched episode of The X-Files to air since the eighth season episode \\"This Is Not Happening\\" in 2001, which was watched by 16.9 million viewers.[89] When DVR and streaming are taken into account, \\"My Struggle\\" was seen by 21.4 million viewers, scoring a 7.1 Nielsen rating.[90] The second episode, \\"Founder's Mutation\\", was viewed by 9.67 million.[10] The success of the first two episodes fueled speculation that Fox might order more episodes.[10][90][91]\\r\\nIn an interview with Entertainment Weekly, Duchovny stated that if the season were successful, he would be interested in another renewal, stating, \\"I would be open to doing another cycle. I don't know that I could do a 20-episode version of this show at this point in my life, and I don't know that Gillian could. But I think everybody is open ended on what happens after this. Certainly, we didn't bring it back with the idea of ending it.\\"[99] At the 2016 Television Critics Association panel for the series, Carter stated, \\"If we do well in the ratings, I can't imagine we wouldn't be asked to do more.\\"[100] Fox Television Group chairman and CEO Gary Newman stated that he and fellow executive Dana Walden would be open to another renewal, stating, \\"We would love to do this again, so we'd be on board if schedules can be worked out.\\"[101] In an interview with Variety prior to the premiere, Anderson, Duchovny, and Walden stated their willingness for another renewal.[102] In an interview with TV Guide, Carter reaffirmed plans for more episodes, but stressed that everyone involved is waiting on the success of the season.[103]\\r\\nOn April 20, 2017, Fox officially announced that The X-Files would be returning for an eleventh season of ten episodes, which would air in the 2017ÿ18 television season after filming in mid-2017.[104]\\r\\nThe season was released on Blu-ray and DVD in region 1 on June 14, 2016.

This includes both manned and unmanned (robotic) missions. The first human-made object to reach the surface of the Moon was the Soviet Union's Luna 2 mission, on 13 September 1959.[3]\\r\\nThe United States' Apollo 11 was the first manned mission to land on the Moon, on 20 July 1969.[4] There have been six manned U.S. landings (between 1969 and 1972) and numerous unmanned landings, with no soft landings happening from 22 August 1976 until 14 December 2013.\\r\\nTo date, the United States is the only country to have successfully conducted manned missions to the Moon, with the last departing the lunar surface in December 1972.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the unsuccessful attempt by the Luna 1 to land on the moon in 1959, the Soviet Union performed the first hard (unpowered) moon landing later that same year with the Luna 2 spacecraft, a feat the U.S. duplicated in 1962 with Ranger 4. Since then, twelve Soviet and U.S. spacecraft have used braking rockets to make soft landings and perform scientific operations on the lunar surface, between 1966 and 1976. In 1966 the USSR accomplished the first soft landings and took the first pictures from the lunar surface during the Luna 9 and Luna 13 missions. The U.S. followed with five unmanned Surveyor soft landings.\\r\\nThe Soviet Union achieved the first unmanned lunar soil sample return with the Luna 16 probe on 24 September 1970. This was followed by Luna 20 and Luna 24 in 1972 and 1976, respectively. Following the failure at launch in 1969 of the first Lunokhod, Luna E-8 No.201, the Luna 17 and Luna 21 were successful unmanned lunar rover missions in 1970 and 1973.\\r\\nMany missions were failures at launch. In addition, several unmanned landing missions achieved the Lunar surface but were unsuccessful, including: Luna 15, Luna 18, and Luna 23 all crashed on landing; and the U.S. Surveyor 4 lost all radio contact only moments before its landing.\\r\\nMore recently, other nations have crashed spacecraft on the surface of the Moon at speeds of around 8,000 kilometres per hour (5,000?mph), often at precise, planned locations. These have generally been end-of-life lunar orbiters that, because of system degradations, could no longer overcome perturbations from lunar mass concentrations (\\"masscons\\") to maintain their orbit. Japan's lunar orbiter Hiten impacted the Moon's surface on 10 April 1993. The European Space Agency performed a controlled crash impact with their orbiter SMART-1 on 3 September 2006.\\r\\nIndian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) performed a controlled crash impact with its Moon Impact Probe (MIP) on 14 November 2008. The MIP was an ejected probe from the Indian Chandrayaan-1 lunar orbiter and performed remote sensing experiments during its descent to the lunar surface.\\r\\nThe Chinese lunar orbiter Chang'e 1 executed a controlled crash onto the surface of the Moon on 1 March 2009. The rover mission Chang'e 3 was launched on 1 December 2013 and soft-landed on 14 December.\\r\\nA total of twelve men have landed on the Moon. This was accomplished with two US pilot-astronauts flying a Lunar Module on each of six NASA missions across a 41-month period starting on 20 July 1969 UTC, with Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin on Apollo 11, and ending on 14 December 1972 UTC with Gene Cernan and Jack Schmitt on Apollo 17. Cernan was the last to step off the lunar surface.\\r\\nAll Apollo lunar missions had a third crew member who remained on board the Command Module. The last three missions had a rover for increased mobility.\\r\\nIn order to go to the Moon, a spacecraft must first leave the gravity well of the Earth. The only practical way of accomplishing this currently is with a rocket. Unlike other airborne vehicles such as balloons or jets, a rocket is the only known form of propulsion which can continue to increase its speed at high altitudes in the vacuum outside the Earth's atmosphere.\\r\\nUpon approach of the target moon, a spacecraft will be drawn ever closer to its surface at increasing speeds due to gravity. In order to land intact it must decelerate to less than about 160 kilometres per hour (99?mph) and be ruggedized to withstand a \\"hard landing\\" impact, or it must decelerate to negligible speed at contact for a \\"soft landing\\" (which is the only viable option with human occupants). The first three attempts by the U.S. to perform a successful hard moon landing with a ruggedized seismometer package in 1962 all failed.[5] The Soviets first achieved the milestone of a hard lunar landing with a ruggedized camera in 1966, followed only months later by the first unmanned soft lunar landing by the U.S.\\r\\nThe speed of a crash landing on its surface is typically between 70 and 100% of the escape velocity of the target moon, and thus this is the total velocity which must be shed from the target moon's gravitational attraction for a soft landing to occur. For Earth's Moon, the escape velocity is 2.38 kilometres per second (1.48?mi/s).[6] The change in velocity (referred to as a delta-v) is usually provided by a landing rocket, which must be carried into space by the original launch vehicle as part of the overall spacecraft. An exception is the soft moon landing on Titan carried out by the Huygens probe in 2005. As the moon with the thickest atmosphere, landings on Titan may be accomplished by using atmospheric entry techniques that are generally lighter in weight than a rocket with equivalent capability.\\r\\nThe Soviets succeeded in making the first crash landing on the Moon in 1959.[7] Crash landings[8] may occur because of malfunctions in a spacecraft, or they can be deliberately arranged for vehicles which do not have an onboard landing rocket. There have been many such moon crashes, often with their flight path controlled to impact at precise locations on the lunar surface. For example, during the Apollo program the S-IVB third stage of the Saturn V moon rocket as well as the spent ascent stage of the lunar module were deliberately crashed on the Moon several times to provide impacts registering as a moonquake on seismometers that had been left on the lunar surface. Such crashes were instrumental in mapping the internal structure of the Moon.\\r\\nTo return to Earth, the escape velocity of the Moon must be overcome for the spacecraft to escape the gravity well of the Moon. Rockets must be used to leave the Moon and return to space. Upon reaching Earth, atmospheric entry techniques are used to absorb the kinetic energy of a returning spacecraft and reduce its speed for safe landing.[citation needed] These functions greatly complicate a moon landing mission and lead to many additional operational considerations. Any moon departure rocket must first be carried to the Moon's surface by a moon landing rocket, increasing the latter's required size. The Moon departure rocket, larger moon landing rocket and any Earth atmosphere entry equipment such as heat shields and parachutes must in turn be lifted by the original launch vehicle, greatly increasing its size by a significant and almost prohibitive degree.\\r\\nThe intense efforts devoted in the 1960s to achieving first an unmanned and then ultimately a manned moon landing become easier to understand in the political context of its historical era. World War II had introduced many new and deadly innovations including blitzkrieg-style surprise attacks used in the invasion of Poland and in the attack on Pearl Harbor; the V-2 rocket, a ballistic missile which killed thousands in attacks on London and Antwerp; and the atom bomb, which killed hundreds of thousands in the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. In the 1950s, tensions mounted between the two ideologically opposed superpowers of the United States and the Soviet Union that had emerged as victors in the conflict, particularly after the development by both countries of the hydrogen bomb.\\r\\nWilly Ley wrote in 1957 that a rocket to the Moon \\"could be built later this year if somebody can be found to sign some papers\\".[9] On 4 October 1957, the Soviet Union launched Sputnik 1 as the first artificial satellite to orbit the Earth and so initiated the Space Race. This unexpected event was a source of pride to the Soviets and shock to the U.S., who could now potentially be surprise attacked by nuclear-tipped Soviet rockets in under 30 minutes.[citation needed] Also, the steady beeping of the radio beacon aboard Sputnik 1 as it passed overhead every 96 minutes was widely viewed on both sides[citation needed] as effective propaganda to Third World countries demonstrating the technological superiority of the Soviet political system compared to that of the U.S. This perception was reinforced by a string of subsequent rapid-fire Soviet space achievements. In 1959, the R-7 rocket was used to launch the first escape from Earth's gravity into a solar orbit, the first crash impact onto the surface of the Moon and the first photography of the never-before-seen far side of the Moon. These were the Luna 1, Luna 2 and Luna 3 spacecraft.\\r\\nThe U.S. response to these Soviet achievements was to greatly accelerate previously existing military space and missile projects and to create a civilian space agency, NASA. Military efforts were initiated to develop and produce mass quantities of intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) that would bridge the so-called missile gap and enable a policy of deterrence to nuclear war with the Soviets known as mutual assured destruction or MAD. These newly developed missiles were made available to civilians of NASA for various projects (which would have the added benefit of demonstrating the payload, guidance accuracy and reliabilities of U.S. ICBMs to the Soviets).\\r\\nWhile NASA stressed peaceful and scientific uses for these rockets, their use in various lunar exploration efforts also had secondary goal of realistic, goal-oriented testing of the missiles themselves and development of associated infrastructure,[citation needed] just as the Soviets were doing with their R-7.\\r\\nAfter the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991, historical records were released to allow the true accounting of Soviet lunar efforts. Unlike the U.S. tradition of assigning a particular mission name in advance of a launch, the Soviets assigned a public \\"Luna\\" mission number only if a launch resulted in a spacecraft going beyond Earth orbit. The policy had the effect of hiding Soviet Moon mission failures from public view. If the attempt failed in Earth orbit before departing for the Moon, it was frequently (but not always) given a \\"Sputnik\\" or \\"Cosmos\\" Earth-orbit mission number to hide its purpose. Launch explosions were not acknowledged at all.\\r\\nIn contrast to Soviet lunar exploration triumphs in 1959, success eluded initial U.S. efforts to reach the Moon with the Pioneer and Ranger programs. Fifteen consecutive U.S. unmanned lunar missions over a six-year period from 1958 to 1964 all failed their primary photographic missions;[10][11] however, Rangers 4 and 6 successfully repeated the Soviet lunar impacts as part of their secondary missions.[12][13]\\r\\nFailures included three U.S. attempts[5][12][14] in 1962 to hard land small seismometer packages released by the main Ranger spacecraft. These surface packages were to use retrorockets to survive landing, unlike the parent vehicle, which was designed to deliberately crash onto the surface. The final three Ranger probes performed successful high altitude lunar reconnaissance photography missions during intentional crash impacts between 2.62 and 2.68 kilometres per second (9,400 and 9,600?km/h).[15][16][17]\\r\\nThree different designs of Pioneer lunar probes were flown on three different modified ICBMs. Those flown on the Thor booster modified with an Able upper stage carried an infrared image scanning television system with a resolution of 1 milliradian to study the Moon's surface, an ionization chamber to measure radiation in space, a diaphragm/microphone assembly to detect micrometeorites, a magnetometer, and temperature-variable resistors to monitor spacecraft internal thermal conditions. The first, a mission managed by the United States Air Force, exploded during launch; all subsequent Pioneer lunar flights had NASA as the lead management organization. The next two returned to Earth and burned up upon reentry into the atmosphere after achieved maximum altitudes of around 110,000 kilometres (68,000?mi) and 1,450 kilometres (900?mi), far short of the roughly 400,000 kilometres (250,000?mi) required to reach the vicinity of the Moon.\\r\\nNASA then collaborated with the United States Army's Ballistic Missile Agency to fly two extremely small cone-shaped probes on the Juno ICBM, carrying only photocells which would be triggered by the light of the Moon and a lunar radiation environment experiment using a Geiger-Mller tube detector. The first of these reached an altitude of only around 100,000 kilometres (62,000?mi), serendipitously gathering data that established the presence of the Van Allen radiation belts before reentering Earth's atmosphere. The second passed by the Moon at a distance of more than 60,000 kilometres (37,000?mi), twice as far as planned and too far away to trigger either of the on-board scientific instruments, yet still becoming the first U.S. spacecraft to reach a solar orbit.\\r\\nThe final Pioneer lunar probe design consisted of four \\"paddlewheel\\" solar panels extending from a one-meter diameter spherical spin-stabilized spacecraft body that was equipped to take images of the lunar surface with a television-like system, estimate the Moon's mass and topography of the poles, record the distribution and velocity of micrometeorites, study radiation, measure magnetic fields, detect low frequency electromagnetic waves in space and use a sophisticated integrated propulsion system for maneuvering and orbit insertion as well. None of the four spacecraft built in this series of probes survived launch on its Atlas ICBM outfitted with an Able upper stage.\\r\\nFollowing the unsuccessful Atlas-Able Pioneer probes, NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory embarked upon an unmanned spacecraft development program whose modular design could be used to support both lunar and interplanetary exploration missions. The interplanetary versions were known as Mariners; lunar versions were Rangers. JPL envisioned three versions of the Ranger lunar probes: Block I prototypes, which would carry various radiation detectors in test flights to a very high Earth orbit that came nowhere near the Moon; Block II, which would try to accomplish the first Moon landing by hard landing a seismometer package; and Block III, which would crash onto the lunar surface without any braking rockets while taking very high resolution wide-area photographs of the Moon during their descent.\\r\\nThe Ranger 1 and 2 Block I missions were virtually identical.[18][19] Spacecraft experiments included a Lyman-alpha telescope, a rubidium-vapor magnetometer, electrostatic analyzers, medium-energy-range particle detectors, two triple coincidence telescopes, a cosmic-ray integrating ionization chamber, cosmic dust detectors, and scintillation counters. The goal was to place these Block I spacecraft in a very high Earth orbit with an apogee of 110,000 kilometres (68,000?mi) and a perigee of 60,000 kilometres (37,000?mi).[18]\\r\\nFrom that vantage point, scientists could make direct measurements of the magnetosphere over a period of many months while engineers perfected new methods to routinely track and communicate with spacecraft over such large distances. Such practice was deemed vital to be assured of capturing high-bandwidth television transmissions from the Moon during a one-shot fifteen-minute time window in subsequent Block II and Block III lunar descents. Both Block I missions suffered failures of the new Agena upper stage and never left low Earth parking orbit after launch; both burned up upon reentry after only a few days.\\r\\nThe first attempts to perform a Moon landing took place in 1962 during the Rangers 3, 4 and 5 missions flown by the United States.[5][12][14] All three Block II missions basic vehicles were 3.1?m high and consisted of a lunar capsule covered with a balsa wood impact-limiter, 650?mm in diameter, a mono-propellant mid-course motor, a retrorocket with a thrust of 5,050 pounds-force (22.5?kN),[12] and a gold- and chrome-plated hexagonal base 1.5?m in diameter. This lander (code-named Tonto) was designed to provide impact cushioning using an exterior blanket of crushable balsa wood and an interior filled with incompressible liquid freon. A 42?kg (56 pounds) 30-centimetre-diameter (0.98?ft) metal payload sphere floated and was free to rotate in a liquid freon reservoir contained in the landing sphere[citation needed].\\r\\nThis payload sphere contained six silver-cadmium batteries to power a fifty-milliwatt radio transmitter, a temperature sensitive voltage controlled oscillator to measure lunar surface temperatures, and a seismometer that was designed with sensitivity high enough to detect the impact of a 5?lb (2.3?kg) meteorite on the opposite side of the Moon. Weight was distributed in the payload sphere so it would rotate in its liquid blanket to place the seismometer into an upright and operational position no matter what the final resting orientation of the external landing sphere. After landing, plugs were to be opened allowing the freon to evaporate and the payload sphere to settle into upright contact with the landing sphere. The batteries were sized to allow up to three months of operation for the payload sphere. Various mission constraints limited the landing site to Oceanus Procellarum on the lunar equator, which the lander ideally would reach 66 hours after launch.\\r\\nNo cameras were carried by the Ranger landers, and no pictures were to be captured from the lunar surface during the mission. Instead, the 3.1 metres (10?ft) Ranger Block II mother ship carried a 200-scan-line television camera which was to capture images during the free-fall descent to the lunar surface. The camera was designed to transmit a picture every 10 seconds.[12] Seconds before impact, at 5 and 0.6 kilometres (3.11 and 0.37?mi) above the lunar surface, the Ranger mother ships took picture (which may be viewed here).\\r\\nOther instruments gathering data before the mother ship crashed onto the Moon were a gamma ray spectrometer to measure overall lunar chemical composition and a radar altimeter. The radar altimeter was to give a signal ejecting the landing capsule and its solid-fueled braking rocket overboard from the Block II mother ship. The braking rocket was to slow and the landing sphere to a dead stop at 330 metres (1,080?ft) above the surface and separate, allowing the landing sphere to free fall once more and hit the surface[citation needed].\\r\\nOn Ranger 3, failure of the Atlas guidance system and a software error aboard the Agena upper stage combined to put the spacecraft on a course that would miss the Moon. Attempts to salvage lunar photography during a flyby of the Moon were thwarted by in-flight failure of the onboard flight computer. This was probably because of prior heat sterilization of the spacecraft by keeping it above the boiling point of water for 24 hours on the ground, to protect the Moon from being contaminated by Earth organisms. Heat sterilization was also blamed for subsequent in-flight failures of the spacecraft computer on Ranger 4 and the power subsystem on Ranger 5. Only Ranger 4 reached the Moon in an uncontrolled crash impact on the far side of the Moon.[citation needed]\\r\\nHeat sterilization was discontinued for the final four Block III Ranger probes.[citation needed] These replaced the Block II landing capsule and its retrorocket with a heavier, more capable television system to support landing site selection for upcoming Apollo manned Moon landing missions. Six cameras were designed to take thousands of high-altitude photographs in the final twenty-minute period before crashing on the lunar surface. Camera resolution was 1,132 scan lines, far higher than the 525 lines found in a typical U.S. 1964 home television. While Ranger 6 suffered a failure of this camera system and returned no photographs despite an otherwise successful flight, the subsequent Ranger 7 mission to Mare Cognitum was a complete success.\\r\\nBreaking the six-year string of failures in U.S. attempts to photograph the Moon at close range, the Ranger 7 mission was viewed as a national turning point and instrumental in allowing the key 1965 NASA budget appropriation to pass through the United States Congress intact without a reduction in funds for the Apollo manned Moon landing program. Subsequent successes with Ranger 8 and Ranger 9 further buoyed U.S. hopes.\\r\\nThe Luna 9 spacecraft, launched by the Soviet Union, performed the first successful soft Moon landing on 3 February. Airbags protected its 99 kilograms (218?lb) ejectable capsule which survived an impact speed of over 15 metres per second (54?km/h).[20] Luna 13 duplicated this feat with a similar Moon landing on 24 December 1966. Both returned panoramic photographs that were the first views from the lunar surface.[21]\\r\\nLuna 16 was the first robotic probe to land on the Moon and safely return a sample of lunar soil back to Earth.[22] It represented the first lunar sample return mission by the Soviet Union, and was the third lunar sample return mission overall, following the Apollo 11 and Apollo 12 missions. This mission was later successfully repeated by Luna 20 (1972) and Luna 24 (1976).\\r\\nIn 1970 and 1973 two Lunokhod (\\"Moonwalker\\") robotic lunar rovers were delivered to the Moon, where they successfully operated for 10 and 4 months respectively, covering 10.5?km (Lunokhod 1) and 37?km (Lunokhod 2). These rover missions were in operation concurrently with the Zond and Luna series of Moon flyby, orbiter and landing missions.\\r\\nThe U.S. robotic Surveyor program was part of an effort to locate a safe site on the Moon for a human landing and test under lunar conditions the radar and landing systems required to make a true controlled touchdown. Five of Surveyor's seven missions made successful unmanned Moon landings. Surveyor 3 was visited two years after its Moon landing by the crew of Apollo 12. They removed parts of it for examination back on Earth to determine the effects of long-term exposure to the lunar environment.\\r\\nWithin four months of each other in early 1966 the Soviet Union and the United States had accomplished successful Moon landings with unmanned spacecraft. To the general public both countries had demonstrated roughly equal technical capabilities by returning photographic images from the surface of the Moon. These pictures provided a key affirmative answer to the crucial question of whether or not lunar soil would support upcoming manned landers with their much greater weight.\\r\\nHowever, the Luna 9 hard landing of a ruggedized sphere using airbags at a 50 kilometres (31?mi)-per-hour ballistic impact speed had much more in common with the failed 1962 Ranger landing attempts and their planned 160 kilometres (99?mi)-per-hour impacts than with the Surveyor 1 soft landing on three footpads using its radar-controlled, adjustable-thrust retrorocket. While Luna 9 and Surveyor 1 were both major national accomplishments, only Surveyor 1 had reached its landing site employing key technologies that would be needed for a manned flight. Thus as of mid-1966, the United States had begun to pull ahead of the Soviet Union in the so-called Space Race to land a man on the Moon.\\r\\nAdvances in other areas were necessary before manned spacecraft could follow unmanned ones to the surface of the Moon. Of particular importance was developing the expertise to perform flight operations in lunar orbit. Ranger, Surveyor and initial Luna Moon landing attempts all utilized flight paths from Earth that traveled directly to the lunar surface without first placing the spacecraft in a lunar orbit. Such direct ascents use a minimum amount of fuel for unmanned spacecraft on a one-way trip.\\r\\nIn contrast, manned vehicles need additional fuel after a lunar landing to enable a return trip back to Earth for the crew. Leaving this massive amount of required Earth-return fuel in lunar orbit until it is used later in the mission is far more efficient than taking such fuel down to the lunar surface in a Moon landing and then hauling it all back into space yet again, working against lunar gravity both ways. Such considerations lead logically to a lunar orbit rendezvous mission profile for a manned Moon landing.\\r\\nAccordingly, beginning in mid-1966 both the U.S. and U.S.S.R. naturally progressed into missions which featured lunar orbit operations as a necessary prerequisite to a manned Moon landing. The primary goals of these initial unmanned orbiters were extensive photographic mapping of the entire lunar surface for the selection of manned landing sites and, for the Soviets, the checkout of radio communications gear that would be used in future soft landings.\\r\\nAn unexpected major discovery from initial lunar orbiters were vast volumes of dense materials beneath the surface of the Moon's maria. Such mass concentrations (\\"mascons\\") can send a manned mission dangerously off course in the final minutes of a Moon landing when aiming for a relatively small landing zone that is smooth and safe. Mascons were also found over a longer period of time to greatly disturb the orbits of low-altitude satellites around the Moon, making their orbits unstable and forcing an inevitable crash on the lunar surface in the relatively short period of months to a few years.\\r\\nControlling the location of impact for spent lunar orbiters can have scientific value. For example, in 1999 the NASA Lunar Prospector orbiter was deliberately targeted to impact a permanently shadowed area of Shoemaker Crater near the lunar south pole. It was hoped that energy from the impact would vaporize suspected shadowed ice deposits in the crater and liberate a water vapor plume that would be detectable from Earth. No such plume was observed. However, a small vial of ashes from the body of pioneer lunar scientist Eugene Shoemaker was delivered by the Lunar Prospector to the crater named in his honor ÿ currently the only human remains on the Moon.\\r\\nLuna 10 became the first spacecraft to orbit the Moon on 3 April 1966.\\r\\nIt is possible to aim a spacecraft from Earth so that it will loop around the Moon and return to Earth without entering lunar orbit, following the so-called free return trajectory. Such circumlunar loop missions are simpler than lunar orbit missions because rockets for lunar orbit braking and Earth return are not required. However, a manned circumlunar loop trip poses significant challenges above and beyond those found in a manned low-Earth-orbit mission, offering valuable lessons in preparation for a manned Moon landing. Foremost among these are mastering the demands of re-entering the Earth's atmosphere upon returning from the Moon.\\r\\nManned Earth-orbiting vehicles such as the Space Shuttle return to Earth from speeds of around 17,000 miles per hour (27,000?km/h; 7,600?m/s). Due to the effects of gravity, a vehicle returning from the Moon hits Earth's atmosphere at a much higher speed of around 25,000 miles per hour (40,000?km/h; 11,000?m/s). The g-loading on astronauts during the resulting deceleration can be at the limits of human endurance even during a nominal reentry. Slight variations in the vehicle flight path and reentry angle during a return from the Moon can easily result in fatal levels of deceleration force.\\r\\nAchieving a manned circumlunar loop flight prior to a manned lunar landing became a primary goal of the Soviets with their Zond spacecraft program. The first three Zonds were unmanned planetary probes; after that, the Zond name was transferred to a completely separate manned program. The initial focus of these later Zonds was extensive testing of required high-speed reentry techniques. This focus was not shared by the U.S., who chose instead to bypass the stepping stone of a manned circumlunar loop mission and never developed a separate spacecraft for this purpose.\\r\\nInitial manned spaceflights in the early 1960s placed a single person in low Earth orbit during the Soviet Vostok and U.S. Mercury programs. A two-flight extension of the Vostok program known as Voskhod effectively used Vostok capsules with their ejection seats removed to achieve Soviet space firsts of multiple person crews in 1964 and spacewalks in early 1965. These capabilities were later demonstrated by the U.S. in ten Gemini low Earth orbit missions throughout 1965 and 1966, using a totally new second-generation spacecraft design that had little in common with the earlier Mercury. These Gemini missions went on to prove critical techniques for orbital rendezvous and docking that were crucial to a manned lunar landing mission profile.\\r\\nAfter the end of the Gemini program, the Soviets Union began flying their second-generation Zond manned spacecraft in 1967 with the ultimate goal of looping a cosmonaut around the Moon and returning him immediately to Earth. The Zond spacecraft was launched with the simpler and already operational Proton launch rocket, unlike the parallel Soviet manned Moon landing effort also underway at the time based on third-generation Soyuz spacecraft requiring development of the advanced N-1 booster. The Soviets thus believed they could achieve a manned Zond circumlunar flight years before a U.S. manned lunar landing and so score a propaganda victory. However, significant development problems delayed the Zond program and the success of the U.S. Apollo lunar landing program led to the eventual termination of the Zond effort.\\r\\nLike Zond, Apollo Moon flights were generally launched on a free return trajectory that would return them to Earth via a circumlunar loop in the event that a Service Module malfunction failed to place them in lunar orbit as planned. This option was implemented after an explosion aboard the Apollo 13 mission in 1970, which is the only manned circumlunar loop mission flown to date.\\r\\nZond 5 was the first spacecraft to carry life from Earth to the vicinity of the Moon and return, initiating the final lap of the Space Race with its payload of turtles, insects, plants and bacteria. Despite the failure suffered in its final moments, the Zond 6 mission was reported by Soviet media as being a success as well. Although hailed worldwide as remarkable achievements, both of these Zond missions flew off-nominal reentry trajectories resulting in deceleration forces that would have been fatal to human crewmembers had they been aboard.\\r\\nAs a result, the Soviets secretly planned to continue unmanned Zond tests until their reliability to support manned flight had been demonstrated. However, due to NASA's continuing problems with the lunar module, and because of CIA reports of a potential Soviet manned circumlunar flight in late 1968, NASA fatefully changed the flight plan of Apollo 8 from an Earth-orbit lunar module test to a lunar orbit mission scheduled for late December 1968.\\r\\nIn early December 1968 the launch window to the Moon opened for the Soviet launch site in Baikonur, giving the USSR their final chance to beat the US to the Moon. Cosmonauts went on alert and asked to fly the Zond spacecraft then in final countdown at Baikonur on the first manned trip to the Moon. Ultimately, however, the Soviet Politburo decided the risk of crew death was unacceptable given the combined poor performance to that point of Zond/Proton and so scrubbed the launch of a manned Soviet lunar mission. Their decision proved to be a wise one, since this unnumbered Zond mission was destroyed in another unmanned test when it was finally launched several weeks later.\\r\\nBy this time flights of the third generation U.S. Apollo spacecraft had begun. Far more capable than the Zond, the Apollo spacecraft had the necessary rocket power to slip into and out of lunar orbit and to make course adjustments required for a safe reentry during the return to Earth. The Apollo 8 mission carried out the first manned trip to the Moon on 24 December 1968, certifying the Saturn V booster for manned use and flying not a circumlunar loop but instead a full ten orbits around the Moon before returning safely to Earth. Apollo 10 then performed a full dress rehearsal of a manned Moon landing in May 1969. This mission orbited within 47,400 feet (14.4?km) altitude above the lunar surface, performing necessary low-altitude mapping of trajectory-altering mascons using a factory prototype lunar module that was too overweight to allow a successful landing. With the failure of the unmanned Soviet sample return Moon landing attempt Luna 15 in July 1969, the stage was set for Apollo 11.\\r\\nPlans for manned Moon exploration originated during the Eisenhower administration. In a series of mid-1950s articles in Collier's magazine, Wernher von Braun had popularized the idea of a manned expedition to the Moon to establish a lunar base. A manned Moon landing posed several daunting technical challenges to the US and USSR. Besides guidance and weight management, atmospheric re-entry without ablative overheating was a major hurdle. After the Soviet Union's launch of Sputnik, von Braun promoted a plan for the United States Army to establish a military lunar outpost by 1965.\\r\\nAfter the early Soviet successes, especially Yuri Gagarin's flight, US President John F. Kennedy looked for a US project that would capture the public imagination. He asked Vice President Lyndon Johnson to make recommendations on a scientific endeavor that would prove US world leadership. The proposals included non-space options such as massive irrigation projects to benefit the Third World. The Soviets, at the time, had more powerful rockets than the United States, which gave them an advantage in some kinds of space mission.\\r\\nAdvances in US nuclear weapon technology had led to smaller, lighter warheads, and consequently, rockets with smaller payload capacities. By comparison, Soviet nuclear weapons were much heavier, and the powerful R-7 rocket was developed to carry them. More modest potential missions such as flying around the Moon without landing or establishing a space lab in orbit (both were proposed by Kennedy to von Braun) were determined to offer too much advantage to the Soviets, since the US would have to develop a heavy rocket to match the Soviets. A Moon landing, however, would capture world imagination while functioning as propaganda.\\r\\nJohnson had championed the US manned space program ever since the Sputnik scare, sponsoring the legislation which created NASA when he was in the Senate in 1958. When Kennedy asked him in 1961 to research the best manned space achievement to counter the Soviets' lead, Johnson responded that the US had an even chance of beating the USSR to a manned lunar landing, but not for anything less. Kennedy seized on Apollo as the ideal focus for efforts in space. He ensured continuing funding, shielding space spending from the 1963 tax cut, but diverting money from other NASA scientific projects. This last dismayed NASA's leader, James E. Webb, who perceived the need for NASA's support from the scientific community.\\r\\nThe Moon landing required development of the large Saturn V launch vehicle, which achieved a perfect record of zero catastrophic failures or launch vehicle-caused mission failures, in thirteen launches.\\r\\nFor the program to succeed, its proponents would have to defeat criticism from politicians on the left, who wanted more money spent on social programs, and on those on the right, who favored a more military project. By emphasizing the scientific payoff and playing on fears of Soviet space dominance, Kennedy and Johnson managed to swing public opinion: by 1965, 58 percent of Americans favored Apollo, up from 33 percent two years earlier. After Johnson became President in 1963, his continuing defense of the program allowed it to succeed in 1969, as Kennedy planned.\\r\\nSoviet leader Nikita Khrushchev said in October 1963 that the USSR was \\"not at present planning flight by cosmonauts to the Moon,\\" while insisting that the Soviets had not dropped out of the race. Only after another year would the USSR fully commit itself to a Moon-landing attempt, which ultimately failed.\\r\\nAt the same time, Kennedy had suggested various joint programs, including a possible Moon landing by Soviet and U.S. astronauts and the development of better weather-monitoring satellites. Khrushchev, sensing an attempt by Kennedy to steal Russian space technology, rejected the idea: if the USSR went to the Moon, it would go alone. Sergey Korolev, the Soviet space program's chief designer, had started promoting his Soyuz craft and the N1 launcher rocket that would have the capability of carrying out a manned Moon landing.\\r\\nKhrushchev directed Korolev's design bureau to arrange further space firsts by modifying the existing Vostok technology, while a second team started building a completely new launcher and craft, the Proton booster and the Zond, for a manned cislunar flight in 1966. In 1964 the new Soviet leadership gave Korolev the backing for a Moon landing effort and brought all manned projects under his direction.\\r\\nWith Korolev's death and the failure of the first Soyuz flight in 1967, the co-ordination of the Soviet Moon landing program quickly unraveled. The Soviets built a landing craft and selected cosmonauts for the mission that would have placed Aleksei Leonov on the Moon's surface, but with the successive launch failures of the N1 booster in 1969, plans for a manned landing suffered first delay and then cancellation.\\r\\nIn total, twenty-four U.S. astronauts have traveled to the Moon. Three have made the trip twice, and twelve have walked on its surface. Apollo 8 was a lunar-orbit-only mission, Apollo 10 included undocking and Descent Orbit Insertion (DOI), followed by LM staging to CSM redocking, while Apollo 13, originally scheduled as a landing, ended up as a lunar fly-by, by means of free return trajectory; thus, none of these missions made landings. Apollo 7 and Apollo 9 were Earth-orbit-only missions. Apart from the inherent dangers of manned Moon expeditions as seen with Apollo 13, one reason for their cessation according to astronaut Alan Bean is the cost it imposes in government subsidies.[23]\\r\\nUnlike other international rivalries, the Space Race has remained unaffected in a direct way regarding the desire for territorial expansion. After the successful landings on the Moon, the U.S. explicitly disclaimed the right to ownership of any part of the Moon.\\r\\nPresident Richard Nixon had speechwriter William Safire prepare a condolence speech for delivery in the event that Armstrong and Aldrin became marooned on the Moon's surface and could not be rescued.[24]\\r\\nIn 1951, science fiction writer Arthur C. Clarke forecast that man would reach the Moon by 1978.[25]\\r\\nOn 16 August 2006, the Associated Press reported that NASA is missing the original Slow-scan television tapes (which were made before the scan conversion for conventional TV) of the Apollo 11 Moon walk. Some news outlets have mistakenly reported that the SSTV tapes were found in Western Australia, but those tapes were only recordings of data from the Apollo 11 Early Apollo Surface Experiments Package.[26]\\r\\nScientists believe the six American flags planted by astronauts have been bleached white because of more than 40 years of exposure to solar radiation.[27] Using LROC images, five of the six American flags are still standing and casting shadows at all of the sites, except Apollo 11.[28] Astronaut Buzz Aldrin reported that the flag was blown over by the exhaust from the ascent engine during liftoff of Apollo 11.[28]\\r\\nLaunched on 24 January 1990, 11:46 UTC. At the end of its mission, the Japanese lunar orbiter Hiten was commanded to crash into the lunar surface and did so on 10 April 1993 at 18:03:25.7 UT (11 April 03:03:25.7 JST).[29]\\r\\nLunar Prospector was launched on 7 January 1998. The mission ended on 31 July 1999, when the orbiter was deliberately crashed into a crater near the lunar south pole after the presence of water ice was successfully detected.[30]\\r\\nLaunched 27 September 2003, 23:14 UTC from the Guiana Space Centre in Kourou, French Guiana. At the end of its mission, the ESA lunar orbiter SMART-1 performed a controlled crash into the Moon, at about 2?km/s. The time of the crash was 3 September 2006, at 5:42 UTC.[31]\\r\\nSELENE or Kaguya was launched on 14 September 2007. After successfully orbiting the Moon for a year and eight months, the main orbiter was instructed to impact on the lunar surface near the crater Gill at 18:25 UTC on 10 June 2009.[32]\\r\\nThe Chinese lunar orbiter Chang'e 1, launched 24 October 2007, 10:05 UTC, executed a controlled crash onto the surface of the Moon on 1 March 2009, 20:44 GMT, after a 16-month mission.[33]\\r\\nChandrayaan-1 was launched on 22 October 2008, 00:52 UTC. The impactor, the Moon Impact Probe, impacted near Shackleton Crater at the south pole of the lunar surface at 14 November 2008, 20:31 IST.[34] Chandrayaan-2 is scheduled for launch in 2018.\\r\\nThe LCROSS data collecting shepherding spacecraft was launched together with the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) on 18 June 2009 on board an Atlas V rocket with a Centaur upper stage. On 9 October 2009, at 11:31 UTC, the Centaur upper stage impacted the lunar surface, releasing the kinetic energy equivalent of detonating approximately 2 tons of TNT (8.86 GJ).[35] Six minutes later at 11:37 UTC, the LCROSS shepherding spacecraft also impacted the surface.[36]\\r\\nThe GRAIL mission consisted of two small spacecraft: GRAIL A (Ebb), and GRAIL B (Flow). They were launched on 10 September 2011 on board a Delta II rocket. GRAIL A separated from the rocket about nine minutes after launch, and GRAIL B followed about eight minutes later.[37][38] The first probe entered orbit on 31 December 2011 and the second followed on 1 January 2012.[39] The two spacecraft impacted the Lunar surface on 17 December 2012.[40]\\r\\nLADEE was launched on 7 September 2013.[41] The mission ended on 18 April 2014, when the spacecraft's controllers intentionally crashed LADEE into the far side of the Moon,[42][43] which, later, was determined to be near the eastern rim of Sundman V crater.[44][45]\\r\\nOn 14 December 2013 at 13:12 UTC[46] Chang'e 3 soft-landed a rover on the Moon. This was the first lunar soft landing since Luna 24 on 22 August 1976.[47]\\r\\nProgress in space exploration has recently broadened the phrase moon landing to include other moons in the Solar System as well. The Huygens probe of the CassiniÿHuygens mission to Saturn performed a successful unmanned moon landing on Titan in 2005. Similarly, the Soviet probe Phobos 2 came within 120?mi (190?km) of performing an unmanned moon landing on Mars' moon Phobos in 1989 before radio contact with that lander was suddenly lost. A similar Russian sample return mission called Fobos-Grunt (\\"grunt\\" means \\"soil\\" in Russian) launched in November 2011, but stalled in low-earth orbit. There is widespread interest in performing a future moon landing on Jupiter's Europa moon to drill down and explore the possible liquid water ocean beneath its icy surface.\\r\\nChina is planning to land another rover and collect samples in the Chang'e 4 mission and return lunar soil samples by 2018 in the Chang'e 5 mission.[48]\\r\\nISRO, the Indian National Space agency, is planning a second version of Chandrayaan named Chandrayaan 2. According to former ISRO Chairman G. Madhavan Nair, \\"The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) hopes to land two rovers ÿ one Indian and another Russian ÿ on the Moon in 2018, as a part of its second Chandrayaan mission. The rover will be designed to move on wheels on the lunar surface, pick up samples of soil or rocks, do on-site chemical analysis and send the data to the mother-spacecraft Chandrayaan II, which will be orbiting above. Chandrayaan II will transmit the data to Earth.\\" The payloads have already been finalized.[49][50] ISRO has mentioned that due to weight restrictions it will not be carrying any overseas payloads on this mission. The lander weight is projected to be 1,250?kg, and the spacecraft will be launched by the Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle.\\r\\nRussia's Luna-Glob 1 is expected to be launched in 2018.[51] In 2007 the head of the Russian Space Agency announced plans to send cosmonauts to the Moon by 2025 and establish a permanent robotically operated base there in 2027ÿ2032.[52] In 2015, Roscosmos stated that Russia plans to place a cosmonaut on the Moon by 2030, leaving Mars to NASA. The purpose is to work jointly with NASA and avoid another Space Race.[53]\\r\\nThe Lunar Precursor Robotic Program (LPRP) is a program of robotic spacecraft missions which NASA will use to prepare for future Moon landings.[54] Three orbiters have been launched in the program, the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO), the Lunar Crater Observation and Sensing Satellite (LCROSS), and the Lunar Atmosphere and Dust Environment Explorer (LADEE), launched in 2013, but no Moon landings are scheduled yet.\\r\\nThe Google Lunar X Prize competition offers a $20?million award for the first privately funded team to land a robotic probe on the Moon. Like the Ansari X Prize before it, the competition aims to advance the state of the art in private space exploration.[55] Of the several competing teams, Puli Space Technologies at one time (2012) planned to launch in 2014[56][needs update] and Astrobotic Technology plans to launch in the second half of 2016 with their own rover plus another team's lunar rovers from Hakuto.[57][58]\\r\\nMany conspiracy theorists hold that the Apollo Moon landings were a hoax;[59] however, empirical evidence is readily available to show that manned moon landings did indeed occur. Anyone on Earth with an appropriate laser and telescope system can bounce laser beams off three retroreflector arrays left on the Moon by Apollo 11,[60] 14 and 15, verifying deployment of the Lunar Laser Ranging Experiment at historically documented Apollo Moon landing sites and so proving equipment constructed on Earth was successfully transported to the surface of the Moon. In addition, in August 2009 NASA's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter began to send back high resolution photos of the Apollo landing sites. These photos show not only the large Descent Stages of the lunar landers left behind but also tracks of the astronauts' walking paths in the lunar dust.[61]","input":"Which country was the first to land on the moon?"},{"output":"Novak Djokovic","context":"Rafael Nadal was the defending champion, but retired in his semifinal match against Juan Martn del Potro.\\r\\n\\r\\nNovak Djokovic won the title, his third at the US Open and 14th Grand Slam title overall, tying Pete Sampras, defeating Juan Martn del Potro in the final, 6ÿ3, 7ÿ6(7ÿ4), 6ÿ3.[1][2]\\r\\n\\r\\nNadal and Roger Federer were in contention for the ATP no. 1 singles ranking at the start of the tournament.

Diamond is less stable than graphite, but the conversion rate from diamond to graphite is negligible at standard conditions. Diamond is renowned as a material with superlative physical qualities, most of which originate from the strong covalent bonding between its atoms. In particular, diamond has the highest hardness and thermal conductivity of any bulk material. Those properties determine the major industrial application of diamond in cutting and polishing tools and the scientific applications in diamond knives and diamond anvil cells.\\r\\nBecause of its extremely rigid lattice, it can be contaminated by very few types of impurities, such as boron and nitrogen.

Diamonds are brought close to the Earth's surface through deep volcanic eruptions by magma, which cools into igneous rocks known as kimberlites and lamproites. Diamonds can also be produced synthetically in a HPHT method which approximately simulates the conditions in the Earth's mantle. An alternative, and completely different growth technique is chemical vapor deposition (CVD). Several non-diamond materials, which include cubic zirconia and silicon carbide and are often called diamond simulants, resemble diamond in appearance and many properties. Special gemological techniques have been developed to distinguish natural diamonds, synthetic diamonds, and diamond simulants. The word is from the ancient Greek ?Ѵ?ϫ? ÿ admas \\"unbreakable\\".\\r\\nThe name diamond is derived from the ancient Greek ϫѴ?ϫ? (admas), \\"proper\\", \\"unalterable\\", \\"unbreakable\\", \\"untamed\\", from ?- (a-), \\"un-\\" + Ѵϫ? (dam), \\"I overpower\\", \\"I tame\\".[3] Diamonds are thought to have been first recognized and mined in India, where significant alluvial deposits of the stone could be found many centuries ago along the rivers Penner, Krishna and Godavari. Diamonds have been known in India for at least 3,000 years but most likely 6,000 years.[4]\\r\\nDiamonds have been treasured as gemstones since their use as religious icons in ancient India. Their usage in engraving tools also dates to early human history.[5][6] The popularity of diamonds has risen since the 19th century because of increased supply, improved cutting and polishing techniques, growth in the world economy, and innovative and successful advertising campaigns.[7]\\r\\nIn 1772, the French scientist Antoine Lavoisier used a lens to concentrate the rays of the sun on a diamond in an atmosphere of oxygen, and showed that the only product of the combustion was carbon dioxide, proving that diamond is composed of carbon.[8] Later in 1797, the English chemist Smithson Tennant repeated and expanded that experiment.[9] By demonstrating that burning diamond and graphite releases the same amount of gas, he established the chemical equivalence of these substances.[10]\\r\\nThe most familiar uses of diamonds today are as gemstones used for adornment, a use which dates back into antiquity, and as industrial abrasives for cutting hard materials. The dispersion of white light into spectral colors is the primary gemological characteristic of gem diamonds. In the 20th century, experts in gemology developed methods of grading diamonds and other gemstones based on the characteristics most important to their value as a gem. Four characteristics, known informally as the four Cs, are now commonly used as the basic descriptors of diamonds: these are carat (its weight), cut (quality of the cut is graded according to proportions, symmetry and polish), color (how close to white or colorless; for fancy diamonds how intense is its hue), and clarity (how free is it from inclusions).[11] A large, flawless diamond is known as a paragon.\\r\\nThe formation of natural diamond requires very specific conditionsexposure of carbon-bearing materials to high pressure, ranging approximately between 45 and 60 kilobars (4.5 and 6 GPa), but at a comparatively low temperature range between approximately 900 and 1,300?C (1,650 and 2,370?F). These conditions are met in two places on Earth; in the lithospheric mantle below relatively stable continental plates, and at the site of a meteorite strike.[12]\\r\\nThe conditions for diamond formation to happen in the lithospheric mantle occur at considerable depth corresponding to the requirements of temperature and pressure. These depths are estimated between 140 and 190 kilometers (87 and 118?mi) though occasionally diamonds have crystallized at depths about 300?km (190?mi).[13] The rate at which temperature changes with increasing depth into the Earth varies greatly in different parts of the Earth. In particular, under oceanic plates the temperature rises more quickly with depth, beyond the range required for diamond formation at the depth required. The correct combination of temperature and pressure is only found in the thick, ancient, and stable parts of continental plates where regions of lithosphere known as cratons exist. Long residence in the cratonic lithosphere allows diamond crystals to grow larger.[13]\\r\\nThrough studies of carbon isotope ratios (similar to the methodology used in carbon dating, except with the stable isotopes C-12 and C-13), it has been shown that the carbon found in diamonds comes from both inorganic and organic sources. Some diamonds, known as harzburgitic, are formed from inorganic carbon originally found deep in the Earth's mantle. In contrast, eclogitic diamonds contain organic carbon from organic detritus that has been pushed down from the surface of the Earth's crust through subduction (see plate tectonics) before transforming into diamond. These two different source of carbon have measurably different 13C:12C ratios. Diamonds that have come to the Earth's surface are generally quite old, ranging from under 1?billion to 3.3?billion years old. This is 22% to 73% of the age of the Earth.[13]\\r\\nDiamond-bearing rock is carried from the mantle to the Earth's surface by deep-origin volcanic eruptions. The magma for such a volcano must originate at a depth where diamonds can be formed[13]150?km (93?mi) or more (three times or more the depth of source magma for most volcanoes). This is a relatively rare occurrence. These typically small surface volcanic craters extend downward in formations known as volcanic pipes.[13] The pipes contain material that was transported toward the surface by volcanic action, but was not ejected before the volcanic activity ceased. During eruption these pipes are open to the surface, resulting in open circulation; many xenoliths of surface rock and even wood and fossils are found in volcanic pipes. Diamond-bearing volcanic pipes are closely related to the oldest, coolest regions of continental crust (cratons). This is because cratons are very thick, and their lithospheric mantle extends to great enough depth that diamonds are stable. Not all pipes contain diamonds, and even fewer contain enough diamonds to make mining economically viable.[13]\\r\\nThe magma in volcanic pipes is usually one of two characteristic types, which cool into igneous rock known as either kimberlite or lamproite.[13] The magma itself does not contain diamond; instead, it acts as an elevator that carries deep-formed rocks (xenoliths), minerals (xenocrysts), and fluids upward. These rocks are characteristically rich in magnesium-bearing olivine, pyroxene, and amphibole minerals[13] which are often altered to serpentine by heat and fluids during and after eruption. Certain indicator minerals typically occur within diamantiferous kimberlites and are used as mineralogical tracers by prospectors, who follow the indicator trail back to the volcanic pipe which may contain diamonds. These minerals are rich in chromium (Cr) or titanium (Ti), elements which impart bright colors to the minerals. The most common indicator minerals are chromium garnets (usually bright red chromium-pyrope, and occasionally green ugrandite-series garnets), eclogitic garnets, orange titanium-pyrope, red high-chromium spinels, dark chromite, bright green chromium-diopside, glassy green olivine, black picroilmenite, and magnetite. Kimberlite deposits are known as blue ground for the deeper serpentinized part of the deposits, or as yellow ground for the near surface smectite clay and carbonate weathered and oxidized portion.[13]\\r\\nOnce diamonds have been transported to the surface by magma in a volcanic pipe, they may erode out and be distributed over a large area. A volcanic pipe containing diamonds is known as a primary source of diamonds. Secondary sources of diamonds include all areas where a significant number of diamonds have been eroded out of their kimberlite or lamproite matrix, and accumulated because of water or wind action. These include alluvial deposits and deposits along existing and ancient shorelines, where loose diamonds tend to accumulate because of their size and density. Diamonds have also rarely been found in deposits left behind by glaciers (notably in Wisconsin and Indiana); in contrast to alluvial deposits, glacial deposits are minor and are therefore not viable commercial sources of diamond.[13]\\r\\nNot all diamonds found on Earth originated on Earth. Primitive interstellar meteorites were found to contain carbon possibly in the form of diamond.[14] A type of diamond called carbonado that is found in South America and Africa may have been deposited there via an asteroid impact (not formed from the impact) about 3?billion years ago. These diamonds may have formed in the intrastellar environment, but as of 2008, there was no scientific consensus on how carbonado diamonds originated.[15][16]\\r\\nDiamonds can also form under other naturally occurring high-pressure conditions. Very small diamonds of micrometer and nanometer sizes, known as microdiamonds or nanodiamonds respectively, have been found in meteorite impact craters. Such impact events create shock zones of high pressure and temperature suitable for diamond formation. Impact-type microdiamonds can be used as an indicator of ancient impact craters.[12] Popigai crater in Russia may have the world's largest diamond deposit, estimated at trillions of carats, and formed by an asteroid impact.[17]\\r\\nScientific evidence indicates that white dwarf stars have a core of crystallized carbon and oxygen nuclei. The largest of these found in the universe so far, BPM 37093, is located 50 light-years (4.7G1014?km) away in the constellation Centaurus. A news release from the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics described the 2,500-mile (4,000?km)-wide stellar core as a diamond.[18]\\r\\nFew diamonds are formed from highly compressed coal. More than 99% of diamonds ever mined have formed in the conditions of extreme heat and pressure about 90 miles (140?km) below the Earth's surface. Coal is formed from prehistoric plants buried much closer to the surface and is unlikely to migrate below 2 miles (3.2?km) through common geological processes. Most diamonds that have been dated are older than the first land plants and are therefore older than coal. It is possible that diamonds can form from coal in subduction zones and in meteoroid impacts, but diamonds formed in this way are rare, and the carbon source is more likely carbonate rocks and organic carbon in sediments, rather than coal.[19][20]\\r\\nA diamond is a transparent crystal of tetrahedrally bonded carbon atoms in a covalent network lattice (sp3) that crystallizes into the diamond lattice which is a variation of the face-centered cubic structure. Diamonds have been adapted for many uses because of the material's exceptional physical characteristics. Most notable are its extreme hardness and thermal conductivity (900ÿ7003232000000000000?2320?W{m?1{K?1),[21] as well as wide bandgap and high optical dispersion.[22] Above 7003197315000000000?1700?C (7003197300000000000?1973?K / 7003224592777777777?3583?F) in vacuum or oxygen-free atmosphere, diamond converts to graphite; in air, transformation starts at ~7002973150000000000?700?C.[23] Diamond's ignition point is 720ÿ7003107315000000000?800?C in oxygen and 850ÿ7003127315000000000?1000?C in air. Naturally occurring diamonds have a density ranging from 3.15 to 7003353000000000000?3.53?g/cm3, with pure diamond close to 7003352000000000000?3.52?g/cm3.[1] The chemical bonds that hold the carbon atoms in diamonds together are weaker than those in graphite. In diamonds, the bonds form an inflexible three-dimensional lattice, whereas in graphite, the atoms are tightly bonded into sheets, which can slide easily over one another, making the overall structure weaker.[24] In a diamond, each carbon atom is surrounded by neighboring four carbon atoms forming a tetrahedral shaped unit.\\r\\nDiamonds occur most often as euhedral or rounded octahedra and twinned octahedra known as macles. As diamond's crystal structure has a cubic arrangement of the atoms, they have many facets that belong to a cube, octahedron, rhombicosidodecahedron, tetrakis hexahedron or disdyakis dodecahedron. The crystals can have rounded off and unexpressive edges and can be elongated. Diamonds (especially those with rounded crystal faces) are commonly found coated in nyf, an opaque gum-like skin.[25]\\r\\nDiamond is the hardest known natural material on both the Vickers and the Mohs scale. Diamond's hardness has been known since antiquity, and is the source of its name.\\r\\nDiamond hardness depends on its purity, crystalline perfection and orientation: hardness is higher for flawless, pure crystals oriented to the <111> direction (along the longest diagonal of the cubic diamond lattice).[26] Therefore, whereas it might be possible to scratch some diamonds with other materials, such as boron nitride, the hardest diamonds can only be scratched by other diamonds and nanocrystalline diamond aggregates.\\r\\nThe hardness of diamond contributes to its suitability as a gemstone. Because it can only be scratched by other diamonds, it maintains its polish extremely well. Unlike many other gems, it is well-suited to daily wear because of its resistance to scratchingperhaps contributing to its popularity as the preferred gem in engagement or wedding rings, which are often worn every day.\\r\\nThe hardest natural diamonds mostly originate from the Copeton and Bingara fields located in the New England area in New South Wales, Australia. These diamonds are generally small, perfect to semiperfect octahedra, and are used to polish other diamonds. Their hardness is associated with the crystal growth form, which is single-stage crystal growth. Most other diamonds show more evidence of multiple growth stages, which produce inclusions, flaws, and defect planes in the crystal lattice, all of which affect their hardness. It is possible to treat regular diamonds under a combination of high pressure and high temperature to produce diamonds that are harder than the diamonds used in hardness gauges.[27]\\r\\nSomewhat related to hardness is another mechanical property toughness, which is a material's ability to resist breakage from forceful impact. The toughness of natural diamond has been measured as 7.5ÿ10 MPa{m1/2.[28][29] This value is good compared to other ceramic materials, but poor compared to most engineering materials such as engineering alloys, which typically exhibit toughnesses over 100 MPa{m1/2. As with any material, the macroscopic geometry of a diamond contributes to its resistance to breakage. Diamond has a cleavage plane and is therefore more fragile in some orientations than others. Diamond cutters use this attribute to cleave some stones, prior to faceting.[30] \\"Impact toughness\\" is one of the main indexes to measure the quality of synthetic industrial diamonds.\\r\\nUsed in so-called diamond anvil experiments to create high-pressure environments, diamonds are able to withstand crushing pressures in excess of 600 gigapascals (6 million atmospheres).[31]\\r\\nOther specialized applications also exist or are being developed, including use as semiconductors: some blue diamonds are natural semiconductors, in contrast to most diamonds, which are excellent electrical insulators.[32] The conductivity and blue color originate from boron impurity. Boron substitutes for carbon atoms in the diamond lattice, donating a hole into the valence band.[32]\\r\\nSubstantial conductivity is commonly observed in nominally undoped diamond grown by chemical vapor deposition. This conductivity is associated with hydrogen-related species adsorbed at the surface, and it can be removed by annealing or other surface treatments.[33][34]\\r\\nDiamonds are naturally lipophilic and hydrophobic, which means the diamonds' surface cannot be wet by water, but can be easily wet and stuck by oil. This property can be utilized to extract diamonds using oil when making synthetic diamonds. However, when diamond surfaces are chemically modified with certain ions, they are expected to become so hydrophilic that they can stabilize multiple layers of water ice at human body temperature.[35]\\r\\nThe surface of diamonds is partially oxidized. The oxidized surface can be reduced by heat treatment under hydrogen flow. That is to say, this heat treatment partially removes oxygen-containing functional groups. But diamonds (sp3C) are unstable against high temperature (above about 400?C (752?F)) under atmospheric pressure. The structure gradually changes into sp2C above this temperature. Thus, diamonds should be reduced under this temperature.[36]\\r\\nDiamonds are not very reactive. Under room temperature diamonds do not react with any chemical reagents including strong acids and bases. A diamond's surface can only be oxidized at temperatures above about 850?C (1,560?F) in air. Diamond also reacts with fluorine gas above about 700?C (1,292?F).\\r\\nDiamond has a wide bandgap of 6981881197067849999?5.5?eV corresponding to the deep ultraviolet wavelength of 225 nanometers. This means that pure diamond should transmit visible light and appear as a clear colorless crystal. Colors in diamond originate from lattice defects and impurities. The diamond crystal lattice is exceptionally strong, and only atoms of nitrogen, boron and hydrogen can be introduced into diamond during the growth at significant concentrations (up to atomic percents). Transition metals nickel and cobalt, which are commonly used for growth of synthetic diamond by high-pressure high-temperature techniques, have been detected in diamond as individual atoms; the maximum concentration is 0.01% for nickel[37] and even less for cobalt. Virtually any element can be introduced to diamond by ion implantation.[38]\\r\\nNitrogen is by far the most common impurity found in gem diamonds and is responsible for the yellow and brown color in diamonds. Boron is responsible for the blue color.[22] Color in diamond has two additional sources: irradiation (usually by alpha particles), that causes the color in green diamonds, and plastic deformation of the diamond crystal lattice. Plastic deformation is the cause of color in some brown[39] and perhaps pink and red diamonds.[40] In order of increasing rarity, yellow diamond is followed by brown, colorless, then by blue, green, black, pink, orange, purple, and red.[30] \\"Black\\", or Carbonado, diamonds are not truly black, but rather contain numerous dark inclusions that give the gems their dark appearance. Colored diamonds contain impurities or structural defects that cause the coloration, while pure or nearly pure diamonds are transparent and colorless. Most diamond impurities replace a carbon atom in the crystal lattice, known as a carbon flaw. The most common impurity, nitrogen, causes a slight to intense yellow coloration depending upon the type and concentration of nitrogen present.[30] The Gemological Institute of America (GIA) classifies low saturation yellow and brown diamonds as diamonds in the normal color range, and applies a grading scale from \\"D\\" (colorless) to \\"Z\\" (light yellow). Diamonds of a different color, such as blue, are called fancy colored diamonds and fall under a different grading scale.[30]\\r\\nIn 2008, the Wittelsbach Diamond, a 35.56-carat (7.112?g) blue diamond once belonging to the King of Spain, fetched over US$24?million at a Christie's auction.[41] In May 2009, a 7.03-carat (1.406?g) blue diamond fetched the highest price per carat ever paid for a diamond when it was sold at auction for 10.5?million Swiss francs (6.97?million euros, or US$9.5?million at the time).[42] That record was, however, beaten the same year: a 5-carat (1.0?g) vivid pink diamond was sold for $10.8?million in Hong Kong on December 1, 2009.[43]\\r\\nDiamonds can be identified by their high thermal conductivity. Their high refractive index is also indicative, but other materials have similar refractivity. Diamonds cut glass, but this does not positively identify a diamond because other materials, such as quartz, also lie above glass on the Mohs scale and can also cut it. Diamonds can scratch other diamonds, but this can result in damage to one or both stones. Hardness tests are infrequently used in practical gemology because of their potentially destructive nature.[44] The extreme hardness and high value of diamond means that gems are typically polished slowly, using painstaking traditional techniques and greater attention to detail than is the case with most other gemstones;[10] these tend to result in extremely flat, highly polished facets with exceptionally sharp facet edges. Diamonds also possess an extremely high refractive index and fairly high dispersion. Taken together, these factors affect the overall appearance of a polished diamond and most diamantaires still rely upon skilled use of a loupe (magnifying glass) to identify diamonds \\"by eye\\".[45]\\r\\nThe diamond industry can be separated into two distinct categories: one dealing with gem-grade diamonds and another for industrial-grade diamonds. Both markets value diamonds differently.\\r\\nA large trade in gem-grade diamonds exists. Although most gem-grade diamonds are sold newly polished, there is a well-established market for resale of polished diamonds (e.g. pawnbroking, auctions, second-hand jewelry stores, diamantaires, bourses, etc.). One hallmark of the trade in gem-quality diamonds is its remarkable concentration: wholesale trade and diamond cutting is limited to just a few locations; in 2003, 92% of the world's diamonds were cut and polished in Surat, India.[46] Other important centers of diamond cutting and trading are the Antwerp diamond district in Belgium, where the International Gemological Institute is based, London, the Diamond District in New York City, the Diamond Exchange District in Tel Aviv, and Amsterdam. One contributory factor is the geological nature of diamond deposits: several large primary kimberlite-pipe mines each account for significant portions of market share (such as the Jwaneng mine in Botswana, which is a single large-pit mine that can produce between 12,500,000 and 15,000,000 carats (2,500 and 3,000?kg) of diamonds per year[47]). Secondary alluvial diamond deposits, on the other hand, tend to be fragmented amongst many different operators because they can be dispersed over many hundreds of square kilometers (e.g., alluvial deposits in Brazil).\\r\\nThe production and distribution of diamonds is largely consolidated in the hands of a few key players, and concentrated in traditional diamond trading centers, the most important being Antwerp, where 80% of all rough diamonds, 50% of all cut diamonds and more than 50% of all rough, cut and industrial diamonds combined are handled.[48] This makes Antwerp a de facto \\"world diamond capital\\".[49] The city of Antwerp also hosts the Antwerpsche Diamantkring, created in 1929 to become the first and biggest diamond bourse dedicated to rough diamonds.[50] Another important diamond center is New York City, where almost 80% of the world's diamonds are sold, including auction sales.[48]\\r\\nThe De Beers company, as the world's largest diamond mining company, holds a dominant position in the industry, and has done so since soon after its founding in 1888 by the British imperialist Cecil Rhodes. De Beers is currently the world's largest operator of diamond production facilities (mines) and distribution channels for gem-quality diamonds. The Diamond Trading Company (DTC) is a subsidiary of De Beers and markets rough diamonds from De Beers-operated mines. De Beers and its subsidiaries own mines that produce some 40% of annual world diamond production. For most of the 20th century over 80% of the world's rough diamonds passed through De Beers,[51] but by 2001ÿ2009 the figure had decreased to around 45%,[52] and by 2013 the company's market share had further decreased to around 38% in value terms and even less by volume.[53] De Beers sold off the vast majority of its diamond stockpile in the late 1990s ÿ early 2000s[54] and the remainder largely represents working stock (diamonds that are being sorted before sale).[55] This was well documented in the press[56] but remains little known to the general public.\\r\\nAs a part of reducing its influence, De Beers withdrew from purchasing diamonds on the open market in 1999 and ceased, at the end of 2008, purchasing Russian diamonds mined by the largest Russian diamond company Alrosa.[57] As of January 2011, De Beers states that it only sells diamonds from the following four countries: Botswana, Namibia, South Africa and Canada.[58] Alrosa had to suspend their sales in October 2008 due to the global energy crisis,[59] but the company reported that it had resumed selling rough diamonds on the open market by October 2009.[60] Apart from Alrosa, other important diamond mining companies include BHP Billiton, which is the world's largest mining company;[61] Rio Tinto Group, the owner of the Argyle (100%), Diavik (60%), and Murowa (78%) diamond mines;[62] and Petra Diamonds, the owner of several major diamond mines in Africa.\\r\\nFurther down the supply chain, members of The World Federation of Diamond Bourses (WFDB) act as a medium for wholesale diamond exchange, trading both polished and rough diamonds. The WFDB consists of independent diamond bourses in major cutting centers such as Tel Aviv, Antwerp, Johannesburg and other cities across the USA, Europe and Asia.[30] In 2000, the WFDB and The International Diamond Manufacturers Association established the World Diamond Council to prevent the trading of diamonds used to fund war and inhumane acts. WFDB's additional activities include sponsoring the World Diamond Congress every two years, as well as the establishment of the International Diamond Council (IDC) to oversee diamond grading.\\r\\nOnce purchased by Sightholders (which is a trademark term referring to the companies that have a three-year supply contract with DTC), diamonds are cut and polished in preparation for sale as gemstones ('industrial' stones are regarded as a by-product of the gemstone market; they are used for abrasives).[63] The cutting and polishing of rough diamonds is a specialized skill that is concentrated in a limited number of locations worldwide.[63] Traditional diamond cutting centers are Antwerp, Amsterdam, Johannesburg, New York City, and Tel Aviv. Recently, diamond cutting centers have been established in China, India, Thailand, Namibia and Botswana.[63] Cutting centers with lower cost of labor, notably Surat in Gujarat, India, handle a larger number of smaller carat diamonds, while smaller quantities of larger or more valuable diamonds are more likely to be handled in Europe or North America. The recent expansion of this industry in India, employing low cost labor, has allowed smaller diamonds to be prepared as gems in greater quantities than was previously economically feasible.[48]\\r\\nDiamonds prepared as gemstones are sold on diamond exchanges called bourses. There are 28 registered diamond bourses in the world.[64] Bourses are the final tightly controlled step in the diamond supply chain; wholesalers and even retailers are able to buy relatively small lots of diamonds at the bourses, after which they are prepared for final sale to the consumer. Diamonds can be sold already set in jewelry, or sold unset (\\"loose\\"). According to the Rio Tinto Group, in 2002 the diamonds produced and released to the market were valued at US$9?billion as rough diamonds, US$14?billion after being cut and polished, US$28?billion in wholesale diamond jewelry, and US$57?billion in retail sales.[65]\\r\\nMined rough diamonds are converted into gems through a multi-step process called \\"cutting\\". Diamonds are extremely hard, but also brittle and can be split up by a single blow. Therefore, diamond cutting is traditionally considered as a delicate procedure requiring skills, scientific knowledge, tools and experience. Its final goal is to produce a faceted jewel where the specific angles between the facets would optimize the diamond luster, that is dispersion of white light, whereas the number and area of facets would determine the weight of the final product. The weight reduction upon cutting is significant and can be of the order of 50%.[66] Several possible shapes are considered, but the final decision is often determined not only by scientific, but also practical considerations. For example, the diamond might be intended for display or for wear, in a ring or a necklace, singled or surrounded by other gems of certain color and shape.[67] Some of them may be considered as classical, such as round, pear, marquise, oval, hearts and arrows diamonds, etc. Some of them are special, produced by certain companies, for example, Phoenix, Cushion, Sole Mio diamonds, etc.[68]\\r\\nThe most time-consuming part of the cutting is the preliminary analysis of the rough stone. It needs to address a large number of issues, bears much responsibility, and therefore can last years in case of unique diamonds. The following issues are considered:\\r\\nAfter initial cutting, the diamond is shaped in numerous stages of polishing. Unlike cutting, which is a responsible but quick operation, polishing removes material by gradual erosion and is extremely time consuming. The associated technique is well developed; it is considered as a routine and can be performed by technicians.[70] After polishing, the diamond is reexamined for possible flaws, either remaining or induced by the process. Those flaws are concealed through various diamond enhancement techniques, such as repolishing, crack filling, or clever arrangement of the stone in the jewelry. Remaining non-diamond inclusions are removed through laser drilling and filling of the voids produced.[44]\\r\\nMarketing has significantly affected the image of diamond as a valuable commodity.\\r\\nN. W. Ayer & Son, the advertising firm retained by De Beers in the mid-20th century, succeeded in reviving the American diamond market. And the firm created new markets in countries where no diamond tradition had existed before. N. W. Ayer's marketing included product placement, advertising focused on the diamond product itself rather than the De Beers brand, and associations with celebrities and royalty. Without advertising the De Beers brand, De Beers was advertising its competitors' diamond products as well,[71] but this was not a concern as De Beers dominated the diamond market throughout the 20th century. De Beers' market share dipped temporarily to 2nd place in the global market below Alrosa in the aftermath of the global economic crisis of 2008, down to less than 29% in terms of carats mined, rather than sold.[72] The campaign lasted for decades but was effectively discontinued by early 2011. De Beers still advertises diamonds, but the advertising now mostly promotes its own brands, or licensed product lines, rather than completely \\"generic\\" diamond products.[72] The campaign was perhaps best captured by the slogan \\"a diamond is forever\\".[7] This slogan is now being used by De Beers Diamond Jewelers,[73] a jewelry firm which is a 50%/50% joint venture between the De Beers mining company and LVMH, the luxury goods conglomerate.\\r\\nBrown-colored diamonds constituted a significant part of the diamond production, and were predominantly used for industrial purposes. They were seen as worthless for jewelry (not even being assessed on the diamond color scale). After the development of Argyle diamond mine in Australia in 1986, and marketing, brown diamonds have become acceptable gems.[74][75] The change was mostly due to the numbers: the Argyle mine, with its 35,000,000 carats (7,000?kg) of diamonds per year, makes about one-third of global production of natural diamonds;[76] 80% of Argyle diamonds are brown.[77]\\r\\nIndustrial diamonds are valued mostly for their hardness and thermal conductivity, making many of the gemological characteristics of diamonds, such as the 4 Cs, irrelevant for most applications. 80% of mined diamonds (equal to about 135,000,000 carats (27,000?kg) annually) are unsuitable for use as gemstones and are used industrially.[78] In addition to mined diamonds, synthetic diamonds found industrial applications almost immediately after their invention in the 1950s; another 570,000,000 carats (114,000?kg) of synthetic diamond is produced annually for industrial use (in 2004; in 2014 it is 4,500,000,000 carats (900,000?kg), 90% of which is produced in China). Approximately 90% of diamond grinding grit is currently of synthetic origin.[79]\\r\\nThe boundary between gem-quality diamonds and industrial diamonds is poorly defined and partly depends on market conditions (for example, if demand for polished diamonds is high, some lower-grade stones will be polished into low-quality or small gemstones rather than being sold for industrial use). Within the category of industrial diamonds, there is a sub-category comprising the lowest-quality, mostly opaque stones, which are known as bort.[80]\\r\\nIndustrial use of diamonds has historically been associated with their hardness, which makes diamond the ideal material for cutting and grinding tools. As the hardest known naturally occurring material, diamond can be used to polish, cut, or wear away any material, including other diamonds. Common industrial applications of this property include diamond-tipped drill bits and saws, and the use of diamond powder as an abrasive. Less expensive industrial-grade diamonds, known as bort, with more flaws and poorer color than gems, are used for such purposes.[81] Diamond is not suitable for machining ferrous alloys at high speeds, as carbon is soluble in iron at the high temperatures created by high-speed machining, leading to greatly increased wear on diamond tools compared to alternatives.[82]\\r\\nSpecialized applications include use in laboratories as containment for high-pressure experiments (see diamond anvil cell), high-performance bearings, and limited use in specialized windows.[80] With the continuing advances being made in the production of synthetic diamonds, future applications are becoming feasible. The high thermal conductivity of diamond makes it suitable as a heat sink for integrated circuits in electronics.[83]\\r\\nApproximately 130,000,000 carats (26,000?kg) of diamonds are mined annually, with a total value of nearly US$9?billion, and about 100,000?kg (220,000?lb) are synthesized annually.[84]\\r\\nRoughly 49% of diamonds originate from Central and Southern Africa, although significant sources of the mineral have been discovered in Canada, India, Russia, Brazil, and Australia.[79] They are mined from kimberlite and lamproite volcanic pipes, which can bring diamond crystals, originating from deep within the Earth where high pressures and temperatures enable them to form, to the surface. The mining and distribution of natural diamonds are subjects of frequent controversy such as concerns over the sale of blood diamonds or conflict diamonds by African paramilitary groups.[85] The diamond supply chain is controlled by a limited number of powerful businesses, and is also highly concentrated in a small number of locations around the world.\\r\\nOnly a very small fraction of the diamond ore consists of actual diamonds. The ore is crushed, during which care is required not to destroy larger diamonds, and then sorted by density. Today, diamonds are located in the diamond-rich density fraction with the help of X-ray fluorescence, after which the final sorting steps are done by hand. Before the use of X-rays became commonplace,[66] the separation was done with grease belts; diamonds have a stronger tendency to stick to grease than the other minerals in the ore.[30]\\r\\nHistorically, diamonds were found only in alluvial deposits in Guntur and Krishna district of the Krishna River delta in Southern India.[86] India led the world in diamond production from the time of their discovery in approximately the 9th century BC[4][87] to the mid-18th century AD, but the commercial potential of these sources had been exhausted by the late 18th century and at that time India was eclipsed by Brazil where the first non-Indian diamonds were found in 1725.[4] Currently, one of the most prominent Indian mines is located at Panna.[88]\\r\\nDiamond extraction from primary deposits (kimberlites and lamproites) started in the 1870s after the discovery of the Diamond Fields in South Africa.[89] Production has increased over time and now an accumulated total of 4,500,000,000 carats (900,000?kg) have been mined since that date.[90] Twenty percent of that amount has been mined in the last five years, and during the last 10 years, nine new mines have started production; four more are waiting to be opened soon. Most of these mines are located in Canada, Zimbabwe, Angola, and one in Russia.[90]\\r\\nIn the U.S., diamonds have been found in Arkansas, Colorado, New Mexico, Wyoming, and Montana.[91][92] In 2004, the discovery of a microscopic diamond in the U.S. led to the January 2008 bulk-sampling of kimberlite pipes in a remote part of Montana. The Crater of Diamonds State Park in Arkansas is open to the public, and is the only mine in the world where members of the public can dig for diamonds.[92]\\r\\nToday, most commercially viable diamond deposits are in Russia (mostly in Sakha Republic, for example Mir pipe and Udachnaya pipe), Botswana, Australia (Northern and Western Australia) and the Democratic Republic of the Congo.[93] In 2005, Russia produced almost one-fifth of the global diamond output, according to the British Geological Survey. Australia boasts the richest diamantiferous pipe, with production from the Argyle diamond mine reaching peak levels of 42 metric tons per year in the 1990s.[91][94] There are also commercial deposits being actively mined in the Northwest Territories of Canada and Brazil.[79] Diamond prospectors continue to search the globe for diamond-bearing kimberlite and lamproite pipes.\\r\\nIn some of the more politically unstable central African and west African countries, revolutionary groups have taken control of diamond mines, using proceeds from diamond sales to finance their operations. Diamonds sold through this process are known as conflict diamonds or blood diamonds.[85] Major diamond trading corporations continue to fund and fuel these conflicts by doing business with armed groups.[citation needed]\\r\\nIn response to public concerns that their diamond purchases were contributing to war and human rights abuses in central and western Africa, the United Nations, the diamond industry and diamond-trading nations introduced the Kimberley Process in 2002.[95] The Kimberley Process aims to ensure that conflict diamonds do not become intermixed with the diamonds not controlled by such rebel groups. This is done by requiring diamond-producing countries to provide proof that the money they make from selling the diamonds is not used to fund criminal or revolutionary activities. Although the Kimberley Process has been moderately successful in limiting the number of conflict diamonds entering the market, some still find their way in. According to the International Diamond Manufacturers Association, conflict diamonds constitute 2ÿ3% of all diamonds traded.[96] Two major flaws still hinder the effectiveness of the Kimberley Process: (1) the relative ease of smuggling diamonds across African borders, and (2) the violent nature of diamond mining in nations that are not in a technical state of war and whose diamonds are therefore considered \\"clean\\".[95]\\r\\nThe Canadian Government has set up a body known as the Canadian Diamond Code of Conduct[97] to help authenticate Canadian diamonds. This is a stringent tracking system of diamonds and helps protect the \\"conflict free\\" label of Canadian diamonds.[98]\\r\\nSynthetic diamonds are diamonds manufactured in a laboratory, as opposed to diamonds mined from the Earth. The gemological and industrial uses of diamond have created a large demand for rough stones. This demand has been satisfied in large part by synthetic diamonds, which have been manufactured by various processes for more than half a century. However, in recent years it has become possible to produce gem-quality synthetic diamonds of significant size.[13] It is possible to make colorless synthetic gemstones that, on a molecular level, are identical to natural stones and so visually similar that only a gemologist with special equipment can tell the difference.[99]\\r\\nThe majority of commercially available synthetic diamonds are yellow and are produced by so-called high-pressure high-temperature (HPHT) processes.[100] The yellow color is caused by nitrogen impurities. Other colors may also be reproduced such as blue, green or pink, which are a result of the addition of boron or from irradiation after synthesis.[101]\\r\\nAnother popular method of growing synthetic diamond is chemical vapor deposition (CVD). The growth occurs under low pressure (below atmospheric pressure). It involves feeding a mixture of gases (typically 1 to 99 methane to hydrogen) into a chamber and splitting them to chemically active radicals in a plasma ignited by microwaves, hot filament, arc discharge, welding torch or laser.[102] This method is mostly used for coatings, but can also produce single crystals several millimeters in size (see picture).[84]\\r\\nAs of 2010, nearly all 5,000?million carats (1,000 tonnes) of synthetic diamonds produced per year are for industrial use. Around 50% of the 133?million carats of natural diamonds mined per year end up in industrial use.[99][103] Mining companies' expenses average $40 to $60 per carat for natural colorless diamonds, while synthetic manufacturers' expenses average $2,500 per carat for synthetic, gem-quality colorless diamonds.[99]:79 However, a purchaser is more likely to encounter a synthetic when looking for a fancy-colored diamond because nearly all synthetic diamonds are fancy-colored, while only 0.01% of natural diamonds are.[104]\\r\\nA diamond simulant is a non-diamond material that is used to simulate the appearance of a diamond, and may be referred to as diamante. Cubic zirconia is the most common. The gemstone moissanite (silicon carbide) can be treated as a diamond simulant, though more costly to produce than cubic zirconia. Both are produced synthetically.[105]\\r\\nDiamond enhancements are specific treatments performed on natural or synthetic diamonds (usually those already cut and polished into a gem), which are designed to better the gemological characteristics of the stone in one or more ways. These include laser drilling to remove inclusions, application of sealants to fill cracks, treatments to improve a white diamond's color grade, and treatments to give fancy color to a white diamond.[106]\\r\\nCoatings are increasingly used to give a diamond simulant such as cubic zirconia a more \\"diamond-like\\" appearance. One such substance is diamond-like carbonan amorphous carbonaceous material that has some physical properties similar to those of the diamond. Advertising suggests that such a coating would transfer some of these diamond-like properties to the coated stone, hence enhancing the diamond simulant. Techniques such as Raman spectroscopy should easily identify such a treatment.[107]\\r\\nEarly diamond identification tests included a scratch test relying on the superior hardness of diamond. This test is destructive, as a diamond can scratch another diamond, and is rarely used nowadays. Instead, diamond identification relies on its superior thermal conductivity. Electronic thermal probes are widely used in the gemological centers to separate diamonds from their imitations. These probes consist of a pair of battery-powered thermistors mounted in a fine copper tip. One thermistor functions as a heating device while the other measures the temperature of the copper tip: if the stone being tested is a diamond, it will conduct the tip's thermal energy rapidly enough to produce a measurable temperature drop. This test takes about 2ÿ3 seconds.[108]\\r\\nWhereas the thermal probe can separate diamonds from most of their simulants, distinguishing between various types of diamond, for example synthetic or natural, irradiated or non-irradiated, etc., requires more advanced, optical techniques. Those techniques are also used for some diamonds simulants, such as silicon carbide, which pass the thermal conductivity test. Optical techniques can distinguish between natural diamonds and synthetic diamonds. They can also identify the vast majority of treated natural diamonds.[109] \\"Perfect\\" crystals (at the atomic lattice level) have never been found, so both natural and synthetic diamonds always possess characteristic imperfections, arising from the circumstances of their crystal growth, that allow them to be distinguished from each other.[110]\\r\\nLaboratories use techniques such as spectroscopy, microscopy and luminescence under shortwave ultraviolet light to determine a diamond's origin.[109] They also use specially made instruments to aid them in the identification process. Two screening instruments are the DiamondSure and the DiamondView, both produced by the DTC and marketed by the GIA.[111]\\r\\nSeveral methods for identifying synthetic diamonds can be performed, depending on the method of production and the color of the diamond. CVD diamonds can usually be identified by an orange fluorescence. D-J colored diamonds can be screened through the Swiss Gemmological Institute's[112] Diamond Spotter. Stones in the D-Z color range can be examined through the DiamondSure UV/visible spectrometer, a tool developed by De Beers.[110] Similarly, natural diamonds usually have minor imperfections and flaws, such as inclusions of foreign material, that are not seen in synthetic diamonds.\\r\\nScreening devices based on diamond type detection can be used to make a distinction between diamonds that are certainly natural and diamonds that are potentially synthetic. Those potentially synthetic diamonds require more investigation in a specialized lab. Examples of commercial screening devices are D-Screen (WTOCD / HRD Antwerp) and Alpha Diamond Analyzer (Bruker / HRD Antwerp).\\r\\nOccasionally large thefts of diamonds take place. In February 2013 armed robbers carried out a raid at Brussels Airport and escaped with gems estimated to be worth $50m (S32m; 37m euros). The gang broke through a perimeter fence and raided the cargo hold of a Swiss-bound plane. The gang have since been arrested and large amounts of cash and diamonds recovered.[113]\\r\\nThe identification of stolen diamonds presents a set of difficult problems. Rough diamonds will have a distinctive shape depending on whether their source is a mine or from an alluvial environment such as a beach or river - alluvial diamonds have smoother surfaces than those that have been mined. Determining the provenance of cut and polished stones is much more complex.\\r\\nThe Kimberley Process was developed to monitor the trade in rough diamonds and prevent their being used to fund violence. Before exporting, rough diamonds are certificated by the government of the country of origin. Some countries, such as Venezuela, are not party to the agreement. The Kimberley Process does not apply to local sales of rough diamonds within a country.\\r\\nDiamonds may be etched by laser with marks invisible to the naked eye. Lazare Kaplan, a US-based company, developed this method. However, whatever is marked on a diamond can readily be removed.[114][115]","input":"Where was the first diamond mined in the world?"},{"output":"1.1 million","context":"Arabs\\r\\nAfrican Americans\\r\\nAsian Indians\\r\\nBangladeshis\\r\\nBrazilians\\r\\nCaribbeans\\r\\nChinese (Fuzhounese)\\r\\nFilipinos\\r\\nIrish\\r\\nItalians\\r\\nJapanese\\r\\nJews\\r\\nKoreans\\r\\nPuerto Ricans\\r\\nRussians\\r\\n\\r\\nJews in New York City comprise approximately 13 percent of the city's population, making the Jewish community the largest in the world outside of Israel.  As of  2014[update], 1.1 million Jews live in the five boroughs of New York City, and 1.75 million Jews live in New York state overall.[1] Jews have immigrated to New York City since the first settlement in Dutch New Amsterdam in 1654, most notably at the end of the 19th century to the early 20th century, when the Jewish population rose from about 80,000 in 1880 to 1.5 million in 1920. The large Jewish population has led to a significant impact on the culture of New York City.[2] After many decades of decline in the 20th century, the Jewish population of New York City has seen a sharp increase in the 21st century owing to the high birth rate of the Hasidic and Orthodox communities.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs of  2016[update], about 1.1 million residents of New York City, or about 12% of its residents, were Jewish.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are approximately 1.5 million Jews in the New York metropolitan area, making it the second largest metropolitan Jewish community in the world, after the Tel Aviv Metropolitan Area in Israel (however, Tel Aviv proper has a smaller population of Jews than New York City proper, making New York City the largest community of Jews in the world within a city proper). New York City's Jewish population is more than Chicago's, Philadelphia's, San Francisco's, and Washington, D.C.'s combined Jewish populations.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe number of Jews in New York City soared throughout the beginning of the 20th century and reached a peak of 2 million in the 1950s, when Jews constituted one-quarter of the city's population. New York City's Jewish population then began to decline because of low fertility rates and migration to suburbs and other states, particularly California and Florida. Though there were small Jewish communities throughout the United States by the 1920s, New York City was host to about 45% of the entire population of American Jews.[7] A new wave of Ashkenazi and Bukharian Jewish immigrants from the former Soviet Union began arriving in the 1980s and 1990s. Sephardic Jews, including Syrian Jews and other Jews of non-European origin, have also lived in New York City since the late 19th century. Jews of Eastern European descent ÿ namely, Russian, Lithuanian, and Polish ÿ immigrated during this mid-19th Century as well, in large numbers.[7] Many Jews, including the newer immigrants, have settled in Queens, south Brooklyn, and the Bronx, where at present most live in middle-class neighborhoods. The number of Jews is especially high in Brooklyn, where 561,000 residentsone out of four inhabitantsis Jewish.[8][9] As of  2012[update], there are 1.1 million Jews in New York City.[10] Borough Park, known for its large Orthodox Jewish population, had 27.9 births per 1,000 residents in 2015, making it the neighborhood with the city's highest birth rate.[11] However, the most rapidly growing community of American Orthodox Jews is located in Rockland County and the Hudson Valley of New York, including the communities of Monsey, Monroe, New Square, Kiryas Joel, and Ramapo.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2002, an estimated 972,000 Ashkenazic Jews lived in New York City and constituted about 12% of the city's population. New York City is also home to the world headquarters of the  Chabad, Bobover, and Satmar branches of Hasidism, and other traditional orthodox branches of Judaism. While three-quarters of New York Jews do not consider themselves religiously observant, the Orthodox community is rapidly growing due to the high birth rates of Hasidic Jews, while the numbers of Conservative and Reform Jews are declining.\\r\\n\\r\\nOrganizations such as The Agudath Israel of America, The Orthodox Union, Chabad and The Rohr Jewish Learning Institute have their headquarters in New York.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile the majority of Jews in New York City are white Jews of European descent, many Jewish New Yorkers identify as Asian, Black, Latino, or Multiracial. According to a 2011 community study conducted by the UJA-Federation of New York, 12% of Jewish households in the city are non-white or biracial.[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nMany Central Asian Jews, predominantly Bukharan Jews from Uzbekistan, have settled in the Queens neighborhoods of Rego Park, Forest Hills, Kew Gardens, and Briarwood. As of 2001, an estimated 50,000 Bukharan Jews resided in Queens.[14] Queens is also home to a large Georgian-American community of about 5,000, around 3,000 of whom are Georgian Jews. Queens has the third largest population of Georgian Jews in the world after Israel and Georgia. Forest Hills is home to the Congregation of Georgian Jews, the only Georgian-Jewish synagogue in the United States.[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first recorded Jewish settler in New York was Jacob Barsimson, who arrived in August 1654 on a passport from the Dutch West India Company.[16] A month later, a group of Jews to come to New York, then the colony New Amsterdam, as refugees from Recife, Brazil. Portugal had just re-conquered what is now known of the Brazilian State of Pernambuco from the Netherlands, and the Sephardi Jews there promptly fled. Most went to Amsterdam, but 23 headed for New Amsterdam instead. Governor Peter Stuyvesant was at first unwilling to accept them but succumbed to pressure from the Dutch West India Company  itself pressed by Jewish stockholders  to let them remain. Nevertheless, he imposed numerous restrictions and taxes on his Jewish subjects. Eventually, many of these Jews left.[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the British took the colony from the Dutch in 1664, the only Jewish name on the requisite oath of loyalty given to residents was Asser Levy. This is the only record of a Jewish presence at the time, until 1680 when some of Levy's relatives arrived from Amsterdam shortly before he died.[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first synagogue, the Sephardi Congregation Shearith Israel, was established in 1682, but it did not get its own building until 1730. Over time, the synagogue became dominant in Jewish life, organizing social services and mandating affiliation for all New York Jews.[17] Even though by 1720 the Ashkenazim outnumbered Sephardim,[18] the Sephardi customs were retained.[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nAn influx of German and Polish Jews followed the Napoleonic Wars in Europe. The increasing number of Ashkenazim led to the founding of the city's second synagogue, B'nai Jeshurun, in 1825. The late arrival of synagogues can be attributed to a lack of rabbis. Those who were interested in training as a Rabbi could not do so in America before this part of the century.[19]  Several other synagogues followed B'nai Jeshurun in rapid succession, including the first Polish one, Congregation Shaare Zedek, in 1839. In 1845, the first Reform temple, Congregation Emanu-El of New York opened.[20]  New York City would later become host to several seminaries of various denominations, where rabbis could be ordained, by the 1920s.[21]\\r\\n\\r\\nBy this time numerous communal aid societies were formed. These were usually quite small, and a single synagogue might be associated with more than a few such organizations. Two of the most important of these merged in 1859 to form the Hebrew Benevolent and Orphan Asylum Society[20] (Jewish orphanages were constructed on 77th Street near 3rd Avenue and another in Brooklyn). In 1852 the \\"Jews' Hospital\\" (renamed in 1871 Mount Sinai Hospital), which would one day be considered one of the best in the country,[22] was established.[20]\\r\\n\\r\\nJewish days schools began to appear in the 19th century across the United States, the first being the Polonies Talmud Torah in 1821.[23]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 36 years beginning in 1881 experienced the largest wave of immigration to the United States ever. Following the assassination of Alexander II of Russia, for which many blamed \\"the Jews,\\"[24] there was a vast increase in anti-Jewish pogroms there ÿ possibly with the support of the government ÿ and numerous anti-Jewish laws were passed. The result was that over 2 million Jews immigrated to America,[25]:364ÿ5 more than a million of them to New York.[26]:1076\\r\\n\\r\\nEastern European Jews and their culture flourished at this time.

Although any type of object can be collected into a set, set theory is applied most often to objects that are relevant to mathematics. The language of set theory can be used in the definitions of nearly all mathematical objects.\\r\\nThe modern study of set theory was initiated by Georg Cantor and Richard Dedekind in the 1870s. After the discovery of paradoxes in naive set theory, such as the Russell's paradox, numerous axiom systems were proposed in the early twentieth century, of which the ZermeloÿFraenkel axioms, with or without the axiom of choice, are the best-known.\\r\\nSet theory is commonly employed as a foundational system for mathematics, particularly in the form of ZermeloÿFraenkel set theory with the axiom of choice. Beyond its foundational role, set theory is a branch of mathematics in its own right, with an active research community. Contemporary research into set theory includes a diverse collection of topics, ranging from the structure of the real number line to the study of the consistency of large cardinals.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMathematical topics typically emerge and evolve through interactions among many researchers. Set theory, however, was founded by a single paper in 1874 by Georg Cantor: \\"On a Property of the Collection of All Real Algebraic Numbers\\".[1][2]\\r\\nSince the 5th century BC, beginning with Greek mathematician Zeno of Elea in the West and early Indian mathematicians in the East, mathematicians had struggled with the concept of infinity. Especially notable is the work of Bernard Bolzano in the first half of the 19th century.[3] Modern understanding of infinity began in 1867ÿ71, with Cantor's work on number theory. An 1872 meeting between Cantor and Richard Dedekind influenced Cantor's thinking and culminated in Cantor's 1874 paper.\\r\\nCantor's work initially polarized the mathematicians of his day. While Karl Weierstrass and Dedekind supported Cantor, Leopold Kronecker, now seen as a founder of mathematical constructivism, did not. Cantorian set theory eventually became widespread, due to the utility of Cantorian concepts, such as one-to-one correspondence among sets, his proof that there are more real numbers than integers, and the \\"infinity of infinities\\" (\\"Cantor's paradise\\") resulting from the power set operation. This utility of set theory led to the article \\"Mengenlehre\\" contributed in 1898 by Arthur Schoenflies to Klein's encyclopedia.\\r\\nThe next wave of excitement in set theory came around 1900, when it was discovered that some interpretations of Cantorian set theory gave rise to several contradictions, called antinomies or paradoxes. Bertrand Russell and Ernst Zermelo independently found the simplest and best known paradox, now called Russell's paradox: consider \\"the set of all sets that are not members of themselves\\", which leads to a contradiction since it must be a member of itself, and not a member of itself. In 1899 Cantor had himself posed the question \\"What is the cardinal number of the set of all sets?\\", and obtained a related paradox. Russell used his paradox as a theme in his 1903 review of continental mathematics in his The Principles of Mathematics.\\r\\nIn 1906 English readers gained the book Theory of Sets of Points[4] by husband and wife William Henry Young and Grace Chisholm Young, published by Cambridge University Press.\\r\\nThe momentum of set theory was such that debate on the paradoxes did not lead to its abandonment. The work of Zermelo in 1908 and Abraham Fraenkel in 1922 resulted in the set of axioms ZFC, which became the most commonly used set of axioms for set theory. The work of analysts such as Henri Lebesgue demonstrated the great mathematical utility of set theory, which has since become woven into the fabric of modern mathematics. Set theory is commonly used as a foundational system, although in some areas[which?] category theory is thought to be a preferred foundation.\\r\\nSet theory begins with a fundamental binary relation between an object o and a set A. If o is a member (or element) of A, the notation o j A is used. Since sets are objects, the membership relation can relate sets as well.\\r\\nA derived binary relation between two sets is the subset relation, also called set inclusion. If all the members of set A are also members of set B, then A is a subset of B, denoted A ? B. For example, {1, 2} is a subset of {1, 2, 3} , and so is {2} but {1, 4} is not. As insinuated from this definition, a set is a subset of itself. For cases where this possibility is unsuitable or would make sense to be rejected, the term proper subset is defined. A is called a proper subset of B if and only if A is a subset of B, but A is not equal to B. Note also that 1, 2, and 3 are members (elements) of the set {1, 2, 3} but are not subsets of it; and in turn, the subsets, such as {1}, are not members of the set {1, 2, 3}.\\r\\nJust as arithmetic features binary operations on numbers, set theory features binary operations on sets. The:\\r\\nSome basic sets of central importance are the empty set (the unique set containing no elements; occasionally called the null set though this name is ambiguous), the set of natural numbers, and the set of real numbers.\\r\\nA set is pure if all of its members are sets, all members of its members are sets, and so on. For example, the set {{}} containing only the empty set is a nonempty pure set. In modern set theory, it is common to restrict attention to the von Neumann universe of pure sets, and many systems of axiomatic set theory are designed to axiomatize the pure sets only. There are many technical advantages to this restriction, and little generality is lost, because essentially all mathematical concepts can be modeled by pure sets. Sets in the von Neumann universe are organized into a cumulative hierarchy, based on how deeply their members, members of members, etc. are nested. Each set in this hierarchy is assigned (by transfinite recursion) an ordinal number ϫ, known as its rank. The rank of a pure set X is defined to be the least upper bound of all successors of ranks of members of X. For example, the empty set is assigned rank 0, while the set {{}} containing only the empty set is assigned rank 1. For each ordinal ϫ, the set Vϫ is defined to consist of all pure sets with rank less than ϫ. The entire von Neumann universe is denoted?V.\\r\\nElementary set theory can be studied informally and intuitively, and so can be taught in primary schools using Venn diagrams. The intuitive approach tacitly assumes that a set may be formed from the class of all objects satisfying any particular defining condition. This assumption gives rise to paradoxes, the simplest and best known of which are Russell's paradox and the Burali-Forti paradox. Axiomatic set theory was originally devised to rid set theory of such paradoxes.[5]\\r\\nThe most widely studied systems of axiomatic set theory imply that all sets form a cumulative hierarchy. Such systems come in two flavors, those whose ontology consists of:\\r\\nThe above systems can be modified to allow urelements, objects that can be members of sets but that are not themselves sets and do not have any members.\\r\\nThe systems of New Foundations NFU (allowing urelements) and NF (lacking them) are not based on a cumulative hierarchy. NF and NFU include a \\"set of everything, \\" relative to which every set has a complement. In these systems urelements matter, because NF, but not NFU, produces sets for which the axiom of choice does not hold.\\r\\nSystems of constructive set theory, such as CST, CZF, and IZF, embed their set axioms in intuitionistic instead of classical logic. Yet other systems accept classical logic but feature a nonstandard membership relation. These include rough set theory and fuzzy set theory, in which the value of an atomic formula embodying the membership relation is not simply True or False. The Boolean-valued models of ZFC are a related subject.\\r\\nAn enrichment of ZFC called Internal Set Theory was proposed by Edward Nelson in 1977.\\r\\nMany mathematical concepts can be defined precisely using only set theoretic concepts. For example, mathematical structures as diverse as graphs, manifolds, rings, and vector spaces can all be defined as sets satisfying various (axiomatic) properties. Equivalence and order relations are ubiquitous in mathematics, and the theory of mathematical relations can be described in set theory.\\r\\nSet theory is also a promising foundational system for much of mathematics. Since the publication of the first volume of Principia Mathematica, it has been claimed that most or even all mathematical theorems can be derived using an aptly designed set of axioms for set theory, augmented with many definitions, using first or second order logic. For example, properties of the natural and real numbers can be derived within set theory, as each number system can be identified with a set of equivalence classes under a suitable equivalence relation whose field is some infinite set.\\r\\nSet theory as a foundation for mathematical analysis, topology, abstract algebra, and discrete mathematics is likewise uncontroversial; mathematicians accept that (in principle) theorems in these areas can be derived from the relevant definitions and the axioms of set theory. Few full derivations of complex mathematical theorems from set theory have been formally verified, however, because such formal derivations are often much longer than the natural language proofs mathematicians commonly present. One verification project, Metamath, includes human-written, computerverified derivations of more than 12,000 theorems starting from ZFC set theory, first order logic and propositional logic.\\r\\nSet theory is a major area of research in mathematics, with many interrelated subfields.\\r\\nCombinatorial set theory concerns extensions of finite combinatorics to infinite sets. This includes the study of cardinal arithmetic and the study of extensions of Ramsey's theorem such as the Erd?sÿRado theorem.\\r\\nDescriptive set theory is the study of subsets of the real line and, more generally, subsets of Polish spaces. It begins with the study of pointclasses in the Borel hierarchy and extends to the study of more complex hierarchies such as the projective hierarchy and the Wadge hierarchy. Many properties of Borel sets can be established in ZFC, but proving these properties hold for more complicated sets requires additional axioms related to determinacy and large cardinals.\\r\\nThe field of effective descriptive set theory is between set theory and recursion theory. It includes the study of lightface pointclasses, and is closely related to hyperarithmetical theory. In many cases, results of classical descriptive set theory have effective versions; in some cases, new results are obtained by proving the effective version first and then extending (\\"relativizing\\") it to make it more broadly applicable.\\r\\nA recent area of research concerns Borel equivalence relations and more complicated definable equivalence relations. This has important applications to the study of invariants in many fields of mathematics.\\r\\nIn set theory as Cantor defined and Zermelo and Fraenkel axiomatized, an object is either a member of a set or not. In fuzzy set theory this condition was relaxed by Lotfi A. Zadeh so an object has a degree of membership in a set, a number between 0 and 1. For example, the degree of membership of a person in the set of \\"tall people\\" is more flexible than a simple yes or no answer and can be a real number such as 0.75.\\r\\nAn inner model of ZermeloÿFraenkel set theory (ZF) is a transitive class that includes all the ordinals and satisfies all the axioms of ZF. The canonical example is the constructible universe L developed by G?del. One reason that the study of inner models is of interest is that it can be used to prove consistency results. For example, it can be shown that regardless of whether a model V of ZF satisfies the continuum hypothesis or the axiom of choice, the inner model L constructed inside the original model will satisfy both the generalized continuum hypothesis and the axiom of choice. Thus the assumption that ZF is consistent (has at least one model) implies that ZF together with these two principles is consistent.\\r\\nThe study of inner models is common in the study of determinacy and large cardinals, especially when considering axioms such as the axiom of determinacy that contradict the axiom of choice. Even if a fixed model of set theory satisfies the axiom of choice, it is possible for an inner model to fail to satisfy the axiom of choice. For example, the existence of sufficiently large cardinals implies that there is an inner model satisfying the axiom of determinacy (and thus not satisfying the axiom of choice).[6]\\r\\nA large cardinal is a cardinal number with an extra property. Many such properties are studied, including inaccessible cardinals, measurable cardinals, and many more. These properties typically imply the cardinal number must be very large, with the existence of a cardinal with the specified property unprovable in Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory.\\r\\nDeterminacy refers to the fact that, under appropriate assumptions, certain two-player games of perfect information are determined from the start in the sense that one player must have a winning strategy. The existence of these strategies has important consequences in descriptive set theory, as the assumption that a broader class of games is determined often implies that a broader class of sets will have a topological property. The axiom of determinacy (AD) is an important object of study; although incompatible with the axiom of choice, AD implies that all subsets of the real line are well behaved (in particular, measurable and with the perfect set property). AD can be used to prove that the Wadge degrees have an elegant structure.\\r\\nPaul Cohen invented the method of forcing while searching for a model of ZFC in which the continuum hypothesis fails, or a model of ZF in which the axiom of choice fails. Forcing adjoins to some given model of set theory additional sets in order to create a larger model with properties determined (i.e. \\"forced\\") by the construction and the original model. For example, Cohen's construction adjoins additional subsets of the natural numbers without changing any of the cardinal numbers of the original model. Forcing is also one of two methods for proving relative consistency by finitistic methods, the other method being Boolean-valued models.\\r\\nA cardinal invariant is a property of the real line measured by a cardinal number. For example, a well-studied invariant is the smallest cardinality of a collection of meagre sets of reals whose union is the entire real line. These are invariants in the sense that any two isomorphic models of set theory must give the same cardinal for each invariant. Many cardinal invariants have been studied, and the relationships between them are often complex and related to axioms of set theory.\\r\\nSet-theoretic topology studies questions of general topology that are set-theoretic in nature or that require advanced methods of set theory for their solution. Many of these theorems are independent of ZFC, requiring stronger axioms for their proof. A famous problem is the normal Moore space question, a question in general topology that was the subject of intense research. The answer to the normal Moore space question was eventually proved to be independent of ZFC.\\r\\nFrom set theory's inception, some mathematicians have objected to it as a foundation for mathematics. The most common objection to set theory, one Kronecker voiced in set theory's earliest years, starts from the constructivist view that mathematics is loosely related to computation. If this view is granted, then the treatment of infinite sets, both in naive and in axiomatic set theory, introduces into mathematics methods and objects that are not computable even in principle. The feasibility of constructivism as a substitute foundation for mathematics was greatly increased by Errett Bishop's influential book Foundations of Constructive Analysis.[7]\\r\\nA different objection put forth by Henri Poincar is that defining sets using the axiom schemas of specification and replacement, as well as the axiom of power set, introduces impredicativity, a type of circularity, into the definitions of mathematical objects. The scope of predicatively founded mathematics, while less than that of the commonly accepted Zermelo-Fraenkel theory, is much greater than that of constructive mathematics, to the point that Solomon Feferman has said that \\"all of scientifically applicable analysis can be developed [using predicative methods]\\".[8]\\r\\nLudwig Wittgenstein condemned set theory. He wrote that \\"set theory is wrong\\", since it builds on the \\"nonsense\\" of fictitious symbolism, has \\"pernicious idioms\\", and that it is nonsensical to talk about \\"all numbers\\".[9] Wittgenstein's views about the foundations of mathematics were later criticised by Georg Kreisel and Paul Bernays, and investigated by Crispin Wright, among others.\\r\\nCategory theorists have proposed topos theory as an alternative to traditional axiomatic set theory. Topos theory can interpret various alternatives to that theory, such as constructivism, finite set theory, and computable set theory.[10][11] Topoi also give a natural setting for forcing and discussions of the independence of choice from ZF, as well as providing the framework for pointless topology and Stone spaces.[12]\\r\\nAn active area of research is the univalent foundations and related to it homotopy type theory. Here, sets may be defined as certain kinds of types, with universal properties of sets arising from higher inductive types. Principles such as the axiom of choice and the law of the excluded middle appear in a spectrum of different forms, some of which can be proven, others which correspond to the classical notions; this allows for a detailed discussion of the effect of these axioms on mathematics.[13][14]","input":"Who developed the set theory approach to probability?"},{"output":"July 4, 1966","context":"The Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), 5 U.S.C.??552, is a federal freedom of information law that allows for the full or partial disclosure of previously unreleased information and documents controlled by the United States government. The Act defines agency records subject to disclosure, outlines mandatory disclosure procedures and grants nine exemptions to the statute.[1][2] This amendment was signed into law by President Lyndon B. Johnson, despite his misgivings,[3][4] on July 4, 1966, and went into effect the following year.[5]\\r\\nAs indicated by its long title, FOIA was actually extracted from its original home in Section 3 of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). Section 3 of the APA, as enacted in 1946, gave agencies broad discretion concerning the publication of governmental records. Following concerns that the provision had become more of a withholding than a disclosure mechanism, Congress amended the section in 1966 as a standalone act to implement \\"a general philosophy of full agency disclosure.\\" The amendment required agencies to publish their rules of procedure in the Federal Register, 5 U.S.C.  552(a)(1)(C), and to make available for public inspection and copying their opinions, statements of policy, interpretations, and staff manuals and instructions that are not published in the Federal Register,  552(a)(2). In addition,  522(a)(3) requires every agency, \\"upon any request for records which ... reasonably describes such records\\" to make such records \\"promptly available to any person.\\" If an agency improperly withholds any documents, the district court has jurisdiction to order their production. Unlike the review of other agency action that must be upheld if supported by substantial evidence and not arbitrary or capricious, FOIA expressly places the burden \\"on the agency to sustain its action,\\" and directs the district courts to \\"determine the matter de novo.\\"\\r\\nThe Federal Government's Freedom of Information Act should not be confused with the different and varying Freedom of Information Acts passed by the individual states. Many of those state acts may be similar but not identical to the federal act.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWith the ongoing stress on both constitutional and inherent rights of American citizens and the added assertion of government subservience to the individual, some, particularly representative John Moss, thought it was necessary for government information to be available to the public. This push built on existing principles and protocols of government administration already in place.\\r\\nOthers, thoughmost notably President Lyndon B. Johnsonbelieved that certain types of unclassified government information should nonetheless remain secret. Notwithstanding the White House's opposition, Congress expanded Section 3 of the Administrative Procedure Act as a standalone measure in 1966 to further standardize the publication of government records, consistent with the belief that the people have the \\"right to know\\" about them. The Privacy Act of 1974 was passed as a countervailing measure to ensure the security of government documents increasingly kept on private citizens.\\r\\nThe act explicitly applies only to executive branch government agencies. These agencies are under several mandates to comply with public solicitation of information. Along with making public and accessible all bureaucratic and technical procedures for applying for documents from that agency, agencies are also subject to penalties for hindering the process of a petition for information. If \\"agency personnel acted arbitrarily or capriciously with respect to the withholding, [a] Special Counsel shall promptly initiate a proceeding to determine whether disciplinary action is warranted against the officer or employee who was primarily responsible for the withholding.\\"[6] In this way, there is recourse for one seeking information to go to a federal court if suspicion of illegal tampering or delayed sending of records exists. However, there are nine exemptions, ranging from a withholding \\"specifically authorized under criteria established by an Executive order to be kept secret in the interest of national defense or foreign policy\\" and \\"trade secrets\\" to \\"clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.\\"[6] The nine current exemptions to the FOIA address issues of sensitivity and personal rights. They are (as listed in Title 5 of the United States Code, section 552):[7]\\r\\nThe Postal Reorganization Act of 1970 (at 39 U.S.C.??410(c)(2)) exempts the United States Postal Service (USPS) from disclosure of \\"information of a commercial nature, including trade secrets, whether or not obtained from a person outside the Postal Service, which under good business practice would not be publicly disclosed\\".[9]\\r\\nThe law came about because of the determination of Congressman John E. Moss of California. Moss was the chairman of the Government Information Subcommittee. It took Moss 12 years to get the Freedom of Information Act through Congress successfully.[10] Much of the desire for government transparency stemmed from the Department of Defense and Congressional committees evaluation of the nation's classification system in the late 1950s. They determined that the misuse of government classification of documents was causing insiders to leak documents that were marked \\"confidential.\\" The committee also determined that the lowest rung of the confidentiality ladder \\"confidential\\" should be removed. They deemed that \\"secret\\" and \\"top secret\\" covered National security adequately.[10] The Moss Committee took it upon itself to reform confidentiality policy and implement punishments for the overuse of classification by officials and departments.\\r\\nThe FOIA has been changed repeatedly by both the legislative and executive branches.\\r\\nThe Freedom of Information Act was initially introduced as the bill S. 1160 in the 89th Congress. When the two-page bill was signed into law it became Pub.L. 89ÿ487, 80?Stat.?250, enacted July?4, 1966, but had an effective date of one year after the date of enactment, or July 4, 1967. The law set up the structure of FOIA as we know it today.\\r\\nThat law was initially repealed. During the period between the enactment of the act and its effective date, Title 5 of the United States Code was enacted into positive law.[11] For reasons now unclear but which may have had to do with the way the enactment of Title 5 changed how the law being amended was supposed to be cited, the original Freedom of Information Act was replaced. A new act in Pub.L. 90ÿ23, 81?Stat.?54, enacted June?5, 1967 (originally H.R. 5357 in the 90th Congress), repealed the original and put in its place a substantively identical law. This statute was signed on June 5, 1967, and had the same effective date as the original statute: July 4, 1967.\\r\\nFollowing the Watergate scandal, President Gerald R. Ford wanted to sign FOIA-strengthening amendments in the Privacy Act of 1974, but White House Chief of Staff Donald Rumsfeld and deputy Dick Cheney were concerned about leaks.[12] Assistant Attorney General for the Office of Legal Counsel Antonin Scalia advised the bill was unconstitutional and even telephoned the CIA asking them to lobby a particular White House staffer.[12] President Ford was persuaded to veto the bill on October 17, 1974, according to documents declassified in 2004.[12] However, on November 21, the lame-duck Congress overrode President Ford's veto, giving the United States the core Freedom of Information Act still in effect today, with judicial review of executive secrecy claims.[12][13]\\r\\nScalia remained highly critical of the 1974 amendments, writing years later that \\"It is the Taj Mahal of the Doctrine of Unanticipated Consequences, the Sistine Chapel of Cost-Benefit Analysis Ignored.\\"[14] Scalia particularly disliked the availability of judicial review, decrying that if \\"an agency denies a freedom of information request, shazam!the full force of the Third Branch of the government is summoned to the wronged partys assistance.\\"[14]\\r\\nThese amendments that these FOIA regulate government control of documents which concern a citizen. It gives one \\"(1) the right to see records about [one]self, subject to the Privacy Act's exemptions, (2) the right to amend that record if it is inaccurate, irrelevant, untimely, or incomplete, and (3) the right to sue the government for violations of the statute including permitting others to see [ones] records unless specifically permitted by the Act.\\"[15] In conjunction with the FOIA, the PA is used to further the rights of an individual gaining access to information held by the government. The Justice Department's Office of Information and Privacy and federal district courts are the two channels of appeal available to seekers of information.[16]\\r\\nIn 1976, as part of the Government in the Sunshine Act, Exemption 3 of the FOIA was amended so that several exemptions were specified:\\r\\nBetween 1982 and 1995, President Reagan's Executive Order 12356 allowed federal agencies to withhold enormous amounts of information under Exemption 1(relating to national security information), claiming it would better protect the country and strengthen national security.[17]\\r\\nThe outcry from the effect that the Reagan Order had on FOIA requests was a factor in leading President Clinton to dramatically alter the criteria in 1995.[18]\\r\\nThe FOIA amendments were a small part of the bipartisan Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986. Congress amended FOIA to address the fees charged by different categories of requesters and the scope of access to law enforcement and national security records. The amendments are not referenced in the congressional reports on the Act, so the floor statements provide an indication of Congressional intent.[19]\\r\\nBetween 1995 and 1999, President Clinton issued executive directives (and amendments to the directives) that allowed the release of previously classified national security documents more than 25 years old and of historical interest, as part of the FOIA.[20] This release of information allowed many previously publicly unknown details about the Cold War and other historical events to be discussed openly.[18]\\r\\nThe Electronic Freedom of Information Act Amendments of 1996 (E-FOIA) stated that all agencies are required by statute to make certain types of records, created by the agency on or after November 1, 1996, available electronically. Agencies must also provide electronic reading rooms for citizens to use to have access to records. Given the large volume of records and limited resources, the amendment also extended the agencies' required response time to FOIA requests. Formerly, the response time was ten days and the amendment extended it to twenty business days.[7]\\r\\nExecutive Order 13233, drafted by Alberto R. Gonzales and issued by President George W. Bush on November 1, 2001, restricted access to the records of former presidents.\\r\\nThis order was revoked on January 21, 2009, as part of President Barack Obama's Executive Order 13489.[21] Public access to presidential records was restored to the original extent of five years (12 for some records) outlined in the Presidential Records Act.[22]\\r\\nIn 2002, Congress passed the Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2003, Pub.L. 107ÿ306.[23] Within this omnibus legislation were amendments to the FOIA (pertaining mainly to intelligence agencies) entitled \\"Prohibition on Compliance with Requests for Information Submitted by Foreign Governments\\":[24]\\r\\nSection 552(a)(3) of title 5, United States Code, is amended\\r\\n(1) in subparagraph (A) by inserting \\"and except as provided in subparagraph (E)\\", after \\"of this subsection\\"; and\\r\\n(2) by adding at the end the following:\\r\\nIn effect, this new language precluded any covered U.S. intelligence agency from disclosing records in response to FOIA requests made by foreign governments or international governmental organizations. By its terms, it prohibits disclosure in response to requests made by such non-U.S. governmental entities either directly or through a \\"representative\\".[25] This means that for any FOIA request that by its nature appears as if it might have been made by or on behalf of a non-U.S. governmental entity, a covered agency may inquire into the particular circumstances of the requester in order to properly implement this new FOIA provision.[23]\\r\\nThe agencies affected by this amendment are those that are part of, or contain \\"an element of\\", the \\"intelligence community\\". As defined in the National Security Act of 1947 (as amended), they consist of the CIA, the National Security Agency, the Defense Intelligence Agency, the National Imagery and Mapping Agency, the National Reconnaissance Office (and certain other reconnaissance offices within the Department of Defense), the intelligence elements of the Army, the Navy, the Air Force, and the Marine Corps, the FBI, the Department of the Treasury, the Department of Energy, and the Coast Guard, the Department of Homeland Security, the Bureau of Intelligence and Research in the Department of State, and \\"such other elements of any other department or agency as may be designated by the President, or designated jointly by the Director of Central Intelligence and the head of the department or agency concerned, as an element of the intelligence community\\".[23][26]\\r\\nPresident Bush signed the Openness Promotes Effectiveness in our National Government Act of 2007, Pub.L. 110ÿ175, on December 31, 2007. This law, also known as the \\"OPEN Government Act of 2007\\", amended the federal FOIA statute in several ways.[27] According to a White House press release, it does so by:\\r\\nChanges include the following:\\r\\nOn December 29, 2009, President Barack Obama issued Executive Order 13526, which allows the government to classify certain specific types of information relevant to national security after it has been requested.[30] That is, a request for information that meets the criteria for availability under FOIA can still be denied if the government determines that the information should have been classified, and unavailable. It also sets a timeline for automatic declassification of old information that is not specifically identified as requiring continued secrecy.\\r\\nThe DoddÿFrank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, signed into law in July 2010, included provisions in section 929I[31][32] that shielded the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) from requests under the Freedom of Information Act. The provisions were initially motivated out of concern that the FOIA would hinder SEC investigations that involved trade secrets of financial companies, including \\"watch lists\\" they gathered about other companies, trading records of investment managers, and \\"trading algorithms\\" used by investment firms.[33]\\r\\nIn September 2010, the 111th Congress passed an act repealing those provisions. The act was introduced in the Senate on August 5, 2010 as S.3717[34] and given the name \\"A bill to amend the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Investment Company Act of 1940, and the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 to provide for certain disclosures under section 552 of title 5, United States Code, (commonly referred to as the Freedom of Information Act), and for other purposes.\\"\\r\\nA major issue in released documentation is government \\"redaction\\" of certain passages deemed applicable to the Exemption section of the FOIA. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) officers in charge of responding to FOIA requests \\"so heavily redacted the released records as to preclude needed research.\\"[16] This has also brought into question just how one can verify that they have been given complete records in response to a request.\\r\\nThis trend of unwillingness to release records was especially evident in the process of making public the FBI files on J. Edgar Hoover. Of the 164 files and about eighteen thousand pages collected by the FBI, two-thirds were withheld from Athan G. Theoharis and plaintiff, most notably one entire folder entitled the \\"White House Security Survey.\\" Despite finding out that the Truman Library had an accessible file which documented all the reports of this folder, the FBI and Office of Information and Privacy put forth \\"stony resistance\\" to the FOIA appeal process. (Iÿpg. 27) Some[who?] argue that it was not even this sixteen year series of three appeals to the Justice Department which gained a further opening of the files, but rather the case of Department of Justice v. Landano which spurred on a break in stolid FBI opposition.\\r\\nA murder trial decided in 1993, Department of Justice v. Landano, 508 U.S. 165 (1993), involved what was alleged to be a felony murder committed during a group burglary by defendant Landano. Justice Sandra Day O'Connor wrote the unanimous opinion. \\"In an effort to support his claim in subsequent state court proceedings that the prosecution violated Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 (1963), by withholding material exculpatory evidence, he filed Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests with the FBI for information it had compiled in connection with the murder investigation.\\"[35]\\r\\nIn defense, the FBI put forth a claim that the redacted sections of the documents requested were withheld in accordance with FOIA regulations protecting the identity of informants who gave information regarding case details. However, O'Connor ruled that those who supplied information had no need to remain anonymous in the court setting. \\"To the extent that the Government's proof may compromise legitimate interests, the Government still can attempt to meet its burden with in camera affidavits.\\" The court thus remanded the case to the Circuit Courts and rejected the FBI's claim of confidentiality as being a valid reason to withhold information.\\r\\n\\"While most individual sources may expect confidentiality, the Government offers no explanation, other than administrative ease, why that expectation always should be presumed.\\"[35] Thus, when Theoharis and company were in the middle of fighting in court to obtain J. Edgar Hoover files, they may well have benefited from Landano and also Janet Reno's assertions of the government's need for \\"greater openness\\" and \\"discretionary releases\\" in 1993.\\r\\nIn the case of Scott Armstrong v. Executive Office of the President, et al., the White House used the PROFS[16] computer communications software. With encryption designed for secure messaging, PROFS notes concerning the IranÿContra affair (arms-for-hostages) under the Reagan Administration were insulated. However, they were also backed up and transferred to paper memos. The National Security Council, on the eve of President George H.W. Bush's inauguration, planned to destroy these records. The National Security Archive, Armstrong's association for the preservation of government historical documents, obtained an injunction in Federal District Court against the head, John Fawcett, of the National Archives and Records Administration and the National Security Council's purging of PROFS records. A Temporary Restraining Order was approved by Senior U.S. District Court Judge Barrington D. Parker. Suit was filed at District Court under Judge Richey, who upheld the injunction of PROFS records.[36]\\r\\nRichey gave a further injunction to prevent a purging of the George H.W. Bush's administration's records as well. On counts of leaving the White House clean for the new Clinton Administration, the Bush group appealed but was denied its request. Finally, the Clinton Administration appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals, stating that the National Security Council was not truly an agency but a group of aides to the President and thus not subject to FOIA regulations. Under the Presidential Records Act, \\"FOIA requests for NSC [could] not be filed until five years after the president ha[d] left office ... or twelve years if the records [were] classified.\\"[37] The Clinton administration won, and the National Security Archive was not granted a writ of certiorari by the Supreme Court on these grounds. According to Scott Armstrong, taking into account labor and material costs, the three presidential administrations spent almost $9.3 million on contesting the National Security Archive FOIA requests for PROFS e-mail records.[38]\\r\\nThe AP uncovered several federal agencies where staff regularly use fictitious identities and secret or unlisted email accounts to conduct government business. Their use stymied FOIA requests.[39][40][41][42] In some cases, the government demanded enormous (>$1 million) fees for records that appeals show should be available for minimal cost.[39][41][43][44]\\r\\nThe Center for Effective Government analyzed 15 federal agencies which receive the most FOIA requests in-depth. It concluded, that federal agencies are struggling to implement public disclosure rules.\\r\\nIn the latest analysis published in 2015 (using 2012 and 2013 data, the most recent years available) ten of the 15 did not earn satisfactory overall grades, scoring less than 70 out of a possible 100 points. Eight of the ten earned Ds, including the Department of Homeland Security (69 percent), Department of Transportation (68 percent), United States Department of the Treasury (Treasury) (68 percent), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) (67 percent), the United States Department of Labor (63 percent), the United States Department of Veterans Affairs (64 percent), the United States Department of Defense (61 percent), the Securities and Exchange Commission (61 percent). The Department of Health and Human Services and the Department of State earned an F. The State Department's score (37 percent) was dismal due to its extremely low processing score of 23 percent, which was completely out of line with any other agencys performance. Scores of five agencies, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, the Department of Health and Human Services, the SEC, the DOJ, and the EPA, even decreased marginally.[45]","input":"When was the freedom of information act passed?"},{"output":"Potato","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Columbian exchange, also known as the Columbian interchange, was the widespread transfer of plants, animals, culture, human populations, technology, and ideas between the Americas and the Old World in the 15th and 16th centuries, related to European colonization and trade following Christopher Columbus's 1492 voyage.[1] Invasive species, including communicable diseases, were a byproduct of the Exchange. The changes in agriculture significantly altered and changed global populations. The most significant immediate impact of the Columbian exchange was the cultural exchanges and the transfer of people between continents.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe new contact between the global population circulated a wide variety of crops and livestock, which supported increases in population in both hemispheres, although diseases initially caused precipitous declines in the numbers of indigenous peoples of the Americas. Traders returned to Europe with maize, potatoes, and tomatoes, which became very important crops in Europe by the 18th century.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe term was first used in 1972 by American historian Alfred W. Crosby in his environmental history book The Columbian Exchange.[2] It was rapidly adopted by other historians and journalists and has become widely known.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1972 Alfred W. Crosby, an American historian at the University of Texas at Austin, published The Columbian Exchange.[2] This book covers the environmental impact of Columbus' landing in the new world.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe term has become popular among historians and journalists, such as Charles C. Mann, whose book 1493 expands and updates Crosby's original research.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nSeveral plants native to the Americas have spread around the world, including Potato, maize, tomato, and tobacco.[5] Before 1500, potatoes were not grown outside of South America. By the 1840s, Ireland was so dependent on the potato that the proximate cause of the Great Famine was a potato disease.[6] Potatoes eventually became an important staple of the diet in much of Europe, contributing to about 25% of the population growth in Afro-Eurasia between 1700 and 1900.[7] Many European rulers, including Frederick the Great of Prussia and Catherine the Great of Russia, encouraged the cultivation of the potato.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nMaize and cassava, introduced by the Portuguese from South America in the 16th century,[9] have replaced sorghum and millet as Africa's most important food crops.[10] 16th-century Spanish colonizers introduced new staple crops to Asia from the Americas, including maize and sweet potatoes, and thereby contributed to population growth in Asia.[11] On a larger scale, the coming of potatoes and maize to the old world \\"resulted in caloric and nutritional improvements over previously existing staples\\" throughout the Eurasian landmass[12] as they created more varied and abundant food production.[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nTomatoes, which came to Europe from the New World via Spain, were initially prized in Italy mainly for their ornamental value (see below). From the 19th century tomato sauces became typical of Neapolitan cuisine and, ultimately, Italian cuisine in general.[14] Coffee (introduced in the Americas circa 1720) from Africa and the Middle East and sugarcane (introduced from South Asia) from the Spanish West Indies became the main export commodity crops of extensive Latin American plantations. Introduced to India by the Portuguese, chili and potatoes from South America have become an integral part of Indian cuisine.[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore the Columbian exchange, there were no oranges in Florida, no bananas in Ecuador, no paprika in Hungary, no potatoes in Ireland, no coffee in Colombia, no pineapples in Hawaii, no Par rubber trees in Asia, no chili peppers in Thailand, no tomatoes in Italy, and no chocolate in Switzerland.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt took three centuries after their introduction in Europe for tomatoes to become widely accepted. Of all the New World plants introduced to Italy, only the potato took as long as the tomato to gain acceptance. In large part this was due to 16th-century physicians believing that this native Mexican fruit was poisonous and the generator of \\"melancholic humours.\\" In 1544, Pietro Andrea Mattioli, a Tuscan physician and botanist, suggested that tomatoes might be edible, but no record exists of anyone consuming them at this time. On October 31, 1548 the tomato was given its first name anywhere in Europe when a house steward of Cosimo I de' Medici, Duke of Florence, wrote to the De' Medici's private secretary that the basket of pomi d'oro \\"had arrived safely.\\" At this time, the label pomi d'oro was also used to refer to figs, melons, and citrus fruits in treatises by scientists.[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the early years, tomatoes were mainly grown as ornamentals in Italy. For example, the Florentine aristocrat Giovan Vettorio Soderini wrote how they \\"were to be sought only for their beauty\\" and were grown only in gardens or flower beds. Tomatoes were grown in elite town and country gardens in the fifty years or so following their arrival in Europe and were only occasionally depicted in works of art. However, in 1592 the head gardener at the botanical garden of Aranjuez near Madrid, under the patronage of Philip II of Spain wrote, \\"it is said [tomatoes] are good for sauces.\\" Besides this account, tomatoes remained exotic plants grown for ornamental purposes, but rarely for culinary use. The combination of pasta with tomato sauce was developed only in the late nineteenth century. Today around 32,000 acres (12,950?ha) of tomatoes are cultivated in Italy, although there are still areas where relatively few tomatoes are grown and consumed.[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nInitially, at least, the Columbian exchange of animals largely went through one route, from Europe to the New World, as the Eurasian regions had domesticated many more animals. Horses, donkeys, mules, pigs, cattle, sheep, goats, chickens, large dogs, cats and bees were rapidly adopted by native peoples for transport, food, and other uses.[17] One of the first European exports to the Americas, the horse, changed the lives of many Native American tribes. The mountain tribes shifted to a nomadic lifestyle, as opposed to agriculture, based on hunting bison on horseback and moved down to the Great Plains. The existing Plains tribes expanded their territories with horses, and the animals were considered so valuable that horse herds became a measure of wealth.[18]\\r\\n\\r\\nStill, the effects of the introduction of European livestock on the environments and peoples of the New World were not always positive. In the Caribbean, the proliferation of European animals had large effects on native fauna and undergrowth and damaged conucos, plots managed by indigenous peoples for subsistence.[19]\\r\\n\\r\\nEuropean exploration of tropical areas was aided by the New World discovery of quinine, the first effective treatment for malaria. Europeans suffered from this disease, but some indigenous populations had developed at least partial resistance to it. In Africa, resistance to malaria has been associated with other genetic changes among sub-Saharan Africans and their descendants, which can cause sickle-cell disease.[1]:164\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore regular communication had been established between the two hemispheres, the varieties of domesticated animals and infectious diseases that jumped to humans, such as smallpox, were substantially more numerous in the Old World than in the New due to more extensive long-distance trade networks. Many had migrated west across Eurasia with animals or people, or were brought by traders from Asia, so diseases of two continents were suffered by all occupants. While Europeans and Asians were affected by the Eurasian diseases, their endemic status in those continents over centuries resulted in many people gaining acquired immunity.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy contrast, \\"Old World\\" diseases had a devastating effect when introduced to Native American populations via European carriers, as the people in the Americas had no natural immunity to the new diseases. Measles caused many deaths. The smallpox epidemics are believed to have caused the largest death tolls among Native Americans, surpassing any wars[20] and far exceeding the comparative loss of life in Europe due to the Black Death.[1]:164 It is estimated that upwards of 80ÿ95 percent of the Native American population died in these epidemics within the first 100ÿ150 years following 1492. Many regions in the Americas lost 100%.[1]:165 The beginning of demographic collapse on the North American continent has typically been attributed to the spread of a well-documented smallpox epidemic from Hispaniola in December 1518.[19] At that point in time, approximately only 10,000 indigenous people were still alive in Hispaniola.[19]\\r\\n\\r\\nSimilarly, yellow fever is thought to have been brought to the Americas from Africa via the Atlantic slave trade. Because it was endemic in Africa, many people there had acquired immunity. Europeans suffered higher rates of death than did African-descended persons when exposed to yellow fever in Africa and the Americas, where numerous epidemics swept the colonies beginning in the 17th century and continuing into the late 19th century. The disease caused widespread fatalities in the Caribbean during the heyday of slave-based sugar plantation.[19] The replacement of native forests by sugar plantations and factories facilitated its spread in the tropical area by reducing the number of potential natural mosquito predators.[19] The means of yellow fever transmission was unknown until 1881, when Carlos Finlay suggested that the disease was transmitted through mosquitoes, now known to be female mosquitoes of the species Aedes aegypti.[19]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe history of syphilis has been well-studied, but the exact origin of the disease is unknown and remains a subject of debate.[21] There are two primary hypotheses: one proposes that syphilis was carried to Europe from the Americas by the crew of Christopher Columbus in the early 1490s, while the other proposes that syphilis previously existed in Europe but went unrecognized.[22] These are referred to as the \\"Columbian\\" and \\"pre-Columbian\\" hypotheses.[22] The first written descriptions of the disease in the Old World came in 1493.[23] The first large outbreak of syphilis in Europe occurred in 1494/1495 in Naples, Italy, among the army of Charles VIII, during their invasion of Naples.[22][24][25][26]\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of the influences related to the migration of people were cultural exchanges. For example, in the article \\"The Myth of Early Globalization: The Atlantic Economy, 1500ÿ1800\\" Pieter Emmer makes the point that \\"from 1500 onward, a 'clash of cultures' had begun in the Atlantic\\".[27] This clash of culture transferred European values to indigenous cultures. For example, the emergence of private property in regions where there were little to no rights to lands, the concepts of monogamy and the nuclear family, the role of women and children in the family system, and the \\"superiority of free labor\\".[28] An example of this type of cultural exchange occurred during the 1500s in North America. When these early European colonizers first entered North America, they encountered fence-less lands which indicated to them that this land was unimproved. For these Europeans, they were seeking economic opportunities, therefore, land and resources were important for the success of the mission. When these colonizers entered North America they encountered a fully established culture of people called the Powhatan. The Powhatan farmers in Virginia scattered their farm plots within larger cleared areas. These larger cleared areas were a communal place for naturally growing and useful plants. As the Europeans viewed fences as \\"hallmarks of civilization\\" they set about transforming \\"the land into something more suitable for themselves\\".[29] In implementing their practices, the Europeans enslaved, murdered, and exploited indigenous populations. Furthermore, in cases of enslaved peoples (and in particular, enslaved Africans) the Europeans simultaneously implemented their value system while at the same time justifying enslaving people through a philosophy which reduced the enslaved people to property. Thus, the slave traders and some of the plantation owners used the concept of family to exploit and control the enslaved people. In other subtle ways, which had a large impact the cultural exchanges involved sharing practices and traditions. An example of this can be found in the tobacco industry.\\r\\n\\r\\nTobacco was one of the luxury goods which was spread as a direct result of the Columbian exchange. As is discussed in regard to the trans-Atlantic slave trade, the tobacco trade increased demand for free labor and spread tobacco worldwide. In discussing the widespread uses of tobacco, the Spanish physician Nicolas Monardes (1493ÿ1588) noted that \\"The black people that have gone from these parts to the Indies, have taken up the same manner and use of tobacco that the Indians have\\".[30] As the European colonizers and enslaved Africans traveled the globe and came into contact with indigenous peoples, they took with them the cultural practices related to tobacco, and spread them to additional regions. Therefore, demand for tobacco grew in the course of the cultural exchanges and increased contacts among peoples.\\r\\n\\r\\nPlants that arrived by land, sea, or air in the times before 1492 are called archaeophytes, and plants introduced to Europe after those times are called neophytes. Invasive species of plants and pathogens also were introduced by chance, including such weeds as tumbleweeds (Salsola spp.) and wild oats (Avena fatua). Some plants introduced intentionally, such as the kudzu vine introduced in 1894 from Japan to the United States to help control soil erosion, have since been found to be invasive pests in the new environment.\\r\\n\\r\\nFungi have also been transported, such as the one responsible for Dutch elm disease, killing American elms in North American forests and cities, where many had been planted as street trees. Some of the invasive species have become serious ecosystem and economic problems after establishing in the New World environments.[31][32] A beneficial, although probably unintentional, introduction is Saccharomyces eubayanus, the yeast responsible for lager beer now thought to have originated in Patagonia.[33]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn addition to these, many animals were introduced to new habitats on the other side of the world either accidentally or incidentally. These include such animals as brown rats, earthworms (apparently absent from parts of the pre-Columbian New World), and zebra mussels, which arrived on ships.[34] Escaped and feral populations of non-indigenous animals have thrived in both the Old and New Worlds, often negatively impacting or displacing native species. In the New World, populations of feral European cats, pigs, horses and cattle are common, and the Burmese python and green iguana are considered problematic in Florida. In the Old World, Eastern gray squirrel have been particularly successful in colonising Great Britain and populations of raccoons can now be found in some regions of Germany, the Caucasus and Japan. Fur farm escapees such as coypu and American mink have extensive populations.","input":"What was brought to europe from the americas?"},{"output":"September 1, 1986","context":"The alcohol laws of Wisconsin consist of both statewide statutes and local ordinances governing the sale of alcohol.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Wisconsin became a state, settlers from the eastern United States (known as Yankees) took issue with the consumption of alcohol by German immigrants on Sunday, as well as the prevalence of alcoholism. The Wisconsin legislature passed a law in 1849 that made liquor sellers liable for the costs incurred by local governments in supporting alcoholics. Ten years later, the state prohibited liquor sales on Sundays.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1872, alcohol regulation reached new heights in the state with the passage of the Graham Law. This legislation prohibited drunkenness and the sale of alcohol to minors, and required all liquor sellers to post a $2,000 bond (more than $30,000 in 2007 U.S. dollars).[2] German-Americans fought the new law in the courts and at the ballot box. Although they lost challenges in the courts, they were able to elect a legislature friendlier to alcohol consumption. In 1874, the new lawmakers passed less restrictive laws that lowered the bond to $500, allowed Sunday liquor sales, and created certain safe havens for liquor sellers to escape liability for alcoholics.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nAlcohol consumption was banned in Wisconsin during Prohibition (1920-1933).  But even before Prohibition ended, Wisconsin created work-arounds. In 1926, voters approved a referendum allowing the manufacture of beer, if not its consumption. The state repealed its law enforcing Prohibition in 1929.[3] Wisconsin Senator John J. Blaine sponsored the Act that later became the Twenty-first Amendment to the United States Constitution, ending Prohibition.[4] The state was the second to ratify the amendment on April 25, 1933.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nState law prohibits retail sale of liquor and wine between 9:00 p.m. and 6:00 a.m., and beer between midnight and 6:00 a.m.[6] State law allows local municipalities to further restrict retail sales of alcohol, or ban the issuance of retail liquor licenses altogether.[7] Local ordinances often prohibit retail beer sale after 9:00 p.m.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt least two municipalities in Wisconsin prohibited the retail sale of alcohol until recently: the city of Sparta,[8][9] and the village of Ephraim.[10][11] In the April 1, 2014 Wisconsin spring election, voters in Sparta narrowly passed a referendum to allow the sale of beer and wine in groceries and convenience stores. The ban on the sale of liquor within the city remains in effect.[12] In the April 5, 2016, voters in Ephraim passed a referendum to allow the sale of beer and wine in restaurants and businesses.[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nState law requires that bars be closed between 2:00 a.m. and 6:00 a.m. Monday through Friday and between 2:30 a.m. and 6:00 a.m. on Saturday and Sunday. Exceptions are made on New Year's Eve, when no closing is required, and for changes in Daylight Saving Time. State law does not permit municipalities to further restrict when bars must be closed.[6] Municipalities may elect, however, to prohibit the issuance of liquor licenses, making the municipality effectively dry.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe drinking age in Wisconsin is 21. Those under the legal drinking age may be served, possess, or consume alcohol if they are with a parent, legal guardian, or spouse who is of legal drinking age.[14] Those age 18-20 may also be served, possess or consumer alcohol if they are with a parent, legal guardian, or spouse who is of legal drinking age. [15]\\r\\nThose age 18 to 20 may also possess (but not consume) alcohol as part of their employment.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 1983 Wisconsin Act 74, effective July 1, 1984, created a drinking age of 19.

Historians have learned about the eruption from the eyewitness account of Pliny the Younger, a Roman administrator and poet.[1] The event is the namesake for the Vesuvian type of volcanic eruptions.\\r\\n\\r\\nMount Vesuvius violently spewed forth a deadly cloud of super-heated tephra and gases to a height of 33?km (21?mi), ejecting molten rock, pulverized pumice and hot ash at a massive rate of 1.5 million tons per second, ultimately releasing 100,000 times the thermal energy of the Hiroshima-Nagasaki bombings.[2] Several Roman settlements were obliterated and buried underneath massive pyroclastic surges and ashfall deposits, the best known being Pompeii and Herculaneum.[1][2]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe total inhabitants of both cities were 16,000ÿ20,000; the remains of over 1,500 people have been found at Pompeii and Herculaneum, but the overall death toll is still unclear.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe AD 79 eruption was preceded by a powerful earthquake seventeen years before on February 5, AD 62, which caused widespread destruction around the Bay of Naples, and particularly to Pompeii.[3] Some of the damage had still not been repaired when the volcano erupted.[4] The deaths of 600 sheep from \\"tainted air\\" in the vicinity of Pompeii, reported by Seneca the Younger, leads volcanologist Haraldur Sigurdsson to compare them to similar deaths of sheep in Iceland from pools of volcanic carbon dioxide and to speculate that the earthquake of AD 62 was related to new activity by Mount Vesuvius.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother smaller earthquake took place in AD 64; it was recorded by Suetonius in his biography of Nero,[6] and by Tacitus in Annales because it took place while Nero was in Naples performing for the first time in a public theatre.[7] Suetonius recorded that the emperor continued singing through the earthquake until he had finished his song, while Tacitus wrote that the theatre collapsed shortly after being evacuated.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Romans grew accustomed to minor earth tremors in the region; the writer Pliny the Younger wrote that they \\"were not particularly alarming because they are frequent in Campania\\". Small earthquakes started taking place on 20 August 79,[4] becoming more frequent over the next four days, but the warnings were not recognized.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nReconstructions of the eruption and its effects vary considerably in the details but have the same overall features. The eruption lasted for two days. The morning of the first day, August 22, was perceived as normal by the only eyewitness to leave a surviving document, Pliny the Younger, who at that point was staying at Misenum, on the other side of the Bay of Naples about 30 kilometres (19?mi) from the volcano, which may have prevented him from noticing the early signs of the eruption. He was not to have any opportunity, during the next two days, to talk to people who had witnessed the eruption from Pompeii or Herculaneum (indeed he never mentions Pompeii in his letter), so he would not have noticed early, smaller fissures and releases of ash and smoke on the mountain, if such had occurred earlier in the morning. Around 1:00 P.M., Mount Vesuvius violently erupted, spewing up a high-altitude column from which ash and pumice began to fall, blanketing the area. Rescues and escapes occurred during this time. At some time in the night or early the next day, August 23, pyroclastic flows in the close vicinity of the volcano began. Lights seen on the mountain were interpreted as fires. People as far away as Misenum fled for their lives. The flows were rapid-moving, dense, and very hot, knocking down wholly or partly all structures in their path, incinerating or suffocating all population remaining there and altering the landscape, including the coastline. These were accompanied by additional light tremors and a mild tsunami in the Bay of Naples. By evening of the second day, the eruption was over, leaving only haze in the atmosphere through which the sun shone weakly.\\r\\n\\r\\nPliny the Younger wrote an account of the eruption:\\r\\n\\r\\nBroad sheets of flame were lighting up many parts of Vesuvius; their light and brightness were the more vivid for the darkness of the night... it was daylight now elsewhere in the world, but there the darkness was darker and thicker than any night.[9]\\r\\nAccording to a stratigraphic study (a study of the layers of ash) by Sigurdsson, Cashdollar, and Sparks, published in 1982, and now a standard reference, the eruption of Vesuvius of AD 79 unfolded in two phases:[10] a Vesuvian eruption that lasted eighteen to twenty hours and produced a fall of pumice and ashes southward of the volcano that accumulated up to depths of 2.8?m (9.2?ft) at Pompeii, followed by pyroclastic surges or nues ardentes in the second Pelan phase that reached as far as Misenum but was concentrated to the west and northwest. Two pyroclastic surges engulfed Pompeii, burning and asphyxiating any living beings who had remained behind. Herculaneum and Oplontis received the brunt of the surges and were buried in fine pyroclastic deposits, pulverized pumice and lava fragments.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn an article published in 2002, Sigurdsson and Casey elaborate on the stratigraphic evidence based on excavations and surveys up until then. In this interpretation, the quasi-initial explosion (not quite initial) produced a column of ash and pumice ranging between 15?km (9.3?mi) and 30?km (19?mi) high, which, due to northwest winds, rained on Pompeii to the southeast but not on Herculaneum upwind. The eruption is viewed as primarily phreatomagmatic; that is, the chief energy supporting the blast column came from the escape of steam generated by the magma, created from seawater seeping over time into the deep-seated faults of the region, that came into interaction with magma and heat.\\r\\n\\r\\nSubsequently, the cloud collapsed as the gases densified and lost their capability to support their solid contents, releasing it as a pyroclastic surge, which first reached Herculaneum, not Pompeii. Additional explosions reinstituted the column. The eruption alternated between Vesuvian and Pelan six times. Surges 4 and 5 are believed by the authors to have destroyed and buried Pompeii.[11] Surges are identified in the deposits by dune and cross-bedding formations, which are not produced by fallout.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe authors suggest that the first ash falls are to be interpreted as early-morning, low-volume explosions not seen from Misenum, causing Rectina to send her messenger on a ride of several hours around the Bay of Naples, then passable, providing an answer to the paradox of how the messenger might miraculously appear at Pliny's villa so shortly after a distant eruption that would have prevented him.\\r\\n\\r\\nA 2006 study by Zanella, Gurioli, Pareschi, and Lanza used the magnetic characteristics of over 200?samples of lithic, roof-tile, and plaster fragments collected from pyroclastic deposits in and around Pompeii to estimate the equilibrium temperatures of the deposits.[12] The deposits were placed by pyroclastic density currents (PDCs) resulting from the collapses of the Plinian column. The authors argue that fragments over 2ÿ5?cm (0.8ÿ2?in) were not in the current long enough to acquire its temperature, which would have been much higher, and therefore they distinguish between the depositional temperatures, which they estimated, and the emplacement temperatures, which in some cases based on the cooling characteristics of some types and fragment sizes of rocks they believed they also could estimate. Final figures are considered to be those of the rocks in the current just before deposition.[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nAll crustal rock contains some iron or iron compounds, rendering it ferromagnetic, as do Roman roof tiles and plaster. These materials may acquire a residual field from a number of sources. When individual molecules, which are magnetic dipoles, are held in alignment by being bound in a crystalline structure, the small fields reinforce each other to form the rock's residual field.[14] Heating the material adds internal energy to it. At the Curie temperature, the vibration of the molecules is sufficient to disrupt the alignment; the material loses its residual magnetism and assumes whatever magnetic field might be applied to it only for the duration of the application. The authors term this phenomenon unblocking. Residual magnetism is considered to \\"block out\\" non-residual fields.\\r\\n\\r\\nA rock is a mixture of minerals, each with its own Curie temperature; the authors therefore looked for a spectrum of temperatures rather than a single temperature. In the ideal sample, the PDC did not raise the temperature of the fragment beyond the highest blocking temperature. Some constituent material retained the magnetism imposed by the Earth's field when the item was formed. The temperature was raised above the lowest blocking temperature and therefore some minerals on recooling acquired the magnetism of the Earth as it was in AD 79. The overall field of the sample was the vector sum of the fields of the high-blocking material and the low-blocking material.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis type of sample made possible estimation of the low unblocking temperature. Using special equipment that measured field direction and strength at various temperatures, the experimenters raised the temperature of the sample in increments of 40?C (70?F) from 100?C (210?F) until it reached the low unblocking temperature.[15] Deprived of one of its components, the overall field changed direction. A plot of direction at each increment identified the increment at which the sample's resultant magnetism had formed.[16] That was considered to be the equilibrium temperature of the deposit. Considering the data for all the deposits of the surge arrived at a surge deposit estimate. The authors discovered that the city, Pompeii, was a relatively cool spot within a much hotter field, which they attributed to interaction of the surge with the \\"fabric\\" of the city.[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe investigators reconstruct the sequence of volcanic events as follows. On the first day of the eruption a fall of white pumice containing clastic fragments of up to 3 centimetres (1?in) fell for several hours.[18] It heated the roof tiles to 120ÿ140?C (250ÿ280?F).[19] This period would have been the last opportunity to escape. Subsequently, a second column deposited a grey pumice with clastics up to 10?cm (4?in), temperature unsampled, but presumed to be higher, for 18 hours. These two falls were the Plinian phase. The collapse of the edges of these clouds generated the first dilute PDCs, which must have been devastating to Herculaneum, but did not enter Pompeii.\\r\\n\\r\\nEarly in the morning of the second day the grey cloud began to collapse to a greater degree. Two major surges struck and destroyed Pompeii. Herculaneum and all its population no longer existed. The emplacement temperature range of the first surge was 180ÿ220?C (360ÿ430?F), minimum temperatures; of the second, 220ÿ260?C (430ÿ500?F). The depositional temperature of the first was 140ÿ300?C (280ÿ570?F). Upstream and downstream of the flow it was 300ÿ360?C (570ÿ680?F).[20]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe variable temperature of the first surge was due to interaction with the buildings. Any population remaining in structural refuges could not have escaped, as the city was surrounded by gases of incinerating temperatures. The lowest temperatures were in rooms under collapsed roofs. These were as low as 100?C (210?F), the boiling point of water.[21] The authors suggest that elements of the bottom of the flow were decoupled from the main flow by topographic irregularities and were made cooler by the introduction of ambient turbulent air. In the second surge the irregularities were gone and the city was as hot as the surrounding environment.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the last surge, which was very dilute, one meter more of deposits fell over the region.[22]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe only surviving eyewitness account of the event consists of two letters by Pliny the Younger, who was 17 at the time of the eruption,[23] to the historian, Tacitus.[24] Observing the first volcanic activity from Misenum across the Bay of Naples from the volcano, approximately 35 kilometres (22?mi) away, the elder Pliny launched a rescue fleet and went himself to the rescue of a personal friend. His nephew declined to join the party. One of the nephew's letters relates what he could discover from witnesses of his uncle's experiences.[25] In a second letter the younger Pliny details his own observations after the departure of his uncle.[26]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe two men saw an extraordinarily dense cloud rising rapidly above the mountain:[25]\\r\\nI cannot give you a more exact description of its appearance than by comparing to a pine tree; for it shot up to a great height in the form of a tall trunk, which spread out at the top as though into branches. [...] Occasionally it was brighter, occasionally darker and spotted, as it was either more or less filled with earth and cinders.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese events and a request by messenger for an evacuation by sea prompted the elder Pliny to order rescue operations in which he sailed away to participate. His nephew attempted to resume a normal life, continuing to study, and bathing, but that night a tremor awoke him and his mother, prompting them to abandon the house for the courtyard. At another tremor near dawn the population abandoned the village. After still a third \\"the sea seemed to roll back upon itself, and to be driven from its banks\\", which is evidence for a tsunami. There is, however, no evidence of extensive damage from wave action.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe early light was obscured by a black cloud through which shone flashes, which Pliny likens to sheet lightning, but more extensive. The cloud obscured Point Misenum near at hand and the island of Capraia (Capri) across the bay. Fearing for their lives the population began to call to each other and move back from the coast along the road. Pliny's mother requested him to abandon her and save his own life, as she was too corpulent and aged to go further, but seizing her hand he led her away as best he could. A rain of ash fell. Pliny found it necessary to shake off the ash periodically to avoid being buried. Later that same day the ash stopped falling and the sun shone weakly through the cloud, encouraging Pliny and his mother to return to their home and wait for news of Pliny the Elder. The letter compares the ash to a blanket of snow. Evidently the earthquake and tsunami damage at that location were not severe enough to prevent continued use of the home.\\r\\n\\r\\nPliny's uncle Pliny the Elder was in command of the Roman fleet at Misenum, and had meanwhile decided to investigate the phenomenon at close hand in a light vessel. As the ship was preparing to leave the area, a messenger came from his friend Rectina (wife of Tascius) living on the coast near the foot of the volcano, explaining that her party could only get away by sea and asking for rescue.[27] Pliny ordered the immediate launching of the fleet galleys to the evacuation of the coast. He continued in his light ship to the rescue of Rectina's party.[27]\\r\\n\\r\\nHe set off across the bay but in the shallows on the other side encountered thick showers of hot cinders, lumps of pumice, and pieces of rock. Advised by the helmsman to turn back he stated \\"Fortune favors the brave\\" and ordered him to continue on to Stabiae (about 4.5?km or 2.8?mi from Pompeii), where Pomponianus was.[27] Pomponianus had already loaded a ship with possessions and was preparing to leave, but the same onshore wind that brought Pliny's ship to the location had prevented anyone from leaving.[27]\\r\\n\\r\\nPliny and his party saw flames coming from several parts of the mountain, which Pliny and his friends attributed to burning villages. After staying overnight, the party was driven from the building by an accumulation of material which threatened to block all egress.[27] They woke Pliny, who had been napping and emitting loud snoring. They elected to take to the fields with pillows tied to their heads to protect them from rockfall. They approached the beach again but the wind had not changed. Pliny sat down on a sail that had been spread for him and could not rise even with assistance when his friends departed, escaping ultimately by land.[28] Very likely, he had collapsed and died, which is the most popular explanation of why his friends abandoned him, although Suetonius offers an alternative story of his ordering a slave to kill him to avoid the pain of incineration. How the slave would have escaped to tell the tale remains a mystery. There is no mention of such an event in his nephew's letters.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the first letter to Tacitus his nephew suggested that his death was due to the reaction of his weak lungs to a cloud of poisonous, sulphurous gas that wafted over the group.[27] However, Stabiae was 16?km (9.9?mi) from the vent (roughly where the modern town of Castellammare di Stabia is situated) and his companions were apparently unaffected by the fumes, and so it is more likely that the corpulent Pliny died from some other cause, such as a stroke or heart attack.[29] An asthmatic attack is also not out of the question. His body was found with no apparent injuries on the next day, after dispersal of the plume.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlong with Pliny the Elder, the only other notable casualties of the eruption to be known by name were Agrippa (a son of the Jewish princess Drusilla and the procurator Antonius Felix) and his wife.[30]\\r\\n\\r\\nBy 2003 around 1,044?casts made from impressions of bodies in the ash deposits had been recovered in and around Pompeii, with the scattered bones of another 100.[31] The remains of about 332 bodies have been found at Herculaneum (300 in arched vaults discovered in 1980).[32] What percentage these numbers are of the total dead or the percentage of the dead to the total number at risk remain completely unknown.\\r\\n\\r\\nThirty-eight percent of the 1,044 were found in the ash fall deposits, the majority inside buildings. These are thought to have been killed mainly by roof collapses, with the smaller number of victims found outside buildings probably killed by falling roof slates or by larger rocks thrown out by the volcano. This differs from modern experience, since over the last four hundred years only around 4% of victims have been killed by ash falls during explosive eruptions. The remaining 62% of remains found at Pompeii were in the pyroclastic surge deposits,[31] and thus were probably killed by them. It was initially believed that due to the state of the bodies found at Pompeii and the outline of clothes on the bodies it was unlikely that high temperatures were a significant cause. But in 2010, studies indicated that during the fourth pyroclastic surge ÿ the first surge to reach Pompeii ÿ temperatures reached 300?C (572?F). Volcanologist Giuseppe Mastrolorenzo, who led the study, noted that \\"(It was) enough to kill hundreds of people in a fraction of a second\\". In reference as to why the bodies were frozen in suspended action, \\"The contorted postures are not the effects of a long agony, but of the cadaveric spasm, a consequence of heat shock on corpses.\\"[33]\\r\\n\\r\\nHerculaneum, which was much closer to the crater, was saved from tephra falls by the wind direction, but was buried under 23 metres (75?ft) of material deposited by pyroclastic surges. It is likely that most, or all, of the known victims in this town were killed by the surges, particularly given evidence of high temperatures found on the skeletons of the victims found in the arched vaults, and the existence of carbonised wood in many of the buildings.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese people were all caught on the former seashore by the first surge and died of thermal shock but not of carbonization, although some were partly carbonized by later and hotter surges. The arched vaults were most likely boathouses, as the crossbeams in the overhead were probably for the suspension of boats. No boats have been found, indicating they may have been used for the earlier escape of some of the population. The rest were concentrated in the chambers at a density of as high as 3 persons per square meter. As only 85 metres (279?ft) of the coast have been excavated, the casualties waiting to be excavated may well be as high as the thousands.[34]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe year of the eruption is pinned to AD 79 by references in contemporary Roman writers, a number of them apart from Pliny the Younger, and has never been seriously questioned. It is determined by the well-known events of the reign of Titus. Vespasian died that year. When Titus visited Pompeii to give orders for the relief of the displaced population, he was the sole ruler. In the year after the eruption, AD 80, he faced another disaster, a great fire at Rome.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe time of year is stated once in one historical document, the first letter of Pliny the Younger to Tacitus,[25] where it appears as \\"nonum kal.

This seems to be an abbreviation of a standard date, to be interpreted as \\"the ninth day before the Kalends of September\\", which in the Julian calendar, in general use by then, would have been eight days before September 1, that is August 24 (the Romans counted September 1 as one of the nine).\\r\\n\\r\\nAugust 24 is not necessarily the date given by Pliny. It represents an editorial collusion to use the manuscript text of Pliny's letters in the Medicean Laurentian Library, which also appears in the edition printed by Aldus Manutius (1508) and in all recensions since then, even though the numerous other Pliny manuscripts, as well as the works of other authors, offer many alternative dates.[35]","input":"When did the volcanic eruption in pompeii occur?"},{"output":"in the royal chapel of the Cathedral of Saint John the Baptist in Turin","context":"","input":"What church is the shroud of turin in?"},{"output":"cut from the short loin","context":"The T-bone and porterhouse are steaks of beef cut from the short loin (called the sirloin in Commonwealth countries and Ireland). Both steaks include a \\"T\\"-shaped bone with meat on each side. Porterhouse steaks are cut from the rear end of the short loin and thus include more tenderloin steak, along with (on the other side of the bone) a large strip steak. T-bone steaks are cut closer to the front, and contain a smaller section of tenderloin. The smaller portion of a T-bone, when sold alone, is known as a filet mignon, especially if it's cut from the small forward end of the tenderloin.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is little agreement among experts on how large the tenderloin must be to differentiate a T-bone steak from porterhouse. The U.S. Department of Agriculture's Institutional Meat Purchase Specifications state that the tenderloin of a porterhouse must be at least 1.25 inches (32?mm) thick at its widest, while that of a T-bone must be at least 0.5 inches (13?mm). However, steaks with a large tenderloin are often called a \\"T-bone\\" in restaurants and steakhouses despite technically being porterhouse.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nOwing to their large size and the fact that they contain meat from two of the most prized cuts of beef (the short loin and the tenderloin), T-bone steaks are generally considered one of the highest quality steaks, and prices at steakhouses are accordingly high. Porterhouse steaks are even more highly valued owing to their larger tenderloin.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the United States, the T-bone has the meat-cutting classification IMPS 1174; the porterhouse is IMPS 1173.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn British usage, followed in Commonwealth countries, \\"porterhouse\\" often means a UK sirloin steak (i.e. US strip steak) on the bone, i.e. without the tenderloin on the other side of T-bone.[2] However, nowadays some British on-line butchers also offer American style porterhouse steaks.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn New Zealand and Australia, a Porterhouse is striploin steak off the bone.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe origin of the term \\"porterhouse\\" is contentious, with several cities and establishments claiming to have coined it. The Oxford English Dictionary traces the etymology from proprietor Martin Morrison serving large T-bones in his Pearl Street (Manhattan) \\"Porter House\\" around 1814, while noting the lack of contemporary evidence to support the tale.[4] This origin story gained traction in the late 19th century, but others contend a Cambridge, Massachusetts hotel and restaurant proprietor named Zachariah B. Porter lent his name to the cut of beef, and others claim the steak takes its name from various 19th Century U.S. hotels or restaurants called Porter House, such as the Porter House Hotel in Flowery Branch, Georgia.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nTo cut a T-bone from butchered cattle, a lumbar vertebra is sawn in half through the vertebral column. The downward prong of the 'T' is a transverse process of the vertebra, and the flesh surrounding it is the spinal muscles. The small semicircle at the top of the 'T' is half of the vertebral foramen.\\r\\n\\r\\nT-bone and porterhouse steaks are suited to fast, dry heat cooking methods, such as grilling or broiling. Since they contain a small amount of collagen relative to other cuts, longer cooking times are not necessary to tenderize the meat.[citation needed] The bone also conducts heat within the meat so that it cooks more evenly and prevents meat drying out and shrinking during cooking.[6][7] The meat near the bone will cook more slowly than the rest of the steak, and the tenderloin will tend to reach the desired temperature before the strip.[8][9]\\r\\n\\r\\nBistecca alla fiorentina, or 'beefsteak Florentine style', consists of a T-bone traditionally sourced from either the Chianina or Maremmana breeds of cattle. A favorite of Tuscan cuisine, the steak is grilled over a wood or charcoal fire, seasoned with salt, sometimes with black pepper, and olive oil, applied immediately after the meat is retired from the heat. Thickly cut and very large, \\"Bistecca\\" are often shared between two or more persons, and traditionally served very rare, sometimes garnished with lemon wedges, if not accompanied by red wine, and accompanied by Tuscan beans as a side dish.[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe same cut of meat, but from a calf, is used for Cotoletta alla milanese, which consists of 1.5?cm-thick cuts which are battered in breadcrumbs and fried in clarified butter with salt.","input":"What cut of meat is the porterhouse steak?"},{"output":"eight","context":"LeBron Raymone James (/l??br?n/; born December 30, 1984) is an American professional basketball player for the Cleveland Cavaliers of the National Basketball Association (NBA). James has won three NBA championships, four NBA Most Valuable Player Awards, three NBA Finals MVP Awards, two Olympic gold medals, an NBA scoring title, and the NBA Rookie of the Year Award. He has also been selected to 13 NBA All-Star teams, 13 All-NBA teams, and six All-Defensive teams, is the Cavaliers' all-time leading scorer, and is the NBA career playoff scoring leader.\\r\\nJames played high school basketball at St. VincentÿSt. Mary High School in his hometown of Akron, Ohio, where he was highly promoted in the national media as a future NBA superstar. After graduating, he was selected by his home team, the Cleveland Cavaliers, as the first overall pick of the 2003 NBA draft. James led Cleveland to the franchise's first Finals appearance in 2007, ultimately losing to the San Antonio Spurs. In 2010, he left the Cavaliers for the Miami Heat in a highly publicized ESPN special titled The Decision. James spent four seasons with the Heat, reaching the Finals all four years and winning back-to-back championships in 2012 and 2013. In 2013, he led Miami on a 27-game winning streak, the third longest in league history. Following his final season with the Heat, James opted out of his contract and returned to the Cavaliers. He led the Cavaliers to three consecutive Finals series between 2015 and 2017, winning his third championship in 2016 to end Cleveland's 52-year professional sports title drought.\\r\\nOff the court, James has accumulated considerable wealth and fame from numerous endorsement contracts. His public life has been the subject of much scrutiny, and he has been ranked as one of America's most influential and popular athletes. He has been featured in books, documentaries, and television commercials. He also hosted the ESPY Awards, Saturday Night Live, and appeared in the 2015 film Trainwreck.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nJames was born on December 30, 1984 in Akron, Ohio to a 16-year-old mother, Gloria Marie James, who raised James on her own.[1][2]:22 When James was growing up, life was often a struggle for the family, as they moved from apartment to apartment in the seedier neighborhoods of Akron while Gloria struggled to find steady work.[3] Realizing that he would be better off in a more stable family environment, Gloria allowed James to move in with the family of Frank Walker, a local youth football coach, who introduced James to basketball when he was nine years old.[2]:23\\r\\nAs a youth, James played Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) basketball for the Northeast Ohio Shooting Stars.[3] The team enjoyed success on a local and national level, led by James and his friends Sian Cotton, Dru Joyce III, and Willie McGee.[2]:24 The players were inseparable and dubbed themselves the \\"Fab Four\\", promising each other that they would attend high school together.[2]:27 In a move that stirred local controversy, they chose to attend St. VincentÿSt. Mary High School, a predominately white private Catholic school.[4][5]\\r\\nAs a freshman, James averaged 21 points and 6 rebounds per game for the St. Vincent-St. Mary varsity basketball team.[6] The Fighting Irish finished the year 27ÿ0, winning the Division III state title.[6] As a sophomore, James averaged 25.2 points and 7.2 rebounds with 5.8 assists and 3.8 steals per game.[7] For some home games during the season, St. Vincent-St. Mary played at the University of Akron's 5,492-seat Rhodes Arena to satisfy ticket demand from alumni, fans, and college and NBA scouts who wanted to see James play.[2]:51[8] The Fighting Irish finished the season 26ÿ1 and repeated as state champions.[6] For his outstanding play, James was named Ohio Mr. Basketball and selected to the USA Today All-USA First Team, becoming the first sophomore to do either.[9]\\r\\nPrior to the start of James' junior year, he appeared in SLAM Magazine and was lauded as possibly \\"the best high school basketball player in America right now\\" by writer Ryan Jones.[10] During the season, he appeared on the cover of Sports Illustrated, becoming the first high school basketball underclassman to do so.[2]:104 With averages of 29 points, 8.3 rebounds, 5.7 assists, and 3.3 steals per game,[6] he was again named Ohio Mr. Basketball and selected to the USA Today All-USA First Team,[6] and became the first junior to be named boys' basketball Gatorade National Player of the Year.[2]:117 St. Vincent-St. Mary finished the year with a 23ÿ4 record, ending their season with a loss in the Division II championship game.[2]:114 Following the loss, James seriously considered declaring for the 2002 NBA draft, unsuccessfully petitioning for an adjustment to the NBA's draft eligibility rules that required prospective players to have at least graduated from high school.[11] During this time, he used marijuana to help cope with the stress that resulted from the constant media attention he was receiving.[12][13][14]\\r\\nThroughout his senior year, James and the Fighting Irish traveled around the country to play a number of nationally ranked teams, including a game against Oak Hill Academy that was nationally televised on ESPN2.[2]:142 Time Warner Cable, looking to capitalize on James' popularity, offered St. Vincent-St. Mary's games to subscribers on a pay-per-view basis throughout the season.[2]:143 For the year, James averaged 31.6 points, 9.6 rebounds, 4.6 assists, and 3.4 steals per game,[9] was named Ohio Mr. Basketball and selected to the USA Today All-USA First Team for an unprecedented third consecutive year,[2]:178[6] and was named Gatorade National Player of the Year for the second consecutive year.[6] He participated in three year-end high school basketball all-star gamesthe EA Sports Roundball Classic, the Jordan Capital Classic, and the McDonald's All-American Gamelosing his National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) eligibility and making it official that he would enter the 2003 NBA draft.[15] Many basketball analysts, scouts, and writers have noted that James left high school as one of the best and most hyped prospects of all-time.[2]:142[16][17][18][19]\\r\\nAlso during his senior year, James was the centerpiece of several controversies. For his 18th birthday, he skirted state amateur bylaws by accepting a Hummer H2 from his mother, who had secured a loan for the vehicle by utilizing LeBron's future earning power as a professional athlete.[20] This prompted an investigation by the Ohio High School Athletic Association (OHSAA) because its guidelines stated that no amateur may accept any gift valued over $100 as a reward for athletic performance. James was cleared of any wrongdoing because he had accepted the gift from a family member and not from an agent or any outside source.[15] Later in the season, James accepted two throwback jerseys worth $845 from an urban clothing store in exchange for posing for pictures, officially violating OHSAA rules and resulting in him being stripped of his high school sports eligibility.[15] James appealed the ruling and his penalty was eventually dropped to a two-game suspension, allowing him to play the remainder of the year. The Irish were also forced to forfeit one of their wins, their only official loss that season.[21] In his first game back after the suspension, James scored a career-high 52 points.[22]\\r\\nJames played wide receiver for St. Vincent-St. Mary's football team in high school and was recruited by some Division I programs, including Notre Dame.[2]:51[23] As a sophomore, he was named first team all-state, and as a junior, he led the Fighting Irish to the state semifinals.[7] He decided to stop playing high school football before his senior year, after he broke his wrist during an AAU basketball game.[24] Many sports analysts, football critics, high school coaches, and former and current players have speculated on whether he could have played in the National Football League.[2]:91[25][26][27][28]\\r\\nJames was selected by his home team, the Cleveland Cavaliers, as the first overall pick of the 2003 NBA draft.[29] In his first regular season game, he scored 25 points against the Sacramento Kings, setting an NBA record for most points scored by a prep-to-pro player in his debut performance.[30] At the conclusion of the season, he was named the NBA Rookie of the Year, finishing with averages of 20.9 points, 5.5 rebounds, and 5.9 assists per game.[31] He became the first Cavalier to receive the honor and just the third player in NBA history to average at least 20 points, 5 rebounds, and 5 assists per game as a rookie.[32] The Cavaliers finished the season 35ÿ47, failing to make the playoffs despite an 18-game improvement over the previous year.[33]\\r\\nJames earned his first NBA All-Star Game selection in 2004ÿ05, contributing 13 points, 8 rebounds, and 6 assists in a winning effort for the Eastern Conference.[34] Around the league, teams took note of his rapid development, with Denver Nuggets coach George Karl telling Sports Illustrated, \\"It's weird talking about a 20-year-old kid being a great player, but he is a great player ... He's the exception to almost every rule.\\"[35] On March 20, James scored 56 points against the Toronto Raptors, setting Cleveland's new single-game points record.[36] With final averages of 27.2 points, 7.4 rebounds, 7.2 assists, and 2.2 steals per game, he was named to his first All-NBA Team.[7] Despite a 30ÿ20 record to start the year,[36] the Cavaliers again failed to make the playoffs, finishing the season at 42ÿ40.[37]\\r\\nAt the 2006 All-Star Game, James led the East to victory with 29 points and was named the NBA All-Star Game Most Valuable Player.[38] Behind final season averages of 31.4 points, 7 rebounds, and 6.6 assists per game,[39] he finished second in overall NBA Most Valuable Player Award voting to Steve Nash.[40] Under James' leadership, the Cavaliers qualified for the playoffs for the first time since 1998.[41] In his postseason debut, he recorded a triple-double in a winning effort versus the Washington Wizards.[42] In Game 3 of the series, he made the first game-winning shot of his career, making another in Game 5.[43] Cleveland would go on to defeat the Wizards before being ousted by the Detroit Pistons in the second round.[44][45]\\r\\nIn 2006ÿ07, James' averages declined to 27.3 points, 6.7 rebounds, 6 assists, and 1.6 steals per game.[7] Some analysts attributed the fall to a regression in his passing skills and shot selection, stemming from a lack of effort and focus.[48] The Cavaliers finished the season with 50 wins for the second consecutive year and entered the playoffs as the East's second seed.[49][50] In Game 5 of the Conference Finals, James notched 48 points with 9 rebounds and 7 assists, scoring 29 of Cleveland's last 30 points, including the game-winning layup with two seconds left, against the Pistons.[51] After the game, play-by-play announcer Marv Albert called the performance \\"one of the greatest moments in postseason history\\" and color commentator Steve Kerr described it as \\"Jordan-esque\\".[52] In 2012, ESPN ranked the performance the fourth greatest in modern NBA playoff history.[53] The Cavaliers went on to win Game 6 and claim their first-ever Eastern Conference championship,[54] earning them a matchup with the San Antonio Spurs in the NBA Finals.[55] During the championship round, James struggled, averaging 22 points, 7 rebounds, and 6.8 assists per game on just 35.6 percent shooting,[56] and Cleveland was eliminated in a sweep.[55]\\r\\nIn February of the 2007ÿ08 season, James was named All-Star Game MVP for the second time behind a 27-point, 8-rebound, and 9-assist performance.[57][58] On March 21, he moved past Brad Daugherty as the Cavaliers' all-time leading scorer in a game against the Raptors, doing so in over 100 less games than Daugherty.[59] His 30 points per game were also the highest in the league, representing his first scoring title.[60] Despite his individual accomplishments, Cleveland's record fell from the year before to 45ÿ37.[61] Seeded fourth in the East entering the playoffs, the Cavaliers defeated the Wizards in the first round for the third consecutive season before being eliminated in seven games by the eventual-champion Boston Celtics in the next round.[62] During the decisive seventh game in Boston, James scored 45 points and Paul Pierce scored 41 in a game the Associated Press described as a \\"shootout\\".[63]\\r\\nAt the conclusion of the 2008ÿ09 season, James finished second in NBA Defensive Player of the Year voting and made his first NBA All-Defensive Team, posting 23 chase-down blocks and a career-high 93 total blocks.[65][66] He also became only the fourth postmerger player to lead his team in points, rebounds, assists, steals, and blocks in a single season.[67] Behind his play and the acquisition of All-Star guard Mo Williams, Cleveland went a franchise record 66ÿ16 and fell one game short of matching the best home record in league history.[68] With averages of 28.4 points, 7.6 rebounds, 7.2 assists, 1.7 steals, and 1.2 blocks per game, James became the first Cavalier to win the MVP Award.[69]\\r\\nIn the playoffs, Cleveland swept the Pistons and the Atlanta Hawks to earn a matchup with the Orlando Magic in the Conference Finals.[70] In Game 1 of the series, James scored 49 points on 66 percent shooting in a losing effort for the Cavaliers.[53] In Game 2, he hit a game-winner to tie the series at 1ÿ1.[71] Cleveland would lose the series in six games, and following the loss in Game 6, James immediately left the floor without shaking hands with his opponents, an act many media members viewed as unsportsmanlike.[72][73] For the series, he averaged 38.5 points, 8.3 rebounds, and 8 assists per game,[74] finishing the postseason with a career playoff-high 35.3 points per game.[39]\\r\\nMidway through the 2009ÿ10 season, the Cavaliers' guards experienced significant injuries, forcing James into a temporary point guard role.[75] With increased minutes as the team's primary ball handler, he averaged 8.6 assists in addition to 29.7 points, 7.3 rebounds, 1.6 steals, and 1 block per game on 50 percent shooting, culminating in a second consecutive MVP Award.[76] Cleveland also finished the season with the league's best record for the second straight year.[77] In the playoffs, the Cavaliers defeated the Bulls in the first round but lost to the Celtics in the second round.[78] James was heavily criticized for not playing well in Game 5 of the series, shooting only 20 percent on 14 shots and scoring 15 points.[79] At the conclusion of the game, he walked off the court to a smattering of boos from Cleveland's home crowd, the team having just suffered their worst home playoff loss ever.[80] The Cavaliers were officially eliminated from the postseason in Game 6, with James recording 27 points, 19 rebounds, 10 assists, and nine turnovers in a losing effort.[78]\\r\\nJames became an unrestricted free agent at 12:01?am EDT on July 1, 2010.[82] During his free agency, he was contacted by several teams, including the Bulls, Los Angeles Clippers, Miami Heat, New York Knicks, New Jersey Nets, and Cavaliers.[83] On July 8, he announced that he would sign with the Heat on a live ESPN special titled The Decision.[84] The telecast, broadcast from the Boys & Girls Club of Greenwich, Connecticut, raised $2.5 million for the charity and an additional $3.5 million from advertisement revenue that was donated to other charities.[85][86] The day before the special, fellow free agents Chris Bosh and Dwyane Wade had also announced that they would sign with Miami;[87][88] reports later arose that the trio had discussed their 2010 free agencies together in 2006.[89] James decided to join with Bosh and Wade in part so that he could shoulder less of the load offensively, thinking that his improved teammates would give him a better chance of winning a championship than had he stayed in Cleveland.[90][91] Heat president Pat Riley played a major role in selling James on the idea of playing with Bosh and Wade.[92] Relieved of the burden of scoring, James thought he could be the first player to average a triple-double in a season since Oscar Robertson.[90]\\r\\nJames drew intense criticism from sports analysts, executives, fans, and current and former players for leaving the Cavaliers. The Decision itself was also scrutinized and viewed as unnecessary. Many thought the prolonged wait for James' choice was unprofessional as not even the teams courting him were aware of his decision until moments before the show.[93] Upon learning that James would not be returning to Cleveland, Cavaliers owner Dan Gilbert published an open letter to fans in which he aggressively denounced James' actions.[94] Some angry fans of the team recorded videos of themselves burning his jersey.[95] Former NBA players, including Michael Jordan and Magic Johnson, were also critical of James, condemning him for joining with Bosh and Wade in Miami and not trying to win a championship as \\"the guy\\".[96][97][98] James drew further criticism in a September interview with CNN when he claimed that race might have been a factor in the fallout from The Decision.[99][100] As a result of his actions during the 2010 free agency period, he quickly gained a reputation as one of America's most disliked athletes, a radical change from years prior.[101][102] The phrase \\"taking my talents to South Beach\\" became a punch line for critics.[103][104]\\r\\nImmediately following The Decision, James claimed that there was nothing he would change about the handling of his free agency despite all the criticism.[105] During the 2010ÿ11 season, he expressed some regret, admitting, \\"[I] probably would do it a little bit different ... But I'm happy with my decision.\\"[106] Before the 2011ÿ12 season, he relented, \\"... if the shoe was on the other foot and I was a fan, and I was very passionate about one player, and he decided to leave, I would be upset too about the way he handled it.\\"[102]\\r\\nJames officially became a member of the Heat on July 10, 2010.[107] With the move, he became only the third reigning MVP to change teams and the first since Moses Malone in 1982.[108] That evening, the Heat threw a welcome party for their new \\"big three\\" at the American Airlines Arena, an event that took on a rock concert atmosphere.[109] During the gathering, James predicted a dynasty for the Heat and alluded to multiple championships.[110][111] Outside of Miami, the spectacle was not well-received, furthering the negative public perception of James.[112][113]\\r\\nThroughout the 2010ÿ11 season, James embraced the villain role that was bestowed upon him by the media, playing with an angry demeanor and less joy than in years past; he later admitted that he regretted this approach.[114] On December 2, he faced the Cavaliers in Cleveland for the first time since departing as a free agent, scoring 38 points and leading Miami to a win while being booed every time he touched the ball.[115][116] He finished the season with averages of 26.7 points, 7.5 rebounds, and 7 assists per game on 51 percent shooting.[39] Entering the playoffs as the East's second seed, Miami advanced to the Finals before stumbling against the Dallas Mavericks, losing in six games despite holding a 2ÿ1 series lead going into Game 4.[117] James received the brunt of the criticism for the loss, averaging only three points in fourth quarters in the series.[118] His Finals scoring average of 17.8 points per game signified an 8.9-point drop from the regular season, the largest point drop-off in league history.[119]\\r\\nHumbled by the Heat's loss to the Mavericks, James spent the offseason working with Hakeem Olajuwon on his post game.[120] His work with Olajuwon paid off, fueling what Grantland's Kirk Goldsberry called \\"one of the greatest and most important transformations in recent sports history\\".[121] Behind James' more post-oriented play,[121] Miami matched their best start to a season in franchise history,[122] and at the conclusion of the lockout-shortened 2011ÿ12 season, he was named MVP for the third time, finishing with averages of 27.1 points, 7.9 rebounds, 6.2 assists, and 1.9 steals per game on 53 percent shooting.[123]\\r\\nIn Game 4 of the second round of the playoffs, James registered 40 points, 18 rebounds, and 9 assists to help even the series against the Indiana Pacers.[125] Miami eventually defeated the Pacers in six games.[126] Facing elimination in Game 6 of the Conference Finals against the Celtics, James scored 45 points to lead the Heat to victory in what The New York Times called a \\"career-defining performance\\".[127] Miami won Game 7 to advance to the Finals, earning them a matchup with the Oklahoma City Thunder.[126] Late in Game 4 of the series, James hit a three-pointer to give the Heat a lead, helping them win the game despite missing time with leg cramps.[128] In Game 5, he registered a triple-double as Miami defeated Oklahoma City for their second-ever championship and James' first championship.[129] James was unanimously voted the Bill Russell NBA Finals Most Valuable Player with averages of 28.6 points, 10.2 rebounds, and 7.4 assists per game.[130] His full postseason run, in which he averaged 30.3 points, 9.7 rebounds and 5.6 assists per game, was later ranked the second best in modern NBA history by ESPN.[131]\\r\\nIn February of the 2012ÿ13 season, James' performance was described by Sports Illustrated as a \\"month for the ages\\",[132] averaging 29.7 points and 7.8 assists per game while setting multiple shooting efficiency records.[133][134][135] During this period, the Heat began a 27-game winning streak, the third longest in NBA history.[136] Behind his play, Miami finished the year with a franchise and league best 66ÿ16 record,[137] and James was named MVP for the fourth time, falling just one vote shy of becoming the first player in NBA history to win the award unanimously.[138] His final season averages were 26.8 points, 8 rebounds, 7.3 assists, and 1.7 steals per game on 56.5 percent shooting.[39]\\r\\nIn Game 1 of the Conference Finals, James scored a buzzer-beating layup to give Miami a one-point victory against the Pacers.[139] Throughout the series, his supporting cast struggled significantly, and his added scoring load prompted him to compare his responsibilities to those of his \\"Cleveland days\\".[140] Despite these struggles, the Heat advanced to the Finals for a meeting with the Spurs,[141] signifying a rematch for James from his first Finals six years earlier.[142] At the beginning of the series, he was criticized for his lack of aggressiveness and poor shot selection as Miami fell behind 2ÿ3.[74][141][143] In Game 6, he recorded his second triple-double of the series, including 16 fourth quarter points, to lead the Heat to a comeback victory.[144] In Game 7, he tied the Finals record for most points scored in a Game 7 victory, leading Miami over San Antonio with 37 points.[145] He was named Finals MVP for the second straight season, averaging 25.3 points, 10.9 rebounds, 7 assists, and 2.3 steals per game for the championship round.[146]\\r\\nOn March 3 of the 2013ÿ14 season, James scored a career-high and franchise-record 61 points in a game against the Charlotte Bobcats.[147] Throughout the year, he was one of the few staples for a Heat roster that used 20 different starting lineups due to injuries,[148] finishing with averages of 27.1 points, 6.9 rebounds, and 6.4 assists per game on 56.7 percent shooting.[39] In the second round of the playoffs, he tied a career postseason-high by scoring 49 points in Game 4 against the Brooklyn Nets.[149] In the next round, Miami defeated the Pacers to earn their fourth consecutive Finals berth, becoming one of only four teams in NBA history to do so.[150] In Game 1 of the Finals, James missed most of the fourth quarter because of leg cramps, helping the Spurs take an early series lead.[151] In Game 2, he led the Heat to a series-tying victory with 35 points on a 64 percent shooting rate.[152] San Antonio eventually eliminated the Heat in five games, ending Miami's quest for a three-peat.[153] For the Finals, James averaged 28.2 points, 7.8 rebounds, and 2 steals per game.[154]\\r\\nOn June 25, 2014, James opted out of his contract with the Heat, officially becoming an unrestricted free agent on July 1.[157] On July 11, he revealed via a first-person essay in Sports Illustrated that he intended to return to the Cavaliers.[158] In contrast to The Decision, his announcement to return to Cleveland was well received.[159][160][161] On July 12, he officially signed with the team,[162] who had compiled a league-worst 97ÿ215 record in the four seasons following his departure.[163] A month after James' signing, the Cavaliers acquired Kevin Love from the Minnesota Timberwolves, forming a new star trio along with Kyrie Irving.[164]\\r\\nIn January of the 2014ÿ15 season, James missed two weeks due to left knee and lower back strains, the longest stretch of missed games in his career.[165] In total, he played a career-low 69 games and his final averages were 25.3 points, 6 rebounds, and 7.4 assists per game.[39] In the second round of the playoffs, he hit a baseline jumper at the buzzer to give Cleveland a 2ÿ2 series tie with the Bulls.[166] In the Conference Finals, the Cavaliers defeated the Hawks to advance to the Finals, making James the first player since the 1960s to play in five consecutive Finals.[167] For most of the Finals against the Golden State Warriors, Irving and Love were sidelined due to injury, giving James more offensive responsibilities.[167] Behind his leadership, the Cavaliers opened the series with a 2ÿ1 lead before being eliminated in six games.[168] Despite the loss, he received serious consideration for the Finals MVP Award,[169] averaging 35.8 points, 13.3 rebounds, and 8.8 assists per game for the championship round.[168]\\r\\nDuring the 2015ÿ16 season, James was criticized for his role in several off-court controversies, including the midseason firing of Cavaliers' head coach David Blatt.[170][171] Despite these distractions, Cleveland finished the year with 57 wins and the best record in the East.[172] James' final averages were 25.3 points, 7.4 rebounds, and 6.8 assists per game on 52 percent shooting.[39] In the playoffs, the Cavaliers advanced comfortably to the Finals, losing only two games en route to a rematch with the Warriors,[172] who were coming off a record-setting 73 win season.[173] To begin the series, Cleveland fell behind 3ÿ1, including two blowout losses.[174] James responded by registering back-to-back 41 point games in Games 5 and 6, leading the Cavaliers to two consecutive wins to stave off elimination.[175] In Game 7, he posted a triple-double and made a number of key plays, including a memorable chase-down block on Andre Iguodala in the final two minutes,[176][177][178] as Cleveland emerged victorious, winning the city's first professional sports title in 52 years and becoming the first team in NBA history to come back from a 3ÿ1 series deficit in the Finals.[179] James became just the third player to record a triple-double in an NBA Finals Game 7,[180] and behind series averages of 29.7 points, 11.3 rebounds, 8.9 assists, 2.3 blocks, and 2.6 steals per game,[174] he also became the first player in league history to lead both teams in all five statistical categories for a playoff round, culminating in a unanimous Finals MVP selection.[181]\\r\\nThe 2016ÿ17 season was marred by injuries and unexpected losses for the Cavaliers;[182] James later described it as one of the \\"strangest\\" years of his career.[183] Following a January defeat to the New Orleans Pelicans, he publicly criticized Cleveland's front office for constructing a team that he felt was too \\"top heavy\\", for which he received criticism.[184] The Cavaliers finished the season as the East's second seed, with James averaging 26.4 points and career highs in rebounds (8.6), assists (8.7), and turnovers (4.1) per game.[39] In Game 3 of the first round of the postseason, he registered 41 points, 13 rebounds, and 12 assists against the Pacers, leading Cleveland to a comeback victory after trailing by 25 points at halftime, representing the largest halftime deficit overcome in NBA playoff history.[185] In Game 5 of the Conference Finals against the Celtics, James scored 35 points and surpassed Michael Jordan as the league's all-time postseason scoring leader.[186] The Cavaliers won the game and the series, advancing to their third consecutive Finals against the Warriors.[187] Behind averages of 33.6 points, 12 rebounds, and 10 assists per game, James became the first player to average a triple-double in the Finals, but Cleveland was defeated in five games.[188]\\r\\nJames made his debut for the United States national team at the 2004 Olympics in Athens, Greece.[189] He spent the Games mostly on the bench,[190][191] averaging 14.6 minutes per game with 5.8 points and 2.6 rebounds per game in eight games.[189] Team USA finished the competition with a bronze medal, becoming the first U.S. basketball team to return home without a gold medal since adding professionals to their line-up.[189][192] James felt his limited playing time was a \\"lowlight\\" and believed he was not given \\"a fair opportunity to play\\".[193] His attitude during the Olympics was described as \\"disrespectful\\" and \\"distasteful\\" by columnists Adrian Wojnarowski and Peter Vecsey, respectively.[194][195]\\r\\nAt the 2006 FIBA World Championship in Japan, James took on a greater role for Team USA, averaging 13.9 points, 4.8 rebounds, and 4.1 assists per game as co-captain.[196][197] The team finished the tournament with an 8ÿ1 record, winning another bronze medal.[196] James' behavior was again questioned, this time by teammate Bruce Bowen, who confronted James during tryouts regarding his treatment of staff members.[194][198]\\r\\nBefore naming James to the 2008 Olympic team, Team USA managing director Jerry Colangelo and coach Mike Krzyzewski gave James an ultimatum to improve his attitude, and he heeded their advice.[194][199] At the FIBA Americas Championship 2007, he averaged 18.1 points, 3.6 rebounds, and 4.7 assists per game, including a 31-point performance against Argentina in the championship game, the most ever by an American in an Olympic qualifier.[200][201] Team USA went 10ÿ0, winning the gold medal and qualifying for the 2008 Olympics in Beijing, China.[189] James credited the team's attitude and experience for their improvement, saying: \\"I don't think we understood what it meant to put on a USA uniform and all the people that we were representing in 2004. We definitely know that now.\\"[191] At the Olympics, Team USA went unbeaten, winning their first gold medal since 2000.[202] In the final game, James turned in 14 points, 6 rebounds, and 3 assists against Spain.[202]\\r\\nJames did not play at the 2010 FIBA World Championship but rejoined Team USA for the 2012 Olympics in London, England.[203] He became the leader of the team with Kobe Bryant, who would soon be 34, stepping back.[204][205][206] James facilitated the offense from the post and perimeter, called the defensive sets, and provided scoring when needed.[207][208][209][210] During a game against Australia, he recorded the first triple-double in U.S. Olympic basketball history with 11 points, 14 rebounds and 12 assists.[a][210] Team USA went on to win their second straight gold medal, again defeating Spain in the final game.[212] James contributed 19 points in the win, becoming the all-time leading scorer in U.S. men's basketball history.[189][212] He also joined Michael Jordan as the only players to win an NBA MVP award, NBA championship, NBA Finals MVP, and Olympic gold medal in the same year.[213] Afterwards, Krzyzewski said James \\"is the best player, he is the best leader and he is as smart as anybody playing the game right now.\\"[214]\\r\\nStanding 6?feet 8?inches (2.03?m) and weighing 250 pounds (113.4?kg), James has started at small forward and power forward, but he can also play the other three positions.[215] With career averages of 27.1 points, 7.3 rebounds, 7.0 assists, and 1.6 steals per game,[39] he is considered one of the most athletic and versatile players in the NBA,[121][216][217] and has been compared to Hall of Famers Oscar Robertson, Magic Johnson, and Michael Jordan.[31][218] Since 2011, he has been ranked the best player in the NBA by ESPN and Sports Illustrated.[b][c]\\r\\nMany basketball analysts, coaches, fans, and current and former players consider James to be one of the greatest players of all-time, often ranking him as the best small forward and in the top five overall.[d] He has earned All-NBA honors every season since his sophomore year, All-Defensive honors every season from 2009 to 2014, and was named Rookie of the Year in his debut season.[39] With four MVP awards, he is part of a select group of players who have won the award four times, including Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Jordan, Wilt Chamberlain, and Bill Russell; James and Russell are the only two players who have won four MVP awards in a five-year span.[237] While James has never won the Defensive Player of the Year Award, he has finished second in the voting twice and lists it as one of his main goals.[66][238] James has appeared in the Finals eight times and won three championships. Some analysts have criticized him for not having a better Finals record, while others have defended him, arguing that his supporting casts were usually poor and, despite the fact that James had played well, his team was defeated by superior competition.[239][240][241]\\r\\nUpon entering the NBA, James made an immediate offensive impact, leading the Cavaliers in scoring as a 19-year-old rookie.[243][244] He holds numerous \\"youngest to\\" distinctions, including being the youngest player to score 28,000 career points.[e] During his first stint in Cleveland, he was primarily used as an on-ball point forward, and although his shooting tendencies were perimeter-oriented,[121] he established himself as one of the best slashers and finishers in basketball, leading the NBA in three-point plays in 2006.[249] His combination of speed, quickness, and size often created matchup problems for opposing teams as he was capable of blowing by larger defenders and overpowering smaller ones.[250] These qualities became more apparent in transition, where he developed a reputation for grabbing defensive rebounds and then beating the defense downcourt for highlight-quality baskets.[251] Around this time, James was frequently criticized for not having developed a reliable jump shot or post game.[252] Teams would try to exploit these weaknesses by giving him space in the half court and forcing him to settle for three-pointers and long two-pointers, a strategy famously utilized by Spurs coach Greg Popovich in the 2007 Finals, where James converted on only 36 percent of his field goals in four games.[253]\\r\\nIn Miami, Heat coach Erik Spoelstra changed James' role to a more unconventional one.[121] James began spending more time in the post and shooting fewer three-pointers, attempting a career-low 149 in 2012.[39][121] He improved his shot selection and accuracy on jump shots, finishing second in the league in catch-and-shoot field goal percentage in 2013.[254] He also learned how to work as an off-ball cutter in the Heat's \\"pass-happy\\" offense.[255] Behind these improvements, James' overall scoring efficiency rose to historically-great levels,[256] peaking in 2014 when he registered a 64.9 true shooting percentage.[39] During this period, ESPN's Tom Haberstroh called James' free throw shooting his biggest weakness, describing it as \\"average\\".[257] Upon returning to the Cavaliers, James began to experience subtle age-related declines in productivity,[258] posting his lowest scoring averages since his rookie season in 2015 and 2016.[39][259] His shooting also temporarily regressed, and he briefly ranked as the worst high-volume outside shooter from outside the paint in the NBA.[260] Despite these changes, he has remained an elite offensive player who is capable of beating defenses with body control, strength, and varying attacking speeds.[250]\\r\\nJames' playmaking ability is generally considered to be one of his premier skills, with some analysts ranking him among the greatest passers in NBA history.[261] He is the only frontcourt player in league history to register over 7,000 career assists.[262] Using his size, vision, and the attention he garners from opposing defenses to his advantage,[263] James is able to create easy points for his teammates with accurate assists, manufacturing a league leading 2.6 three-pointers per game by way of his passing alone in 2013.[264] He will often execute passes that would normally be considered unconventional, including passes after leaving his feet and passes through defensive traffic.[265] His uncanny tendency to find the open man played a significant role in the evolution of modern NBA defenses, forcing teams to incorporate some elements of zone into their schemes to better cover the weak side of the court and prevent James from passing to open shooters.[250]\\r\\nEarly in James' career, he was criticized by the media for his play in pressure situations; specifically, for passing instead of shooting in the waning seconds of close games.[266][267] In a 2011 interview, teammate Chris Bosh stated that he would rather have Dwyane Wade take a last-second shot than James.[268] Later in James' career, his clutch play was viewed more favorably; for example, a 2011 article by Henry Abbott revealed that James had a better shooting percentage with the game on the line than such notables as Ray Allen and Kobe Bryant.[269] In 2015, FiveThirtyEight wrote that he might be \\"the most clutch playoff shooter of his generation\\".[270]\\r\\nAt the beginning of James' career, he was considered a poor defensive player,[271] but he improved steadily through the years. Near the end of his first tenure in Cleveland, he became proficient at the chase-down block; coming in from behind the opposition in transition to block their shot.[65] In Miami, he developed into a more versatile defender, and the Heat relied on him to guard all five positions.[272] Paired with teammates Shane Battier and Dwyane Wade, Miami used James in an ultra-aggressive defensive scheme,[273] with James cheating off the ball to help out inside or get into rebounding position.[274] Beginning in 2014, some analysts noted a regression in his defensive impact, stemming from a lack of effort and expected age-related declines.[275][276] James himself admitted to taking plays off at times, referring to this approach as \\"chill mode\\".[277] Writing for ESPN in 2016, Nate Duncan observed that while James tended to take off more plays than in his younger days, he was able to raise his level in that year's Finals and temporarily recapture his Miami form.[278]\\r\\nJames proposed to Savannah Brinson, his high school sweetheart, on December 31, 2011 at a party celebrating New Year's Eve and his 27th birthday.[279] The two were married on September 14, 2013 in San Diego.[280] Together, they have three children: LeBron James Jr. (b. 2004),[281] Bryce Maximus James (b. 2007),[282] and Zhuri James (b. 2014).[283] During his tenure with the Heat, James resided in Coconut Grove, an affluent Miami neighborhood, where he bought a three-story mansion overlooking Biscayne Bay for $9?million.[284] In November 2015, James bought a 9,350 square-feet East Coastÿstyle mansion in Brentwood, Los Angeles for about $21?million.[285]\\r\\nJames is an active supporter of the Boys & Girls Club of America, Children's Defense Fund, and ONEXONE.[286] He also has his own charity foundation, the LeBron James Family Foundation, which is based in Akron.[287] Since 2005, the foundation has held an annual bike-a-thon in Akron to raise money for various causes.[288] In 2015, James announced a partnership with the University of Akron to provide scholarships for as many as 2,300 children beginning in 2021.[289] In 2016, he donated $2.5 million to the Smithsonian National Museum of African American History and Culture to support an exhibit about Muhammad Ali.[290] In 2017, he received the J. Walter Kennedy Citizenship Award from the NBA for his \\"outstanding service and dedication to the community\\".[291]\\r\\nJames is represented by agent Rich Paul of Klutch Sports.[292] His first agent was Aaron Goodwin, whom he left in 2005 for Leon Rose. Rose joined Creative Artists Agency (CAA) in 2007, and he worked with fellow CAA agent Henry Thomas, who represented Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh, to bring James to Miami in 2010. James left CAA for Paul in 2012.[293] James, Paul, Maverick Carter, and Randy Mimsall childhood friendsformed agent and sports-marketing company LRMR after James left Goodwin. LRMR handles James' marketing, including the marketing of The Decision, for which it was criticized.[294][295]\\r\\nThroughout his career, James has taken a unique approach to his playing contracts, usually opting to sign shorter term deals in order to maximize his earnings potential and flexibility;[296][107][297] for example, in 2006, he and the Cavaliers negotiated a three-year, $60?million contract extension instead of the four-year maximum as it allotted him the option of seeking a new contract worth more money as an unrestricted free agent following the 2010 season.[298] This move ultimately allowed James, Dwyane Wade, and Chris Bosh to sign with the Heat together.[299] During his second stint in Cleveland, he began opting out and re-signing on new contracts after each season in order to take advantage of higher salaries resulting from the NBA's rising salary cap.[162][300][301][302] In 2016, he signed with the Cavaliers on a three-year deal,[303] becoming the highest-paid player in the league for the first time in his career.[304]\\r\\nJames has numerous endorsement contracts; some of the companies he does business with are Audemars Piguet,[305] Coca-Cola,[306] Dunkin' Brands,[307] McDonald's,[308] Nike,[306] State Farm,[309] and Samsung.[306] Coming out of high school, he was the target of a three-way bidding war among Nike, Reebok, and Adidas,[310] eventually signing with Nike for approximately $90 million.[311] His signature shoes have performed well for Nike.[312] In 2011, Fenway Sports Group became the sole global marketer of his rights, and as part of the deal, he was granted a minority stake in the English Premier League football club Liverpool FC,[313] who he has claimed his support for.[314] As a result of James' endorsement money and NBA salary, he has been listed as one of the world's highest-paid athletes.[315] In 2013, he surpassed Kobe Bryant as the highest paid basketball player in the world, with earnings of $56.5 million.[316] In 2014, James realized a profit of more than $30 million as part of Apple's acquisition of Beats Electronics; he had originally struck a deal to get a small stake in the company at its inception in exchange for promoting its headphones.[317] In 2015, he was ranked the sixth highest earning sportsperson,[318] and third highest in 2016 (after Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi).[319] James has stated that we would like to own an NBA team in the future, albeit in a hands-off capacity.[320]\\r\\nJames, with comedian Jimmy Kimmel, co-hosted the 2007 ESPY Awards.[321] In other comedic pursuits, he hosted the 33rd-season premiere of Saturday Night Live.[322] He has also tried his hand at acting, appearing in a cameo role on the HBO series Entourage.[323] In 2015, he played himself in the Judd Apatow film Trainwreck,[324] receiving positive reviews for his performance.[325] That same year, James' digital video company, Uninterrupted, raised $15.8 million from Warner Bros. Entertainment and Turner Sports to help expand the company's efforts to bring athlete-created content to fans. It is hosted on Bleacher Report and is used by several other athletes including New England Patriots tight end Rob Gronkowski and Seattle Seahawks cornerback Richard Sherman.[326]\\r\\nAlong with business partner Maverick Carter, James owns production company SpringHill Entertainment,[327] whose first work was the Lions Gate documentary More Than a Game, released in 2009 and chronicling James' high school years.[328] Series produced by SpringHill include the Disney XD sports documentaries Becoming,[329] Starz sitcom Survivor's Remorse,[330] and animated web series The LeBrons.[331] In 2016, CNBC aired an unscripted series hosted by James called Cleveland Hustles, where four up-and-coming Northern Ohio entrepreneurs will be financed on the condition of revitalizing a neighborhood in Cleveland.[332] In the 2017 Toronto International Film Festival, a 60-minute Vince Carter documentary entitled The Carter Effect was executive produced by James and Maverick Carter along with rapper Drake and Future the Prince.[333][334]\\r\\nJames is considered by many, including his fellow players, to be the \\"face of the NBA\\".[335] His opinions have yielded significant influence on important league decisions; for example, in 2014 he asked commissioner Adam Silver to increase the duration of the All-Star break, and the request was granted the following season.[336] On February 13, 2015, James was elected the first Vice President of the National Basketball Players Association (NBPA).[337]\\r\\nThroughout his career, James has been ranked by Forbes as one of the world's most influential athletes,[338][339] and in 2017, he was listed as one of the 100 most influential people in the world by Time.[340] During his first stint with the Cavaliers, he was adored by local fans, with Sherwin-Williams displaying a giant Nike-produced banner of James on its world headquarters.[341] Despite their affection for James, Cleveland fans and critics were frequently annoyed when he attended Cleveland Indians games against the New York Yankees sporting a Yankees hat.[342] Following his actions during the 2010 free agency period and, more specifically, The Decision, he was listed as one of the world's most disliked athletes.[343] By 2013, his image had mostly recovered and he was reported by ESPN as the most popular player in the NBA for the second time in his career.[344] In 2014, he was named the most popular male athlete in America by the Harris Poll.[345] He has led the league in jersey sales six times.[346]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn March 2008, James became the first black manand third man overall after Richard Gere and George Clooneyto appear on the cover of Vogue, posing with Gisele Bndchen.[349] Some sports bloggers and columnists considered the cover offensive, describing the demeanor of James and his holding Bndchen as a reference to classic imagery of the movie monster King Kong, a dark savage capturing his light-skinned love interest.[347][348]\\r\\nJames has taken stances on controversial issues throughout his career, mentioning on several occasions a feeling of obligation to effect change using his status.[350] Those include the War in Darfur,[351][352][353][354] the Trayvon Martin case,[355] the now-former NBA owner Donald Sterling's racist comments in 2014,[350] the Michael Brown verdict,[356] and the death of Eric Garner.[357] Following a racist incident at his Los Angeles home in 2017, James stated, \\"being black in America is tough. We got a long way to go for us as a society and for us as African Americans until we feel equal in America.\\"[358] Later on that same year, in the aftermath of the 2017 Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, James questioned President Donald Trump's Make America Great Again slogan by stating \\"It's sad what's going on in Charlottesville. Is this the direction our country is heading? Make America Great Again huh? He said that\\" and \\"Our youth deserve better!!\\"[359]\\r\\nIn June 2008, James donated $20,000 to a committee to elect Democratic presidential nominee Barack Obama.[360] Later that year, James gathered almost 20,000 people at the Quicken Loans Arena for a viewing of Obama's 30-minute American Stories, American Solutions television advertisement.[361] It was shown on a large screen above the stage, where Jay-Z later held a free concert.[361] James later publicly endorsed Hillary Clinton in the 2016 Presidential election.[362]","input":"How many times has lebron james been in finals?"},{"output":"in the 1960s","context":"Birth control, also known as contraception and fertility control, is a method or device used to prevent pregnancy.[1] Birth control has been used since ancient times, but effective and safe methods of birth control only became available in the 20th century.[2] Planning, making available, and using birth control is called family planning.[3][4] Some cultures limit or discourage access to birth control because they consider it to be morally, religiously, or politically undesirable.[2]\\r\\nThe most effective methods of birth control are sterilization by means of vasectomy in males and tubal ligation in females, intrauterine devices (IUDs), and implantable birth control.[5] This is followed by a number of hormone-based methods including oral pills, patches, vaginal rings, and injections.[5] Less effective methods include physical barriers such as condoms, diaphragms and birth control sponges and fertility awareness methods.[5] The least effective methods are spermicides and withdrawal by the male before ejaculation.[5] Sterilization, while highly effective, is not usually reversible; all other methods are reversible, most immediately upon stopping them.[5] Safe sex practices, such as with the use of male or female condoms, can also help prevent sexually transmitted infections.[6] Other methods of birth control do not protect against sexually transmitted diseases.[7] Emergency birth control can prevent pregnancy if taken within the 72 to 120 hours after unprotected sex.[8][9] Some argue not having sex as a form of birth control, but abstinence-only sex education may increase teenage pregnancies if offered without birth control education, due to non-compliance.[10][11]\\r\\nIn teenagers, pregnancies are at greater risk of poor outcomes.[12] Comprehensive sex education and access to birth control decreases the rate of unwanted pregnancies in this age group.[12][13] While all forms of birth control can generally be used by young people,[14] long-acting reversible birth control such as implants, IUDs, or vaginal rings are more successful in reducing rates of teenage pregnancy.[13] After the delivery of a child, a woman who is not exclusively breastfeeding may become pregnant again after as few as four to six weeks.[14] Some methods of birth control can be started immediately following the birth, while others require a delay of up to six months.[14] In women who are breastfeeding, progestin-only methods are preferred over combined oral birth control pills.[14] In women who have reached menopause, it is recommended that birth control be continued for one year after the last period.[14]\\r\\nAbout 222?million women who want to avoid pregnancy in developing countries are not using a modern birth control method.[15][16] Birth control use in developing countries has decreased the number of deaths during or around the time of pregnancy by 40% (about 270,000 deaths prevented in 2008) and could prevent 70% if the full demand for birth control were met.[17][18] By lengthening the time between pregnancies, birth control can improve adult women's delivery outcomes and the survival of their children.[17] In the developing world women's earnings, assets, weight, and their children's schooling and health all improve with greater access to birth control.[19] Birth control increases economic growth because of fewer dependent children, more women participating in the workforce, and less use of scarce resources.[19][20]\\r\\nBirth control methods include barrier methods, hormonal birth control, intrauterine devices (IUDs), sterilization, and behavioral methods. They are used before or during sex while emergency contraceptives are effective for up to five days after sex. Effectiveness is generally expressed as the percentage of women who become pregnant using a given method during the first year,[25] and sometimes as a lifetime failure rate among methods with high effectiveness, such as tubal ligation.[26]\\r\\nThe most effective methods are those that are long acting and do not require ongoing health care visits.[27] Surgical sterilization, implantable hormones, and intrauterine devices all have first-year failure rates of less than 1%.[21] Hormonal contraceptive pills, patches or vaginal rings, and the lactational amenorrhea method (LAM), if adhered to strictly, can also have first-year (or for LAM, first-6-month) failure rates of less than 1%.[27] With typical use, first-year failure rates are considerably high, at 9%, due to inconsistent use.[21] Other methods such as condoms, diaphragms, and spermicides have higher first-year failure rates even with perfect usage.[27] The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends long acting reversible birth control as first line for young individuals.[28]\\r\\nWhile all methods of birth control have some potential adverse effects, the risk is less than that of pregnancy.[27] After stopping or removing many methods of birth control, including oral contraceptives, IUDs, implants and injections, the rate of pregnancy during the subsequent year is the same as for those who used no birth control.[29]\\r\\nFor individuals with specific health problems, certain forms of birth control may require further investigations.[30] For women who are otherwise healthy, many methods of birth control should not require a medical examincluding birth control pills, injectable or implantable birth control, and condoms.[31] For example, a pelvic exam, breast exam, or blood test before starting birth control pills does not appear to affect outcomes.[32][33] In 2009, the World Health Organization (WHO) published a detailed list of medical eligibility criteria for each type of birth control.[30]\\r\\nHormonal contraception is available in a number of different forms, including oral pills, implants under the skin, injections, patches, IUDs and a vaginal ring. They are currently available only for women, although hormonal contraceptives for men have been and are being clinically tested.[34] There are two types of oral birth control pills, the combined oral contraceptive pills (which contain both estrogen and a progestin) and the progestogen-only pills (sometimes called minipills).[35] If either is taken during pregnancy, they do not increase the risk of miscarriage nor cause birth defects.[33] Both types of birth control pills prevent fertilization mainly by inhibiting ovulation and thickening cervical mucus.[36][37] They may also change the lining of the uterus and thus decrease implantation.[37] Their effectiveness depends on the user's adherence to taking the pills.[33]\\r\\nCombined hormonal contraceptives are associated with a slightly increased risk of venous and arterial blood clots.[38] Venous clots, on average, increase from 2.8 to 9.8 per 10,000 women years[39] which is still less than that associated with pregnancy.[38] Due to this risk, they are not recommended in women over 35?years of age who continue to smoke.[40] Due to the increased risk, they are included in decision tools such as the DASH score and PERC rule used to predict the risk of blood clots.[41]\\r\\nThe effect on sexual desire is varied, with increase or decrease in some but with no effect in most.[42] Combined oral contraceptives reduce the risk of ovarian cancer and endometrial cancer and do not change the risk of breast cancer.[43][44] They often reduce menstrual bleeding and painful menstruation cramps.[33] The lower doses of estrogen released from the vaginal ring may reduce the risk of breast tenderness, nausea, and headache associated with higher dose estrogen products.[43]\\r\\nProgestin-only pills, injections and intrauterine devices are not associated with an increased risk of blood clots and may be used by women with a history of blood clots in their veins.[38][45] In those with a history of arterial blood clots, non-hormonal birth control or a progestin-only method other than the injectable version should be used.[38] Progestin-only pills may improve menstrual symptoms and can be used by breastfeeding women as they do not affect milk production. Irregular bleeding may occur with progestin-only methods, with some users reporting no periods.[46] The progestins drospirenone and desogestrel minimize the androgenic side effects but increase the risks of blood clots and are thus not first line.[47] The perfect use first-year failure rate of injectable progestin is 0.2%; the typical use first failure rate is 6%.[21]\\r\\nThree varieties of birth control pills in calendar oriented packaging\\r\\nBirth control pills\\r\\nA transdermal contraceptive patch\\r\\nA NuvaRing vaginal ring\\r\\nBarrier contraceptives are devices that attempt to prevent pregnancy by physically preventing sperm from entering the uterus.[48] They include male condoms, female condoms, cervical caps, diaphragms, and contraceptive sponges with spermicide.[48]\\r\\nGlobally, condoms are the most common method of birth control.[49] Male condoms are put on a man's erect penis and physically block ejaculated sperm from entering the body of a sexual partner.[50] Modern condoms are most often made from latex, but some are made from other materials such as polyurethane, or lamb's intestine.[50] Female condoms are also available, most often made of nitrile, latex or polyurethane.[51] Male condoms have the advantage of being inexpensive, easy to use, and have few adverse effects.[52] Making condoms available to teenagers does not appear to affect the age of onset of sexual activity or its frequency.[53] In Japan, about 80% of couples who are using birth control use condoms, while in Germany this number is about 25%,[54] and in the United States it is 18%.[55]\\r\\nMale condoms and the diaphragm with spermicide have typical use first-year failure rates of 18% and 12%, respectively.[21] With perfect use condoms are more effective with a 2% first-year failure rate versus a 6% first-year rate with the diaphragm.[21] Condoms have the additional benefit of helping to prevent the spread of some sexually transmitted infections such as HIV/AIDS, however, condoms made from animal intestine do not.[5][56]\\r\\nContraceptive sponges combine a barrier with a spermicide.[27] Like diaphragms, they are inserted vaginally before intercourse and must be placed over the cervix to be effective.[27] Typical failure rates during the first year depend on whether or not a woman has previously given birth, being 24% in those who have and 12% in those who have not.[21] The sponge can be inserted up to 24?hours before intercourse and must be left in place for at least six hours afterward.[27] Allergic reactions[57] and more severe adverse effects such as toxic shock syndrome have been reported.[58]\\r\\nA rolled up male condom.\\r\\nAn unrolled male latex condom\\r\\nA polyurethane female condom\\r\\nA diaphragm vaginal-cervical barrier, in its case with a quarter U.S. coin.\\r\\nA contraceptive sponge set inside its open package.\\r\\nThe current intrauterine devices (IUD) are small devices, often 'T'-shaped, containing either copper or levonorgestrel, which are inserted into the uterus. They are one form of long-acting reversible contraception which are the most effective types of reversible birth control.[59] Failure rates with the copper IUD is about 0.8% while the levonorgestrel IUD has a failure rates of 0.2% in the first year of use.[60] Among types of birth control, they, along with birth control implants, result in the greatest satisfaction among users.[61] As of 2007, IUDs are the most widely used form of reversible contraception, with more than 180?million users worldwide.[62]\\r\\nEvidence supports effectiveness and safety in adolescents[61] and those who have and have not previously had children.[63] IUDs do not affect breastfeeding and can be inserted immediately after delivery.[64] They may also be used immediately after an abortion.[65] Once removed, even after long term use, fertility returns to normal immediately.[66]\\r\\nWhile copper IUDs may increase menstrual bleeding and result in more painful cramps,[67] hormonal IUDs may reduce menstrual bleeding or stop menstruation altogether.[64] Cramping can be treated with painkillers like non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.[68] Other potential complications include expulsion (2ÿ5%) and rarely perforation of the uterus (less than 0.7%).[64][68] A previous model of the intrauterine device (the Dalkon shield) was associated with an increased risk of pelvic inflammatory disease, however the risk is not affected with current models in those without sexually transmitted infections around the time of insertion.[69]\\r\\nSurgical sterilization is available in the form of tubal ligation for women and vasectomy for men.[2] There are no significant long term side effects, and tubal ligation decreases the risk of ovarian cancer.[2] Short term complications are twenty times less likely from a vasectomy than a tubal ligation.[2][70] After a vasectomy, there may be swelling and pain of the scrotum which usually resolves in one or two weeks.[71] With tubal ligation, complications occur in 1 to 2 percent of procedures with serious complications usually due to the anesthesia.[72] Neither method offers protection from sexually transmitted infections.[2]\\r\\nThis decision may cause regret in some men and women. Of women aged over 30 who have undergone tubal ligation, about 5% regret their decision, as compared with 20% of women aged under 30.[2] By contrast, less than 5% of men are likely to regret sterilization. Men who are more likely to regret sterilization are younger, have young or no children, or have an unstable marriage.[73] In a survey of biological parents, 9% stated they would not have had children if they were able to do it over again.[74]\\r\\nAlthough sterilization is considered a permanent procedure,[75] it is possible to attempt a tubal reversal to reconnect the fallopian tubes or a vasectomy reversal to reconnect the vasa deferentia. In women, the desire for a reversal is often associated with a change in spouse.[75] Pregnancy success rates after tubal reversal are between 31 and 88 percent, with complications including an increased risk of ectopic pregnancy.[75] The number of males who request reversal is between 2 and 6 percent.[76] Rates of success in fathering another child after reversal are between 38 and 84 percent; with success being lower the longer the time period between the vasectomy and the reversal.[76] Sperm extraction followed by in vitro fertilization may also be an option in men.[77]\\r\\nBehavioral methods involve regulating the timing or method of intercourse to prevent introduction of sperm into the female reproductive tract, either altogether or when an egg may be present.[78] If used perfectly the first-year failure rate may be around 3.4%, however if used poorly first-year failure rates may approach 85%.[79]\\r\\nFertility awareness methods involve determining the most fertile days of the menstrual cycle and avoiding unprotected intercourse.[78] Techniques for determining fertility include monitoring basal body temperature, cervical secretions, or the day of the cycle.[78] They have typical first-year failure rates of 24%; perfect use first-year failure rates depend on which method is used and range from 0.4% to 5%.[21] The evidence on which these estimates are based, however, is poor as the majority of people in trials stop their use early.[78] Globally, they are used by about 3.6% of couples.[80] If based on both basal body temperature and another primary sign, the method is referred to as symptothermal. First-year failure rates of 20% overall and 0.4% for perfect use have been reported in clinical studies of the symptothermal method.[81][21] A number of fertility tracking apps are available, as of 2016, but they are more commonly designed to assist those trying to get pregnant rather than prevent pregnancy.[82]\\r\\nThe withdrawal method (also known as coitus interruptus) is the practice of ending intercourse (\\"pulling out\\") before ejaculation.[83] The main risk of the withdrawal method is that the man may not perform the maneuver correctly or in a timely manner.[83] First-year failure rates vary from 4% with perfect usage to 22% with typical usage.[21] It is not considered birth control by some medical professionals.[27]\\r\\nThere is little data regarding the sperm content of pre-ejaculatory fluid.[84] While some tentative research did not find sperm,[84] one trial found sperm present in 10 out of 27 volunteers.[85] The withdrawal method is used as birth control by about 3% of couples.[80]\\r\\nSexual abstinence may be used as a form of birth control, meaning either not engaging in any type of sexual activity, or specifically not engaging in vaginal intercourse, while engaging in other forms of non-vaginal sex.[86][87] Complete sexual abstinence is 100% effective in preventing pregnancy.[88][89] However, among those who take a pledge to abstain from premarital sex, as many as 88% who engage in sex, do so prior to marriage.[90] The choice to abstain from sex cannot protect against pregnancy as a result of rape, and public health efforts emphasizing abstinence to reduce unwanted pregnancy may have limited effectiveness, especially in developing countries and among disadvantaged groups.[91][92]\\r\\nDeliberate non-penetrative sex without vaginal sex or deliberate oral sex without vaginal sex are also sometimes considered birth control.[86] While this generally avoids pregnancy, pregnancy can still occur with intercrural sex and other forms of penis-near-vagina sex (genital rubbing, and the penis exiting from anal intercourse) where sperm can be deposited near the entrance to the vagina and can travel along the vagina's lubricating fluids.[93][94]\\r\\nAbstinence-only sex education does not reduce teenage pregnancy.[7][95] Teen pregnancy rates and STI rates are generally the same or higher in states where students are given abstinence-only education, as compared with comprehensive sex education.[95] Some authorities recommend that those using abstinence as a primary method have backup methods available (such as condoms or emergency contraceptive pills).[96]\\r\\nThe lactational amenorrhea method involves the use of a woman's natural postpartum infertility which occurs after delivery and may be extended by breastfeeding.[97] This usually requires the presence of no periods, exclusively breastfeeding the infant, and a child younger than six months.[24] The World Health Organization states that if breastfeeding is the infant's only source of nutrition, the failure rate is 2% in the six months following delivery.[98] Six uncontrolled studies of lactational amenorrhea method users found failure rates at 6 months postpartum between 0% and 7.5%.[99][needs update] Failure rates increase to 4ÿ7% at one year and 13% at two years.[100] Feeding formula, pumping instead of nursing, the use of a pacifier, and feeding solids all increase its failure rate.[101] In those who are exclusively breastfeeding, about 10% begin having periods before three months and 20% before six months.[100] In those who are not breastfeeding, fertility may return four weeks after delivery.[100]\\r\\nEmergency contraceptive methods are medications (sometimes misleadingly referred to as \\"morning-after pills\\")[102] or devices used after unprotected sexual intercourse with the hope of preventing pregnancy.[8] They work primarily by preventing ovulation or fertilization.[2][103] They are unlikely to affect implantation, but this has not been completely excluded.[103] A number of options exist, including high dose birth control pills, levonorgestrel, mifepristone, ulipristal and IUDs.[104] Levonorgestrel pills, when used within 3?days, decrease the chance of pregnancy after a single episode of unprotected sex or condom failure by 70% (resulting in a pregnancy rate of 2.2%).[8] Ulipristal, when used within 5?days, decreases the chance of pregnancy by about 85% (pregnancy rate 1.4%) and might be a little more effective than levonorgestrel.[8][104][105] Mifepristone is also more effective than levonorgestrel, while copper IUDs are the most effective method.[104] IUDs can be inserted up to five?days after intercourse and prevent about 99% of pregnancies after an episode of unprotected sex (pregnancy rate of 0.1 to 0.2%).[2][106] This makes them the most effective form of emergency contraceptive.[107] In those who are overweight or obese, levonorgestrel is less effective and an IUD or ulipristal is recommended.[108]\\r\\nProviding emergency contraceptive pills to women in advance does not affect rates of sexually transmitted infections, condom use, pregnancy rates, or sexual risk-taking behavior.[109][110] All methods have minimal side effects.[104]\\r\\nDual protection is the use of methods that prevent both sexually transmitted infections and pregnancy.[111] This can be with condoms either alone or along with another birth control method or by the avoidance of penetrative sex.[112][113]\\r\\nIf pregnancy is a high concern, using two methods at the same time is reasonable.[112] For example, two forms of birth control are recommended in those taking the anti-acne drug isotretinoin or anti-epileptic drugs like carbamazepine, due to the high risk of birth defects if taken during pregnancy.[114][115]\\r\\nContraceptive use in developing countries is estimated to have decreased the number of maternal deaths by 40% (about 270,000 deaths prevented in 2008) and could prevent 70% of deaths if the full demand for birth control were met.[17][18] These benefits are achieved by reducing the number of unplanned pregnancies that subsequently result in unsafe abortions and by preventing pregnancies in those at high risk.[17]\\r\\nBirth control also improves child survival in the developing world by lengthening the time between pregnancies.[17] In this population, outcomes are worse when a mother gets pregnant within eighteen months of a previous delivery.[17][117] Delaying another pregnancy after a miscarriage however does not appear to alter risk and women are advised to attempt pregnancy in this situation whenever they are ready.[117]\\r\\nTeenage pregnancies, especially among younger teens, are at greater risk of adverse outcomes including early birth, low birth weight, and death of the infant.[12] In the United States 82% of pregnancies in those between 15 and 19 are unplanned.[68] Comprehensive sex education and access to birth control are effective in decreasing pregnancy rates in this age group.[118]\\r\\nIn the developing world, birth control increases economic growth due to there being fewer dependent children and thus more women participating in or increased contribution to the workforce.[19] Women's earnings, assets, body mass index, and their children's schooling and body mass index all improve with greater access to birth control.[19] Family planning, via the use of modern birth control, is one of the most cost-effective health interventions.[119] For every dollar spent, the United Nations estimates that two to six dollars are saved.[16] These cost savings are related to preventing unplanned pregnancies and decreasing the spread of sexually transmitted illnesses.[119] While all methods are beneficial financially, the use of copper IUDs resulted in the greatest savings.[119]\\r\\nThe total medical cost for a pregnancy, delivery and care of a newborn in the United States is on average $21,000 for a vaginal delivery and $31,000 for a caesarean delivery as of 2012.[120] In most other countries, the cost is less than half.[120] For a child born in 2011, an average US family will spend $235,000 over 17 years to raise them.[121]\\r\\nGlobally, as of 2009, approximately 60% of those who are married and able to have children use birth control.[122] How frequently different methods are used varies widely between countries.[122] The most common method in the developed world is condoms and oral contraceptives, while in Africa it is oral contraceptives and in Latin America and Asia it is sterilization.[122] In the developing world overall, 35% of birth control is via female sterilization, 30% is via IUDs, 12% is via oral contraceptives, 11% is via condoms, and 4% is via male sterilization.[122]\\r\\nWhile less used in the developed countries than the developing world, the number of women using IUDs as of 2007 was more than 180?million.[62] Avoiding sex when fertile is used by about 3.6% of women of childbearing age, with usage as high as 20% in areas of South America.[123] As of 2005, 12% of couples are using a male form of birth control (either condoms or a vasectomy) with higher rates in the developed world.[124] Usage of male forms of birth control has decreased between 1985 and 2009.[122] Contraceptive use among women in Sub-Saharan Africa has risen from about 5% in 1991 to about 30% in 2006.[125]\\r\\nAs of 2012, 57% of women of childbearing age want to avoid pregnancy (867 of 1,520?million).[126] About 222 million women however were not able to access birth control, 53?million of whom were in sub-Saharan Africa and 97?million of whom were in Asia.[126] This results in 54?million unplanned pregnancies and nearly 80,000 maternal deaths a year.[122] Part of the reason that many women are without birth control is that many countries limit access due to religious or political reasons,[2] while another contributor is poverty.[127] Due to restrictive abortion laws in Sub-Saharan Africa, many women turn to unlicensed abortion providers for unintended pregnancy, resulting in about 2ÿ4% obtaining unsafe abortions each year.[127]\\r\\nThe Egyptian Ebers Papyrus from 1550?BC and the Kahun Papyrus from 1850?BC have within them some of the earliest documented descriptions of birth control: the use of honey, acacia leaves and lint to be placed in the vagina to block sperm.[128][129] It is believed that in Ancient Greece silphium was used as birth control which, due to its effectiveness and thus desirability, was harvested into extinction.[130]\\r\\nIn medieval Europe, any effort to halt pregnancy was deemed immoral by the Catholic Church,[128] although it is believed that women of the time still used a number of birth control measures, such as coitus interruptus and inserting lily root and rue into the vagina.[131] Women in the Middle Ages were also encouraged to tie weasel testicles around their thighs during sex to prevent pregnancy.[132] The oldest condoms discovered to date were recovered in the ruins of Dudley Castle in England, and are dated back to 1640.[132] They were made of animal gut, and were most likely used to prevent the spread of sexually transmitted diseases during the English Civil War.[132] Casanova, living in 18th century Italy, described the use of a lambskin covering to prevent pregnancy; however, condoms only became widely available in the 20th century.[128]\\r\\nThe birth control movement developed during the 19th and early 20th centuries.[133] The Malthusian League, based on the ideas of Thomas Malthus, was established in 1877 in the United Kingdom to educate the public about the importance of family planning and to advocate for getting rid of penalties for promoting birth control.[134] It was founded during the \\"Knowlton trial\\" of Annie Besant and Charles Bradlaugh, who were prosecuted for publishing on various methods of birth control.[135]\\r\\nIn the United States, Margaret Sanger and Otto Bobsein popularized the phrase \\"birth control\\" in 1914.[136][137] Sanger primarily advocated for birth control on the idea that it would prevent women from seeking unsafe abortions, but during her lifetime, she began to campaign for it on the grounds that it would reduce mental and physical defects.[138][139] She was mainly active in the United States but had gained an international reputation by the 1930s. At the time, under the Comstock Law, distribution of birth control information was illegal. She jumped bail in 1914 after her arrest for distributing birth control information and left the United States for the United Kingdom.[140] In the U.K., Sanger, influenced by Havelock Ellis, further developed her arguments for birth control. She believed women needed to enjoy sex without fearing a pregnancy. During her time abroad, Sanger also saw a more flexible diaphragm in a Dutch clinic, which she thought was a better form of contraceptive.[139] Once Sanger returned to the United States, she established a short-lived birth-control clinic with the help of her sister, Ethel Bryne, based in the Brownville section of Brooklyn, New York[141] in 1916. It was shut down after eleven days and resulted in her arrest.[142] The publicity surrounding the arrest, trial, and appeal sparked birth control activism across the United States.[143] Besides her sister, Sanger was helped in the movement by her first husband, William Sanger, who distributed copies of Family Limitation. Sangers second husband, James Noah H. Slee, would also later become involved in the movement, acting as its main funder.[139]\\r\\nThe first permanent birth-control clinic was established in Britain in 1921 by Marie Stopes working with the Malthusian League.[144] The clinic, run by midwives and supported by visiting doctors,[145] offered women's birth-control advice and taught them the use of a cervical cap. Her clinic made contraception acceptable during the 1920s by presenting it in scientific terms. In 1921, Sanger founded the American Birth Control League, which later became the Planned Parenthood Federation of America.[146] In 1924 the Society for the Provision of Birth Control Clinics was founded to campaign for municipal clinics; this led to the opening of a second clinic in Greengate, Salford in 1926.[147] Throughout the 1920s, Stopes and other feminist pioneers, including Dora Russell and Stella Browne, played a major role in breaking down taboos about sex. In April 1930 the Birth Control Conference assembled 700 delegates and was successful in bringing birth control and abortion into the political sphere ÿ three months later, the Ministry of Health, in the United Kingdom, allowed local authorities to give birth-control advice in welfare centres.[148]\\r\\nIn 1936 the U.S. court ruled in U.S. v. One Package that medically prescribing contraception to save a person's life or well-being was not illegal under the Comstock Law; following this decision, the American Medical Association Committee on Contraception revoked its 1936 statement condemning birth control. A national survey in 1937 showed 71 percent of the adult population supported the use of contraception. By 1938 347 birth control clinics were running in the United States despite their advertisement still being illegal. First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt publicly supported birth control and family planning.[149] In 1966, President Lyndon B. Johnson started endorsing public funding for family planning services, and the Federal Government began subsidizing birth control services for low-income families.[150] The Affordable Care Act, passed into law on March 23, 2010 under President Barack Obama, requires all plans in the Health Insurance Marketplace to cover contraceptive methods. These include barrier methods, hormonal methods, implanted devices, emergency contraceptives, and sterilization procedures.[151]\\r\\nIn 1909, Richard Richter developed the first intrauterine device made from silkworm gut, which was further developed and marketed in Germany by Ernst Gr?fenberg in the late 1920s.[152] In 1951, a chemist, named Carl Djerassi from Mexico City made the hormones in progesterone pills using Mexican yams.[153] Djerassi had chemically created the pill but was not equipped to distribute it to patients. Meanwhile, Gregory Pincus and John Rock with help from the Planned Parenthood Federation of America developed the first birth control pills in the 1950s, such as mestranol/noretynodrel, which became publicly available in the 1960s through the Food and Drug Administration under the name Enovid.[146][154] Medical abortion became an alternative to surgical abortion with the availability of prostaglandin analogs in the 1970s and mifepristone in the 1980s.[155]\\r\\nHuman rights agreements require most governments to provide family planning and contraceptive information and services. These include the requirement to create a national plan for family planning services, remove laws that limit access to family planning, ensure that a wide variety of safe and effective birth control methods are available including emergency contraceptives, make sure there are appropriately trained healthcare providers and facilities at an affordable price, and create a process to review the programs implemented. If governments fail to do the above it may put them in breach of binding international treaty obligations.[156]\\r\\nIn the United States, the 1965 Supreme Court decision Griswold v. Connecticut overturned a state law prohibiting dissemination of contraception information based on a constitutional right to privacy for marital relationships. In 1971, Eisenstadt v. Baird extended this right to privacy to single people.[157]\\r\\nIn 2010, the United Nations launched the Every Woman Every Child movement to assess the progress toward meeting women's contraceptive needs. The initiative has set a goal of increasing the number of users of modern birth control by 120 million women in the world's 69 poorest countries by the year 2020. Additionally, they aim to eradicate discrimination against girls and young women who seek contraceptives.[158] The American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) recommended in 2014 that oral birth control pills should be over the counter medications.[159]\\r\\nSince at least the 1870s, American religious, medical, legislative, and legal commentators have debated contraception laws. Ana Garner and Angela Michel have found that in these discussions men often attach reproductive rights to moral and political matters, as part of an ongoing attempt to regulate human bodies. In press coverage between 1873ÿ2013 they found a divide between institutional ideology and real-life experiences of women.[160]\\r\\nReligions vary widely in their views of the ethics of birth control.[161] The Roman Catholic Church officially only accepts natural family planning,[162] although large numbers of Catholics in developed countries accept and use modern methods of birth control.[163][164][165] Among Protestants, there is a wide range of views from supporting none, such as in the Quiverfull movement, to allowing all methods of birth control.[166] Views in Judaism range from the stricter Orthodox sect, which prohibits all methods of birth control, to the more relaxed Reform sect, which allows most.[167] Hindus may use both natural and modern contraceptives.[168] A common Buddhist view is that preventing conception is acceptable, while intervening after conception has occurred is not.[169] In Islam, contraceptives are allowed if they do not threaten health, although their use is discouraged by some.[170]\\r\\nSeptember 26 is World Contraception Day, devoted to raising awareness and improving education about sexual and reproductive health, with a vision of a world where every pregnancy is wanted.[171] It is supported by a group of governments and international NGOs, including the Office of Population Affairs, the Asian Pacific Council on Contraception, Centro Latinamericano Salud y Mujer, the European Society of Contraception and Reproductive Health, the German Foundation for World Population, the International Federation of Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology, International Planned Parenthood Federation, the Marie Stopes International, Population Services International, the Population Council, the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), and Women Deliver.[171]\\r\\nThere are a number of common misconceptions regarding sex and pregnancy.[172] Douching after sexual intercourse is not an effective form of birth control.[173] Additionally, it is associated with a number of health problems and thus is not recommended.[174] Women can become pregnant the first time they have sexual intercourse[175] and in any sexual position.[176] It is possible, although not very likely, to become pregnant during menstruation.[177]\\r\\nImprovements of existing birth control methods are needed, as around half of those who get pregnant unintentionally are using birth control at the time.[27] A number of alterations of existing contraceptive methods are being studied, including a better female condom, an improved diaphragm, a patch containing only progestin, and a vaginal ring containing long-acting progesterone.[178] This vaginal ring appears to be effective for three or four months and is currently available in some areas of the world.[178] For women who rarely have sex, the taking of the hormonal birth control levonorgestrel around the time of sex looks promising.[179]\\r\\nA number of methods to perform sterilization via the cervix are being studied. One involves putting quinacrine in the uterus which causes scarring and infertility. While the procedure is inexpensive and does not require surgical skills, there are concerns regarding long-term side effects.[180] Another substance, polidocanol, which functions in the same manner is being looked at.[178] A device called Essure, which expands when placed in the fallopian tubes and blocks them, was approved in the United States in 2002.[180]\\r\\nMethods of male birth control include condoms, vasectomies and withdrawal.[181][182] Between 25 and 75% of males who are sexually active would use hormonal birth control if it was available for them.[124][181] A number of hormonal and non-hormonal methods are in trials,[124] and there is some research looking at the possibility of contraceptive vaccines.[183]\\r\\nA reversible surgical method under investigation is reversible inhibition of sperm under guidance (RISUG) which consists of injecting a polymer gel, styrene maleic anhydride in dimethyl sulfoxide, into the vas deferens.

The shock was centered in The Forest of Nisene Marks State Park approximately 10?mi (16?km) northeast of Santa Cruz on a section of the San Andreas Fault System and was named for the nearby Loma Prieta Peak in the Santa Cruz Mountains. With a moment magnitude of 6.9 and a maximum Mercalli intensity of IX (Violent), the shock was responsible for 63 deaths and 3,757 injuries. The Loma Prieta segment of the San Andreas Fault System had been relatively inactive since the 1906 San Francisco earthquake (to the degree that it was designated a seismic gap) until two moderate foreshocks occurred in June 1988 and again in August 1989.\\r\\nDamage was heavy in Santa Cruz County and less so to the south in Monterey County, but effects extended well to the north into the San Francisco Bay Area, both on the San Francisco Peninsula and across the bay in Oakland. No surface faulting occurred, though a large number of other ground failures and landslides were present, especially in the Summit area of the Santa Cruz Mountains. Liquefaction was also a significant issue, especially in the heavily damaged Marina District of San Francisco, but its effects were also seen in the East Bay, and near the shore of Monterey Bay, where a non-destructive tsunami was also observed.\\r\\nDue to the sports coverage of the 1989 World Series, it became the first major earthquake in the United States that was broadcast live on national television (and is sometimes referred to as the \\"World Series earthquake\\" as a result). Rush-hour traffic on the Bay Area freeways was lighter than normal because the game was about to begin, and this may have prevented a larger loss of life, as several of the Bay Area's major transportation structures suffered catastrophic failures. The collapse of a section of the double-deck Nimitz Freeway in Oakland was the site of the largest number of casualties for the event, but the collapse of man-made structures and other related accidents contributed to casualties occurring in San Francisco, Los Altos, and Santa Cruz.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe history of earthquake investigations in California has been largely focused on the San Andreas Fault System, due to its strong influence in the state as the boundary between the Pacific Plate and the North American Plate; it is the most studied fault on Earth. Andrew Lawson, a geologist from the University of California, Berkeley, had named the fault after the San Andreas Lake (prior to the occurrence of the 1906 San Francisco earthquake) and later led an investigation into that event. The San Andreas Fault ruptured for a length of 290?mi (470?km) during the 1906 shock, both to the north of San Francisco and to the south in the Santa Cruz Mountains region. Several long term forecasts for a large shock along the San Andreas Fault in that area had been made public prior to 1989 (the event and its aftershocks occurred within a recognized seismic gap) but the earthquake that transpired was not what had been anticipated. The 1989 Loma Prieta event originated on an undiscovered oblique-slip reverse fault that is located adjacent to the San Andreas Fault.[8]\\r\\nSince many forecasts had been presented for the region near Loma Prieta, seismologists were not taken by surprise by the October 1989 event. Between 1910 and 1989 there were 20 widely varying forecasts that were announced, with some that were highly specific, covering multiple aspects of an event, while others were less complete and vague. With a M6.5 event on the San Juan Bautista segment, or an M7 event on the San Francisco Peninsula segment, United States Geological Survey (USGS) seismologist Allan Lindh's 1983 forecasted rupture length of 25 miles (40?km) (starting near Pajaro Gap, and continuing to the northwest) for the San Juan Bautista segment nearly matched the actual rupture length of the 1989 event. An updated forecast was presented in 1988, at which time Lindh took the opportunity to assign a new name to the San Juan Bautista segment ÿ the Loma Prieta segment.[9]\\r\\nIn early 1988, the Working Group for California Earthquake Probabilities (WGCEP) made several statements regarding their forecasts for the 225?mi (360?km) northern San Andreas Fault segment, the 56?mi (90?km) San Francisco Peninsula segment, and a 18.8ÿ22?mi (30ÿ35?km) portion of that segment which was referred to as the southern Santa Cruz Mountains segment. The thirty year probability for one or more M7 earthquakes in the study area was given as 50%, but because of a lack of information and low confidence, a 30% probability was assigned to the Southern Santa Cruz Mountains segment. Two moderate shocks, referred to as the Lake Elsman earthquakes by the USGS, occurred in the Santa Cruz Mountains region in June 1988 and again in August 1989. Following each event, the State office of Emergency Services issued (for the first time in Bay Area history) short term advisories for a possible large earthquake, which meant there was \\"a slightly increased likelihood of an M6.5 event on the Santa Cruz Mountains segment of the San Andreas fault\\". The advisories following the two Lake Elsman events were issued in part because of the statements made by WGCEP and because they were two of the three largest shocks to occur along the 1906 earthquake's rupture zone since 1914.[6][9]\\r\\nThe M5.3 June 1988 and the M5.4 August 1989 events (local magnitude) also occurred on previously unknown oblique reverse faults and were within 3?mi (4.8?km) of the M6.9 Loma Prieta mainshock epicenter, near the intersection of the San Andreas and Sargent faults. Total displacement for these shocks was relatively small (approximately 4?in (100?mm) of strike-slip and substantially less reverse-slip) and although they occurred on separate faults and well before the mainshock, a group of seismologists considered these to be foreshocks due to their location in space and time relative to the main event. Each event's aftershock sequence and effect on stress drop was closely examined, and their study indicated that the shocks affected the mainshock's rupture process. Following the August 8, 1989, shock, in anticipation of an upcoming large earthquake, staff at the University of California, Santa Cruz deployed four accelerometers in the area, which were positioned at the UCSC campus, two residences in Santa Cruz, and a home in Los Gatos. Unlike other nearby (high gain) seismographs that were overwhelmed (driven off scale) by the large magnitude mainshock, the four accelerometers captured a useful record of the main event and more than half an hour of the early aftershock activity.[6][10]\\r\\nThe June 27, 1988, shock occurred with a maximum intensity of VI (Strong). Its effects included broken windows in Los Gatos, and other light damage in Holy City, where increased flow was observed at a water well. Farther away from the Santa Cruz Mountains, pieces of concrete fell from a parking structure at the Sunnyvale Town Center, a two-level shopping mall in Santa Clara County. More moderate damage resulted from the August 8, 1989, shock (intensity VII, Very strong) when chimneys were toppled in Cupertino, Los Gatos, and Redwood Estates. Other damage included cracked walls and foundations and broken underground pipes. At the office of the Los Gatos City Manager, a window that was cracked had also been broken in the earlier shock. Also in Los Gatos, one man died when he exited a building through a window and fell five stories.[1][11]\\r\\nThe Loma Prieta earthquake was named for Loma Prieta Peak in the Santa Cruz Mountains, which lies just to the east of the mainshock epicenter. The duration of the heaviest shaking in the Santa Cruz Mountains was about 15 seconds, but strong ground motion recordings revealed that the duration of shaking was not uniform throughout the affected area (due to different types and thicknesses of soil). At sites with rocky terrain, the duration was shorter and the shaking was much less intense, and at locations with unconsolidated soil (like the Marina District or the Cypress Street Viaduct) the intensity of the shaking was more severe and lasted longer. The strong motion records also allowed for the causative fault to be determined ÿ the rupture was related to the San Andreas Fault System.[7]\\r\\nWhile a Mercalli Intensity of VIII (Severe) covered a large swath of territory relatively close to the epicenter (including the cities of Los Gatos, Santa Cruz, and Watsonville) further to the north, portions of San Francisco were assessed at intensity IX (Violent). At more than 44 miles (70?km) distant, the San Francisco Bay Area recorded peak horizontal accelerations that were as high as 0.26g, and close to the epicenter they peaked at more than 0.6g. In a general way, the location of aftershocks of the event delineated the extent of the faulting, which (according to seismologist Bruce Bolt) extended about 24 miles (40?km) in length. Because the rupture took place bilaterally, the duration of strong shaking was about half of what it would have been had it ruptured in one direction only. The duration of a typical M6.9 shock with a comparable rupture length would have been about twice as long.[7]\\r\\nGregory Beroza, a seismologist with Stanford University, made several distinctions regarding the 1906 and 1989 events. Near Loma Prieta, the 1906 rupture was more shallow, had more strike-slip, and occurred on a fault that was near vertical. The 1989 event's oblique-slip rupture was at 10?km and below on a fault plane that dipped 70 to the southwest. Because much of the slip in 1989 occurred at depth and the rupture propagated up dip, Beroza proposed that the overlying San Andreas Fault actually inhibited further rupture and also maintains that the occurrence of an event at the location that was forecast by the WGCEP in 1988 was coincidental.[12]\\r\\nThe contrasting characteristics of the 1906 and 1989 events were examined by seismologists Hiroo Kanamori and Kenji Satake. The significant amount of vertical displacement in 1989 was a key aspect to consider because a long-term sequence of 1989-type events (with an 80ÿ100-year recurrence interval) normally result in regions with high topographic relief, which is not seen in the Santa Cruz Mountains. Three scenarios were presented that might explain this disparity. The first is that the geometry of the San Andreas Fault goes through a transition every several thousand years. Secondly, slip type could vary from event to event. And lastly, the 1989 event did not occur on the San Andreas Fault.[13]\\r\\nWhile the effects of a four-year drought limited the potential of landslides, the steep terrain near the epicenter was prone to movement, and up to 4,000 landslides may have occurred during the event. The majority of landslides occurred to the southwest of the epicenter, especially along road cuts in the Santa Cruz Mountains and in the Summit Road area, but also along the bluffs of the Pacific Coast, and as far north as the Marin Peninsula. Highway 17 was blocked for several weeks due to a large slide and one person was killed by a rockfall along the coast. Other areas with certain soil conditions were susceptible to site amplification due to the effects of liquefaction, especially near the shore of San Francisco Bay (where its effects were severe in the Marina District) and to the west of the epicenter near rivers and other bodies of water. Minor lateral spreading was also seen along the shores of San Francisco Bay and to the south near Monterey Bay. Other ground effects included downslope movement, slumps, and ground cracks.[2]\\r\\nFifty-seven of the deaths were directly caused by the earthquake; six further fatalities were ruled to have been caused indirectly.[14] In addition, there were 3,757 injuries as a result of the earthquake, 400 of which were serious.[15][16] The highest number of fatalities, 42,[17] occurred in Oakland because of the Cypress Street Viaduct collapse on the Nimitz Freeway (Interstate 880), where the upper level of a double-deck portion of the freeway collapsed, crushing the cars on the lower level, and causing crashes on the upper level. One 50-foot (15?m) section of the San FranciscoÿOakland Bay Bridge also collapsed, leading to a single fatality, a 23-year-old woman named Anamafi Moala.[18][19] Three people were killed in the collapse of buildings along the Pacific Garden Mall in Santa Cruz,[citation needed] and five people were killed in the collapse of a brick wall on Bluxome Street in San Francisco.[citation needed]\\r\\nWhen the earthquake hit, the third game of the 1989 World Series baseball championship was about to begin. Because of the unusual circumstance that both of the World Series teams (the San Francisco Giants and Oakland Athletics) were based in the affected area, many people had left work early or were staying late to participate in after work group viewings and parties. As a consequence the normally crowded freeways contained unusually light traffic. If traffic had been normal for a Tuesday rush hour, injuries and deaths would certainly have been higher. The initial media reports failed to take into account the game's effect on traffic and initially estimated the death toll at 300, a number that was corrected to 63 in the days after the earthquake.[20][21]\\r\\nAfter the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake occurred, a group led by Antony C. Fraser-Smith of Stanford University reported that the event was preceded by disturbances in background magnetic field noise as measured by a sensor placed in Corralitos, California, about 4.5 miles (7?km) from the epicenter.[22] From October 5, they reported a substantial increase in noise was measured in the frequency range 0.01ÿ10?Hz.[22] The measurement instrument was a single-axis search-coil magnetometer that was being used for low frequency research.[22] Precursor increases of noise apparently started a few days before the earthquake, with noise in the range 0.01ÿ0.5?Hz rising to exceptionally high levels about three hours before the earthquake.[22] Though this pattern gave scientists new ideas for research into potential precursors to earthquakes, and the Fraser-Smith et al. report remains one of the most frequently cited examples of a specific earthquake precursor, more recent studies have cast doubt on the connection, attributing the Corralitos signals to either unrelated magnetic disturbance or,[23] even more simply, to sensor-system malfunction.[24]\\r\\nThe earthquake caused severe damage in some very specific locations in the San Francisco Bay Area, most notably on unstable soil in San Francisco and Oakland. Oakland City Hall was evacuated after the earthquake until US$80M seismic retrofit and hazard abatement work was completed in 1995.[26] Many other communities sustained severe damage throughout the region located in Alameda, San Mateo, Santa Clara, San Benito, Santa Cruz and Monterey counties. Major property damage in San Francisco's Marina District 60?mi (97?km) from the epicenter resulted from liquefaction of soil used to create waterfront land. Other effects included sand volcanoes, landslides and ground ruptures. Some 12,000 homes and 2,600 businesses were damaged.[15]\\r\\nIn Santa Cruz, close to the epicenter, 40 buildings collapsed, killing six people.[27] At the Santa Cruz Beach Boardwalk, the Plunge Building was significantly damaged.[28] Liquefaction also caused damage in the Watsonville area.[29] For example, sand volcanoes formed in a field near Pajaro as well as in a strawberry field.[29] The Ford's department store in Watsonville experienced significant damage, including a crack down the front of the building.[29] Many homes were dislodged if they were not bolted to their foundations.[29] There were structural failures of twin bridges across Struve Slough near Watsonville.[29] In Moss Landing, the liquefaction destroyed the causeway that carried the Moss Beach access road across tidewater basin, damaged the approach and abutment of the bridge linking Moss Landing spit to the mainland and cracked the paved road on Paul's Island.[30] In the Old Town historical district of the city of Salinas, unreinforced masonry buildings were partially destroyed.[31]\\r\\nAn estimated 1.4 million people lost power following the quake, mainly due to damaged electrical substations.[32] Many San Francisco radio and television stations were temporarily knocked off the air.[33] KRON-TV was off the air for about half an hour,[34] while KGO-AM was off the air for about 40 minutes.[33] About an hour and 40 minutes after the quake, KTVU resumed broadcasting, with their news anchors reporting from the station's parking lot.[35][36] KCBS-AM switched immediately to backup power and managed to stay on air despite a subsequent generator failure.[33] KCBS later won a Peabody Award for their news coverage, as did KGO-TV.[37] Power was restored to most of San Francisco by midnight, and all but 12,000 customers had their power restored within two days.[32]\\r\\nThe quake caused an estimated $6 billion[15] in property damage, becoming one of the most expensive natural disasters in U.S. history at the time. Private donations poured into aid relief efforts and on October 26, President George H. W. Bush signed a $1.1 billion earthquake relief package for California.[38]\\r\\nFour people died in San Francisco's Marina District, four buildings were destroyed by fire, and seven buildings collapsed. Another 63 damaged structures were judged too dangerous to live in.[39] Among the four deaths, one family lost their infant son who choked on dust while trapped for an hour inside their collapsed apartment.[18]\\r\\nThe Marina district was built on a landfill made of a mixture of sand, dirt, rubble, waste and other materials containing a high percentage of groundwater. Some of the fill was rubble dumped into San Francisco Bay after the 1906 San Francisco earthquake, but most was sand and debris laid down in preparation for the 1915 Panama-Pacific International Exposition, a celebration of San Francisco's ability to rebound after its catastrophe in 1906.[40] After the Exposition, apartment buildings were erected on the landfill. In the 1989 earthquake, the water-saturated unconsolidated mud, sand and rubble suffered liquefaction, and the earthquake's vertical shock waves rippled the ground more severely.[41]\\r\\nAt the intersection of Beach and Divisadero Streets in San Francisco, a natural gas main rupture caused a major structure fire.[42][43][44] The fire department selected bystanders to help run fire hoses from a distance because the nearby hydrant system failed. Since the bay was only two blocks from the burning buildings,[44] water from the bay was pumped by the fireboat Phoenix, to engines on the shore, and from there sprayed on the fire.[45][46] The apartment structures that collapsed were older buildings that included ground floor garages, which engineers refer to as a soft story building.[47]\\r\\nIn Santa Cruz, the Pacific Garden Mall was severely damaged, with falling debris killing three people, half of the six earthquake deaths in Santa Cruz and Monterey Counties.[27] Some 31 buildings were damaged enough to warrant demolition, seven of which had been listed in the Santa Cruz Historic Building Survey.[48] The four oldest were built in 1894, the five oldest withstood the 1906 San Francisco earthquake.[48]\\r\\nImmediately, a number of civilians began to free victims from the rubble of Ford's Department Store and the Santa Cruz Coffee Roasting Companyboth buildings had collapsed inward on customers and employees alike.[27] Two police officers crawled through voids in the debris, found one victim alive and another dead inside the coffee house.[49] Santa Cruz beach lifeguards assisted in moving the victims.[49] Police dogs were brought in to help locate other victims.[49] A woman was found dead inside Ford's.[50] The civilians who were helpful initially, were soon viewed by police and fire officials as a hindrance to operations, with frantic coworkers and friends of a coffee house employee thought to be trapped under the rubble continuing their efforts in the dark.[49] Police arrested those who refused to stop searching. This became a political issue in the following days.[51] The body of a young woman coffee worker was found under a collapsed wall late the next day.[52]\\r\\nDuring the first few days following the quake, electric power to most Santa Cruz County subscribers was out, and some areas had no water. Limited phone service remained online, providing a crucial link to rescue workers.[51] Widespread search operations were organized to find possible victims inside the remains of fallen structures. As many as six teams of dogs and their handlers were at work identifying the large number of damaged buildings that held no victims.[51]\\r\\nThe quake claimed one life in Watsonville:[51] a driver who collided with panicked horses after they escaped their collapsed corral.[53] In other Santa Cruz and Monterey county locations such as Boulder Creek and Moss Landing, a number of structures were damaged, with some knocked off of their foundations.[54] Many residents slept outside their homes out of concern for further damage from aftershocks, of which there were 51 with magnitudes greater than 3.0 in the following 24 hours, and 16 more the second day.[54] The earthquake damaged several historic buildings in the Old Town district of Salinas, and some were later demolished.[55]\\r\\nThe San FranciscoÿOakland Bay Bridge suffered severe damage, as a 76-by-50-foot (23?m G?15?m) section of the upper deck on the eastern cantilever side fell onto the deck below. The quake caused the Oakland side of the bridge to shift 7?in (18?cm) to the east, and caused the bolts of one section to shear off, sending the 250-short-ton (230?t) section of roadbed crashing down like a trapdoor.[56] Traffic on both decks came to a halt, blocked by the section of roadbed. Police began unsnarling the traffic jam, telling drivers to turn their cars around and drive back the way they had come. Eastbound drivers stuck on the lower deck between the collapse and Yerba Buena Island were routed up to the upper deck and westward back to San Francisco. A miscommunication made by emergency workers at Yerba Buena Island routed some drivers the wrong way; they were directed to the upper deck where they drove eastward toward the collapse site.[18] One of these drivers did not see the open gap in time; the car plunged over the edge and smashed onto the collapsed roadbed. The driver, Anamafi Moala, died, and the passenger was seriously injured.[42][57] Caltrans removed and replaced the collapsed section, and re-opened the bridge on November 18.[41]\\r\\nThe worst disaster of the earthquake was the collapse of the two-level Cypress Street Viaduct of Interstate 880 in West Oakland. The failure of a 1.25-mile (2.0?km) section[58] of the viaduct, also known as the \\"Cypress Structure\\" and the \\"Cypress Freeway\\",[18] killed 42 and injured many more.[59]\\r\\nBuilt in the late 1950s, the Cypress Street Viaduct, a stretch of Interstate 880, was a double-deck freeway section made of nonductile reinforced concrete[60] that was constructed above and astride Cypress Street in Oakland. Roughly half of the land the Cypress Viaduct was built on was filled marshland, and half was somewhat more stable alluvium.[61] Because of new highway structure design guidelinesthe requirement of ductile construction elementsinstituted following the 1971 San Fernando earthquake, a limited degree of earthquake reinforcement was retrofitted to the Cypress Viaduct in 1977. The added elements were longitudinal restraints at transverse expansion joints in the box girder spans, but no studies were made of possible failure modes specific to the Cypress Viaduct.[60] When the earthquake hit, the shaking was amplified on the former marshland, and soil liquefaction occurred.[54]\\r\\nDuring the earthquake, the freeway buckled and twisted to its limits before the support columns failed and sent the upper deck crashing to the lower deck. In an instant, 41 people were crushed to death in their cars. Cars on the upper deck were tossed around violently, some of them flipped sideways and some of them were left dangling at the edge of the highway. Nearby residents and factory workers came to the rescue, climbing onto the wreckage with ladders and forklifts[25] and pulling trapped people out of their mangled cars from under a four-foot gap in some sections. Sixty members of Oakland's Public Works Agency left the nearby city yard and joined rescue efforts.[58] Employees from Pacific Pipe (a now-closed factory adjoining the freeway) drove heavy lift equipment to the scene and started using it to raise sections of fallen freeway enough to allow further rescue. Hard-hatted factory workers continued their volunteer operation nonstop until October 21, 1989, when they were forced to pause as U.S. President George H. W. Bush and California Governor George Deukmejian viewed the damage.[62] The efforts of the rescue workers finally yielded results on October 21, just after dawn, when survivor Buck Helm was freed from the wreckage, having spent 90 hours trapped in his crushed car under the rubble.[63] Dubbed \\"Lucky Buck\\" by the local radio, Helm lived for another 29 days on life support, but then died of respiratory failure at the age of 57.[64]\\r\\nRebuilding the freeway took nine years.[65] In the meantime, traffic was detoured through nearby Interstate 980, causing increased congestion.[65] Instead of rebuilding Interstate 880 over the same ground, Caltrans rerouted the freeway farther west around the outskirts of West Oakland to provide better access to the Port of Oakland and the San FranciscoÿOakland Bay Bridge, and to meet community desires to keep the freeway from cutting through residential areas. Street-level Mandela Parkway now occupies the previous roadbed of the Cypress structure.[66]\\r\\nImmediately after the earthquake, San Francisco Bay Area airports were closed so officials could conduct visual inspection and damage assessment procedures. San Jose International Airport,[67] Oakland International Airport and San Francisco International Airport all opened the next morning.[68] Large cracks in Oakland's runway and taxiway reduced the usable length to two-thirds normal, and damage to the dike required quick remediation to avoid flooding the runway with water from the bay. Oakland Airport repair costs were assessed at $30 million.[69]\\r\\nSan Francisco Municipal Railway (Muni) lost all power to electric transit systems when the quake hit, but otherwise suffered little damage and no injuries to operators or riders.[70] Cable cars and electric trains and buses were stalled in placehalf of Muni's transport capability was lost for 12 hours. Muni relied on diesel buses to continue abbreviated service until electric power was restored later that night, and electric units could be inspected and readied for service on the morning of October 18.[70] After 78 hours, 96 percent of Muni services were back in operation, including the cable cars.[70] Amtrak intercity rail service into Oakland from the California Zephyr continued, but the Coast Starlight was temporarily suspended north of Salinas because of damage to the Southern Pacific's Coast Line.[71]\\r\\nThe earthquake changed the Bay Area's automobile transportation landscape. Not only did the quake force seismic retrofitting of all San Francisco Bay Area bridges,[72] it caused enough damage that some parts of the region's freeway system had to be demolished.[73] Damage to the region's transportation system was estimated at $1.8 billion.[54]\\r\\nThe 1989 World Series featured the Oakland Athletics and the San Francisco Giants in the first cross-town World Series since 1956. Game 3 of the series was scheduled to begin at San Francisco's Candlestick Park on October 17 at 17:35 PDT, and American TV network ABC began its pre-game show at 17:00 PDT. When the quake struck at approximately 17:04, sportscaster Tim McCarver was narrating taped highlights of Game 2, which had been played two days earlier across the Bay Bridge in Oakland. Television viewers saw the video signal begin to break up, heard McCarver repeat a sentence as the shaking distracted him, and heard McCarver's colleague Al Michaels exclaim, \\"I'll tell you what, we're having an earth.\\"[53] At that moment, the signal from Candlestick Park was lost.[82]\\r\\nThe network put up a green ABC Sports graphic while it scrambled to repair the video feed (the broadcast cameras and mics were powered by the local power supply), but audio from the stadium was restored after a few seconds via a telephone link. Michaels had to pick up a POTS phone in the press booth (phones work off a separate power supply) and call ABC headquarters in New York, at which point they put him back on the air. Michaels cracked, \\"Well, folks, that's the greatest open in the history of television, bar none!\\" accompanied by the combined screams of excitement and panic from fans who had no idea of the devastation elsewhere.[83] ABC then switched to an episode of Roseanne which was on standby for a rain delay situation, while attempting to restore electricity to its remote equipment.\\r\\nWith anchorman Ted Koppel in position in Washington, D.C., ABC News began continuous coverage of the quake at about 5:40?p.m., at the same time as CBS News; Al Michaels, in the process, became a de facto on-site reporter for ABC.[34] NBC News also began continuous coverage, with Tom Brokaw, about an hour later.[34] The Goodyear blimp had already been overhead to cover the baseball game, and ABC used it to capture images of damage to the Bay Bridge and other locations.[33]\\r\\nInside Candlestick Park, fewer than half of the more than 62,000 fans[18] had reached their seats by the time of the quake, and the load on the structure of the stadium was lower than maximum.[84] There had also been a seismic-strengthening project previously completed on the upper deck concrete windscreen that may have prevented large numbers of injuries in the event of serious damage or even a catastrophic collapse.[85] Fans reported that the stadium moved in an articulated manner as the earthquake wave passed through it, that the light standards swayed by many feet, and that the concrete upper deck windscreen moved in a wave-like manner over a distance of several feet. When electrical power to the stadium was lost, someone drove a police car onto the field, where an officer used the car's public address system to advise that the game had been postponed. After the shaking subsided, many of the players on both teams immediately searched for, and gathered, family and friends from the stands before evacuating the facility.[84]\\r\\nThe October 18, 1989 edition NBC's Today that covered the earthquake ran until noon Eastern Time. Bryant Gumbel, Jane Pauley and Deborah Norville anchored from Chicago (where they had planned to originally do a special celebratory edition), with reports done by Bob Jamieson and Don Oliver in San Francisco, and George Lewis in Oakland. Jim Miklasewski and Bob Hager covered disaster response from Washington. NBC Sports commentators Bob Costas and Jimmy Cefalo discussed the effect the temblor would have on the 1989 World Series.\\r\\nThe World Series was delayed while the Bay Area started the recovery process. While the teams' stadiums had suffered only minor damage, it took several days for power and transmission links at Candlestick Park to be repaired. After ten days (the longest delay in World Series history), Game 3 was held in San Francisco on October 27 and Game 4 the following afternoon as the A's swept the Giants, four games to none.[84]\\r\\nIt is likely that the World Series game saved many lives as Bay Area residents; who would have normally been on the freeways, were at home ready to watch the game when the earthquake hit. It is a rough estimate that thousands of people may have otherwise been on the Cypress Structure during the 5:00?p.m. rush-hour, as the structure was said to have carried 195,000 vehicles a day.[86]\\r\\nSources","input":"When did san francisco last have an earthquake?"},{"output":"Kanshi Ram","context":"The Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) is the third largest national political party in the Indian state of Uttar Pradesh.[7] It was formed mainly to represent Bahujans (literally meaning \\"People in minority\\"), referring to people from the Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and Other Backward Castes (OBC), as well as religious minorities that together consist of 65 percent of India's population but still divided into 6000 different castes.[8][9]\\r\\nThe party claims to be inspired by the philosophy of Gautama Buddha, B.

The \\"Bahujan Samaj\\", to them, includes the lower-caste groups in India like the Scheduled Castes (SC), the Scheduled Tribes (ST) and the Other Backward Classes (OBC). It also includes religious minorities like Sikhs, Muslims, Christians, Parsis and Buddhists. They see these groups as having been victims of the \\"Manuwadi\\" system for millennia, a system which benefited upper-caste Hindus only. They hold B.R. Ambedkar, champion of lower-caste rights, as one of their key icons and ideological inspirations. They also believe in egalitarianism and hold a strong emphasis on social justice.\\r\\nThe Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) was founded on the birth anniversary of Dr. B. R. Ambedkar (i.e. 14 April 1984) by Kanshi Ram,[17] who named former schoolteacher Mayawati as his successor in 2001.[18]\\r\\nSpeaking of lesser-known figures from the Indian Rebellion of 1857 who have been used as Dalit icons by the BSP, such as Chetram Jatav, the social scientist Badri Narayan Tiwari has noted that\\r\\nDalit intellectuals supported by BSP, which is trying to mobilise grassroot Dalits using local heroes, histories, myths and legends found a wealth of resources in the oral history of the regions of [Uttar Pradesh] centering around the 1857 rebellion. The political strategy of the party is to tell and retell the stories of these heroes, build memorials and organize celebrations around their stories repeatedly to build a collective memory in the psyche of the people. The stories are narrated in such a manner that the Dalits imagine the story of the making of this nation in which they played a significant role.[19]\\r\\nThe party's power grew quickly with seats in the Legislative Assembly of Uttar Pradesh and the Lok Sabha, the lower house of the Parliament of India. In 1993, following the assembly elections, Mayawati formed a coalition with Samajwadi Party President Mulayam Singh Yadav as Chief Minister. On 2 June 1995, she withdrew support from his government, which led to a major incident where Yadav was accused of sending his goons to keep her party legislators hostage at a Lucknow guest house and shout casteist abuses at her.[20] Since this event, they have regarded each other publicly as chief rivals.[21]\\r\\nMayawati then obtained support from the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) to become Chief Minister on 3 June 1995. In October 1995, the BJP withdrew their support and fresh elections were called after a period of President's Rule. In 2003, Mayawati resigned from her own government to prove that she was not \\"hungry for power\\"[22] and asked the BJP-run Government of India to remove Union Tourism and Culture Minister, Jagmohan.[23] In 2007, she began leading a BSP-formed government with an absolute majority for a full five-year term.[24]\\r\\nThe results of the May 2007 Uttar Pradesh state assembly election saw the BSP emerge as a sole majority party, the first to do so since 1991. Mayawati began her fourth term as Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh and took her oath of office along with 50 ministers of cabinet and state rank on 13 May 2007, at Rajbhawan in the state capital of Lucknow.[25] Most importantly, the majority achieved in large part was due to the party's ability to take away majority of upper castes votes from their traditional party, the BJP.[26]\\r\\nThe party could manage only 80 seats in 2012 as against 206 in 2007 assembly elections. BSP government was the first in the history of Uttar Pradesh to complete its full five-year term.[27] On 11 July 2012, the party in a major revamp, replaced Swami Prasad Maurya by Ram Achal Rajbhar as President of UP Unit.[28]\\r\\nThe 2014 national Lok Sabha elections saw the BSP become the third-largest national party of India in terms of vote percentage, having 4.2% of the vote across the country but gaining no seats.[29]\\r\\nOn 9 August 2009; Mayawati declared that she had chosen a successor from the Dalit community who is 18ÿ20 years her junior. She has penned down his name in a sealed packet left in the safe custody of two of her close confidantes. The name of the successor will be disclosed on her death.[30]","input":"Who formed bsp what are its main policies?"},{"output":"March 1941","context":"","input":"When was the first captain america comic made?"},{"output":"El Paso County","context":"El Paso County is the westernmost county in the U.S. state of Texas.

BARC is a multi-disciplinary research centre with extensive infrastructure for advanced research and development covering the entire spectrum of nuclear science, engineering and related areas.\\r\\nBARC's core mandate is to sustain peaceful applications of nuclear energy, primarily for power generation. It manages all facts of nuclear power generation, from theoretical design of reactors, computerised modelling and simulation, risk analysis, development and testing of new reactor fuel materials, etc. It also conducts research in spent fuel processing, and safe disposal of nuclear waste. Its other research focus areas are applications for isotopes in industries, medicine, agriculture, etc. BARC operates a number of research reactors across the country.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Government of India created the Atomic Energy Establishment, Trombay (AEET) on 3 January 1954. It was established to consolidate all the research and development activity for nuclear reactors and technology under the Atomic Energy Commission. All scientists and engineers engaged in the fields of reactor design and development, instrumentation, metallurgy and material science etc. were transferred with their respective programmes from the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research (TIFR) to AEET, with TIFR retaining its original focus for fundamental research in the sciences. After Homi J. Bhabha's death in 1966, the centre was renamed as the Bhabha Atomic Research Centre on 22 January 1967. All the directors of the BARC were highly qualified doctorates in their discipline and were internationally recognised for their contribution in academia, who were the crown of this prestigious research organisation.[1]\\r\\nThe first reactors at BARC and its affiliated power generation centres were imported from the west. India's first power reactors, installed at the Tarapur Atomic Power Station were from the United States.\\r\\nThe primary importance of BARC is as a research centre. The BARC and the Indian government has consistently maintained that the reactors are used for this purpose only: Apsara (1956; named by the then Prime Minister of India, Jawaharlal Nehru when he likened the blue Cerenkov radiation to the beauty of the Apsaras), CIRUS (1960; the \\"Canada-India Reactor\\" with assistance from the US), the now-defunct ZERLINA (1961; Zero Energy Reactor for Lattice Investigations and Neutron Assay), Purnima I (1972), Purnima II (1984), Dhruva (1985), Purnima III (1990), and KAMINI.\\r\\nThe plutonium used in India's 1974 Smiling Buddha nuclear test came from CIRUS. The 1974 test (and the 1998 tests that followed) gave Indian scientists the technological know-how and confidence not only to develop nuclear fuel for future reactors to be used in power generation and research, but also the capacity to refine the same fuel into weapons-grade fuel to be used in the development of nuclear weapons. It is one of the world's most important ATOMIC RESEARCH CENTRE.\\r\\nBARC also designed and built India's first Pressurised water reactor at Kalpakkam, a 80MW land based prototype of INS Arihant's nuclear power unit,[3] as well as the Arihant's propulsion reactor.[4][5]\\r\\nIndia is not a part of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), citing concerns that it unfairly favours the established nuclear powers, and provides no provision for complete nuclear disarmament. Indian officials argued that India's refusal to sign the treaty stemmed from its fundamentally discriminatory character; the treaty places restrictions on the non-nuclear weapons states but does little to curb the modernisation and expansion of the nuclear arsenals of the nuclear weapons states.[6][7]\\r\\nMore recently, India and the United States signed an agreement to enhance nuclear cooperation between the two countries, and for India to participate in an international consortium on fusion research, ITER (International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor) so there are signs that the west wants to bring India in the Nuclear mainstream.[8][9]\\r\\nThe BARC also conducts research in biotechnology at the Gamma Gardens, and has developed numerous disease resistant and high-yielding crop varieties, particularly groundnuts. It also conducts research in Liquid Metal Magnetohydrodynamics for power generation.\\r\\nOn 4 June 2005, with the goal of encouraging research in basic sciences, BARC started the Homi Bhabha National Institute. Research institutions affiliated to BARC(Bhabha Atomic Research Centre) include IGCAR (Indira Gandhi Centre for Atomic Research), RRCAT (Raja Ramanna Centre for Advanced Technology), and VECC (Variable Energy Cyclotron Centre).\\r\\nPower projects that have benefited from BARC expertise but which fall under the NPCIL (Nuclear Power Corporation of India Limited) are KAPP (Kakrapar Atomic Power Project), RAPP (Rajasthan Atomic Power Project), and TAPP (Tarapur Atomic Power Project).\\r\\nThe Bhabha Atomic Research Centre in addition to its nuclear research mandate, also conducts research in other high technology areas like accelerators, micro electron beams, materials design, supercomputers, and computer vision among the few.

The Act was drafted during President Franklin D. Roosevelt's first term by the President's Committee on Economic Security, under Frances Perkins, and passed by Congress as part of the New Deal. The Act was an attempt to limit what were seen as dangers in the modern American life, including old age, poverty, unemployment, and the burdens of widows and fatherless children. By signing this Act on August 14, 1935, President Roosevelt became the first president to advocate federal assistance for the elderly.[3]\\r\\nThe Act provided benefits to retirees and the unemployed, and a lump-sum benefit at death. Payments to current retirees are financed by a payroll tax on current workers' wages, half directly as a payroll tax and half paid by the employer. The act also gave money to states to provide assistance to aged individuals (Title I), for unemployment insurance (Title III), Aid to Families with Dependent Children (Title IV), Maternal and Child Welfare (Title V), public health services (Title VI), and the blind (Title X).[3]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe idea of a federally funded pension plan was popularized by Francis Townsend in 1933, and the influence of the \\"Townsend Plan\\" movement on debate over social security persisted into the 1950s.[4][5] Early debates on Social Security's design centered on how the program's benefits should be funded. Some believed that benefits to individuals should be funded by contributions that they themselves had made over the course of their careers. Others argued that this design would disadvantage those who had already begun their careers at the time of the program's implementation because they would not have enough time to accumulate adequate benefits.[6]\\r\\nSocial Security was controversial when originally proposed, with one point of opposition being that it would reduce the labor force, but supporters argued instead that retiring older workers would free up employment for young men, which during the Depression was a vital point of concern.\\r\\nOpponents also decried the proposal as socialism.[7][8][9] In a Senate Finance Committee hearing, one Senator asked Secretary of Labor Frances Perkins, \\"Isn't this socialism?\\" She said that it was not, but he continued, \\"Isn't this a teeny-weeny bit of socialism?\\"[10]\\r\\nMost women and minorities were excluded from the benefits of unemployment insurance and old age pensions.[11] Job categories that were not covered by the act included workers in agricultural labor, domestic service, government employees, and many teachers, nurses, hospital employees, librarians, and social workers.[12] The act also denied coverage to individuals who worked intermittently.[13] These jobs were dominated by women and minorities. For example, women made up 90 percent of domestic labor in 1940 and two-thirds of all employed black women were in domestic service.[14] Exclusions exempted nearly half of the working population.[13] Nearly two-thirds of all African Americans in the labor force, 70 to 80 percent in some areas in the South, and just over half of all women employed were not covered by Social Security.[15][16] At the time, the NAACP protested the Social Security Act, describing it as \\"a sieve with holes just big enough for the majority of Negroes to fall through.\\"[16]\\r\\nSome writers have suggested that this discrimination resulted from the powerful position of Southern Democrats on two of the committees pivotal for the Act's creation, the Senate Finance Committee and the House Ways and Means Committee. However, Larry DeWitt has refuted those arguments, showing there was no evidence for them. Indeed, southern Democrats in 1935 were generally liberal and strongly supported of the New Deal and Social Security. They became much more conservative after 1937.[citation needed] The Social Security law was very unpopular among many groups, especially farmers, who resented the additional taxes and feared they would never be made good. They lobbied hard for exclusion. Furthermore, the Treasury realized how difficult it would be to set up payroll deduction plans for farmers, for housekeepers who employed maids, and for nonprofit groups; therefore they were excluded. State employees were excluded for constitutional reasons (the federal government cannot tax state government). Federal employees were also excluded. Many textbooks, however, falsely indicate that the exclusions were the product of southern racial hostility toward blacks; there is no evidence of that in the record.[17] Other scholars have replicated and endorsed DeWitt's analysis, agreeing that the exclusions were made by policy experts on technical grounds and were not grounded on racial hostility. Rodems and Shaefer note in all other countries unemployment insurance programs \\"excluded domestic and agricultural workers when they were first implemented, a fact that the key New Deal policy makers were well aware of.\\"[18] The exclusions followed consultation with leading experts in Europe as well as the United States, including William Beveridge, Henry Steel-Maitland, and R.C. Davison in Britain, Andre Tixier of the International Labour Organization, and Edwin Witte, Wilbur J. Cohen, and Evelyn Burns in the United States.[19]\\r\\nSocial Security reinforced traditional views of family life.[20] Women generally qualified for benefits only through their husbands or children.[20] Mothers' pensions (Title IV) based entitlements on the presumption that mothers would be unemployed.[20]\\r\\nHistorical discrimination in the system can also be seen with regard to Aid to Dependent Children. Since this money was allocated to the states to distribute, some localities assessed black families as needing less money than white families. These low grant levels made it impossible for African American mothers to not work: one requirement of the program.[21] Some states also excluded children born out of wedlock, an exclusion which affected African American women more than white women.[22] One study determined that 14.4% of eligible white individuals received funding, but only 1.5 percent of eligible black individuals received these benefits.[16]\\r\\nIn the 1930s, the Supreme Court struck down many pieces of Roosevelt's New Deal legislation, including the Railroad Retirement Act. The Social Security Act's similarity with the Railroad Retirement Act caused Edwin Witte- the executive director of the President's Committee on Economic Security under Roosevelt who was credited as \\"the father of social security\\"-[23] to question whether or not the bill would pass;[24] John Gall, an Associate Counsel for the National Association of Manufacturers who testified before the US House of Representatives in favor of the act, also felt that the bill was rushed through Congress too quickly and that the old age provision of the act was \\"hodgepodge\\" that needed to be written more properly in order to have a higher likelihood of being ruled constitutional.[25] The Court threw out a centerpiece of the New Deal, the National Industrial Recovery Act, the Agricultural Adjustment Act, and New York State's minimum-wage law. President Roosevelt responded with an attempt to pack the court via the Judicial Procedures Reform Bill of 1937. On February 5, 1937, he sent a special message to Congress proposing legislation granting the President new powers to add additional judges to all federal courts whenever there were sitting judges age 70 or older who refused to retire.[26] The practical effect of this proposal was that the President would get to appoint six new Justices to the Supreme Court (and 44 judges to lower federal courts), thus instantly tipping the political balance on the Court dramatically in his favor. The debate on this proposal was heated and widespread, and lasted over six months. Beginning with a set of decisions in March, April, and May, 1937 (including the Social Security Act cases), the Court would sustain a series of New Deal legislation.[27]\\r\\nTwo Supreme Court rulings affirmed the constitutionality of the Social Security Act.\\r\\nThe first reported Social Security payment was to Ernest Ackerman, a Cleveland motorman who retired only one day after Social Security began.[29] Five cents were withheld from his pay during that period, and he received a lump-sum payout of seventeen cents from Social Security.[29][30]\\r\\nThe first monthly payment was issued on January 31, 1940 to Ida May Fuller of Ludlow, Vermont.[31] In 1937, 1938, and 1939, she paid a total of $24.75 into the Social Security System. Her first check was for $22.54.[31] After her second check, Fuller already had received more than she contributed over the three-year period. She ultimately reached her 100th birthday, dying in 1975[31] and she collected a total of $22,888.92.[32]\\r\\nThe provisions of Social Security have been changing since the 1930s, shifting in response to economic worries as well as concerns over changing gender roles and the position of minorities. Officials have responded more to the concerns of women than those of minority groups.[33] Social Security gradually moved toward universal coverage. By 1950, debates moved away from which occupational groups should be included to how to provide more adequate coverage.[34] Changes in Social Security have reflected a balance between promoting equality and efforts to provide adequate protection.[35]\\r\\nIn 1940, benefits paid totaled $35 million. These rose to $961 million in 1950, $11.2 billion in 1960, $31.9 billion in 1970, $120.5 billion in 1980, and $247.8 billion in 1990 (all figures in nominal dollars, not adjusted for inflation). In 2004, $492 billion of benefits were paid to 47.5 million beneficiaries.[36] In 2009, nearly 51 million Americans received $650 billion in Social Security benefits.\\r\\nThe effects of Social Security took decades to manifest themselves. In 1950, it was reported that as many as 40% of Americans over 65 were still employed in some capacity, but by 1980 that figure had dropped to less than 20%. In 1990, fewer than 11% of Americans over 65 were still employed, an all-time low after which the number began to slowly rise again.\\r\\nDuring the 1950s, over-65s continued to have the highest poverty rate of any age group in the US with the largest percentage of the nation's wealth concentrated in the hands of Americans under 35. By 2010, this figure had dramatically reversed itself with the largest percentage of wealth being in the hands of Americans aged 55ÿ75 and those under 45 being among the poorest. Elder poverty, once a normal sight, had thus become rare by the 21st century.[37]\\r\\nOne reason for the proposed changes in 1939 was a growing concern over the impact that the reserves created by the 1935 act were having on the economy. The Recession of 1937 was blamed on the government, tied to the abrupt decrease in government spending and the $2 billion that had been collected in Social Security taxes.[38] Benefits became available in 1940 instead of 1942 and changes to the benefit formula increased the amount of benefits available to all recipients in the early years of Social Security.[39] These two policies combined to shrink the size of the reserves. The original Act had conceived of the program as paying benefits out of a large reserve. This Act shifted the conception of Social Security into something of a hybrid system; while reserves would still accumulate, most early beneficiaries would receive benefits on the pay-as-you-go system. Just as importantly, the changes also delayed planned rises in contribution rates. Ironically if these had been left in place they would have come into effect during the wartime boom in wages and would have arguably helped to temper wartime inflation.[40]\\r\\nThe amendments established a trust fund for any surplus funds. The managing trustee of this fund is the Secretary of the Treasury. The money could be invested in both non-marketable and marketable securities.[41]\\r\\nCalls for reform of Social Security emerged within a few years of the 1935 Act. Even as early as 1936, some believed that women were not getting enough support. Worried that a lack of assistance might push women back into the work force, these individuals wanted Social Security changes that would prevent this. In an effort to protect the family, therefore, some called for reform which tied women's aid more concretely to their dependency on their husbands.[42] Others expressed apprehension about the complicated administrative practices of Social Security.[43] Concerns about the size of the reserve fund of the retirement program, emphasized by a recession in 1937, led to further calls for change.[44]\\r\\nThese amendments, however, avoided the question of the large numbers of workers in excluded categories.[45] Instead, the amendments of 1939 made family protection a part of Social Security. This included increased federal funding for the Aid to Dependent Children and raised the maximum age of children eligible to receive money under the Aid to Dependent Children to 18. The amendment added wives, elderly widows, and dependent survivors of covered male workers to those who could receive old age pensions. These individuals had previously been granted lump-sum payments upon only death or coverage through the Aid to Dependent Children program. If a married wage-earning woman's own benefit was worth less than 50% of her husband's benefit, she was treated as a wife, not a worker.[46] If a woman who was covered by Social Security died, however, her dependents were ineligible for her benefits.[47] Since support for widows was dependent on the husband being a covered worker, African American widows were severely underrepresented and unaided by these changes.[48]\\r\\nIn order to assure fiscal conservatives who worried about the costs of adding family protection policies, the benefits for single workers were decreased and lump-sum death payments were abolished.[49]\\r\\nIn the original 1935 law, the benefit provisions were in Title II of the Act (which is why Social Security is sometimes referred to as the \\"Title II\\" program.) The taxing provisions were in a separate title (Title VIII) (for reasons related to the constitutionality of the 1935 Act). As part of the 1939 Amendments, the Title VIII taxing provisions were taken out of the Social Security Act and placed in the Internal Revenue Code and renamed the Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA). Social Security payroll taxes are thus often referred to as \\"FICA taxes.\\"\\r\\nAfter years of debates about the inclusion of domestic labor, household employees working at least two days a week for the same person were added in 1950, along with nonprofit workers and the self-employed. Hotel workers, laundry workers, all agricultural workers, and state and local government employees were added in 1954.[50]\\r\\nIn 1956, the tax rate was raised to 4.0 percent (2.0 percent for the employer, 2.0 percent for the employee) and disability benefits were added. Also in 1956, women were allowed to retire at 62 with benefits reduced by 25 percent. Widows of covered workers were allowed to retire at 62 without the reduction in benefits.[51]\\r\\nIn 1961, retirement at age 62 was extended to men, and the tax rate was increased to 6.0%.\\r\\nIn 1962, the changing role of the female worker was acknowledged when benefits of covered women could be collected by dependent husbands, widowers, and children. These individuals, however, had to be able to prove their dependency.[52]\\r\\nMedicare and Medicaid were added in 1965 by the Social Security Act of 1965, part of President Lyndon B. Johnson's \\"Great Society\\" program.\\r\\nIn 1965, the age at which widows could begin collecting benefits was reduced to 60. Widowers were not included in this change. When divorce, rather than death, became the major cause of marriages ending, divorces were added to the list of recipients. Divorces over the age of 65 who had been married for at least 20 years, remained unmarried, and could demonstrate dependency on their ex-husbands received benefits.[53]\\r\\nThe government adopted a unified budget in the Johnson administration in 1968. This change resulted in a single measure of the fiscal status of the government, based on the sum of all government activity.[54] The surplus in Social Security trust funds offsets the total debt, making it appear much smaller than it otherwise would. This allowed Congress to increase spending without having to risk the political consequences of raising taxes.\\r\\nIn June 1972, both houses of the United States Congress approved by overwhelming majorities 20% increases in benefits for 27.8 million Americans. The average payment per month rose from $133 to $166. The bill also set up a cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) to take effect in 1975. This adjustment would be made on a yearly basis if the Consumer Price Index (CPI) increased by 3% or more.[55] This addition was an attempt to index benefits to inflation so that benefits would rise automatically. If inflation was 5%, the goal was to automatically increase benefits by 5% so their real value didn't decline. A technical error in the formula caused these adjustments to overcompensate for inflation, a technical mistake which has been called double-indexing. The COLAs actually caused benefits to increase at twice the rate of inflation.\\r\\nIn October 1972, a $5 billion piece of Social Security legislation was enacted which expanded the Social Security program. For example, minimum monthly benefits of individuals employed in low income positions for at least 30 years were raised. Increases were also made to the pensions of 3.8 million widows and dependent widowers.[55]\\r\\nThese amendments also established the Supplemental Security Income (SSI). SSI is not a Social Security benefit, but a welfare program, because the elderly and disabled poor are entitled to SSI regardless of work history. Likewise, SSI is not an entitlement, because there is no right to SSI payments.\\r\\nThroughout the 1950s and 1960s, during the phase-in period of Social Security, Congress was able to grant generous benefit increases because the system had perpetual short-run surpluses. Congressional amendments to Social Security took place in even numbered years (election years) because the bills were politically popular, but by the late 1970s, this era was over. For the next three decades, projections of Social Security's finances would show large, long-term deficits, and in the early 1980s, the program flirted with immediate insolvency. From this point on, amendments to Social Security would take place in odd numbered years (years that were not election years) because Social Security reform now meant tax increases and benefit reductions. Social Security became known as the \\"Third Rail of American Politics.\\" Touching it meant political death.\\r\\nSeveral effects came together in the years following the 1972 amendments which rapidly changed the outlook on Social Security's long-term financial picture from positive to problematic. By the 1970s, the phase-in period, during which workers were paying taxes but few were collecting benefits, was largely over, and the ratio of elderly population to the working population was increasing. These developments brought questions about the capacity of the long term financial structure based on a pay-as-you-go program.\\r\\nDuring the Carter administration, the economy suffered double-digit inflation, coupled with very high interest rates, oil and energy crises, high unemployment and slow economic growth. Productivity growth in the United States had declined to an average annual rate of 1%, compared to an average annual rate increase of 3.2% during the 1960s. There was also a growing federal budget deficit which increased to $66 billion. The 1970s are described as a period of stagflation, meaning economic stagnation coupled with price inflation, as well as higher interest rates. Price inflation (a rise in the general level of prices) creates uncertainty in budgeting and planning and makes labor strikes for pay raises more likely. These underlying negative trends were exacerbated by a colossal mathematical error made in the 1972 amendments establishing the COLAs. The mathematical error which overcompensated for inflation was particularly detrimental given the double-digit inflation of this period, and the error led to benefit increases that were nowhere near financially sustainable.\\r\\nThe high inflation, double-indexing, and lower than expected wage growth was financial disaster for Social Security.\\r\\nTo combat the declining financial outlook, in 1977 Congress passed and Carter signed legislation fixing the double-indexing mistake. This amendment also altered the tax formulas to raise more money,[56] increasing withholding from 2% to 6.15%.[57] With these changes, President Carter remarked, \\"Now this legislation will guarantee that from 1980 to the year 2030, the Social Security funds will be sound.\\"[58] This turned out not to be the case. The financial picture declined almost immediately and by the early 1980s, the system was again in crisis.\\r\\nAfter the 1977 amendments, the economic assumptions surrounding Social Security projections continued to be overly optimistic as the program moved toward a crisis. For example, COLAs were attached to increases in the CPI. This meant that they changed with prices, instead of wages. Before the 1970s, wage measurements exceeded changes in price. In the 1970s, however, this reversed and real wages decreased. This meant that FICA revenues could not keep up with the increasing benefits that were being given out. Continued high unemployment levels also lowered the amount of Social Security tax that could be collected. These two developments were decreasing the Social Security Trust Fund reserves.[59] In 1982, projections indicated that the Social Security Trust Fund would run out of money by 1983, and there was talk of the system being unable to pay benefits.[60] The National Commission on Social Security Reform, chaired by Alan Greenspan, was created to address the crisis.\\r\\nThe National Commission on Social Security Reform (NCSSR), chaired by Alan Greenspan, was empaneled to investigate the long-run solvency of Social Security. The 1983 Amendments to the SSA were based on the NCSSR's Final Report.[61] The NCSSR recommended enacting a six-month delay in the COLA and changing the tax-rate schedules for the years between 1984 and 1990.[62] It also proposed an income tax on the Social Security benefits of higher-income individuals. This meant that benefits in excess of a household income threshold, generally $25,000 for singles and $32,000 for couples (the precise formula computes and compares three different measures) became taxable. These changes were important for generating revenue in the short term.\\r\\nAlso of concern was the long-term prospect for Social Security because of demographic considerations. Of particular concern was the issue of what would happen when people born during the postÿWorld War II baby boom retired. The NCSSR made several recommendations for addressing the issue.[63] Under the 1983 amendments to Social Security, a previously enacted increase in the payroll tax rate was accelerated, additional employees were added to the system, the full-benefit retirement age was slowly increased, and up to one-half of the value of the Social Security benefit was made potentially taxable income.[64][65]\\r\\nThe 1983 Amendments also included a provision to exclude the Social Security Trust Fund from the unified budget (to take it \\"off-budget.\\"[citation needed]) Yet today Social Security is treated like all the other trust funds of the Unified Budget.[citation needed]\\r\\nAs a result of these changes, particularly the tax increases, the Social Security system began to generate a large short-term surplus of funds, intended to cover the added retirement costs of the \\"baby boomers.\\" Congress invested these surpluses into special series, non-marketable U.S. Treasury securities held by the Social Security Trust Fund. Under the law, the government bonds held by Social Security are backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government.\\r\\nThe Supreme Court has established that no one has any legal right to Social Security benefits. The Court decided, in Flemming v. Nestor (1960), that \\"entitlement to Social Security benefits is not a contractual right\\". In that case, Ephram Nestor, a Bulgarian immigrant to the United States who made contributions for covered wages for the statutorily required \\"quarters of coverage\\" was nonetheless denied benefits after being deported in 1956 for being a member of the Communist party.\\r\\nThe case specifically held:\\r\\n2. A person covered by the Social Security Act has not such a right in old-age benefit payments as would make every defeasance of \\"accrued\\" interests violative of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment. Pp. 608ÿ611. (a) The noncontractual interest of an employee covered by the Act cannot be soundly analogized to that of the holder of an annuity, whose right to benefits are based on his contractual premium payments. Pp. 608ÿ610. (b) To engraft upon the Social Security System a concept of \\"accrued property rights\\" would deprive it of the flexibility and [363 U.S. 603, 604] boldness in adjustment to ever-changing conditions which it demands and which Congress probably had in mind when it expressly reserved the right to alter, amend or repeal any provision of the Act. Pp. 610ÿ611. 3. Section 202 (n) of the Act cannot be condemned as so lacking in rational justification as to offend due process. Pp. 611ÿ612. 4. Termination of appellee's benefits under 202 (n) does not amount to punishing him without a trial, in violation of Art. III, 2, cl. 3, of the Constitution or the Sixth Amendment; nor is 202 (n) a bill of attainder or ex post facto law, since its purpose is not punitive. Pp. 612ÿ621.[65]\\r\\nThe Supreme Court was also responsible for major changes in Social Security. Many of these cases were pivotal in changing the assumptions about differences in wage earning among men and women in the Social Security system.[66]","input":"When did social security begin in the us?"},{"output":"in the 18th-century","context":"","input":"When did the name hinduism first emerged in india?"},{"output":"March 21, 2017","context":"7: 12 MP 2nd-generation Sony Exmor RS[8] with six-element lens, quad-LED \\"True Tone\\" flash, autofocus, IR filter, Burst mode, f/1.8 aperture, 4K video recording at 30?fps or 1080p at 30 or 60?fps, slow-motion video (1080p at 120?fps and 720p at 240?fps), timelapse with stabilization, panorama, facial recognition, digital image stabilization, optical image stabilization\\r\\niPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus are smartphones designed, developed, and marketed by Apple Inc. They were announced on September 7, 2016, at the Bill Graham Civic Auditorium in San Francisco by Apple CEO Tim Cook, and were released on September 16, 2016, succeeding the iPhone 6S and iPhone 6S Plus as the flagship devices in the iPhone series. Apple also released the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus in numerous countries worldwide throughout September and October 2016. They were succeeded as flagship devices by the iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus on September 22, 2017, and the iPhone X on November 3, 2017.\\r\\nThe iPhone 7's overall design is similar to the iPhone 6S, but introduces new color options, water and dust resistance, a new capacitive, static home button, and removes the 3.5?mm headphone jack. The device's internal hardware also received upgrades, including a heterogeneous quad-core system-on-chip with improved system and graphics performance, and upgraded 12?megapixel rear-facing cameras with optical image stabilization on all models and an additional telephoto lens on the iPhone 7 Plus model to provide enhanced zoom capabilities.\\r\\nReception of the iPhone 7 was mixed. Although reviewers noted the improvements to the camera, especially the dual rear camera on the Plus model, they also stated that the iPhone 7 did not make significant changes to the display or build quality, where competing flagship smartphones surpassed the quality of the iPhone 7. Many reviews highlighted the controversial removal of the 3.5?mm headphone jack; some critics argued that the change was meant to bolster licensing of the proprietary Lightning connector and the sales of Apple's own wireless headphone products, and questioned the effects of the change on audio quality. Apple was also mocked by critics for Phil Schiller's statement that such a drastic change required \\"courage\\".\\r\\nThe iPhone 7 has been the subject of several reported issues, most notably a hissing noise during heavy usage of the phones and significant differences in performance between device variants. Apple has not released sales numbers for iPhone 7, but multiple U.S. carriers reported that it was in high demand on launch. Subsequent reports at the end of 2016 stated that Apple had reduced production of the models due to \\"sluggish\\" sales and decreasing demand, though sales research after the first quarter of 2017 placed the devices as the best-selling smartphones in the world.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPrior to its official announcement, multiple aspects of the iPhone 7 were heavily rumored. Apple's plans to remove the 3.5?mm headphone jack received significant media attention.[15][16][17][18] Other rumors included a flush camera, stereo speakers,[19] a 256?gigabyte storage option, and a larger 3,100 mAh battery.[20]\\r\\nOn August 29, 2016, invitations to a press event at the Bill Graham Civic Auditorium in San Francisco, California on September 7, 2016 were sent out to members of the media, prompting immediate speculation of the iPhone 7's upcoming announcement.[21][22] The iPhone 7 was officially announced at that event, with pre-orders beginning September 9, and general availability on September 16.[23][24][25]\\r\\niPhone 7 launched in 30 new countries later in September, with further international rollouts throughout October and November 2016.[26][27][28][29][30][31][32] Indonesia was the last country to release the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus, with availability starting on March 31, 2017, following Apple's research and development investment in the country.[33]\\r\\nOn March 21, 2017, Apple announced an iPhone 7 with a red color finish (and white front), as part of its partnership with Product Red to highlight its AIDS fundraising campaign. It launched on March 24, 2017,[34][35] but it was later discontinued after the announcement of the iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus.[citation needed]\\r\\nIn September 2017, Apple announced the iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus as direct successors to the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus,[36] alongside the iPhone X.[37]\\r\\nAs of February 4, 2018, the NYPD has been rolling out about 600 phones per day to its officers, who get to choose between an iPhone 7 and an iPhone 7 Plus, switching from the failed Windows Phone. Currently, officers in Manhattan are taking part in the transition, but once that is complete, the rollout moves to Brooklyn and then Queens.[38]\\r\\nThe iPhone 7's exterior is similar in shape and volume to iPhone 6 and iPhone 6S. Alongside the existing silver, gold, and rose gold colors, the device is offered in new matte black, \\"jet black\\",[23] and red colors.[34][35] The \\"jet black\\" color is a dark shade, high-gloss black finish. It is created through a multi-step process, beginning with an anodization phase to make the surface of the casing a porous aluminum oxide, and then using a machine to sweep the casing through a powdered compound, absorbed by aluminum oxide. The process is concluded with an \\"ultrafine particle bath\\" for additional finishing; the entire process takes less than an hour.[39]\\r\\niPhone 7 is rated IP67 water and dust resistant,[40] although tests have resulted in malfunctions, specifically distorted speakers, after water exposure.[41] The warranty does not cover any water damage to the phone.[42]\\r\\niPhone 7's home button uses a capacitive mechanism for input rather than a physical push-button, as on previous models, meaning direct skin contact (or a capacitive glove) is required to operate the device.[43][44] Physical feedback is provided via a Taptic Engine vibrator, and the button is also pressure-sensitive.[45] iPhone 7 retains the \\"3D Touch\\" display system introduced on the iPhone 6S, providing pressure-sensitive touchscreen input.[23]\\r\\nThe iPhone 7 does not feature a 3.5?mm headphone jack; it was replaced by a second speaker grille that serves as a vent for the internal barometer.[46] A Lightning-to-3.5-mm-connector adapter, as well as in-ear headphones that use the Lightning connector, are bundled with the device,[23] and the adapter is also sold separately as an accessory.[47] The adapter is also compatible with other iPhone, iPad, and iPod Touch devices running iOS 10.[48]\\r\\niPhone 7 uses the Apple A10 Fusion 64-bit system-on-chip, which consists of two low-power cores and two high-power cores (only two cores are used at any point in time[49]). The A10 chip also features a hexa-core graphics chip capable of \\"console-level gaming\\".[50] As with prior models, iPhone 7 is available in two sizes: one with a 4.7-inch screen, and a \\"Plus\\" variant with a 5.5-inch screen.[51] The displays have identical sizes and resolutions to iPhone 6S, but with a wider color gamut[23] and increased brightness.[52] The screen-to-body ratio is about ~66% and ~68% for the 7 and 7 Plus, respectively.[53][54]\\r\\nBoth device variants also contain a new iteration of Apple's motion coprocessor, the M10.[55] Unlike previous iPhone models, internal storage options for iPhone 7 begin at 32?GB instead of 16?GB, and max out at 256?GB.[56] iPhone 7 Plus offers 3?GB of RAM, more than any other previous iPhone;[49] the 4.7-inch iPhone 7 has 2?GB.[57]\\r\\nThe iPhone 7 includes a 12-megapixel rear-facing camera with a quad-LED \\"True Tone\\" flash; its aperture was widened to f/1.8, and the standard-size phone model adds optical image stabilization?ÿ  a feature that was previously exclusive to Plus models.[58] The iPhone 7 Plus includes a second 12-megapixel telephoto lens, which can be used to achieve 2G optical zoom, and up to 10G digital zoom. The front-facing camera was upgraded to a 7-megapixel sensor with automatic image stabilization.[23][59]\\r\\niPhone 7 ships with iOS 10 pre-installed.[60] The iPhone 7 Plus received an exclusive portrait camera mode in the iOS 10.1 software update.[61] This camera mode is capable of producing a bokeh effect using depth of field analysis of the second camera of dual-lens in the back of iPhone 7 Plus.[62][63]\\r\\nEach iPhone 7 comes with a Lightning-to-3.5-mm adapter.[23] Apple sells the adapter independently as well.[47] Apple also unveiled several Bluetooth wireless headphones ostensibly intended for use with iPhone 7, including AirPods, wireless in-ear headphones, and three new Beats headphone products. All four products utilize an in-house wireless chip known as Apple W1, which is designed to provide low-power Bluetooth operation and integration with iOS and macOS products (though they are still compatible with other Bluetooth-supported devices).[64][65]\\r\\nReception to the iPhone 7 was mixed. Gordon Kelly of Forbes noted that rival smartphones, such as the Samsung Galaxy S7, had increased battery life and added water resistance over its predecessor while retaining the headphone jack, and that the iPhone 7's camera photo quality was improved but still lagging behind some phones already on the market, including the Galaxy S7 and Nexus 6P. Kelly praised how Apple was able to extract improved brightness and accurate color reproduction from its LCD display panel, while noting that it was old technology which was also well behind rivals who had already moved to sharper 1080p or even 2K screens. The iPhone 7's exterior, which reuses the aging design of the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6S, was criticized, especially the size of the device and thick top/bottom bezels, with Kelly writing that \\"the iPhone 7 Plus is simply far too big for a smartphone with a 5.5-inch display\\".[66]\\r\\nNilay Patel of The Verge described the devices as being \\"full of aggressive breaks from convention\\" despite their design continuity with previous models (going as far as dubbing them \\"a prototype of next year's rumored drastic iPhone redesign disguised as an iPhone 6\\"), citing the headphone jack removal (which he felt was an attempt to encourage the use of wireless headphones), heterogeneous CPU, and home button redesign. The display quality was considered an improvement over previous models, albeit \\"not as insane\\" as the quad HD displays on competing phones. The Taptic Engine was considered the \\"first really valuable new UI concept I've seen on phones in years\\" (as opposed to the \\"gimmick\\" of 3D Touch), Patel felt that the cameras of the devices were a \\"step\\" above the 6S in terms of performance, and praised the dual-lens camera on the 7 Plus for enhancing the phone's camera functionality. However, he panned the lack of editing features that made use of them. In regards to the enhanced Bluetooth audio support provided by devices containing the W1 chip, he argued that Apple \\"took away an established open standard in favor of new technologies, but instead of making the experience of using those new technologies better across the board, it made every third-party wireless audio product a second-class citizen of the Apple ecosystem.\\" Giving the iPhone 7 a 9 out of 10, he concluded that the devices were \\"legitimately among the most interesting, opinionated, powerful phones Apple has ever shipped, and the most confident expressions of the company's vision in a long time. iOS 10 is excellent, the cameras are better, and the performance is phenomenal. And the batteries last longer.\\"[67]\\r\\nJohn McCann of TechRadar wrote that for the first time, the phablet-sized iPhone 7 Plus was \\"markedly better\\" than the smaller model. He highlighted improved battery life and praised the camera, calling the Plus' dual cameras \\"excellent\\" for point-and-shoot, and \\"much improved\\" for low-light performance. McCann wrote that the lack of a headphone jack was \\"initially frustrating\\", but noted that it was a \\"positive step forward for the mobile industry\\", despite the \\"short-term effects ... making the most noise for now\\".[68]\\r\\nCriticism of the iPhone 7 centered around the removal of the headphone jack, including the inability to use wired headphones with the included adapter and charge the device simultaneously.[a][70]\\r\\nIn a particularly scathing article, Nilay Patel of The Verge wrote that removing the headphone jack - \\"ditching a deeply established standard\\" - would be \\"user-hostile and stupid\\". He goes on to list reasons why removing the port is negative, concluding with \\"No one is asking for this\\" and \\"Vote with your dollars\\".[71]\\r\\nGordon Kelly of Forbes noted that wireless audio technology was immature at the moment, with Bluetooth audio quality being inferior while Lightning audio reliability was still in question. The removal of the headphone jack meant \\"youre being pushed into an era where you will have to pay more for decent headphones due to their need for an integrated DAC and/or Lightning licensing\\", and pointed out that \\"the only company to profit from this situation is Apple, who will now be charging licensing fees to millions of headphone companies\\".[66]\\r\\nIn particular, Apple's vice president Phillip Schiller, who announced the change, was mocked extensively online for stating that removing the headphone jack took 'courage'.[72][73] An online petition created by the consumer group SumOfUs, that accuses Apple of planned obsolescence and causing substantial electronic waste by removing the headphone jack,[74] reached over 300,000 signatures.[75]\\r\\nSome users have reported a strange hissing noise during heavy usage of the phone. CNET reports it as \\"faint buzzes and hums coming from the backside\\".[76] The Daily Telegraph speculates that the iPhone 7's new A10 Fusion processor is the source of the noise, linking to tweets that compare the phone's hissing sound to \\"hearing the fans spin up loudly whenever your Macs CPU gets used to its actual potential.\\"[77] The issue has been referred to as Hissgate.[78][79]\\r\\nThe Guardian reported in October 2016 that storage tests from Unbox Therapy and GSMArena showed that the 32 GB iPhone 7 is \\"significantly\\" slower than the 128 and 256 GB versions, measuring data write speeds of 341 MB/s on a 128 GB iPhone 7 model versus 42 MB/s on a 32 GB model.[80] October 2016 network tests by Cellular Insights showed that models A1660 and A1661 with Qualcomm modems had \\"a significant performance edge\\" over models A1778 and A1784 with Intel modems. Inspection of the modems also found that the Qualcomm version's ability to use Ultra HD Voice had been turned off, likely to \\"level the playing field between the Qualcomm, and Intel variants\\". The report concluded with the statement that \\"We are not sure what was the main reason behind Apple's decision to source two different modem suppliers for the newest iPhone\\".[81][82] Bloomberg reported in November 2016 that tests by researchers from Twin Prime and Cellular Insights had shown the two modems to perform similarly on some U.S. cellular networks despite one of the modems being technically capable of faster connectivity. Apple spokeswoman Trudy Muller told the publication that \\"Every iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus meets or exceeds all of Apples wireless performance standards, quality metrics, and reliability testing ... In all of our rigorous lab tests based on wireless industry standards, in thousands of hours of real-world field testing, and in extensive carrier partner testing, the data shows there is no discernible difference in the wireless performance of any of the models\\". Bloomberg quoted analysts and technology advisers who stated that \\"[Apple] dont want one version to get the reputation that it is better\\" and that \\"This may not impact the fanboys, but it may make other consumers think twice about buying an Apple phone, especially if they think they might be purchasing a sub-standard product\\".[83]\\r\\nIn a similar manner with the now-discontinued Samsung Galaxy Note 7, there have been reports of the iPhone 7 exploding or emitting smoke. In September 2016, one device reportedly exploded while in transit,[84][85] while another one had a \\"malfunction that caused the battery to blow up internally\\".[86] Another report about an iPhone 7 emitting smoke and \\"melting\\" was published in October 2016.[87]\\r\\nThe iPhone 7's \\"This is 7\\" slogan has been misunderstood when translated to certain other languages. The slogan in China translates to \\"7, is here.\\", while it becomes \\"Exactly is 7.\\" in Taiwan, and \\"This, is exactly iPhone 7.\\" in Hong Kong. In the Cantonese language, the slogan becomes \\"This is penis\\", due to \\"seven\\" pronounced tsat, a slang for \\"penis\\".[88][89]\\r\\nIn the iPhone 7, Apple added a software lock that prevents individuals from attempting to replace the home button on their own. Users are now required to go to an Apple Store to have repairs done, with \\"recalibration\\" of the button being necessary. This is a step further than Apple went with iPhone 5S, 6 and 6S, where only Touch ID functionality would get disabled but the \\"return-to-home\\" functionality still worked.[90][91]\\r\\nSome iPhone 7 devices with the model numbers A1660, A1780 and A1779 suffer from a problem where they show a \\"No service\\" message even when cellular reception is available. Apple will repair those devices for free within two years of the first retail sale of the unit.[92]\\r\\nApple has deliberately withheld pre-order sales numbers, citing that these are \\"no longer a representative metric for our investors and customers\\".[93] Without releasing specific numbers, T-Mobile US stated that the iPhone 7 had broken the carrier's all-time record for first-day pre-order sales. The following weekend, T-Mobile US stated that iPhone 7 was its biggest iPhone launch ever, being \\"up nearly 4x compared to the next most popular iPhone\\".[94]\\r\\nOn September 14, 2016, two days before the iPhone 7 went on sale, Apple announced that due to high demand, they had sold out of all \\"jet black\\" iPhone 7's, and all colors of the iPhone 7 Plus.[95] This caused issues for customers in the iPhone Upgrade Program, who were unable to reserve new phones.[96] After customer complaints and a class action lawsuit,[97] Apple made changes to ensure members of the program could get new phones as soon as possible.[98]\\r\\nIn May 2017, analytics research company Strategy Analytics announced that iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus were the best-selling smartphones worldwide during the first quarter of 2017, selling 21.5?million and 17.4?million units, respectively.[99][100]\\r\\nFor the initial U.S. sales of the iPhone 7, all four major wireless carriers announced trade-in deals. Under the deals, the monthly installment plan cost of the iPhone 7 is negated by a monthly credit on consumers' bill, but consumers who cancel their service with the carrier or pay off the phone prior to the installment contract completion will not receive credits for the remaining months.[101] Jacob Kastrenakes of The Verge noted that the deals effectively constituted a return to two-year phone contracts, in which the deals \\"essentially lock you into that carrier for two years\\".[102]\\r\\nIn the wake of these deals, Verizon announced they had seen an increase in sales over the release of the previous year's iPhone 6S, AT&T said that sales had exceeded its expectations, and T-Mobile and Sprint announced \\"huge increases in sales\\", with T-Mobile seeing a demand roughly four times higher for the 7 than the 6.[103]\\r\\nIn December 2016, DigiTimes reported that Apple had reduced production of the iPhone 7 because of decreasing demand for the product after the initial surge of interest waned. A reason cited was consumers and suppliers turning their attention to next year's iPhone model.[104][105]\\r\\nA new report from Nikkei at the end of December included details on sales and production of the iPhone 7. The report, \\"based on data from suppliers\\", stated that Apple would trim production of the iPhone 7 by 10% in the first quarter of 2017, following \\"sluggish\\" sales. Nikkei reported that Apple previously trimmed production of the iPhone 7 by 20% due to accumulated inventory of the previous model, but that the new models had \\"sold more sluggishly than expected\\". Additionally, the report notes that the \\"iPhone 7 Plus, which features two cameras on its back face, remains popular\\", but \\"a shortage of camera sensors has curbed Apple's ability to meet demand for the phones\\".[106]","input":"When was the product red iphone 7 released?"},{"output":"Thomas Alva Edison","context":"Thomas Alva Edison (February 11, 1847?ÿ October 18, 1931) was an American inventor and businessman, who has been described as America's greatest inventor.[1] He developed many devices that greatly influenced life around the world, including the phonograph, the motion picture camera, and the long-lasting, practical electric light bulb. Dubbed \\"The Wizard of Menlo Park\\",[2] he was one of the first inventors to apply the principles of mass production and large-scale teamwork to the process of invention, and because of that, he is often credited with the creation of the first industrial research laboratory.[3]\\r\\nEdison was a prolific inventor, holding 1,093 US patents in his name, as well as many patents in the United Kingdom, France, and Germany. More significant than the number of Edison's patents was the widespread impact of his inventions: electric light and power utilities, sound recording, and motion pictures all established major new industries worldwide. Edison's inventions contributed to mass communication and, in particular, telecommunications. These included a stock ticker, a mechanical vote recorder, a battery for an electric car, electrical power, recorded music and motion pictures. His advanced work in these fields was an outgrowth of his early career as a telegraph operator. Edison developed a system of electric-power generation and distribution[4] to homes, businesses, and factories ÿ a crucial development in the modern industrialized world. His first power station was on Pearl Street in Manhattan, New York.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThomas Edison was born in Milan, Ohio, and grew up in Port Huron, Michigan. He was the seventh and last child of Samuel Ogden Edison Jr. (1804ÿ1896, born in Marshalltown, Nova Scotia) and Nancy Matthews Elliott (1810ÿ1871, born in Chenango County, New York).[5] His father, the son of a Loyalist refugee, had moved as a boy with the family from Nova Scotia, settling in southwestern Ontario (then called Upper Canada), in a village known as Shewsbury, later Vienna, by 1811. Samuel Jr. eventually fled Ontario, because he took part in the unsuccessful Mackenzie Rebellion of 1837.[6] His father, Samuel Sr., had earlier fought in the War of 1812 as captain of the First Middlesex Regiment. By contrast, Samuel Jr.'s struggle found him on the losing side, and he crossed into the United States at Sarnia-Port Huron. Once across the border, he found his way to Milan, Ohio. His patrilineal family line was Dutch by way of New Jersey; the surname had originally been \\"Edeson.\\"[7]\\r\\nEdison only attended school for a few months and was instead taught by his mother.[8] Much of his education came from reading R.G. Parker's School of Natural Philosophy and The Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art.[9]\\r\\nEdison developed hearing problems at an early age. The cause of his deafness has been attributed to a bout of scarlet fever during childhood and recurring untreated middle-ear infections. Around the middle of his career, Edison attributed the hearing impairment to being struck on the ears by a train conductor when his chemical laboratory in a boxcar caught fire and he was thrown off the train in Smiths Creek, Michigan, along with his apparatus and chemicals. In his later years, he modified the story to say the injury occurred when the conductor, in helping him onto a moving train, lifted him by the ears.[10][11]\\r\\nEdison's family moved to Port Huron, Michigan, after the railroad bypassed Milan in 1854 and business declined.[12] Edison sold candy and newspapers on trains running from Port Huron to Detroit, and sold vegetables. He briefly worked as a telegraph operator in 1863 for the Grand Trunk Railway at the railway station in Stratford, Ontario, at age 16. He was held responsible for a near collision. He also studied qualitative analysis and conducted chemical experiments on the train until he left the job.[13][14]\\r\\nEdison obtained the exclusive right to sell newspapers on the road, and, with the aid of four assistants, he set in type and printed the Grand Trunk Herald, which he sold with his other papers.[14] This began Edison's long streak of entrepreneurial ventures, as he discovered his talents as a businessman. These talents eventually led him to found 14 companies, including General Electric, which is still one of the largest publicly traded companies in the world.[15][16]\\r\\nEdison became a telegraph operator after he saved three-year-old Jimmie MacKenzie from being struck by a runaway train. Jimmie's father, station agent J. U. MacKenzie of Mount Clemens, Michigan, was so grateful that he trained Edison as a telegraph operator. Edison's first telegraphy job away from Port Huron was at Stratford Junction, Ontario, on the Grand Trunk Railway.[17]\\r\\nIn 1866, at the age of 19, Edison moved to Louisville, Kentucky, where, as an employee of Western Union, he worked the Associated Press bureau news wire. Edison requested the night shift, which allowed him plenty of time to spend at his two favorite pastimesreading and experimenting. Eventually, the latter pre-occupation cost him his job. One night in 1867, he was working with a leadÿacid battery when he spilled sulfuric acid onto the floor. It ran between the floorboards and onto his boss's desk below. The next morning Edison was fired.[18]\\r\\nOne of his mentors during those early years was a fellow telegrapher and inventor named Franklin Leonard Pope, who allowed the impoverished youth to live and work in the basement of his Elizabeth, New Jersey, home. Some of Edison's earliest inventions were related to telegraphy, including a stock ticker. His first patent was for the electric vote recorder, U.S. Patent 90,646, which was granted on June 1, 1869.[19]\\r\\nOn December 25, 1871, Edison married 16-year-old Mary Stilwell (1855ÿ1884), whom he had met two months earlier; she was an employee at one of his shops. They had three children:\\r\\nMary Edison died at age 29 on August 9, 1884, of unknown causes: possibly from a brain tumor[23] or a morphine overdose. Doctors frequently prescribed morphine to women in those years to treat a variety of causes, and researchers believe that her symptoms could have been from morphine poisoning.[24]\\r\\nEdison generally preferred spending time in the laboratory to being with his family.[25]\\r\\nOn February 24, 1886, at the age of thirty-nine, Edison married the 20-year-old Mina Miller (1865ÿ1947) in Akron, Ohio.[26] She was the daughter of the inventor Lewis Miller, co-founder of the Chautauqua Institution, and a benefactor of Methodist charities. They also had three children together:\\r\\nMina outlived Thomas Edison, dying on August 24, 1947.[30][31]\\r\\nEdison began his career as an inventor in Newark, New Jersey, with the automatic repeater and his other improved telegraphic devices, but the invention that first gained him wider notice was the phonograph in 1877.[32] This accomplishment was so unexpected by the public at large as to appear almost magical. Edison became known as \\"The Wizard of Menlo Park,\\" New Jersey.[2]\\r\\nHis first phonograph recorded on tinfoil around a grooved cylinder. Despite its limited sound quality and that the recordings could be played only a few times, the phonograph made Edison a celebrity. Joseph Henry, president of the National Academy of Sciences and one of the most renowned electrical scientists in the US, described Edison as \\"the most ingenious inventor in this country... or in any other\\".[33] In April 1878, Edison traveled to Washington to demonstrate the phonograph before the National Academy of Sciences, Congressmen, Senators and US President Hayes.[34] The Washington Post described Edison as a \\"genius\\" and his presentation as \\"a scene... that will live in history\\".[35] Although Edison obtained a patent for the phonograph in 1878,[36] he did little to develop it until Alexander Graham Bell, Chichester Bell, and Charles Tainter produced a phonograph-like device in the 1880s that used wax-coated cardboard cylinders.\\r\\nEdison's major innovation was the establishment of an industrial research lab in 1876. It was built in Menlo Park, a part of Raritan Township, Middlesex County, New Jersey (today named Edison in his honor), with the funds from the sale of Edison's quadruplex telegraph. After his demonstration of the telegraph, Edison was not sure that his original plan to sell it for $4,000 to $5,000 was right, so he asked Western Union to make a bid. He was surprised to hear them offer $10,000 ($211,700 in today's dollars.[37]), which he gratefully accepted.[38] The quadruplex telegraph was Edison's first big financial success, and Menlo Park became the first institution set up with the specific purpose of producing constant technological innovation and improvement. Edison was legally attributed with most of the inventions produced there, though many employees carried out research and development under his direction. His staff was generally told to carry out his directions in conducting research, and he drove them hard to produce results.\\r\\nWilliam Joseph Hammer, a consulting electrical engineer, started working for Edison and began his duties as a laboratory assistant in December 1879. He assisted in experiments on the telephone, phonograph, electric railway, iron ore separator, electric lighting, and other developing inventions. However, Hammer worked primarily on the incandescent electric lamp and was put in charge of tests and records on that device (see Hammer Historical Collection of Incandescent Electric Lamps). In 1880, he was appointed chief engineer of the Edison Lamp Works. In his first year, the plant under General Manager Francis Robbins Upton turned out 50,000 lamps. According to Edison, Hammer was \\"a pioneer of incandescent electric lighting\\".[39] Frank J. Sprague, a competent mathematician and former naval officer, was recruited by Edward H. Johnson and joined the Edison organization in 1883. One of Sprague's contributions to the Edison Laboratory at Menlo Park was to expand Edison's mathematical methods. Despite the common belief that Edison did not use mathematics, analysis of his notebooks reveal that he was an astute user of mathematical analysis conducted by his assistants such as Francis Robbins Upton, for example, determining the critical parameters of his electric lighting system including lamp resistance by an analysis of Ohm's Law, Joule's Law and economics.[40]\\r\\nNearly all of Edison's patents were utility patents, which were protected for a 17-year period and included inventions or processes that are electrical, mechanical, or chemical in nature. About a dozen were design patents, which protect an ornamental design for up to a 14-year period. As in most patents, the inventions he described were improvements over prior art. The phonograph patent, in contrast, was unprecedented as describing the first device to record and reproduce sounds.[41]\\r\\nIn just over a decade, Edison's Menlo Park laboratory had expanded to occupy two city blocks. Edison said he wanted the lab to have \\"a stock of almost every conceivable material\\".[42] A newspaper article printed in 1887 reveals the seriousness of his claim, stating the lab contained \\"eight thousand kinds of chemicals, every kind of screw made, every size of needle, every kind of cord or wire, hair of humans, horses, hogs, cows, rabbits, goats, minx, camels?... silk in every texture, cocoons, various kinds of hoofs, shark's teeth, deer horns, tortoise shell?... cork, resin, varnish and oil, ostrich feathers, a peacock's tail, jet, amber, rubber, all ores?...\\" and the list goes on.[43]\\r\\nOver his desk, Edison displayed a placard with Sir Joshua Reynolds' famous quotation: \\"There is no expedient to which a man will not resort to avoid the real labor of thinking.\\"[44] This slogan was reputedly posted at several other locations throughout the facility.\\r\\nWith Menlo Park, Edison had created the first industrial laboratory concerned with creating knowledge and then controlling its application.[45] Edison's name is registered on 1,093 patents.[25]\\r\\nIn 1876, Edison began work to improve the microphone for telephones (at that time called a \\"transmitter\\") by developing a carbon microphone that used a button of carbon that would change resistance with the pressure of sound waves. Up to that point, microphones, such as the ones developed by Johann Philipp Reis and Alexander Graham Bell, worked by generating a weak current. Edison was one of many inventors working on the problem of creating a usable microphone for telephony by having it modulate an electrical current passed through it.[46] His work was concurrent with Emile Berliner's loose-contact carbon transmitter (who lost a later patent case against Edison over the carbon transmitters invention[47]) and David Edward Hughes study and published paper on the physics of loose-contact carbon transmitters (work that Hughes did not bother to patent).[46][48]\\r\\nEdison used the carbon microphone concept in 1877 to create an improved telephone for Western Union.[47] In 1886, Edison found a way to improve a Bell Telephone microphone, one that used loose-contact ground carbon, with his discovery that it worked far better if the carbon was roasted. This type was put in use in 1890[47] and was used in all telephones along with the Bell receiver until the 1980s.\\r\\nIn 1878, Edison began working on a system of electrical illumination, something he hoped could compete with gas and oil based lighting.[49] He began by tackling the problem of creating a long-lasting incandescent lamp, something that would be needed for indoor use. Many earlier inventors had previously devised incandescent lamps, including Alessandro Volta's demonstration of a glowing wire in 1800 and inventions by Henry Woodward and Mathew Evans. Others who developed early and commercially impractical incandescent electric lamps included Humphry Davy, James Bowman Lindsay, Moses G. Farmer,[50] William E. Sawyer, Joseph Swan, and Heinrich G?bel. Some of these early bulbs had such flaws as an extremely short life, high expense to produce, and high electric current drawn, making them difficult to apply on a large scale commercially.[51]:217ÿ218 Edison realized that to connect a series of electric lights to an economically manageable size and using the necessary thickness of copper wire, he would have to develop a lamp that used a low amount of current. This lamp must have high resistance and use relatively low voltage (around 110 volts).[52]\\r\\nAfter many experiments, first with carbon filaments and then with platinum and other metals, Edison returned to a carbon filament.[53] The first successful test was on October 22, 1879;[51]:186[54][55][25] it lasted 13.5 hours.[56] Edison continued to improve this design and on November 4, 1879, filed for U.S. patent 223,898 (granted on January 27, 1880) for an electric lamp using \\"a carbon filament or strip coiled and connected to platina contact wires\\".[57] This was the first commercially practical incandescent light.[58]\\r\\nAlthough the patent described several ways of creating the carbon filament including \\"cotton and linen thread, wood splints, papers coiled in various ways\\",[57] it was not until several months after the patent was granted that Edison and his team discovered a carbonized bamboo filament that could last over 1,200?hours. The idea of using this particular raw material originated from Edison's recalling his examination of a few threads from a bamboo fishing pole while relaxing on the shore of Battle Lake in the present-day state of Wyoming, where he and other members of a scientific team had traveled so that they could clearly observe a total eclipse of the sun on July 29, 1878, from the Continental Divide.[59]\\r\\nIn 1878, Edison formed the Edison Electric Light Company in New York City with several financiers, including J. P. Morgan, Spencer Trask,[60] and the members of the Vanderbilt family. Edison made the first public demonstration of his incandescent light bulb on December 31, 1879, in Menlo Park. It was during this time that he said: \\"We will make electricity so cheap that only the rich will burn candles.\\"[61]\\r\\nHenry Villard, president of the Oregon Railroad and Navigation Company, attended Edison's 1879 demonstration. Villard was impressed and requested Edison install his electric lighting system aboard Villard's company's new steamer, the Columbia. Although hesitant at first, Edison agreed to Villard's request. Most of the work was completed in May 1880, and the Columbia went to New York City, where Edison and his personnel installed Columbia's new lighting system. The Columbia was Edison's first commercial application for his incandescent light bulb. The Edison equipment was removed from Columbia in 1895.[62][63][64][65]\\r\\nLewis Latimer joined the Edison Electric Light Company in 1884. Latimer had received a patent in January 1881 for the \\"Process of Manufacturing Carbons\\", an improved method for the production of carbon filaments for light bulbs. Latimer worked as an engineer, a draftsman and an expert witness in patent litigation on electric lights.[66]\\r\\nGeorge Westinghouse's company bought Philip Diehl's competing induction lamp patent rights (1882) for $25,000, forcing the holders of the Edison patent to charge a more reasonable rate for the use of the Edison patent rights and lowering the price of the electric lamp.[67]\\r\\nOn October 8, 1883, the US patent office ruled that Edison's patent was based on the work of William E. Sawyer and was, therefore, invalid. Litigation continued for nearly six years, until October 6, 1889, when a judge ruled that Edison's electric light improvement claim for \\"a filament of carbon of high resistance\\" was valid.[68] To avoid a possible court battle with Joseph Swan, whose British patent had been awarded a year before Edison's, he and Swan formed a joint company called Ediswan to manufacture and market the invention in Britain.\\r\\nMahen Theatre in Brno (in what is now the Czech Republic), opened in 1882, and was the first public building in the world to use Edison's electric lamps. Francis Jehl, Edison's assistant in the invention of the lamp, supervised the installation.[69] In September 2010, a sculpture of three giant light bulbs was erected in Brno, in front of the theatre.[70]\\r\\nAfter devising a commercially viable electric light bulb on October 21, 1879, Edison developed an electric \\"utility\\" to compete with the existing gas light utilities.[71] On December 17, 1880, he founded the Edison Illuminating Company, and during the 1880s, he patented a system for electricity distribution. The company established the first investor-owned electric utility in 1882 on Pearl Street Station, New York City. On September 4, 1882, Edison switched on his Pearl Street generating station's electrical power distribution system, which provided 110 volts direct current (DC) to 59 customers in lower Manhattan.[72]\\r\\nIn January 1882, Edison switched on the first steam-generating power station at Holborn Viaduct in London. The DC supply system provided electricity supplies to street lamps and several private dwellings within a short distance of the station. On January 19, 1883, the first standardized incandescent electric lighting system employing overhead wires began service in Roselle, New Jersey.\\r\\nAs Edison expanded his direct current (DC) power delivery system, he received stiff competition from companies installing alternating current (AC) systems. From the early 1880s AC arc lighting systems for streets and large spaces had been an expanding business in the US. With the development of transformers in Europe and by Westinghouse Electric in the US in 1885ÿ1886, it became possible to transmit AC long distances over thinner and cheaper wires, and \\"step down\\" the voltage at the destination for distribution to users. This allowed AC to be used in street lighting and in lighting for small business and domestic customers, the market Edison's patented low voltage DC incandescent lamp system was designed to supply.[73] Edison's DC empire suffered from one of its chief drawbacks: it was suitable only for the high density of customers found in large cities. Edison's DC plants could not deliver electricity to customers more than one mile from the plant, and left a patchwork of unsupplied customers between plants. Small cities and rural areas could not afford an Edison style system at all, leaving a large part of the market without electrical service. AC companies expanded into this gap.\\r\\nEdison expressed views that AC was unworkable and the high voltages used were dangerous. As George Westinghouse installed his first AC systems in 1886, Thomas Edison struck out personally against his chief rival stating, \\"Just as certain as death, Westinghouse will kill a customer within six months after he puts in a system of any size. He has got a new thing and it will require a great deal of experimenting to get it working practically.\\"[74] Many reasons have been suggested for Edison's anti-AC stance. One notion is that the inventor could not grasp the more abstract theories behind AC and was trying to avoid developing a system he did not understand. Edison also appeared to have been worried about the high voltage from misinstalled AC systems killing customers and hurting the sales of electric power systems in general.[75] Primary was the fact that Edison Electric based their design on low voltage DC and switching a standard after they had installed over 100 systems was, in Edison's mind, out of the question. By the end of 1887, Edison Electric was losing market share to Westinghouse, who had built 68 AC-based power stations to Edison's 121 DC-based stations. To make matters worse for Edison, the Thomson-Houston Electric Company of Lynn, Massachusetts (another AC-based competitor) built 22 power stations.[76]\\r\\nParallel to expanding competition between Edison and the AC companies was rising public furor over a series of deaths in the spring of 1888 caused by pole mounted high voltage alternating current lines. This turned into a media frenzy against high voltage alternating current and the seemingly greedy and callous lighting companies that used it.[77][78] Edison took advantage of the public perception of AC as dangerous, and joined with self-styled New York anti-AC crusader Harold P. Brown in a propaganda campaign, aiding Brown in the public electrocution of animals with AC, and supported legislation to control and severely limit AC installations and voltages (to the point of making it an ineffective power delivery system) in what was now being referred to as a \\"battle of currents\\". The development of the electric chair was used in an attempt to portray AC as having a greater lethal potential than DC and smear Westinghouse at the same time via Edison colluding with Brown and Westinghouse's chief AC rival, the Thomson-Houston Electric Company, to make sure the first electric chair was powered by a Westinghouse AC generator.\\r\\nThomas Edison's staunch anti-AC tactics were not sitting well with his own stockholders. By the early 1890s, Edison's company was generating much smaller profits than its AC rivals, and the War of Currents would come to an end in 1892 with Edison forced out of controlling his own company. That year, the financier J.P. Morgan engineered a merger of Edison General Electric with Thomson-Houston that put the board of Thomson-Houston in charge of the new company called General Electric. General Electric now controlled three-quarters of the US electrical business and would compete with Westinghouse for the AC market.[79][80]\\r\\nEdison is credited with designing and producing the first commercially available fluoroscope, a machine that uses X-rays to take radiographs. Until Edison discovered that calcium tungstate fluoroscopy screens produced brighter images than the barium platinocyanide screens originally used by Wilhelm R?ntgen, the technology was capable of producing only very faint images.\\r\\nThe fundamental design of Edison's fluoroscope is still in use today, although Edison abandoned the project after nearly losing his own eyesight and seriously injuring his assistant, Clarence Dally. Dally made himself an enthusiastic human guinea pig for the fluoroscopy project and was exposed to a poisonous dose of radiation. He later died of injuries related to the exposure. In 1903, a shaken Edison said: \\"Don't talk to me about X-rays, I am afraid of them.\\"[81]\\r\\nThe key to Edison's fortunes was telegraphy. With knowledge gained from years of working as a telegraph operator, he learned the basics of electricity. This allowed him to make his early fortune with the stock ticker, the first electricity-based broadcast system. On August 9, 1892, Edison received a patent for a two-way telegraph.\\r\\nEdison was also granted a patent for the motion picture camera or \\"Kinetograph\\". He did the electromechanical design while his employee W.?K.?L. Dickson, a photographer, worked on the photographic and optical development. Much of the credit for the invention belongs to Dickson.[51] In 1891, Thomas Edison built a Kinetoscope or peep-hole viewer. This device was installed in penny arcades, where people could watch short, simple films. The kinetograph and kinetoscope were both first publicly exhibited May 20, 1891.[83]\\r\\nIn April 1896, Thomas Armat's Vitascope, manufactured by the Edison factory and marketed in Edison's name, was used to project motion pictures in public screenings in New York City. Later, he exhibited motion pictures with voice soundtrack on cylinder recordings, mechanically synchronized with the film.\\r\\nOfficially the kinetoscope entered Europe when the rich American Businessman Irving T. Bush (1869ÿ1948) bought from the Continental Commerce Company of Frank Z. Maguire and Joseph D. Baucus a dozen machines. Bush placed from October 17, 1894, the first kinetoscopes in London. At the same time, the French company Kintoscope Edison Michel et Alexis Werner bought these machines for the market in France. In the last three months of 1894, the Continental Commerce Company sold hundreds of kinetoscopes in Europe (i.e. the Netherlands and Italy). In Germany and in Austria-Hungary, the kinetoscope was introduced by the Deutsche-?sterreichische-Edison-Kinetoscop Gesellschaft, founded by the Ludwig Stollwerck[84] of the Schokoladen-Ssswarenfabrik Stollwerck & Co of Cologne.\\r\\nThe first kinetoscopes arrived in Belgium at the Fairs in early 1895. The Edison's Kintoscope Fran?ais, a Belgian company, was founded in Brussels on January 15, 1895, with the rights to sell the kinetoscopes in Monaco, France and the French colonies. The main investors in this company were Belgian industrialists.[85]\\r\\nOn May 14, 1895, the Edison's Kintoscope Belge was founded in Brussels. The businessman Ladislas-Victor Lewitzki, living in London but active in Belgium and France, took the initiative in starting this business. He had contacts with Leon Gaumont and the American Mutoscope and Biograph Co. In 1898, he also became a shareholder of the Biograph and Mutoscope Company for France.[85]\\r\\nEdison's film studio made close to 1,200 films. The majority of the productions were short films showing everything from acrobats to parades to fire calls including titles such as Fred Ott's Sneeze (1894), The Kiss (1896), The Great Train Robbery (1903), Alice's Adventures in Wonderland (1910), and the first Frankenstein film in 1910. In 1903, when the owners of Luna Park, Coney Island announced they would execute Topsy the elephant by strangulation, poisoning, and electrocution (with the electrocution part ultimately killing the elephant), Edison Manufacturing sent a crew to film it, releasing it that same year with the title Electrocuting an Elephant.\\r\\nAs the film business expanded, competing exhibitors routinely copied and exhibited each other's films.[86] To better protect the copyrights on his films, Edison deposited prints of them on long strips of photographic paper with the U.S. copyright office. Many of these paper prints survived longer and in better condition than the actual films of that era.[87]\\r\\nIn 1908, Edison started the Motion Picture Patents Company, which was a conglomerate of nine major film studios (commonly known as the Edison Trust). Thomas Edison was the first honorary fellow of the Acoustical Society of America, which was founded in 1929.\\r\\nEdison said his favorite movie was The Birth of a Nation. He thought that talkies had \\"spoiled everything\\" for him. \\"There isn't any good acting on the screen. They concentrate on the voice now and have forgotten how to act. I can sense it more than you because I am deaf.\\"[88] His favorite stars were Mary Pickford and Clara Bow.[89]\\r\\nStarting in the late 1870s, Thomas Edison became interested and involved with mining. High-grade iron ore was scarce on the east coast of the United States and Edison tried to mine low-grade ore. Edison developed a process using rollers and crushers that could pulverize rocks up to 10 tons. The dust was then sent between three giant magnets that would pull the iron ore from the dust. Despite the failure of his mining company, the Edison Ore Milling Company, Edison used some of the materials and equipment to produce cement.[90]\\r\\nIn 1901, Edison visited an industrial exhibition in the Sudbury area in Ontario, Canada and thought nickel and cobalt deposits there could be used in his production of electrical equipment. He returned as a mining prospector and is credited with the original discovery of the Falconbridge ore body. His attempts to mine the ore body were not successful, and he abandoned his mining claim in 1903.[91] A street in Falconbridge, as well as the Edison Building, which served as the head office of Falconbridge Mines, are named for him.\\r\\nThe Edison Storage Battery Company was founded in 1901. With this company Edison exploited his invention of the accumulator. In 1904 already 450 people worked at the company. The first accumulators were produced for electric cars. But there were several defects. Several Customers were complaining about the products. When the capital of the company was spent Edison paid for the company with his private money. Not until 1910 Edison showed a mature product: A Nickel-Iron-Battery with Lye as liquid.\\r\\nEdison became concerned with America's reliance on foreign supply of rubber and was determined to find a native supply of rubber. He joined Harvey Firestone and Henry Ford (each contributing $25,000) to create the Edison Botanic Research Corp. in 1927 and constructed a laboratory in Fort Myers, Florida the following year. Edison did the majority of the research and planting, sending results and sample rubber residues to his West Orange Lab. Edison employed a two-part Acid-base extraction, to derive latex from the plant material after it was dried and crushed to a powder.[92] After testing 17,000 plant samples, he eventually found an adequate source in the Goldenrod plant.\\r\\nEdison moved from Menlo Park after the death of his first wife, Mary, in 1884, and purchased a home known as \\"Glenmont\\" in 1886 as a wedding gift for his second wife, Mina, in Llewellyn Park in West Orange, New Jersey. In 1885, Thomas Edison bought property in Fort Myers, Florida, and built what was later called Seminole Lodge as a winter retreat. Edison and Mina spent many winters at their home in Fort Myers, and Edison tried to find a domestic source of natural rubber.[93]\\r\\nDue to the security concerns around World War I, Edison suggested forming a science and industry committee to provide advice and research to the US military, and he headed the Naval Consulting Board in 1915.[94]\\r\\nEdison's work on rubber took place largely at his botanic research laboratory in Fort Myers, which has been designated as a National Historic Chemical Landmark.[95] The laboratory was built after Thomas Edison, Henry Ford, and Harvey Firestone pulled together $75,000 to form the Edison Botanical Research Corporation. Initially, only Ford and Firestone were to contribute funds to the project while Edison did all the research. Edison, however, wished to contribute $25,000 as well. After testing over 17,000 plant species, Edison decided on Solidago leavenworthii, also known as Leavenworth's Goldenrod. The plant, which normally grows roughly 3ÿ4 feet tall with a 5% latex yield, was adapted by Edison through cross-breeding to produce plants twice the size and with a latex yield of 12%.[96]\\r\\nHenry Ford, the automobile magnate, later lived a few hundred feet away from Edison at his winter retreat in Fort Myers. Ford once worked as an engineer for the Edison Illuminating Company of Detroit and met Edison at a convention of affiliated Edison illuminating companies in Brooklyn, NY in 1896. Edison was impressed with Ford's internal combustion engine automobile and encouraged its developments. They were friends until Edison's death. Edison and Ford undertook annual motor camping trips from 1914 to 1924. Harvey Firestone and John Burroughs also participated.\\r\\nIn 1928, Edison joined the Fort Myers Civitan Club. He believed strongly in the organization, writing that \\"The Civitan Club is doing thingsbig thingsfor the community, state, and nation, and I certainly consider it an honor to be numbered in its ranks.\\"[97] He was an active member in the club until his death, sometimes bringing Henry Ford to the club's meetings.\\r\\nEdison was active in business right up to the end. Just months before his death, the Lackawanna Railroad inaugurated suburban electric train service from Hoboken to Montclair, Dover, and Gladstone, New Jersey. Electrical transmission for this service was by means of an overhead catenary system using direct current, which Edison had championed. Despite his frail condition, Edison was at the throttle of the first electric MU (Multiple-Unit) train to depart Lackawanna Terminal in Hoboken in September 1930, driving the train the first mile through Hoboken yard on its way to South Orange.[98]\\r\\nThis fleet of cars would serve commuters in northern New Jersey for the next 54 years until their retirement in 1984. A plaque commemorating Edison's inaugural ride can be seen today in the waiting room of Lackawanna Terminal in Hoboken, which is presently operated by New Jersey Transit.[98]\\r\\nEdison was said to have been influenced by a popular fad diet in his last few years; \\"the only liquid he consumed was a pint of milk every three hours\\".[51] He is reported to have believed this diet would restore his health. However, this tale is doubtful. In 1930, the year before Edison died, Mina said in an interview about him, \\"correct eating is one of his greatest hobbies.\\" She also said that during one of his periodic \\"great scientific adventures\\", Edison would be up at 7:00, have breakfast at 8:00, and be rarely home for lunch or dinner, implying that he continued to have all three.[88]\\r\\nEdison became the owner of his Milan, Ohio, birthplace in 1906. On his last visit, in 1923, he was reportedly shocked to find his old home still lit by lamps and candles.[citation needed]\\r\\nEdison died of complications of diabetes on October 18, 1931, in his home, \\"Glenmont\\" in Llewellyn Park in West Orange, New Jersey, which he had purchased in 1886 as a wedding gift for Mina. He is buried behind the home.[99][100]\\r\\nEdison's last breath is reportedly contained in a test tube at The Henry Ford museum near Detroit. Ford reportedly convinced Charles Edison to seal a test tube of air in the inventor's room shortly after his death, as a memento.[101] A plaster death mask and casts of Edison's hands were also made.[102] Mina died in 1947.\\r\\nHistorian Paul Israel has characterized Edison as a \\"freethinker\\".[51] Edison was heavily influenced by Thomas Paine's The Age of Reason.[51] Edison defended Paine's \\"scientific deism\\", saying, \\"He has been called an atheist, but atheist he was not. Paine believed in a supreme intelligence, as representing the idea which other men often express by the name of deity.\\"[51] In an October 2, 1910, interview in the New York Times Magazine, Edison stated:\\r\\nNature is what we know. We do not know the gods of religions. And nature is not kind, or merciful, or loving. If God made me? the fabled God of the three qualities of which I spoke: mercy, kindness, love? He also made the fish I catch and eat. And where do His mercy, kindness, and love for that fish come in? No; nature made us? nature did it all? not the gods of the religions.[103]\\r\\nEdison was accused of being an atheist for those remarks, and although he did not allow himself to be drawn into the controversy publicly, he clarified himself in a private letter:\\r\\nYou have misunderstood the whole article, because you jumped to the conclusion that it denies the existence of God. There is no such denial, what you call God I call Nature, the Supreme intelligence that rules matter. All the article states is that it is doubtful in my opinion if our intelligence or soul or whatever one may call it lives hereafter as an entity or disperses back again from whence it came, scattered amongst the cells of which we are made.[51]\\r\\nHe also stated, \\"I do not believe in the God of the theologians; but that there is a Supreme Intelligence I do not doubt.\\"[104]\\r\\nNonviolence was key to Edison's moral views, and when asked to serve as a naval consultant for World War I, he specified he would work only on defensive weapons and later noted, \\"I am proud of the fact that I never invented weapons to kill.\\" Edison's philosophy of nonviolence extended to animals as well, about which he stated: \\"Nonviolence leads to the highest ethics, which is the goal of all evolution. Until we stop harming all other living beings, we are still savages.\\"[105][106] He was a vegetarian[107] but not a vegan in actual practice, at least near the end of his life.[51]\\r\\nIn 1920, Edison set off a media sensation when he told B. C. Forbes of American Magazine that he was working on a \\"spirit phone\\" to allow communication with the dead, a story which other newspapers and magazines repeated.[108] Edison later disclaimed the idea, telling the New York Times in 1926 that \\"I really had nothing to tell him, but I hated to disappoint him so I thought up this story about communicating with spirits, but it was all a joke.\\"[109]\\r\\nThomas Edison was an advocate for monetary reform in the United States. He was ardently opposed to the gold standard and debt-based money. Famously, he was quoted in the New York Times stating \\"Gold is a relic of Julius Caesar, and interest is an invention of Satan.\\"[110]\\r\\nIn the same article, he expounded upon the absurdity of a monetary system in which the taxpayer of the United States, in need of a loan, can be compelled to pay in return perhaps double the principal, or even greater sums, due to interest. His basic point was that, if the Government can produce debt-based money, it could equally as well produce money that was a credit to the taxpayer.[110]\\r\\nHe thought at length about the subject of money in 1921 and 1922. In May 1922, he published a proposal, entitled \\"A Proposed Amendment to the Federal Reserve Banking System\\".[111] In it, he detailed an explanation of a commodity-backed currency, in which the Federal Reserve would issue interest-free currency to farmers, based on the value of commodities they produced. During a publicity tour that he took with friend and fellow inventor, Henry Ford, he spoke publicly about his desire for monetary reform. For insight, he corresponded with prominent academic and banking professionals. In the end, however, Edison's proposals failed to find support and were eventually abandoned.[112][113]\\r\\nThe President of the Third French Republic, Jules Grvy, on the recommendation of his Minister of Foreign Affairs, Jules Barthlemy-Saint-Hilaire, and with the presentations of the Minister of Posts and Telegraphs, Louis Cochery, designated Edison with the distinction of an Officer of the Legion of Honour (Lgion d'honneur) by decree on November 10, 1881;[114] Edison was also named a Chevalier in the Legion in 1879, and a Commander in 1889.[115]\\r\\nIn 1887, Edison won the Matteucci Medal. In 1890, he was elected a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.\\r\\nThe Philadelphia City Council named Edison the recipient of the John Scott Medal in 1889.[115]\\r\\nIn 1899, Edison was awarded the Edward Longstreth Medal of The Franklin Institute.[116]\\r\\nHe was named an Honorable Consulting Engineer at the Louisiana Purchase Exposition World's fair in 1904.[115]\\r\\nIn 1908, Edison received the American Association of Engineering Societies John Fritz Medal.[115]\\r\\nIn 1915, Edison was awarded Franklin Medal of The Franklin Institute for discoveries contributing to the foundation of industries and the well-being of the human race.[117]\\r\\nIn 1920, the United States Navy department awarded him the Navy Distinguished Service Medal.[115]\\r\\nIn 1923, the American Institute of Electrical Engineers created the Edison Medal and he was its first recipient.[115]\\r\\nIn 1927, he was granted membership in the National Academy of Sciences.[115]\\r\\nOn May 29, 1928, Edison received the Congressional Gold Medal.[115]\\r\\nIn 1983, the United States Congress, pursuant to Senate Joint Resolution 140 (Public Law 97198), designated February 11, Edison's birthday, as National Inventor's Day.[118]\\r\\nLife magazine (USA), in a special double issue in 1997, placed Edison first in the list of the \\"100 Most Important People in the Last 1000 Years\\", noting that the light bulb he promoted \\"lit up the world\\". In the 2005 television series The Greatest American, he was voted by viewers as the fifteenth greatest.\\r\\nIn 2008, Edison was inducted in the New Jersey Hall of Fame.\\r\\nIn 2010, Edison was honored with a Technical Grammy Award.\\r\\nIn 2011, Edison was inducted into the Entrepreneur Walk of Fame and named a Great Floridian by the Florida Governor and Cabinet.[119]\\r\\nSeveral places have been named after Edison, most notably the town of Edison, New Jersey. Thomas Edison State University, nationally known for adult learners, is in Trenton, New Jersey. Two community colleges are named for him: Edison State College (now Florida SouthWestern State College) in Fort Myers, Florida, and Edison Community College in Piqua, Ohio.[120] There are numerous high schools named after Edison (see Edison High School) and other schools including Thomas A. Edison Middle School. Footballer Pel's father originally named him Edson, as a tribute to the inventor of the light bulb, but the name was incorrectly listed on his birth certificate as \\"Edison\\".[121]\\r\\nThe small town of Alva just east of Fort Myers took Edison's middle name.\\r\\nIn 1883, the City Hotel in Sunbury, Pennsylvania was the first building to be lit with Edison's three-wire system. The hotel was renamed The Hotel Edison upon Edison's return to the city on 1922.[122]\\r\\nLake Thomas A Edison in California was named after Edison to mark the 75th anniversary of the incandescent light bulb.[123]\\r\\nEdison was on hand to turn on the lights at the Hotel Edison in New York City when it opened in 1931.[124]\\r\\nThree bridges around the United States have been named in Edison's honor: the Edison Bridge in New Jersey,[125] the Edison Bridge in Florida,[126] and the Edison Bridge in Ohio.[127]\\r\\nIn space, his name is commemorated in asteroid 742 Edisona.\\r\\nIn West Orange, New Jersey, the 13.5 acres (5.5 hectares) Glenmont estate is maintained and operated by the National Park Service as the Edison National Historic Site, as is his nearby laboratory and workshops including the reconstructed \\"Black Maria\\"the world's first movie studio.[128] The Thomas Alva Edison Memorial Tower and Museum is in the town of Edison, New Jersey.[129] In Beaumont, Texas, there is an Edison Museum, though Edison never visited there.[130] The Port Huron Museum, in Port Huron, Michigan, restored the original depot that Thomas Edison worked out of as a young news butcher. The depot has been named the Thomas Edison Depot Museum.[131] The town has many Edison historical landmarks, including the graves of Edison's parents, and a monument along the St. Clair River. Edison's influence can be seen throughout this city of 32,000.\\r\\nIn Detroit, the Edison Memorial Fountain in Grand Circus Park was created to honor his achievements. The limestone fountain was dedicated October 21, 1929, the fiftieth anniversary of the creation of the lightbulb.[132] On the same night, The Edison Institute was dedicated in nearby Dearborn.\\r\\nHe was inducted into the Automotive Hall of Fame in 1969.\\r\\nA bronze statue of Edison was placed in the National Statuary Hall Collection at the United States Capitol in 2016, with the formal dedication ceremony held on September 20 of that year. The Edison statue replaced one of 19th-century state governor William Allen that had been one of Ohio's two allowed contributions to the collection.[133]\\r\\nThe Edison Medal was created on February 11, 1904, by a group of Edison's friends and associates. Four years later the American Institute of Electrical Engineers (AIEE), later IEEE, entered into an agreement with the group to present the medal as its highest award. The first medal was presented in 1909 to Elihu Thomson. It is the oldest award in the area of electrical and electronics engineering, and is presented annually \\"for a career of meritorious achievement in electrical science, electrical engineering or the electrical arts.\\"\\r\\nIn the Netherlands, the major music awards are named the Edison Award after him. The award is an annual Dutch music prize, awarded for outstanding achievements in the music industry, and is one of the oldest music awards in the world, having been presented since 1960.\\r\\nThe American Society of Mechanical Engineers concedes the Thomas A. Edison Patent Award to individual patents since 2000.[134]\\r\\nThe United States Navy named the USS Edison (DD-439), a Gleaves class destroyer, in his honor in 1940. The ship was decommissioned a few months after the end of World War II.[135] In 1962, the Navy commissioned USS Thomas A. Edison (SSBN-610), a fleet ballistic missile nuclear-powered submarine.[citation needed][136]\\r\\nThomas Edison has appeared in popular culture as a character in novels, films, comics and video games.

Morris in 1973 identified the following seven figures as the key Founding Fathers: John Adams, Benjamin Franklin, Alexander Hamilton, John Jay, Thomas Jefferson, James Madison, and George Washington.[3][4] Adams, Jefferson, and Franklin were members of the Committee of Five that drafted the Declaration of Independence. Hamilton, Madison, and Jay were authors of The Federalist Papers, advocating ratification of the Constitution. The constitutions drafted by Jay and Adams for their respective states of New York (1777) and Massachusetts (1780) were heavily relied upon when creating language for the US Constitution [5] Jay, Adams and Franklin negotiated the Treaty of Paris (1783) that would end the American Revolutionary War.[6] Washington was Commander-in-Chief of the Continental Army and was President of the Constitutional Convention. Washington, Jay and Franklin are considered the Founding Fathers of U.S. Intelligence by the CIA.[7] All held additional important roles in the early government of the United States, with Washington, Adams, Jefferson, and Madison serving as President. Jay was the nation's first Chief Justice. Four of these seven - Washington, Jay, Hamilton and Madison - were not signers of the Declaration of Independence.[8]\\r\\nThe term Founding Fathers is sometimes used to refer to the Signers of the embossed version of the Declaration of Independence in 1776.[9] It is not to be confused with the term Framers; the Framers are defined by the National Archives as those 55 individuals who were appointed to be delegates to the 1787 Constitutional Convention and took part in drafting the proposed Constitution of the United States. Of the 55 Framers, only 39 were signers of the Constitution.[10][11] Two further groupings of Founding Fathers include: 1) those who signed the Continental Association, a trade ban and one of the colonists' first collective volleys protesting British control and the Intolerable Acts in 1774 [12] or 2) those who signed the Articles of Confederation, the first U.S. constitutional document.[13]\\r\\nThe phrase \\"Founding Fathers\\" is a twentieth-century appellation, coined by Warren G. Harding in 1916.[14] In the 19th century, they were referred to as simply, the \\"Fathers\\".\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe First Continental Congress met briefly in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania in 1774, consisting of fifty-six delegates from twelve of the thirteen colonies (excluding Georgia) that became the United States of America. Among them was George Washington, who would soon be drawn out of military retirement to command the Continental Army during the American Revolutionary War. Also in attendance was Patrick Henry, and John Adams, who like all delegates were elected by their respective colonial assemblies. Other delegates included Samuel Adams from Massachusetts, John Dickinson from Pennsylvania and New York's John Jay. This congress in addition to formulating appeals to the British crown, established the Continental Association to administer boycott actions against Britain.\\r\\nWhen the Second Continental Congress convened on May 10, 1775, it essentially reconstituted the First Congress. Many of the same 56 delegates who attended the first meeting participated in the second.[15] New arrivals included Benjamin Franklin and Robert Morris of Pennsylvania, John Hancock of Massachusetts, and John Witherspoon of New Jersey. Hancock was elected Congress President two weeks into the session when Peyton Randolph was recalled to Virginia to preside over the House of Burgesses. Thomas Jefferson replaced Randolph in the Virginia congressional delegation.[16] The second Congress adopted the Declaration of Independence. Witherspoon was the only active clergyman to sign the Declaration. He also signed the Articles of Confederation and attended the New Jersey (1787) convention that ratified the Federal Constitution.[17]\\r\\nThe newly founded country of the United States had to create a new government to replace the British Parliament. The U.S. adopted the Articles of Confederation, a declaration that established a national government with a one-house legislature. Its ratification by all thirteen colonies gave the second Congress a new name: the Congress of the Confederation, which met from 1781 to 1789.[18] Later, the Constitutional Convention took place during the summer of 1787, in Philadelphia.[19] Although the Convention was called to revise the Articles of Confederation, the intention from the outset for some including James Madison and Alexander Hamilton was to create a new frame of government rather than amending the existing one. The delegates elected George Washington to preside over the Convention. The result of the Convention was the United States Constitution.\\r\\nThe Founding Fathers represented a cross-section of 18th-century U.S. leadership. Almost all of them were well-educated men of means who were leaders in their communities. Many were also prominent in national affairs. Virtually every one had taken part in the American Revolution; at least 29 had served in the Continental Army, most of them in positions of command. Scholars have examined the collective biography of them as well as the signers of the Declaration and the Constitution.[20]\\r\\nMany of the Founding Fathers attended or held degrees from the colonial colleges, most notably Columbia, Princeton, Harvard, the College of William and Mary, Yale and University of Pennsylvania. Some had previously been home schooled or obtained early instruction from private tutors or academies.[21] Others had studied abroad. Ironically, Benjamin Franklin who had little formal education himself would ultimately establish the University of Pennsylvania based on European models (1740); \\"Penn\\" would have the first medical school (1765) in the thirteen colonies where another Founder, Benjamin Rush would eventually teach.\\r\\nWith a limited number of professional schools established in the U.S., Founders also sought advanced degrees from traditional institutions in England and Scotland such as the University of Edinburgh and University of St. Andrews.\\r\\nSeveral like John Jay, James Wilson, John Williams and George Wythe[25] were trained as lawyers through apprenticeships in the colonies while a few trained at the Inns of Court in London.\\r\\nFranklin, Washington, John Williams and Henry Wisner had little formal education and were largely self-taught or learned through apprenticeship.\\r\\nThe Founding Fathers had extensive political experience. Many had been members of the Continental Congress. Nearly all of the 55 Constitutional Convention delegates had experience in colonial and state government, and the majority had held county and local offices.[26]\\r\\nHistorian Caroline Robbins in 1977 examined the status of the Signers of the Declaration of Independence and concluded:\\r\\nThe Founding Fathers practiced a wide range of high and middle-status occupations, and many pursued more than one career simultaneously. They did not differ dramatically from the Loyalists, except they were generally younger and less senior in their professions.[28] A few of them were wealthy or had financial resources that ranged from good to excellent, but there are other founders who were less than wealthy. On the whole they were less wealthy than the Loyalists.[29]\\r\\nFranklin T. Lambert (2003) has examined the religious affiliations and beliefs of the Founders. Of the 55 delegates to the 1787 Constitutional Convention, 28 were Anglicans (in the Church of England; or Episcopalian, after the American Revolutionary War was won), 21 were Protestants, and two were Roman Catholics (D. Carroll, and Fitzsimons).[32] Among the Protestant delegates to the Constitutional Convention, eight were Presbyterians, seven were Congregationalists, two were Lutherans, two were Dutch Reformed, and two were Methodists.[32]\\r\\nA few prominent Founding Fathers were anti-clerical Christians such as Thomas Jefferson,[33][34][35] who constructed the Jefferson Bible, and Benjamin Franklin.[36]\\r\\nHistorian Gregg L. Frazer argues that the leading Founders (Adams, Jefferson, Franklin, Wilson, Morris, Madison, Hamilton, and Washington) were neither Christians nor Deists, but rather supporters of a hybrid \\"theistic rationalism\\".[37]\\r\\nThe Faiths of the Founding Fathers is a book that discusses the religion held by the founding fathers, written in 2006 by historian of U.S. religion David L. Holmes.\\r\\nOne of the greatest contradictions of the Founding Fathers was their disunity with regard to slavery at a time that they were seeking liberty for themselves. In her study of Thomas Jefferson, historian Annette Gordon-Reed emphasizes this irony, \\"Others of the founders held slaves, but no other founder drafted the charter for freedom, \\"[38] In addition to Jefferson, George Washington, John Jay and many other of the Founding Fathers practiced slavery but were also conflicted by the institution which many saw as immoral and politically divisive.[39] Benjamin Franklin owned slaves (though Franklin later became an abolitionist).[40] John Jay would try unsuccessfully to abolish slavery as early as 1777 in the State of New York but was overruled (though he would later sign the Gradual Emancipation Act into law while Governor).[41] Alexander Hamilton opposed slavery, as his experiences in life left him very familiar with slavery and its effect on slaves and on slaveholders,[42] although he did negotiate slave transactions for his wife's family, the Schuylers.[43] John Adams, Samuel Adams, and Thomas Paine never owned slaves [44]\\r\\nSlaves and slavery are mentioned only indirectly in the 1787 Constitution. For example, Article 1, Section 2, Clause 3 prescribes that \\"three fifths of all other Persons\\" are to be counted for the apportionment of seats in the House of Representatives and direct taxes. Additionally, in Article 4, Section 2, Clause 3, slaves are referred to as \\"persons held in service or labor\\".[40][45] The Founding Fathers, however, did make important efforts to contain slavery. Many Northern states had adopted legislation to end or significantly reduce slavery during and after the American Revolution.[45] In 1782 Virginia passed a manumission law that allowed slave owners to free their slaves by will or deed.[46] As a result, thousands of slaves were manumitted in Virginia.[46] Thomas Jefferson, in 1784, proposed to ban slavery in all the Western Territories, which failed to pass Congress by one vote.[45] Partially following Jefferson's plan, Congress did ban slavery in the Northwest Ordinance of 1787, for lands north of the Ohio River.[45]\\r\\nThe international slave trade was banned in all states except South Carolina, by 1800. Finally in 1807, President Jefferson called for and signed into law a Federally-enforced ban on the international slave trade throughout the U.S. and its territories. It became a federal crime to import or export a slave.[47] However, the domestic slave trade was allowed, for expansion, or for diffusion of slavery into the Louisiana Territory.[48]\\r\\nIn the winter and spring of 1786ÿ1787, twelve of the thirteen states chose a total of 74 delegates to attend the Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia. Nineteen delegates chose not to accept election or attend the debates; for example, Patrick Henry of Virginia thought that state politics were far more interesting and important than national politics, though during the ratification controversy of 1787ÿ1788 he claimed, \\"I smelled a rat.\\" Rhode Island did not send delegates because of its politicians' suspicions of the Convention delegates' motivations. As the colony was founded by Roger Williams as a sanctuary for Baptists, Rhode Island's absence at the Convention in part explains the absence of Baptist affiliation among those who did attend. Of the 55 who did attend at some point, no more than 38 delegates showed up at one time.[49]\\r\\nMost of the Founding Fathers married and had children. Many of their spouses, like Eliza Schuyler Hamilton, Martha Washington, Abigail Adams, Sarah Livingston Jay, Dolley Madison, Mary White Morris and Catherine Alexander Duer were strong women and made significant contributions of their own to the fight for liberty.[50]\\r\\nSherman fathered the largest family: 15 children by two wives. At least nine (Bassett, Brearly, Johnson, Mason, Paterson, Charles Cotesworth Pinckney, Sherman, Wilson, and Wythe) married more than once. Four (Baldwin, Gilman, Jenifer, and Alexander Martin) were lifelong bachelors. Many of the delegates also had children conceived illegitimately.[51] George Washington, \\"The Father of our Country,\\"[52] had no biological descendants.\\r\\nThe National Archives and Records Administration also known as NARA, defines U.S. Founding Documents, or Charters of Freedom, as the Declaration of Independence (1776), The Constitution (1787) and the Bill of Rights (1791). These original instruments which represent the philosophy of the United States are housed in Washington, D.C. in the NARA Rotunda.[53] The Library of Congress further identifies the Articles of Confederation, also preserved at NARA, as a primary U.S. document.[54] The Articles of Confederation served as the first constitution of the United States until its replacement by the present Constitution on March 4, 1789.\\r\\nSignatories of the Continental Association (CA), Declaration of Independence (DI), Articles of Confederation (AC), and the United States Constitution (USC)):\\r\\nSubsequent events in the lives of the Founding Fathers after the adoption of the Constitution were characterized by success or failure, reflecting the abilities of these men as well as the vagaries of fate.[55] Washington, Adams, Jefferson and Madison served in highest U.S. office of President. Jay would be elected to two terms as Governor of New York.\\r\\nSeven (Fitzsimons, Gorham, Luther Martin, Mifflin, Robert Morris, Pierce, and Wilson) suffered serious financial reversals that left them in or near bankruptcy. Robert Morris spent three of the last years of his life imprisoned following bad land deals.[50] Two, Blount and Dayton, were involved in possibly treasonous activities. Yet, as they had done before the convention, most of the group continued to render public service, particularly to the new government they had helped to create.\\r\\nMany of the Founding Fathers were under 40 years old at the time of the signing of the Declaration of Independence in 1776: James Armistead Lafayette was 15, Marquis de Lafayette was 18, Alexander Hamilton was 19, Aaron Burr was 20, Gouverneur Morris and Betsy Ross were 24. The oldest were Benjamin Franklin, 70 and Samuel Whittemore, 81.[56]\\r\\nSecretary Charles Thomson lived to the age of 94. Johnson died at 92. John Adams lived to the age of 90. A few  Franklin, Jay, Jefferson, Madison, Hugh Williamson, and George Wythe  lived into their eighties. Approximately 16 died in their seventies, 21 in their sixties, 8 in their fifties, and 5 in their forties. Three (Alexander Hamilton, Richard Dobbs Spaight and Button Gwinnett) were killed in duels.\\r\\nFriends and political adversaries John Adams and Thomas Jefferson both died on the same day - July 4, 1826 [57]\\r\\nThe last remaining founders, also called the \\"Last of the Romans\\", lived well into the nineteenth century.[58]\\r\\nThe following men and women are also recognized by many as having been founders of the United States based upon their significant contributions to the formation of American nation and democracy.\\r\\nSeveral Founding Fathers were instrumental in establishing schools and societal institutions that still exist today:\\r\\nArticles and books by twenty-first century historians combined with the digitization of primary sources like handwritten letters continue to contribute to an encyclopedic body of knowledge about the Founding Fathers.\\r\\nRon Chernow won the Pulitzer Prize for his biography of George Washington. His bestselling book about Alexander Hamilton inspired the blockbuster musical of the same name.\\r\\nJoseph J. Ellis - According to Ellis, the concept of the Founding Fathers of the U.S. emerged in the 1820s as the last survivors died out. Ellis says \\"the founders\\", or \\"the fathers\\", comprised an aggregate of semi-sacred figures whose particular accomplishments and singular achievements were decidedly less important than their sheer presence as a powerful but faceless symbol of past greatness. For the generation of national leaders coming of age in the 1820s and 1830s ÿ men like Andrew Jackson, Henry Clay, Daniel Webster, and John C. Calhoun ÿ \\"the founders\\" represented a heroic but anonymous abstraction whose long shadow fell across all followers and whose legendary accomplishments defied comparison.\\r\\n\\"We can win no laurels in a war for independence,\\" Webster acknowledged in 1825. \\"Earlier and worthier hands have gathered them all.

Freeman Freeman's area of expertise is the life and legacy of Alexander Hamilton as well as political culture of the revolutionary and early national eras.[89][90][91] Freeman has documented the often opposing visions of the Founding Fathers as they tried to build a new framework for governance, \\"Regional distrust, personal animosity, accusation, suspicion, implication, and denouncementthis was the tenor of national politics from the outset.

It is often encountered as the heptahydrate sulfate mineral epsomite (MgSO4{7H2O), commonly called Epsom salt. The overall global annual usage in the mid-1970s of the monohydrate was 2.3 million tons, of which the majority was used in agriculture.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nEpsom salt has been traditionally used as a component of bath salts. Epsom salt can also be used as a beauty product. Athletes use it to soothe sore muscles, while gardeners use it to improve crops. It has a variety of other uses: for example, Epsom salt is also effective in the removal of splinters.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nA variety of hydrates are known.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe heptahydrate (epsomite) readily loses one equivalent of water to form the hexahydrate.  Epsom salt takes its name from a bitter saline spring in Epsom in Surrey, England, where the salt was produced from the springs that arise where the porous chalk of the North Downs meets non-porous London clay.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe monohydrate, MgSO4{H2O is found as the mineral kieserite. It can be prepared by heating the hexahydrate to approximately 150?C.  Further heating to approximately 200?C gives anhydrous magnesium sulfate.  Upon further heating, the anhydrous salt decomposes into magnesium oxide (MgO) and sulfur trioxide (SO3).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe heptahydrate can be prepared by neutralizing sulfuric acid with magnesium carbonate or oxide, but it is usually obtained directly from natural sources.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is on the WHO Model List of Essential Medicines, the most important medications needed in a basic health system.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nMagnesium sulfate is a common mineral pharmaceutical preparation of magnesium, commonly known as Epsom salt, used both externally and internally. Magnesium sulfate is highly water-soluble and solubility is inhibited with lipids typically used in lotions. Lotions often employ the use of emulsions or suspensions to include both oil and water-soluble ingredients.  Hence, magnesium sulfate in a lotion may not be as freely available to migrate to the skin nor to be absorbed through the skin, hence both studies may properly suggest absorption or lack thereof as a function of the carrier (in a water solution vs. in an oil emulsion/suspension).  Temperature and concentration gradients may also be contributing factors to absorption.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nExternally, magnesium sulfate paste is used to treat skin inflammations such as small boils or localised infections. Known in the UK as 'drawing paste' it is also used to remove splinters.[6] The standard British Pharmacopoeia composition is dried Magnesium Sulfate 47.76?% w/w, Phenol 0.49?% w/w. and glycerol (E422).[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nEpsom salt is used as bath salts and for isolation tanks. Magnesium sulfate is the main preparation of intravenous magnesium.\\r\\n\\r\\nInternal uses include:\\r\\n\\r\\nIn agriculture, magnesium sulfate is used to increase magnesium or sulfur content in soil. It is most commonly applied to potted plants, or to magnesium-hungry crops, such as potatoes, roses, tomatoes, lemon trees, carrots, and peppers. The advantage of magnesium sulfate over other magnesium soil amendments (such as dolomitic lime) is its high solubility, which also allows the option of foliar feeding. Solutions of magnesium sulfate are also nearly neutral, compared with alkaline salts of magnesium as found in limestone; therefore, the use of magnesium sulfate as a magnesium source for soil does not significantly change the soil pH.[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nMagnesium sulfate is used as a brewing salt in beer.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt may also be used as a coagulant for making tofu.[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nAnhydrous magnesium sulfate is commonly used as a desiccant in organic synthesis due to its affinity for water. During work-up, an organic phase is treated with anhydrous magnesium sulfate. The hydrated solid is then removed with filtration or decantation. Other inorganic sulfate salts such as sodium sulfate and calcium sulfate may be used in the same way.\\r\\n\\r\\nMagnesium sulfate heptahydrate is also used to maintain the magnesium concentration in marine aquaria which contain large amounts of stony corals, as it is slowly depleted in their calcification process. In a magnesium-deficient marine aquarium, calcium and alkalinity concentrations are very difficult to control because not enough magnesium is present to stabilize these ions in the saltwater and prevent their spontaneous precipitation into calcium carbonate.[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nMagnesium sulfates are common minerals in geological environments. Their occurrence is mostly connected with supergene processes. Some of them are also important constituents of evaporitic potassium-magnesium (K-Mg) salts deposits.\\r\\n\\r\\nBright spots observed by the Dawn Spacecraft in Occator Crater on the dwarf planet Ceres are most consistent with reflected light from magnesium sulfate hexahydrate.[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nAlmost all known mineralogical forms of MgSO4 are hydrates. Epsomite is the natural analogue of \\"Epsom salt\\". Another heptahydrate, the copper-containing mineral alpersite (Mg,Cu)SO4{7H2O,[18] was recently recognized. Both are, however, not the highest known hydrates of MgSO4, due to the recent terrestrial find of meridianiite, MgSO4{11H2O, which is thought to also occur on Mars. Hexahydrite is the next lower (6) hydrate. Three next lower hydratespentahydrite, starkeyite, and especially sanderite are rare. Kieserite is a monohydrate and is common among evaporitic deposits. Anhydrous magnesium sulfate was reported from some burning coal dumps.\\r\\n\\r\\nDouble salts containing magnesium sulfate exist, for example there are several known sodium magnesium sulfates and potassium magnesium sulfates.\\r\\n\\r\\nAn abnormally elevated plasma concentration of magnesium is called hypermagnesemia.","input":"What is the chemical formula of magnesium sulphate?"},{"output":"October 12, 1492","context":"Columbus Day is a national holiday in many countries of the Americas and elsewhere which officially celebrates the anniversary of Christopher Columbus's arrival in the Americas on October 12, 1492. The landing is celebrated as \\"Columbus Day\\" in the United States, as \\"Da de la Raza\\" (\\"Day of the Race\\") in some countries in Latin America, as \\"Da de la Hispanidad\\" and \\"Fiesta Nacional\\" in Spain, where it is also the religious festivity of la Virgen del Pilar, as Da de las Amricas (Day of the Americas) in Belize and Uruguay, as Da del Respeto a la Diversidad Cultural (Day of Respect for Cultural Diversity) in Argentina, and as Giornata Nazionale di Cristoforo Colombo or Festa Nazionale di Cristoforo Colombo in Italy as well as in Little Italys around the world.[1][2] As the day of remembrance of Our Lady of the Pillar, 12 October had been declared a religious feast day throughout the Spanish Empire in 1730; the secular Fiesta de la Raza Espa?ola was first proposed by Faustino Rodrguez-San Pedro y Daz-Argelles in 1913.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nColumbus Day first became an official state holiday in Colorado in the autumn of 1905,[citation needed] and it became a federal holiday in the United States in 1937.[citation needed] Celebration of Columbus's voyage in the early United States is recorded from as early as 1792, when the Tammany Society in New York City[3] (for whom it became an annual tradition)[4][5] and also the Massachusetts Historical Society in Boston celebrated the 300th anniversary of Columbus' landing in the New World.[6][7] President Benjamin Harrison called upon the people of the United States to celebrate Columbus's landing in the New World on the 400th anniversary of the event. During the anniversary in 1892, teachers, preachers, poets and politicians used rituals to teach ideals of patriotism. These rituals took themes such as citizenship boundaries, the importance of loyalty to the nation, and the celebration of social progress.[8][9][10]\\r\\nMany Italian-Americans observe Columbus Day as a celebration of their heritage, and the first such celebration was held in New York City on October 12, 1866.[11] The day was first enshrined as a legal holiday in the United States through the lobbying of Angelo Noce, a first generation Italian, in Denver. The first statewide holiday was proclaimed by Colorado governor Jesse F. McDonald in 1905, and it was made a statutory holiday in 1907.[12] In April 1934, as a result of lobbying by the Knights of Columbus and New York City Italian leader Generoso Pope, Congress and President Franklin Delano Roosevelt proclaimed October 12 a federal holiday under the name Columbus Day.[12][13][14]\\r\\nSince 1971 (Oct. 11), the holiday has been fixed to the second Monday in October,[15] coincidentally exactly the same day as Thanksgiving in neighboring Canada fixed since 1957. It is generally observed nowadays by banks, the bond market, the U.S. Postal Service, other federal agencies, most state government offices, many businesses, and most school districts. Some businesses and some stock exchanges remain open, and some states and municipalities abstain from observing the holiday.[16] The traditional date of the holiday also adjoins the anniversary of the United States Navy (founded October 13, 1775), and thus both occasions are customarily observed by the Navy (and usually the Marine Corps as well) with either a 72- or 96-hour liberty period.[citation needed]\\r\\nActual observance varies in different parts of the United States, ranging from large-scale parades and events to complete non-observance. Most states celebrate Columbus Day as an official state holiday, though many mark it as a \\"Day of Observance\\" or \\"Recognition\\" and at least four do not recognize it at all. Most states that celebrate Columbus Day will close state services, while others operate as normal.[17]\\r\\nSan Francisco claims the nation's oldest continuously existing celebration with the Italian-American community's annual Columbus Day Parade, which was established by Nicola Larco in 1868,[18] while New York City boasts the largest, with over 35,000 marchers and one million viewers.[19][20][21]\\r\\nAs in the mainland U.S., Columbus Day is a legal holiday in the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico. In the United States Virgin Islands, the day is celebrated as both Columbus Day and \\"Puerto Rico Friendship Day\\".[22]\\r\\nVirginia also celebrates two legal holidays on the day, Columbus Day and Yorktown Victory Day, which honors the final victory at the Siege of Yorktown in the Revolutionary War.[23]\\r\\nThe U.S. states of Alaska, Hawaii, Oregon, South Dakota, and Vermont do not recognize Columbus Day at all; however, they mark the day with an alternative holiday or observance. Hawaii celebrates Discoverer's Day, which commemorates the Polynesian discoverers of Hawaii on the same date, the second Monday of October,[24][25] though the name change has not ended protest related to the observance of Columbus's discovery.[26] The state government does not treat either Columbus Day or Discoverer's Day as a legal holiday;[27] state, city and county government offices and schools are open for business. Similarly, in 2016, Vermont started celebrating Indigenous Peoples' Day instead of Columbus Day. Because this change was made by Governor Peter Shumlin's executive proclamation, it only applies for 2016. In the future it would have to be issued by the sitting governor on a yearly basis, or officially changed by the legislature in order to become permanent.[28] On the other hand, South Dakota celebrates the day as an official state holiday known as Native American Day.[29] Until 2017, Oregon did not recognize Columbus Day, either as a holiday or as a commemoration; schools and public offices remained open.[30] However, on Columbus Day, 2017, Oregon Governor Kate Brown renamed the holiday \\"Indigenous Peoples' Day,\\" to remember these cultures and commemorate the struggles of native peoples during European colonization.[31] Two additional states, Iowa and Nevada, do not celebrate it as an official holiday, but the states' respective governors are \\"authorized and requested\\" by statute to proclaim the day each year.[32]\\r\\nSeveral other states have removed the day as a paid holiday for government workers while still maintaining it either as a day of recognition, or as a legal holiday for other purposes. These include California and Texas.[33][34][35][36][37]\\r\\nThe city of Berkeley, California, replaced Columbus Day with Indigenous Peoples' Day in 1992,[38] a move which has been followed by multiple other localities including Sebastopol and Santa Cruz, California; Dane County, Wisconsin; Seattle, Washington; Missoula, Montana; Cambridge, Massachusetts; Denver, Colorado; Phoenix, Arizona; Los Angeles, California; Austin, Texas; and Salt Lake City, Utah.[39][40][34][41][42][43][44][45][46] Various tribal governments in Oklahoma designate the day Native American Day, or name it after their own tribe.[47]\\r\\nThe date Columbus arrived in the Americas is celebrated in some countries of Latin America. The most common name for the celebration in Spanish (including some Latin American communities[48] in the United States) is the Da de la Raza (\\"day of the race\\" or the \\"day of the [Hispanic] people\\"), commemorating the first encounters of Europeans and Native Americans. The day was first celebrated in Argentina in 1917, in Venezuela and Colombia in 1921, in Chile in 1922, and in Mexico, it was first celebrated in 1928. The day was also celebrated under this title in Spain until 1957, when it was changed to the Da de la Hispanidad (\\"Hispanicity Day\\"), and in Venezuela it was celebrated under this title until 2002, when it was changed to the Da de la Resistencia Indgena (Day of Indigenous Resistance). Originally conceived of as a celebration of Hispanic influence in the Americas, as evidenced by the complementary celebrations in Spain and Latin America, Da de la Raza has come to be seen by indigenous activists throughout Latin America as a counter to Columbus Day; a celebration of the native races and cultures and their resistance to the arrival of Europeans in the Americas.[citation needed]\\r\\nIn the U.S. Da de la Raza has served as a time of mobilization for pan-ethnic Latino activists, particularly since the 1960s. Since then, La Raza has served as a periodic rallying cry for Hispanic activists. The first Hispanic March on Washington occurred on Columbus Day in 1996. The name is still used by the largest Hispanic social justice organization in the nation, the National Council of La Raza.[8]\\r\\nThe Day of the Race was established in Argentina in 1916 by a decree of President Hip܇lito Yrigoyen. The name was changed to \\"Day of Respect of Cultural Diversity\\" by a Decree of Necessity and Urgency 1584/2010 issued by populist President Cristina Kirchner. Instigated by then Venezuelan president Chvez, she had the statue of Columbus removed from its original position near the Casa Rosada and replaced by one of Juana Azurduy.\\r\\nColombia, the only country in the world with a name originated from Columbus himself, celebrates El da de la Raza y de la Hispanidad and is taken as an opportunity to celebrate the encounter of \\"the two worlds\\" and to reflect on the richness that the racial diversity has brought to the culture.\\r\\nBetween 1921 and 2002, Venezuela celebrated Da de la Raza along with many other Latin American nations. The original holiday was officially established in 1921 under President Juan Vicente G܇mez. In 2002, under president Hugo Chvez, the name was changed to Da de la Resistencia Indgena (Day of Indigenous Resistance) to commemorate the Indigenous peoples' resistance to European settlement. On October 12, 2004 a crowd of pro-government activists toppled the statue of Christopher Columbus in Caracas and sprayed allusive graffiti over its pedestal. The pro-Chvez website Aporrea wrote: \\"Just like the statue of Saddam in Baghdad, that of Columbus the tyrant also fell this October 12, 2004 in Caracas\\".[50] The famous toppling of Saddam Hussein's statue had occurred the previous year.\\r\\nOn September 21, 1994, Costa Rica changed the official holiday from Da de la Raza to Da del Encuentro de las Culturas(Day of the Encounter of Cultures) to recognize the mix of European, Native American (autochthonous populations), African and Asian cultures that constitute modern Costa Rican (and Latin American) culture and ethnicity. In accordance to the Costa Rican labor law, the holiday is observed on October 12. However, should this date coincide with a Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday or Friday, the employer shall agree that said holiday be postponed to the following Monday. [51]\\r\\nIn Brazil Columbus Day is not celebrated. Instead, the country celebrates the arrival on the coast of present-day Brazil of the fleet led by Portuguese explorer Pedro lvares Cabral on April 22, 1500. This date is known in Brazil as \\"O Descobrimento do Brazil\\" (The Discovery of Brazil). The date began to be celebrated after the country's independence from Portugal, when Brazilian Emperor Pedro II instituted the date as part of a plan to foster a sense of nationalism among Brazil's diverse citizenrygiving them a common identity and history as residents of a unique Portuguese-speaking empire surrounded by Hispanic-American Republics. [52] The Discovery of Brazil was originally celebrated on May 3, but scholars in the nineteen century found definitive evidence proving April 22 to be the actual date of the arrival of Cabral's fleet on South American shores. [53] In 2000, the government of Brazil used the date to celebrate 500 years of the existence of the country. The festivities, however, were met with protests by indigenous peoples who claimed it marked 500 years of genocide of indigenous Brazilians.[54] [55]\\r\\nSome Caribbean countries also observe holidays related to Columbus Day. In Belize, October 12 is celebrated as Day of the Americas or Pan American Day.[56][57][58] In the Bahamas, it was formerly known as Discovery Day, until 2001 when it was replaced by National Heroes Day.\\r\\nSince the 18th century, many Italian communities in the Americas have observed the Discovery of the New World as a celebration of their heritage; Cristopher Columbus (whose original, Italian name is \\"Cristoforo Colombo\\") was an Italian explorer, citizen of the Republic of Genoa.[11]\\r\\nIn Italy, Columbus Day has been officially celebrated since 2004.[2] It is officially named Giornata nazionale di Cristoforo Colombo.\\r\\nThe \\"Lega Navale Italiana\\" has created a Regata di Colombo as a celebration of the Columbus achievement.[59] Italians have celebrated their \\"Cristoforo Colombo\\" naming after him many civilian and military ships, like the ocean liner SS Cristoforo Colombo.\\r\\nSince 1987, Spain has celebrated the anniversary of Columbus's arrival in the Americas as its Fiesta Nacional or \\"National Day\\".[60] Previously Spain had celebrated the day as Da de la Hispanidad, emphasizing Spain's ties with the Hispanidad, the international Hispanic community.[60] In 1981 a royal decree established the Da de la Hispanidad as a national holiday.[60] However, in 1987 the name was changed to Fiesta Nacional, and October 12 became one of two national celebrations, along with Constitution Day on December 6.[61] Spain's \\"national day\\" had moved around several times during the various regime changes of the 20th century; establishing it on the day of the international Columbus celebration was part of a compromise between conservatives, who wanted to emphasize the status of the monarchy and Spain's history, and Republicans, who wanted to commemorate Spain's burgeoning democracy with an official holiday.[61] Since 2000, October 12 has also been Spain's Day of the Armed Forces, celebrated each year with a military parade in Madrid.[61] Other than this, however, the holiday is not widely or enthusiastically celebrated in Spain; there are no other large-scale patriotic parades, marches, or other events, and the observation is generally overshadowed by the feast day of Our Lady of the Pillar (Fiestas del Pilar).[61]\\r\\nOpposition to Columbus Day dates back to at least the 19th century, when anti-immigrant nativists (see Know Nothings) sought to eliminate its celebration because of its association with immigrants from the Catholic countries of Ireland and Italy, and the American Catholic fraternal organization, the Knights of Columbus.[62] Some anti-Catholics, notably including the Ku Klux Klan and the Women of the Ku Klux Klan, opposed celebrations of Columbus or monuments about him because they thought that it increased Catholic influence in the US, which was largely a Protestant country.[62]\\r\\nBy far the more common opposition today, decrying both Columbus's and other Europeans actions against the indigenous populations of the Americas, did not gain much traction until the latter half of the 20th century. This opposition was led by Native Americans and expanded upon by left-wing political parties,[63][64][65][66][67] though it has become more mainstream.[68] Surveys conducted in 2013 and 2015 found 26% to 38% of American adults not in favor of celebrating Columbus Day.[69][70]\\r\\nThere are many interrelated strands of criticism. One refers primarily to the treatment of the indigenous populations during the European colonization of the Americas which followed Columbus's discovery. Some groups, such as the American Indian Movement, have argued that the ongoing actions and injustices against Native Americans are masked by Columbus myths and celebrations. These groups argue that the legacy of Columbus has been used to legitimize these actions. F. David Peat asserts that many cultural myths of North America exclude or diminish the culture and myths of Native Americans. These cultural myths include ideas expressed by Michael Berliner of the Ayn Rand Institute, claiming that Western civilization brought \\"reason, science, self-reliance, individualism, ambition, and productive achievement\\" to a people who were based in \\"primitivism, mysticism, and collectivism\\", and to a land that was \\"sparsely inhabited, unused, and underdeveloped\\".[71] American anthropologist Jack Weatherford says that on Columbus Day, Americans celebrate the greatest waves of genocide of the American Indians known in history.[72] American Indian Movement of Colorado leader and activist Ward Churchill takes this argument further, contending that the mythologizing and celebration of the European settlement of the Americas in Columbus Day make it easier for people today to avoid taking responsibility for their own actions, or the actions of their governments regarding indigenous populations. He wrote in his book Bringing the Law Back Home:\\r\\nVery high on the list of those expressions of non-indigenous sensibility [that] contribute to the perpetuation of genocidal policies against [American] Indians are the annual Columbus Day celebration, events in which it is baldly asserted that the process, events, and circumstances described above are, at best, either acceptable or unimportant. More often, the sentiments expressed by the participants are, quite frankly, that the fate of Native America embodied in Columbus and the Columbian legacy is a matter to be openly and enthusiastically applauded as an unrivaled \\"boon to all mankind\\". Undeniably, the situation of American Indians will notin fact cannotchange for the better so long as such attitudes are deemed socially acceptable by the mainstream populace. Hence, such celebrations as Columbus Day must be stopped.\\r\\nA second strain of criticism of Columbus Day focuses on the character of Columbus himself. In time for the 2004 observation of the day, the final volume of a compendium of Columbus-era documents was published by the University of California, Los Angeles's Medieval and Renaissance Center. Geoffrey Symcox, the general editor of the project, asserted:[73]\\r\\nWhile giving the brilliant mariner his due, the collection portrays Columbus as an unrelenting social climber and self-promoter who stopped at nothingnot even exploitation, slavery, or twisting Biblical scriptureto advance his ambitions Many of the unflattering documents have been known for the last century or more, but nobody paid much attention to them until recently The fact that Columbus brought slavery, enormous exploitation or devastating diseases to the Americas used to be seen as a minor detailif it was recognized at allin light of his role as the great bringer of white man's civilization to the benighted idolatrous American continent. But to historians today this information is very important. It changes our whole view of the enterprise.\\r\\nHoward Zinn described some of the details of how Columbus personally ordered the enslavement and mutilation of the native Arawak people in a bid to repay his investors:\\r\\nNow, from his base on Haiti, Columbus sent expedition after expedition into the interior. They found no gold fields, but had to fill up the ships returning to Spain with some kind of dividend. In the year 1495, they went on a great slave raid, rounded up fifteen hundred Arawak men, women, and children, put them in pens guarded by Spaniards and dogs, then picked the five hundred best specimens to load onto ships. Of those five hundred, two hundred died en route. The rest arrived alive in Spain and were put up for sale by the archdeacon of the town, who reported that, although the slaves were \\"naked as the day they were born,\\" they showed \\"no more embarrassment than animals.\\" Columbus later wrote: \\"Let us in the name of the Holy Trinity go on sending all the slaves that can be sold.\\"\\r\\nBut too many of the slaves died in captivity. And so Columbus, desperate to pay back dividends to those who had invested, had to make good his promise to fill the ships with gold. In the province of Cicao on Haiti, where he and his men believed huge gold fields to exist, they ordered all persons fourteen years or older to collect a certain quantity of gold every three months. When they brought it, they were given copper tokens to hang around their necks. American Indians found without a copper token had their hands cut off and bled to death.[74]\\r\\nMost criticisms combine elements of both strains. Journalist and media critic Norman Solomon reflects, in Columbus Day: A Clash of Myth and History, that many people choose to hold on to the myths surrounding Columbus, whereas historians who deal with the evidence are frequently depicted as politically correct revisionists. He quotes from the logbook Columbus's initial description of the American Indians: \\"They do not bear arms, and do not know them, for I showed them a sword, they took it by the edge and cut themselves out of ignorance.... They would make fine servants.... With 50 men we could subjugate them all and make them do whatever we want\\". In 1495, during the Second Voyage, American Indians were transported to Spain as slaves, many dying en route. \\"Let us in the name of the Holy Trinity\\", Columbus later wrote, \\"go on sending all the slaves that can be sold\\". Solomon states that the most important contemporary documentary evidence is the multi-volume History of the Indies by the Catholic priest Bartolom de las Casas, who observed the region where Columbus was governor. In contrast to \\"the myth\\" Solomon quotes Las Casas, who describes Spaniards driven by \\"insatiable greed\\"\\"killing, terrorizing, afflicting, and torturing the native peoples\\" with \\"the strangest and most varied new methods of cruelty\\" and how systematic violence was aimed at preventing \\"[American] Indians from daring to think of themselves as human beings.\\" The Spaniards \\"thought nothing of knifing [American] Indians by tens and twenties and of cutting slices off them to test the sharpness of their blades,\\" wrote Las Casas. \\"My eyes have seen these acts so foreign to human nature, and now I tremble as I write\\".[75]\\r\\nIn the summer of 1990, 350 representatives from American Indian groups from all over the hemisphere, met in Quito, Ecuador, at the first Intercontinental Gathering of Indigenous People in the Americas, to mobilize against the 500th anniversary (quin-centennial) celebration of Columbus Day planned for 1992. The following summer, in Davis, California, more than a hundred Native Americans gathered for a follow-up meeting to the Quito conference. They declared October 12, 1992 to be \\"International Day of Solidarity with Indigenous People\\". The largest ecumenical body in the United States, the National Council of Churches, called on Christians to refrain from celebrating the Columbus quincentennial, saying, \\"What represented newness of freedom, hope, and opportunity for some was the occasion for oppression, degradation and genocide for others\\".[76] Among the latest places in the United States to redefine how they would celebrate the holiday to the title \\"Indigenous Peoples' Day\\" by the autumn of 2016 include communities in Massachusetts, specifically Cambridge, Amherst and Northampton, with a group naming itself the \\"Indigenous Peoples' Day of Massachusetts\\" currently attempting to do the same for the state's capital city of Boston.[77]\\r\\nAn American Hispanist, commenting on Spains glorification of 1492/1992, pointed out that in Spain in 1492, the big events were the conquest of Granada and secondarily the expulsion of all of Spains Jews (see Alhambra decree). In 1992, it would have been politically problematic for Spain to commemorate either of these.[78]\\r\\n(federal) = federal holidays, (state) = state holidays, (religious) = religious holidays, (week) = weeklong holidays, (month) = monthlong holidays, (36) = Title 36 Observances and Ceremonies\\r\\nBold indicates major holidays commonly celebrated in the United States, which often represent the major celebrations of the month.","input":"When is el dia de la raza celebrated?"},{"output":"23 January 1993","context":"","input":"When did david beckham start playing professional football?"},{"output":"James Watson","context":"","input":"Who discovered the basic structure of dna nucleotides?"},{"output":"30 or over","context":"Age of candidacy is the minimum age at which a person can legally qualify to hold certain elected government offices.

On extremely rare occasions, young people have been elected to offices they do not qualify for and have been deemed ineligible to assume the office.\\r\\nIn 1934, Rush Holt of West Virginia was elected to the Senate of the United States at the age of 29. Since the U.S. Constitution requires senators to be at least 30, Holt was forced to wait until his 30th birthday, six months after the start of the session, before being sworn in.[3]\\r\\nIn 1954, Richard Fulton won election to the Tennessee Senate. Shortly after being sworn in, Fulton was ousted from office because he was only 27 years old at the time. The Tennessee State Constitution required that senators be at least 30.[4] Rather than hold a new election, the previous incumbent, Clifford Allen, was allowed to resume his office for another term. Fulton went on to win the next State Senate election in 1956 and was later elected to the US House of Representatives where he served for 10 years.\\r\\nIn South Carolina, two Senators aged 24 were elected, but were too young according to the State Constitution: Mike Laughlin in 1969 and Bryan Dorn (later a US Congressman) in 1941. They were seated anyway.[5]\\r\\nOn several occasions, the Socialist Workers Party (USA) has nominated candidates too young to qualify for the offices they were running for. In 1972, Linda Jenness ran as the SWP presidential candidate, although she was only 31 at the time. Since the U.S. Constitution requires that the President and Vice President be at least 35 years old, Jenness was not able to receive ballot access in several states in which she otherwise qualified.[6] Despite this handicap, Jenness still received 83,380 votes.[7] In 2004, the SWP nominated Arrin Hawkins as the party's vice-presidential candidate, although she was only 28 at the time. Hawkins was also unable to receive ballot access in several states due to her age.[8]\\r\\nIn the United States, many groups have attempted to lower age of candidacy requirements in various states. In 1994, South Dakota voters rejected a ballot measure that would have lowered the age requirements to serve as a State Senator or State Representative from 30 to 18. In 1998, however, they approved a similar ballot measure that reduced the age requirements for those offices from 25 to 21. In 2002, Oregon voters rejected a ballot measure that would have reduced the age requirement to serve as a State Representative from 21 to 18.\\r\\nDuring the early 2000s, the British Youth Council and other groups successfully campaigned to lower age of candidacy requirements in the United Kingdom.[9] The age of candidacy was reduced from 21 to 18 in England, Wales and Scotland on 1 January 2007,[10] when section 17 of the Electoral Administration Act 2006 entered into force.[11]\\r\\nIn Australia a person must be aged 18 or over to stand for election to public office at federal, state or local government level.\\r\\nThe youngest ever member of the House of Representatives was 20-year-old Wyatt Roy elected in the 2010 federal election after the Electoral Act 1918 was amended (in 1973) to reduce the age of candidacy for that office from 21 to 18.[citation needed]\\r\\nIn Austria, a person must be 18 years of age or older to stand in elections to the European Parliament or National Council.[12] The Diets of regional L?nder are able to set a minimum age lower than 18 for candidacy in elections to the Diet itself as well as to municipal councils in the Land.[13] In presidential elections the candidacy age is 35.\\r\\nAny Belgian who has reached the age of 21 years can stand for election for the Chamber of Representatives, can become a member of the Senate, or can be elected in one of the regional parliaments.[citation needed] This is regulated in the Constitution and in the Special Law on the Reform of the Institutions.\\r\\nAccording to the Constitution of Belize, a person must be at least 18 years old to be elected as a member of the House of Representatives and must be at least 30 to be Speaker of the House.

The agency then evolved into the United States' first domestic intelligence and counterintelligence agency. Many of the agency's missions were later taken over by subsequent agencies such as the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF), and IRS Criminal Investigation Division (IRS-CI).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Secret Service is mandated by Congress to carry out a unique dual mission: safeguarding the financial and critical infrastructure of the United States, and protecting the nations leaders. The two core missions of investigations and protection synergize with the other, providing crucial benefits to special agents during the course of their careers. Skills developed during the course of investigations which are also used in an agents protective duties include but are not limited to: \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Secret Service's primary investigative mission is to protect the payment and financial systems of the United States from a wide range of financial and electronic-based crimes including counterfeit U.S. currency, bank & financial institution fraud, illicit financing operations, cybercrime, identity theft, intellectual property crimes, and any other violations that may affect the United States economy and financial systems. The agency's key focus is on large, high-dollar economic impact cases involving organized criminal groups. Financial criminals include embezzling bank employees, armed robbers at automatic teller machines, heroin traffickers, and criminal organizations that commit bank fraud on a global scale.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe USSS plays a leading role in facilitating relationships between other law enforcement entities, the private sector, and academia. The Service maintains the Electronic Crimes Task Forces, which focus on identifying and locating international cyber criminals connected to cyber intrusions, bank fraud, data breaches, and other computer-related crimes. Additionally, the Secret Service runs the National Computer Forensics Institute (NCFI), which provides law enforcement officers, prosecutors, and judges with cyber training and information to combat cybercrime.\\r\\n\\r\\nProtection of the nation's highest elected leaders and other government officials remains the other key mission of the United States Secret Service. After the 1901 assassination of President William McKinley, Congress also directed the Secret Service to protect the President of the United States.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Secret Service is authorized by law to protect:[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe laws states that individuals other than the President, the Vice President (or other officer next in the order of succession to the Office of President), the President-elect, and the Vice President-elect may decline Secret Service protection, but the law neither allows nor disallows these excepted offices from declining.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Hillary Clinton became Secretary of State in 2009, the Secret Service continued to protect her at home; however the Diplomatic Security Service protected her while she was performing her duties as the Secretary of State, including foreign travel.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Secret Service investigates thousands of incidents each year of individuals threatening the President of the United States.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the face of budget pressure, hiring challenges and some high-profile lapses in its protective service role in 2014, the Brookings Institution and some members of Congress are asking whether the agency's focus should shift more to the protective mission, leaving more of its original mission to other agencies.[10][11]\\r\\n\\r\\nWith a reported one third of the currency in circulation being counterfeit at the time,[12] the Secret Service was created on July 5, 1865 in Washington, D.C., to suppress counterfeit currency. Chief William P. Wood was sworn in by Secretary of the Treasury Hugh McCulloch. It was commissioned in Washington, D.C. as the \\"Secret Service Division\\" of the Department of the Treasury with the mission of suppressing counterfeiting. The legislation creating the agency was on Abraham Lincoln's desk the night he was assassinated.[13] At the time, the only other federal law enforcement agencies were the United States Customs Service, the United States Park Police, the U.S. Post Office Department's Office of Instructions and Mail Depredations (now known as the United States Postal Inspection Service), and the United States Marshals Service. The Marshals did not have the manpower to investigate all crime under federal jurisdiction, so the Secret Service began investigating a wide range of crimes from murder to bank robbery to illegal gambling. After the assassination of President William McKinley in 1901, Congress informally requested that the Secret Service provide presidential protection. A year later, the Secret Service assumed full-time responsibility for presidential protection. In 1902, William Craig became the first Secret Service agent to die while serving, in a road accident while riding in the presidential carriage.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Secret Service was the first U.S. domestic intelligence and counterintelligence agency. Domestic intelligence collection and counterintelligence responsibilities were vested in the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) upon the FBI's creation in 1908.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Secret Service assisted in arresting Japanese American leaders and in the Japanese American internment during World War II.[14] The U.S. Secret Service is not a part of the U.S. Intelligence Community.[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1909, President William H. Taft agreed to meet with Mexican President Porfirio Daz in El Paso, Texas and Ciudad Jurez, Mexico, the first meeting between a U.S. and a Mexican president and also the first time an American president visited Mexico.[16] But the historic summit resulted in serious assassination threats and other security concerns for the then small Secret Service, so the Texas Rangers, 4,000 U.S. and Mexican troops, BOI agents, U.S. Marshals, and an additional 250 private security detail led by Frederick Russell Burnham, the celebrated scout, were all called in by Chief John Wilkie to provide added security.[17][18] On October 16, the day of the summit, Burnham discovered a man holding a concealed palm pistol standing at the El Paso Chamber of Commerce building along the procession route.[19] Burnham signaled a Texas Ranger, Private C.R. Moore, and the two men captured and disarmed the assassin within only a few feet of Daz and Taft, preventing the shooting of both Presidents.[20]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1950, President Harry S. Truman was residing in Blair House while the White House, across the street, was undergoing renovations. On November 1, 1950, two Puerto Rican nationalists, Oscar Collazo and Griselio Torresola, approached Blair House with the intent to assassinate President Truman. Collazo and Torresola opened fire on Private Leslie Coffelt and other White House Police officers. Though mortally wounded by three shots from a 9 mm German Luger to his chest and abdomen, Private Coffelt returned fire, killing Torresola with a single shot to his head. As of  2017[update], Coffelt is the only member of the Secret Service killed while protecting a US president against an assassination attempt (Special Agent Tim McCarthy stepped in front of President Ronald Reagan during the assassination attempt of March 30, 1981, and took a bullet to the abdomen but made a full recovery). Collazo was also shot, but survived his injuries and served 29 years in prison before returning to Puerto Rico in late 1979.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1968, as a result of Robert F. Kennedy's assassination, Congress authorized protection of major presidential and vice presidential candidates and nominees.[21] In 1965 and 1968, Congress also authorized lifetime protection of the spouses of deceased presidents unless they remarry and of the children of former presidents until age 16.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Secret Service Presidential Protective Division safeguards the President of the United States and his immediate family. They work with other federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies and the military to safeguard the President when he travels in Air Force One, Marine One and by limousine in motorcades.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough the most visible role of the Secret Service today, personal protection is an anomaly in the responsibilities of an agency focused on fraud and counterfeiting.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1984, the US Congress passed the Comprehensive Crime Control Act, which extended the Secret Service's jurisdiction over credit card fraud and computer fraud.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1990, the Secret Service initiated Operation Sundevil, which they originally intended as a sting against malicious hackers, allegedly responsible for disrupting telephone services across the entire United States. The operation, which was later described by Bruce Sterling in his book The Hacker Crackdown, affected a great number of people unrelated to hacking, and led to no convictions. The Secret Service, however, was sued and required to pay damages.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1994 and 1995, it ran an undercover sting called Operation Cybersnare.[22] The Secret Service has concurrent jurisdiction with the FBI over certain violations of federal computer crime laws. They have created 24 Electronic Crimes Task Forces (ECTFs) across the United States. These task forces are partnerships between the Service, federal/state and local law enforcement, the private sector and academia aimed at combating technology-based crimes.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1998, President Bill Clinton signed Presidential Decision Directive 62, which established National Special Security Events (NSSE). That directive made the Secret Service responsible for security at designated events. In 1999, the United States Secret Service Memorial Building was dedicated in DC, granting the agency its first headquarters. Prior to this, the agency's different departments were based in office space around the DC area.[23]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe New York City Field office was located at 6 World Trade Center. Immediately after the World Trade Center was attacked as part of the September 11 attacks, Special Agents and other New York Field office employees were among the first to respond with first aid. Sixty-seven Special Agents in New York City, at and near the New York Field Office, helped to set up triage areas and evacuate the towers. One Secret Service employee, Master Special Officer Craig Miller,[24] died during the rescue efforts. On August 20, 2002, Director Brian L. Stafford awarded the Director's Valor Award to employees who assisted in the rescue attempts.[25]\\r\\n\\r\\nEffective March 1, 2003, the Secret Service transferred from the Treasury to the newly established Department of Homeland Security.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe USA Patriot Act, signed into law by President George W. Bush on October 26, 2001, mandated the Secret Service to establish a nationwide network of ECTFs in addition to the one already active in New York. As such, this mandate expanded on the agency's first ECTFthe New York Electronic Crimes Task Force, formed in 1995which brought together federal, state and local law enforcement, prosecutors, private-industry companies, and academia. These bodies collectively provide necessary support and resources to field investigations that meet any one of the following criteria: significant economic or community impact; participation of organized criminal groups involving multiple districts or transnational organizations; or use of schemes involving new technology.[26][27]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe network prioritizes investigations that meet the following criteria:\\r\\n\\r\\nInvestigations conducted by ECTFs include crimes such as computer generated counterfeit currency; bank fraud; virus and worm proliferation; access device fraud; telecommunications fraud; Internet threats; computer system intrusions and cyberattacks; phishing/spoofing; assistance with Internet-related child pornography and exploitation; and identity theft.[28]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn July 6, 2009, the U.S. Secret Service expanded its fight on cybercrime by creating the first European Electronic Crime Task Force, based on the successful U.S. domestic model, through a memorandum of understanding with Italian police and postal officials. Over a year later, on August 9, 2010, the agency expanded its European involvement by creating its second overseas ECTF in the United Kingdom.[29][30]\\r\\n\\r\\nBoth task forces are said to concentrate on a wide range of \\"computer-based criminal activity,\\" including:\\r\\n\\r\\nAs of 2010, the Service had over 6,500 employees: 3,200 Special Agents, 1,300 Uniformed Division Officers, and 2,000 technical and administrative employees.[31] Special agents serve on protective details and investigate financial, cyber, and homeland security-related crimes.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn September 2014, the United States Secret Service came under criticism following two high-profile incidents involving intruders at the White House. One such intruder entered the East Room of the White House through an unlocked door.[32]\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother incident involved a violation of procedure in which an armed security guard for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention rode in the same elevator as President Barack Obama during a visit to that agency's headquarters in Atlanta, Georgia, to discuss U.S. response to the Ebola virus epidemic in West Africa. The guard used his phone to record a video of Obama and refused to comply with a request to stop.[33] The guard had been arrested multiple times in the past, but had never been convicted of a crime.[34]\\r\\n\\r\\nSince the 1960s, Presidents John F. Kennedy (killed), Gerald Ford (twice attacked, but uninjured) and Ronald Reagan (seriously wounded) have been attacked while appearing in public.[35][36] Agents on scene though not injured during attacks on Presidents include William Greer and Roy Kellerman. One of the agents was Robert DeProspero, the Special Agent In Charge (SAIC) of Reagan's Presidential Protective Division (PPD) from January 1982 to April 1985. DeProspero was deputy to Jerry Parr, the SAIC of PPD during the Reagan assassination attempt on March 30, 1981.[37][38]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Kennedy assassination spotlighted the bravery of two Secret Service agents. First, an agent protecting Mrs. Kennedy, Clint Hill, was riding in the car directly behind the presidential limousine when the attack began. While the shooting continued, Hill leapt from the running board of the car he was riding on and jumped onto the back of the President's moving car and guided Mrs. Kennedy from the trunk back into the rear seat of the car. He then shielded the President and the First Lady with his body until the car arrived at the hospital.\\r\\n\\r\\nRufus Youngblood was riding in the vice-presidential car. When the shots were fired, he vaulted over the front seat and threw his body over Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson.[39] That evening, Johnson called Secret Service Chief James J. Rowley and cited Youngblood's bravery.[40][41] Youngblood would later recall some of this in his memoir, Twenty Years in the Secret Service.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe period following the Kennedy assassination was the most difficult in the modern history of the agency. Press reports indicated that morale among the agents was \\"low\\" for months following the assassination.[42][43] The agency overhauled its procedures in the wake of the Kennedy killing. Training, which until that time had been confined largely to \\"on-the-job\\" efforts, was systematized and regularized.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Reagan assassination attempt also highlighted the bravery of several Secret Service agents, particularly agent Tim McCarthy, who spread his stance to protect Reagan as six bullets were being fired by the would-be assassin, John Hinckley Jr.[44] McCarthy survived a .22-caliber round in the abdomen. For his bravery, McCarthy received the NCAA Award of Valor in 1982.[45] Jerry Parr, the agent who pushed President Reagan into the limousine, and made the critical decision to divert the presidential motorcade to George Washington University Hospital instead of returning to the White House, was also honored with U.S. Congress commendations for his actions that day.[46]\\r\\n\\r\\nArrest and indictment of Max Ray Butler, co-founder of the Carders Market carding website. Butler was indicted by a federal grand jury in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, after his September 5, 2007 arrest, on wire fraud and identity theft charges. According to the indictment, Butler hacked over the Internet into computers at financial institutions and credit card processing centers and sold the tens of thousands of credit card numbers that he acquired in the process.[47]\\r\\n\\r\\nOperation Firewall: In October 2004, 28 suspectslocated across eight U.S. states and six countrieswere arrested on charges of identity theft, computer fraud, credit-card fraud, and conspiracy. Nearly 30 national and foreign field offices of the U.S. Secret Service, including the newly established national ECTFs, and countless local enforcement agencies from around the globe, were involved in this operation. Collectively, the arrested suspects trafficked in at least 1.7 million stolen credit card numbers, which amounted to $4.3 million of losses to financial institutions. However, authorities estimated that prevented loss to the industry was in the hundreds of millions of dollars. The operation, which started in July 2003 and lasted for more than a year, led investigators to identify three cybercriminal groups: Shadowcrew, Carderplanet, and Darkprofits.[48]\\r\\n\\r\\nArrest and indictment of Albert Gonzalez and 11 individuals; three U.S. citizens, one from Estonia, three from Ukraine, two from the People's Republic of China, one from Belarus, and one known only by an online alias. They were arrested on August 5, 2008, for the theft and sale of more than 40 million credit and debit card numbers from major U.S. retailers, including TJX Companies, BJ's Wholesale Club, OfficeMax, Boston Market, Barnes & Noble, Sports Authority, Forever 21, and DSW. Gonzalez, the main organizer of the scheme, was charged with computer fraud, wire fraud, access device fraud, aggravated identity theft, and conspiracy for his leading role in the crime.[49]\\r\\n\\r\\n---\\r\\n\\r\\n---\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Secret Service special agent position is highly competitive. In 2011, the Service accepted less than 1% of its 15,600 special agent applicants.[50] While the Secret Service has always been a popular career path for former military and law enforcement personnel, the Service seeks to hire agents from a diverse range of backgrounds in fulfilling its dual mission, including accountants, lawyers, scientists, engineers, and foreign language specialists.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt a minimum, a prospective agent must be a U.S. citizen, possess a current valid driver's license, be in excellent health and physical condition, possess visual acuity no worse than 20/60 uncorrected, correctable to 20/20 in each eye, and be between the ages of 21 and 37 at the time of appointment.[51] However, eligible veterans may apply after age 37. In 2009, the Office of Personnel Management issued implementation guidance on the Isabella v. Department of State court decision: OPM Letter.[52]\\r\\n\\r\\nProspective agents must also qualify for a TS/SCI (Top Secret / Sensitive Compartmented Information) clearance, and undergo an extensive background investigation, to include in-depth interviews, drug screening, medical diagnosis, and full-scope polygraph examination.[51]\\r\\n\\r\\nSpecial agents receive training in two locations, totaling approximately 7 months. The first phase, the Criminal Investigator Training Program (CITP) is conducted at the Federal Law Enforcement Training Centers (FLETC) at Glynco, GA, lasting approximately 12 weeks. The second phase, the Special Agent Training Course (SATC) is conducted at the Secret Service Academy, James J. Rowley Training Center (JJRTC), just outside Washington, D.C. in Laurel, Maryland, lasting approximately 18 weeks.[53]\\r\\n\\r\\nA typical special agent career path, depending upon performance and promotions that affect individual assignments, begins with the first six to eight years on the job assigned to a field office. Applicants are directed to list their office location preference during the application process, and upon receiving a final job offer, usually have several locations to choose from.[51] After their field office experience, agents are usually transferred to a protective assignment where they will stay for three to five years. Following their protective assignment, many agents return to a field office for the rest of their careers, or opt for a headquarters based assignment located in Washington, D.C. During their careers, agents also have the opportunity to work overseas in one of the agency's international field offices. This typically requires foreign language training to ensure language proficiency when working alongside the agency's foreign law enforcement counterparts.[51]\\r\\n\\r\\nSpecial agents are hired at either the GL-07 or GL-09 grade level, depending on individual qualifications and/or education.[51] Agents are eligible for promotion on a yearly basis, from GL-07, to GL-09, to GS-11, to GS-12, to GS-13 (GL-08 and GS-10 grade levels are skipped). The full performance grade level for a journeyman agent is GS-13, which a GL-07 and GL-09 agent may reach in as little as four and three years respectively. GS-13 agents are eligible for competitive promotion to supervisory agent positions, which compasses the GS-14, GS-15, and SES grade levels. GS-13 agents who wish to remain as senior field agents continue to advance the GS-13 step level, capping at GS-13 Step-10.\\r\\n\\r\\nSpecial agents also receive Law Enforcement Availability Pay (LEAP), a type of premium overtime pay which provides them with an additional 25% bonus pay on top of their salary, as agents are required to work an average workweek of 50 hours as opposed to 40.[54] Therefore, an agent living in the Greater New York City area will earn an annual salary of approximately $65,733 (GL-07), $74,850 (GL-09), $87,639 (GS-11), $105,044 (GS-12), $124,909 (GS-13), $147,606 (GS-14), and $164,200 (GS-15).[55]\\r\\n\\r\\nMoreover, due to the nature of their work and unique among their federal law enforcement counterparts (e.g. FBI, DEA, ATF, ICE), Secret Service agents are regularly eligible for scheduled overtime pay (SOT pay) in addition to LEAP for hours they work beyond 50 per week, and enjoy a raised statutory pay cap of $189,600 per year (Level II of the Executive Schedule) as opposed to $164,200 per year (Level IV of the Executive Schedule).[56]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Secret Service Uniformed Division is a security police similar to the U.S. Capitol Police or DHS Federal Protective Service and is in charge of protecting the physical White House grounds and foreign diplomatic missions in the Washington, D.C. area. Established in 1922 as the White House Police, this organization was fully integrated into the Secret Service in 1930. In 1970, the protection of foreign diplomatic missions was added to the force's responsibilities, and its name was changed to the Executive Protective Service. The name United States Secret Service Uniformed Division was adopted in 1977.\\r\\n\\r\\nSecret Service Uniformed Division officers provide protection for the White House Complex, the Vice President's residence, the main Treasury Building and Annex, and foreign diplomatic missions and embassies in the Washington, D.C., area. Additionally, Uniformed Division officers travel in support of presidential, vice presidential and foreign head of state government missions.[57] Officers may, as their careers progress, be selected to participate in one of several specialized units, including the:\\r\\n\\r\\nSecret Service special officers (not to be confused with Uniformed Division Officers) are federal agents who work within the Special Agent Division and perform a wide range of security functions and support assignments as part of the protective mission for the Secret Service. Whereas special agents alternate between protection and investigative assignments, special officers are hired only to work protection details. They must have a familiarity with all phases of protective responsibilities sufficient to assist in protective movements, cover designated security posts and drive protective vehicles.\\r\\n\\r\\nAssignments may include\\r\\n\\r\\nSpecial officers are sworn law enforcement officers, and are authorized to make arrests in connection with their official duties. They are classified as federal agents but use \\"special officer\\" as their official title much the same way as Deputy US Marshals are special agents but use the title \\"Deputy US Marshal\\".\\r\\n\\r\\nNewly appointed special officers must successfully complete eight (8) weeks of intensive training at the Special Officer Basic Training Course at the Secret Service James J. Rowley Training Center just outside Washington, D.C. The training includes courses such as Criminal Law, Laws of Arrest, Search and Seizure, Control Tactics, Civil Liability, Emergency Medicine, Basic Water Safety, Firearms and Weapons Handling, Radio Communications, Emergency Driving and Physical Fitness Training.\\r\\n\\r\\nSince the agency's inception, a variety of weapons have been carried by its agents.\\r\\n\\r\\nInitially the firearms were privately procured and there was little if any standardization. In the 1930s, the USSS issued the Colt M1911A1 pistol in .45 ACP caliber. In the 1950s and 1960s, Special Agents carried the Smith & Wesson Model 36 and Colt Detective Special .38-Special revolvers.\\r\\n\\r\\nFollowing President Kennedy's assassination, USSS Special Agents were authorized to carry the .357 Magnum Smith & Wesson Model 19 revolver.\\r\\n\\r\\nBetween 1981 and 1991, the Secret Service issued the Smith & Wesson Model 19 and the Smith & Wesson Model 66 .357 Magnum revolvers, with 2.5-inch barrels all the way up to the 4-inch-barreled models, loaded with hollow-point rounds.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy 1992, the standard issue weapon became the SIG Sauer P228 9mm pistol. This weapon stayed in service through 1999.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Secret Service replaced the Thompson submachine gun with the Uzi submachine gun in the 1970s.

Often their attire is customized to conceal the wide array of equipment worn in service.

Since 1959, both units have been defined by international agreement as equivalent to 0.3048?meters exactly. In both systems, the foot comprises 12?inches and three feet compose a yard.\\r\\nHistorically the \\"foot\\" was a part of many local systems of units, including the Greek, Roman, Chinese, French, and English systems. It varied in length from country to country, from city to city, and sometimes from trade to trade. Its length was usually between 250?mm and 335?mm and was generally, but not always, subdivided into 12?inches or 16?digits.\\r\\nThe United States is the only industrialized nation that uses the international foot and the survey foot (a customary unit of length) in preference to the meter in its commercial, engineering, and standards activities.[1] The foot is legally recognized in the United Kingdom; road signs must use imperial units (however distances on road signs are always marked in miles or yards, not feet), while its usage is widespread among the British public as a measurement of height.[2][3] The foot is recognized as an alternative expression of length in Canada[4] officially defined as a unit derived from the meter[5] although both the U.K. and Canada have partially metricated their units of measurement. The measurement of altitude in international aviation is one of the few areas where the foot is used outside the English-speaking world.\\r\\nThe length of the international foot corresponds to a human foot with shoe size of 13 (UK), 14 (US male), 15.5 (US female) or 46 (EU sizing).\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHistorically the human body has been used to provide the basis for units of length.[6] The foot of a white male is typically about 15.3% of his height,[7] giving a person of 160?cm (5 ft 3 in) a foot of 245?mm and one of 180?cm (5 ft 11 in) a foot of 275?mm. These figures are less than the foot used in most cities over time, suggesting that the \\"foot\\" was actually a synonym for a \\"shoe\\".[original research?]\\r\\nArcheologists believe that the Egyptians, Ancient Indians and Mesopotamians preferred the cubit while the Romans and the Greeks preferred the foot. Under the Harappan linear measures, Indus cities during the Bronze Age used a foot of 13.2?inches (333.5?mm) and a cubit of 20.8?inches (528.3?mm).[8] The Egyptian equivalent of the foota measure of four palms or 16 digitswas known as the djeser and has been reconstructed as about 30?cm (12?in).\\r\\nThe Greek foot (??, pous) had a length of ?1?600 of a stadion,[9] one stadion being about 181.2 m,[10] therefore a foot being at the time about 302?mm. Its exact size varied from city to city and could range as much as between 270?mm and 350?mm, but lengths used for temple construction appear to have been about 295?mm to 325?mm, the former being close to the size of the Roman foot.\\r\\nThe standard Roman foot (pes) was normally about 295.7?mm (97% of today's measurement), but in the provinces, the pes Drusianus (foot of Nero Claudius Drusus) was used, with a length of about 334?mm. (In reality, this foot predated Drusus.)[11]\\r\\nOriginally both the Greeks and the Romans subdivided the foot into 16 digits, but in later years, the Romans also subdivided the foot into 12 unciae (from which both the English words \\"inch\\" and \\"ounce\\" are derived).\\r\\nAfter the fall of the Roman Empire, some Roman traditions were continued but others fell into disuse. In AD 790 Charlemagne attempted to reform the units of measure in his domains. His units of length were based on the toise and in particular the toise de l'critoire, the distance between the fingertips of the outstretched arms of a man.[12] The toise has 6 pieds (feet) each of 326.6?mm (12.86?in).\\r\\nHe was unsuccessful in introducing a standard unit of length throughout his realm: an analysis of the measurements of Charlieu Abbey shows that during the 9th century the Roman foot of 296.1?mm was used; when it was rebuilt in the 10th century, a foot of about 320?mm[Note 1] was used. At the same time, monastic buildings used the Carolingian foot of 340?mm.[Note 1][13]\\r\\nThe procedure for verification of the foot as described in the 16th century by Jacob Koebel in his book Geometrei. Von knstlichem Feldmessen und absehen is:[14]\\r\\nStand at the door of a church on a Sunday and bid 16 men to stop, tall ones and small ones, as they happen to pass out when the service is finished; then make them put their left feet one behind the other, and the length thus obtained shall be a right and lawful rood to measure and survey the land with, and the 16th part of it shall be the right and lawful foot.\\r\\nThe measures of Iron Age Britain are uncertain and proposed reconstructions such as the Megalithic Yard are controversial. Later Welsh legend credited Dyfnwal Moelmud with the establishment of their units, including a foot of 9 inches. The Belgic or North German foot of 335?mm (13.2?inches) was introduced to England either by the Belgic Celts during their invasions prior to the Romans or by the Anglo-Saxons in the 5th & 6th century.\\r\\nRoman units were introduced following their invasion in AD?43. The Roman foot had been previously standardized by Agrippa at around 296?mm or 11.65?inches. Following the Roman withdrawal and Saxon invasions, the Roman foot continued to be used in the construction crafts while the Belgic foot was used for land measurement. Both the Welsh and Belgic feet seem to have been based on multiples of the barleycorn, but by as early as 950 the English kings seem to have (ineffectually) ordered measures to be based upon an iron yardstick at Winchester and then London. Henry I was said to have ordered a new standard to be based upon his own arm and, by the c.?1300 Act concerning the Composition of Yards and Perches[15] traditionally credited to Edward?I or II, the statute foot was a different measure exactly ?10?11 of the old foot. The barleycorn, inch, ell, and yard were likewise shrunk, while rods and furlongs remained the same.[16] The ambiguity over the state of the mile was resolved by the 1593 Act against Converting of Great Houses into Several Tenements and for Restraint of Inmates and Inclosures in and near about the City of London and Westminster, which codified the statute mile as comprising 5,280?feet. The differences among the various physical standard yards around the world, revealed by increasingly powerful microscopes, eventually led to the 1959 adoption of the international foot defined in terms of the meter.\\r\\nThe international yard and pound agreement of July 1959 defined the length of the international yard in the United States and countries of the Commonwealth of Nations as exactly 0.9144 meters. Consequently, the international foot is defined to be equal to exactly 0.3048 meters. This was 2?ppm shorter than the previous U.S. definition and 1.7?ppm longer than the previous British definition.[17]\\r\\nThe international standard symbol for a foot is \\"ft\\" (see ISO 31-1, Annex A). In some cases, the foot is denoted by a prime, which is often marked by an apostrophe, and the inch by a double prime; for example, 2 feet 4?inches is sometimes denoted as 2?4, 2 4 or 24. (See 'minute' for another case where prime and double prime symbols are used to denote first and second cuts in refining measurement.)\\r\\nIn the United States, the foot was defined as 12?inches, with the inch being defined by the Mendenhall Order of 1893 by 39.37?inches?= 1?m. In Imperial units, the foot was defined as ?1?3?yard, with the yard being realized as a physical standard (separate from the standard meter).\\r\\nThe yard standards of the different Commonwealth countries were periodically compared with one another.[18] The value of the United Kingdom primary standard of the yard was determined in terms of the meter by the National Physical Laboratory in 1964 as 6999914396900000000?0.9143969?m,[19] implying a pre-1959 foot in the UK of approximately 6999304798966667000?0.304798966667?m.\\r\\nWhen the international foot was defined in 1959, a great deal of survey data was already available based on the former definitions, especially in the United States and in India. The small difference between the survey and the international foot would not be detectable on a survey of a small parcel, but becomes significant for mapping, or when the state plane coordinate system (SPCS) is used in the US, because the origin of the system may be hundreds of thousands of feet (hundreds of miles) from the point of interest. Hence the previous definitions continued to be used for surveying in the United States and India for many years, and are denoted survey feet to distinguish them from the international foot. The United Kingdom was unaffected by this problem, as the retriangulation of Great Britain (1936ÿ62) had been done in meters.\\r\\nThe United States survey foot is defined as exactly ?1200?3937?meters, approximately 6999304800609601000?0.304800609601?m.[20] Out of the 50 states, 24 have legislated that surveying measures should be based on the U.S. survey foot, eight have legislated that they be made on the basis of the international foot, and 18 have not specified the conversion factor from metric units.[21]\\r\\nIn 1986 the National Geodetic Survey (NGS) released the North American Datum of 1983, which underlies the state plane coordinate systems and is entirely defined in meters. An NGS policy from 1991 has this to say about the units used with the new datum to define the SPCS?83:\\r\\nIn preparation for the adjustment of the North American Datum of 1983, 31 states enacted legislation for the State Plane Coordinate System of 1983 (SPCS 83). All states defined SPCS?83 with metric parameters. Within the legislation, the U.S. Survey Foot was specified in 11?states and the International Foot was specified in 6?states. In all other states the meter is the only referenced unit of measure in the SPCS?83 legislation. The remaining 19?states do not yet have any legislation concerning SPCS?83.[22]\\r\\nSince then, 42 states have abandoned the non-metric versions of SPCS?83: seven states continue to keep location data in survey feet as well as in meters, while one state keeps data in international feet as well as in meters.[21] State legislation is also important for determining the conversion factor to be used for everyday land surveying and real estate transactions, although the difference (2?ppm) is of no practical significance given the precision of normal surveying measurements over short distances (usually much less than a mile).\\r\\nThe Indian survey foot is defined as exactly 6999304799600000000?0.3047996?m,[23] presumably derived from a measurement of the previous Indian standard of the yard. The current National Topographic Database of the Survey of India is based on the metric WGS-84 datum,[24] which is also used by the Global Positioning System.\\r\\nAn ISO 2848 measure of 3 basic modules (30?cm) is called a \\"metric foot\\", but there were earlier distinct definitions of a metric foot during metrication in France and Germany.\\r\\nIn 1799 the meter became the official unit of length in France. This was not fully enforced, and in 1812 Napoleon introduced the system of mesures usuelles which restored the traditional French measurements in the retail trade, but redefined them in terms of metric units. The foot, or pied mtrique, was defined as one third of a meter. This unit continued in use until 1837.[26]\\r\\nIn southwestern Germany in 1806, the Confederation of the Rhine was founded and three different reformed feet were defined, all of which were based on the metric system:[27]\\r\\nPrior to the introduction of the metric system, many European cities and countries used the foot, but it varied considerably in length: the voet in Ieper, Belgium, was 273.8 millimetres (10.78?in) while the piede in Venice was 347.73 millimetres (13.690?in). Lists of conversion factors between the various units of measure were given in many European reference works including:\\r\\nMany of these standards were peculiar to a particular city, especially in Germany (which, before German Unification in 1871, consisted of many kingdoms, principalities, free cities and so on). In many cases the length of the unit was not uniquely fixed: for example, the English foot was stated as 11 pouces 2.6 lignes (French inches and lines) by Picard, 11 pouces 3.11 lignes by Maskelyne and 11 pouces 3 lignes by D'Alembert.[35]\\r\\nMost of the various feet in this list ceased to be used when the countries adopted the metric system. The Netherlands and modern Belgium adopted the metric system in 1817, having used the mesures usuelles under Napoleon[36] and the newly formed German Empire adopted the metric system in 1871.[37]\\r\\nThe palm (typically 200?mm to 280?mm) was used in many Mediterranean cities instead of the foot. Horace Doursther, whose reference was published[clarification needed] in Belgium which had the smallest foot measurements, grouped both units together, while J.F.G. Palaiseau devoted three chapters to units of length: one for linear measures (palms and feet), one for cloth measures (ells) and one for distances traveled (miles and leagues). In the table below, arbitrary cut-off points of 270?mm and 350?mm have been chosen.\\r\\n(In Belgium, the words pied (French) and voet (Dutch) would have been used interchangeably.)\\r\\nNotes","input":"1 foot is equal to how much metre?"},{"output":"Alaska pollock","context":"The Filet-O-Fish otherwise known as the 'Fish-O-Filet' is a fish sandwich sold by the international fast food chain store McDonald's. It was invented in 1962 by Lou Groen, a McDonald's franchise owner in Cincinnati, Ohio. While the fish composition of the sandwich has changed through the years to satisfy taste and supply shortcomings, the framework of its ingredients have remained constant; a fried breaded fish fillet, a steamed bun, tartar sauce, and pasteurized processed American cheese.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAs of December 2014[update], the Filet-O-Fish contains a battered, fried fish fillet made from Alaska pollock.[1] In the Republic of Ireland either hoki or Alaska pollock may be served.[2] In New Zealand and the United Kingdom Filet-O-Fish contains hoki instead of Alaska pollock.[3] McDonald's Canada, United States, United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, Portugal, Czech Republic, The Netherlands and Hong Kong use a half slice of cheese in each Filet-O-Fish sandwich.[4][5][6][7]\\r\\nThe sandwich was created in 1962 by a McDonald's franchise owner in Cincinnati, Ohio, named Lou Groen.[8][9] Groen owned a McDonald's in a predominantly Roman Catholic neighborhood where his Catholic customers engaged in the practice of not eating meat on Fridays.[9]\\r\\nThe product was named by Cye Landy of Cye Landy Advertising Agency, which was the advertising firm for that particular McDonald's franchise.\\r\\nIt has become popular with people with dietary restrictions concerning meat-based products. For example, in Judaism, the fish used in the sandwich is considered kosher even without special preparation, while other meats would require special slaughter techniques to be considered kosher.[10] However, the preparation of the fish alongside non-kosher meat products and in a non-Kosher kitchen renders the Filet-O-Fish non-kosher.\\r\\nThe sandwich was the first non-hamburger menu item brought in by new McDonald's company owner Ray Kroc.[11] Kroc made a deal with Groen: they would sell two non-meat sandwiches on a Friday, Kroc's own Hula Burger (grilled pineapple with cheese on a cold bun) and the Filet-O-Fish, and whichever sold the most would be added to the permanent menu. The Filet-O-Fish \\"won hands down\\"[9] and was added to menus throughout 1963 until reaching nationwide status in 1965.[12]\\r\\nThe use of farmed fish in the Filet-O-Fish first came about in 1981, when an owner of a New Zealand fisheries company was dissatisfied with the pollock Filet-O-Fish he purchased at the Courtenay Place, Wellington restaurant. Saying to the manager that he could make a better-tasting fish fillet, he was handed a box of fillets and told to come back with identical, better-tasting fillets. He substituted red cod for the pollock, and after the manager was satisfied with the better-tasting red cod fillets, ended up in agreement to supply the Courtenay Place restaurant (and eventually several other New Zealand restaurants) with the red cod fillets. The similar-tasting hoki was substituted several years later, due to its competitive market value and its boneless fillets, and eventually was introduced widely in the early 1990s when global pollock stocks were facing low numbers.[13] McDonald's removed the Filet-O-Fish from its menus in the United States on September 26, 1996,[14] and replaced it with the Fish Filet Deluxe sandwich, which was part of McDonald's ill-fated Deluxe line of sandwiches. However, the Filet-O-Fish was brought back to its menus on a gradual basis starting in the middle of 1997, due to overwhelming letters and petitions, receiving the larger fish patty from the Fish Filet Deluxe. The Fish Filet Deluxe itself was discontinued at most restaurants early the next year, while others kept it a little longer until the Fish Filet Deluxe was finally removed in the year 2000.[15]\\r\\nIn November 2007, McDonald's lowered the use of New Zealand hoki and increased the use of Alaskan pollock,[16] due to declining New Zealand hoki fishery sustainability and large cutbacks in the total allowable commercial catch of hoki by the New Zealand Ministry of Fisheries - from 250,000?tonnes in 1997 to 90,000?tonnes in 2007.[17] McDonald's originally used Atlantic cod, before declining cod catches forced McDonald's to find sustainable fish elsewhere. McDonald's is trying to maintain fish only from areas certified as sustainable by the Marine Stewardship Council, but that is becoming more difficult each year. Hoki is still a major ingredient.[18]\\r\\nAs of March 2009, the Marine Stewardship Council[19] placed the Alaskan pollock fisheries in a re-assessment program[20] due to catch numbers declining by over 30% between 2005 and 2008, and by-catch problems with salmon.\\r\\nAs of January 2013 the Marine Stewardship Council stated that the pollock comes from suppliers with sustainable fishing practices, and McDonald's packaging and promotion will reflect that change.[21]\\r\\nIn February 2015, for a limited time, McDonald's began offering a special Filet-O-Fish with Old Bay Seasoning in 700 stores within the United States[22]\\r\\nCaptain Crook, the McDonaldland character, was previously used to market the sandwich to children.

The level of conformity that people are forced into was disturbing to us and we were just trying to push the envelope and the name just sorta made sense.\\"[3]\\r\\nAfter renaming the band, Disturbed went on to record two 3-track demo tapes, the first having the demos for \\"The Game\\", \\"Down with the Sickness\\", and \\"Meaning of Life\\", with the second having the demos for \\"Want,\\" \\"Stupify,\\" and \\"Droppin' Plates.\\" The artwork was composed of the band's recently created pet, The Guy. The band eventually signed with Giant Records. In 2000, the band released its debut album, titled The Sickness, which launched the band into stardom. The album peaked at number twenty on Billboard 200,[4] and it has sold over four million copies in the United States since its release.[5] Before joining Marilyn Manson's 2001 European tour, bassist Steve Kmak was unable to play with the band due to a shattered ankle, caused by falling out of a fire escape outside Disturbed's rehearsal hall in Chicago.[6] He took the fire escape to exit the building while the elevator was being used to move their equipment downstairs. Kmak skipped the European trek of the tour, but he did perform with the band on January 11 and 12, 2001 at Disturbed's show in Chicago.[6] During the European tour, Marty O'Brien replaced Kmak until he was able to tour again.\\r\\nIn February 2001, it was announced that the band had covered the song \\"Midlife Crisis\\" for a Faith No More tribute album,[7] however the cover was not used, and a rerecorded version would later make an appearance on the compilation album, The Lost Children.[8] In September 2001, production of their second studio album began. On June 4, 2002, Disturbed released a documentary DVD about the band, titled M.O.L., which showed some of the band's more personal moments in the studio and during tours, as well as featuring several music videos and live performances.[9] On September 17, 2002, Disturbed released their second studio album, titled Believe, which debuted at number one on the Billboard 200.[10] The music video for the first single from the album, titled \\"Prayer\\", was pulled from most television stations, due to perceived similarities with the September 11, 2001 attacks.[11] David Draiman recorded vocals for a song titled \\"Forsaken\\", a song written and produced by Jonathan Davis of the band Korn, released on Queen of the Damned.[12]\\r\\nIn 2003, the band once again participated in the Ozzfest tour and started another one of their own tours, titled Music as a Weapon II. The bands Chevelle, Taproot, and Unloco toured with them.[13] During the tour, Disturbed debuted an unreleased song, titled \\"Dehumanized\\".[14] After Disturbed finished the Music as a Weapon II tour, Steve Kmak was fired by the band because of \\"personality differences\\". He was replaced by John Moyer,[15][16] who is now the current bass player. On the night Moyer became the band's new bass player, Disturbed played live at the House of Blues and performed two new songs, \\"Hell\\" and \\"Monster\\", both of which are B-side tracks on the band's third studio album, Ten Thousand Fists.[16]\\r\\nDisturbed's third studio album, Ten Thousand Fists, was released on September 20, 2005. The album debuted at number-one on the Billboard 200, while also selling around 238,000 copies in the week following its release.[17] The album was certified platinum, shipping 1,000,000 units, in the United States on January 5, 2006.[18] The band toured with 10 Years and Ill Ni?o in support of the album. Disturbed headlined Ozzfest 2006 along with System of a Down, Lacuna Coil, DragonForce, Avenged Sevenfold, and Hatebreed.[19]\\r\\nIn an interview with Launch Radio Networks, Disturbed vocalist David Draiman stated that twenty songs were recorded for the album, but only fourteen made it to the final track listing.[20] The remaining songs included \\"Hell\\", which was included in one of the two \\"Stricken\\" singles;[21] \\"Monster\\", which was included as an iTunes pre-order bonus for Ten Thousand Fists,[22] then later included on the Ten Thousand Fists Tour Edition; \\"Two Worlds\\", which was also included on the Tour Edition of Ten Thousand Fists; and \\"Sickened\\", which was included in the \\"Land of Confusion\\" single.[23] Ten Thousand Fists is the first album released by Disturbed to feature guitar solos. The band stated that they felt that guitar solos are a part of music that is absent in a lot of modern music, and they wanted to bring some of that back. Songs like \\"Stricken\\", \\"Overburdened\\", and \\"Land of Confusion\\" all feature guitar solos, as well as many others.\\r\\nIn 2006, a European tour was scheduled but had been moved twice due to Draiman having troubles with severe acid reflux, which affected his voice.[24] as related by Draiman himself.[25] Later that year, Draiman underwent surgery for a deviated septum which affected his voice.[25] It was successful, and ever since then, Draiman has limited his drinking on the road.[26] In late 2006, Disturbed headlined another one of their own tours named Music as a Weapon III; the bands Flyleaf, Stone Sour, and Nonpoint toured with them.[27] Disturbed completed the first leg of their Music as a Weapon III tour in late 2006.[28] Soon after, Draiman stated that there was not going to be a second leg to the tour and that instead the band was going off the road to start working on their fourth studio album.[29]\\r\\nIn July 2007, a new track titled \\"This Moment\\" was released on the soundtrack to the film Transformers. Disturbed mixed their fourth studio album, titled Indestructible,[30] in Los Angeles in late 2007.[31] In an earlier interview, David Draiman said that they were going to record fifteen songs, but only twelve would be on the album.[32]\\r\\nIndestructible's first single, \\"Inside the Fire\\" was made available on digital distribution services for purchase on March 25, 2008. The band also toured in the United States in April and May 2008 with the bands Five Finger Death Punch and Art of Dying.[33] The music video for \\"Inside the Fire\\" was released on May 2, 2008 on the band's official website. Disturbed released their previously free song \\"Perfect Insanity\\" on iTunes Store as a second single on May 6, 2008, and the album Indestructible become available for pre-order for the release date on June 3, 2008. Indestructible was released in the United States on June 3, 2008 and in Australia on June 7, 2008 and became the band's third consecutive number-one debut on the Billboard 200. A special \\"Internet Only\\" limited edition of the album that includes the B-side track \\"Run\\", a making-of DVD with instructional videos, wrap-around poster, VIP laminate, access to special Disturbed events, and a special website with exclusive video, rare audio and more was also released.[34] Disturbed played their first live online concert on May 29, 2008. The concert was sponsored by Pepsi and Deep Rock Drive.[35] They performed in Las Vegas. The band toured in support of the \\"Mayhem Festival\\"[36] alongside Slipknot, DragonForce and Mastodon during summer of 2008.[37] Disturbed also completed a tour of Australia and New Zealand through August and September 2008.\\r\\nIn May 2008, Harmonix, the developers of the video game Rock Band announced they had reached a deal with Disturbed and Best Buy to offer two tracks from Indestructible for play in Rock Band to those who pre-ordered the album from Best Buy's website. On June 3, 2008, Harmonix released three tracks from Indestructible; \\"Indestructible\\", \\"Inside the Fire\\", and \\"Perfect Insanity\\". On May 12, 2009, Harmonix released Stricken and Stupify to the Rock Band music store.\\r\\nOn September 30, 2008, the band released an iTunes-exclusive live album entitled Live & Indestructible, made up of songs from Deep Rock Drive, as well as the music video for \\"Indestructible\\".[38] The band started a tour of Europe, starting in London during October 2008 and finishing during November 2008 in Helsinki.[39] In November and December 2008, Disturbed toured in the United States.[40] The song \\"Inside the Fire\\" was nominated for a 2009 Grammy Award in the \\"Best Hard Rock Performance\\" category. In March 2009, Disturbed released a music video for the single \\"The Night\\". The band began their Music as a Weapon IV tour in March 2009 and it ended in late May. The tour, also dubbed a \\"festival\\", featured the bands Killswitch Engage, Lacuna Coil, and Chimaira on the main stage.[41] The band released a second cover version of Faith No More's song \\"Midlife Crisis\\" on the album Covered, A Revolution in Sound, which also included bands such as Mastodon, The Used, and Avenged Sevenfold. This cover of \\"Midlife Crisis\\" was originally recorded for Indestructible, but the band decided not to include it on the album.\\r\\nIn an interview in July 2009, with FaceCulture, Draiman stated that the upcoming DVD will be \\"chronicling the past decade of Disturbed's existence. It's meant to show our growth over the course of the decade.\\" He also talked more about the upcoming fifth album: \\"A couple of [song riffs] that Danny has come up with are really amazing. But they're just little pieces...it's not even in two-three part progression [yet].\\"[42] A few months later on March 23, 2010, the band released a reissue of their debut album, The Sickness, with the B-side tracks \\"God of the Mind\\" and \\"A Welcome Burden\\", updated artwork, as well as remastering and remixing the track list.[43] It was also available for the first time in vinyl format.[44] On February 26, 2010, Harmonix announced a second Disturbed pack for download on the Rock Band music store, containing the 2010 remastered versions of \\"Voices\\", \\"The Game\\", and \\"Meaning of Life\\".[45]\\r\\nOn February 8, 2010, it was announced that the band had entered the studio in Chicago, Illinois to begin recording their fifth album, tentatively set for a summer 2010 release. Guitarist Dan Donegan stated that the band had written around 15ÿ18 songs.[46] It was later confirmed that the title of the album would be Asylum.[47] The band released a cover of heavy metal band Judas Priest's song \\"Living After Midnight\\" for the Metal Hammer Presents... Tribute to British Steel album. On April 20, 2010, roughly two months after they entered the studio, Disturbed announced that they had finished recording the album, and were ready to begin mixing it in Los Angeles, California. As they did with their last album Indestructible, Disturbed stated that they self-produced Asylum.[48] The band announced that Asylum would be released on August 31, 2010. On July 9, 2010, the track listing was revealed on the band's official website. Asylum debuted at number-one on the Billboard 200.[49] Asylum was Disturbeds fourth consecutive studio album to debut on top of the charts, an achievement only earned by two other bands: Metallica and Dave Matthews Band.[50]\\r\\nDisturbed headlined the first annual \\"Rockstar Energy Drink Uproar\\" tour with Avenged Sevenfold, as well as Stone Sour, Hellyeah and Halestorm, among others in late summer 2010.[51] Then, in October 2010, it was reported that David Draiman was diagnosed with a \\"serious throat condition\\", and the band's U.S. tour had been canceled, as Draiman's healing process could have taken up to four weeks.[52] Around the end of that year, Disturbed announced that they would be commencing the Music as a Weapon V tour in 2011, co-headlining with Korn and guests Sevendust, In This Moment and Stillwell. In January 2011 it was announced that Disturbed would be headlining the Mayhem Festival, along with Godsmack and Megadeth, for the summer of 2011.[53] February 2011, it was announced that Disturbed would be playing the Download Festival.[54] Disturbed announced that in May 2011, they would be co-headlining the Rock on the Range Festival in Columbus, Ohio.[55]\\r\\nOn Thursday, April 28, Disturbed announced that their previously unreleased bonus track from Asylum, titled \\"3\\", would be available for download on their website. They said that all proceeds made from the download of the song would go towards the Damien Echols Defense Fund, a benefit foundation supporting the release of the West Memphis Three.\\r\\nIn July 2011, the band confirmed it would go on hiatus after finishing their US tour that year, and in an interview that same month, Draiman dismissed concerns that the upcoming hiatus was a result of conflict between the band members.[56] Disturbed went into hiatus in October 2011. Disturbed released a b-side compilation album, titled The Lost Children, on November 8, 2011. The song \\"Hell\\" was made available for digital download on October 11, 2011, but Draiman stated on his Twitter page that there would not be a music video for it. A previously unreleased track, titled \\"Mine\\", also appears on the album. The track listing and release date were revealed on Draiman's Twitter page on September 20. On April 21, 2012, to commemorate Record Store Day, Disturbed released \\"The Collection\\". It is a box set featuring the band's five full-length studio albums in 140?gram vinyl LPs.\\r\\nOn February 8, 2012, it was announced that John Moyer was supergroup Adrenaline Mob's new bass player. John made his onstage debut with the group on March 12, at New York Citys Hiro Ballroom, a day before the release of the band's debut full-length album, Omert.[57] On February 14, 2012, on his Twitter account David Draiman confirmed that he would make an appearance on VH1's That Metal Show 10th Season airing sometime that year.[citation needed] That episode was later moved to the 11th season and premiered on August 11, 2012.\\r\\nIn May 2012 Draiman announced his new project, an industrial metal band called Device. Draiman later released information regarding the future of Disturbed and his new project Device, stating that Device would release their self-titled debut album on April 9, 2013. The album features several guest musicians from various metal bands. On April 25, 2013, it was announced that guitarist Dan Donegan and drummer Mike Wengren had begun a new project with Evans Blue singer Dan Chandler, Fight or Flight. Their debut album, \\"Life by Design?\\" was released on July 23, 2013.[58] In December 2014, Moyer formed a new band with Scott Weiland, Ron \\"Bumblefoot\\" Thal, twins Jon and Vince Votta entitled Art of Anarchy, with an album released in June 2015.[59]\\r\\nOn June 20, 2015, on Disturbed's Facebook page and website, there was material posted hinting at a possible return of the band. The website shows a new Disturbed logo, plus a video of the band's mascot \\"The Guy\\" appearing to be on life support, still breathing.[60] The new Disturbed logo was also posted to their official Facebook page, along with the video of their mascot, and their profile picture changed to solid black, indicating new activity within the band.[61] On June 22, 2015, Disturbed posted another video on Facebook, this time showing The Guy awakening from life support, as well as an 18-hour countdown on their official website, giving speculation to a definite reunion. On June 23, 2015, Disturbed officially announced the end of their hiatus and the coming of their new album entitled Immortalized. On the same day, the official music video for the new single \\"The Vengeful One\\" was released on their YouTube channel.[62] Immortalized was released on August 21, 2015. John Moyer did not perform on the album due to working on other projects, with all bass tracks being performed by Dan Donegan. Moyer is not in the band's video for \\"The Sound Of Silence\\" released in December 2015. However, Moyer remains a band member, having appeared in promotional photography for the album as well as continuing to perform live with the band.\\r\\nOn the album's release day, the band played their first show in four years at the House of Blues in Chicago. The show featured the live debuts of four new songs (\\"The Vengeful One\\", \\"What Are You Waiting For\\", \\"The Light\\" and the title-track) and the song \\"Hell\\", a b-side from Ten Thousand Fists in its entirety for the first time.[63]\\r\\nDisturbed recently released a virtual reality experience for the band's cover of \\"The Sound of Silence\\" via Littlstar.[64] The band released a live album titled Live at Red Rocks on November 18, 2016.[65] The band performed \\"The Sound of Silence\\" live on an episode of Australia's The X Factor.[66] Disturbed was announced as a direct support to Avenged Sevenfold on their UK & European tour throughout January and March 2017, alongside In Flames and Chevelle.[67][68]\\r\\nDisturbed is now currently on break after completing their touring cycle for Immortalized. The band is hoping to enter the studio by early 2018 to begin recording their seventh studio album.[69] The band will also release an acoustic EP before the new album is released, which is planned to be recorded later in 2017.[70] The forthcoming acoustic record will include brand new material as well as reworked versions of songs from the band's catalog.[71] The band's next touring plans aren't until sometime in 2019.[72]\\r\\nDisturbed's mascot, named \\"The Guy\\", was originally just a drawing of a face with a large grin, as seen on the back of the album The Sickness. The original drawing of The Guy was then edited using a digital distorting program. After the original image had been distorted three times The Guy became the official mascot for the band. Later, he would be drawn as a full figure by artist David Finch.\\r\\nClassified as a heavy metal[73][74][75][76][77][78] or hard rock[73][74][75][76][77][79] band, Disturbed is also regarded by some critics as nu metal[73][75][80][81] and alternative metal.[81][82] When asked about die-hard heavy metal fans not finding Disturbed heavy enough, Draiman at one time stated:\\r\\n\\"We probably have too much melody going on or we're not quite as turbulent or caustic. While I really love that type of music, it's not what we try to do. If we have to place things in context, we're more hard rock than heavy metal these days.[83]\\r\\nThe secret is that we were never really part of any particular trend, although we definitely benefited from the popularity of what was called nu-metal at the time?... We never had the stereotypical attributes that those bands had. We dont rap; theres no turntable involved; no fusion in that respect. We play, in my opinion, classic metal. Sabbath, Maiden, Priest, Metallica, Pantera: these are the bands that made us want to play.\\"[84]\\r\\nAllmusic reviewer Bradley Torreano described the album Believe as \\"taking the sort of jump that their heroes in Soundgarden and Pantera made after their respective breakthrough records\\".[85] He also described the title track as moving \\"from a brutal chug to a sweeping chorus that suddenly stops in its tracks and turns into a winding riff that recalls the work of vintage James Hetfield\\". Believe is also considered by several critics to be a step away from the nu metal sound featured on The Sickness, moving towards a more hard rock and heavy metal sound that was continued in their following albums.[86][87][88][89]\\r\\nAccording to frontman David Draiman on the band home documentary M.O.L., the lyrics that he writes are inspired by actual experiences of his own, and he stated that he likes to present his ideas with cryptic lyrics.[2] These lyrical themes range from the Judeo-Christian concept of Heaven and Hell, domestic abuse, suicide, insanity, relationships, war, to more fantasy-like themes, such as vampirism, werewolves and demons.\\r\\nGuitarist Dan Donegan uses guitar tunings Drop C, Drop C# and Drop B (also occasionally Eb), which are lower tunings than regular E standard. These lower tunings allow for a heavier sound and quicker chord changes in Donegan's riffs. Donegan also uses subtle electronic effects, which the rest of the band refers to as \\"The Danny Donegan Orchestra\\".","input":"Who are the members of the band disturbed?"},{"output":"artificial canals","context":"The Intracoastal Waterway (ICW) is a 3,000-mile (4,800?km) inland waterway along the Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico coasts of the United States, running from Boston, Massachusetts, southward along the Atlantic Seaboard and around the southern tip of Florida, then following the Gulf Coast to Brownsville, Texas. Some sections of the waterway consist of natural inlets, saltwater rivers, bays, and sounds, while others are artificial canals. It provides a navigable route along its length without many of the hazards of travel on the open sea.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe shipping hazards and safe havens of the Atlantic coast have been well known and appreciated since colonial times, and considered of great commercial, communication, and military importance to both the colonial power and the newly established, independent United States. The physical features of the eastern coast were advantageous for intracoastal development, resulting from erosion and deposition of sediment over its geologic history, but also enhanced and redistributed by the action of the Atlantic Ocean currents along it. Since the coastline represented the national border and commerce of the time was chiefly by water, the fledgling US government established a degree of national control over it. Inland transportation to supply the coasting trade at the time was less known and virtually undeveloped, but when new lands and their favorable river systems were added in 1787, a radically new and free national policy was established for their development and transportation use.[1] Over time, internal improvements of natural coastal and inland waterways would develop into the Great Loop, which allows for waterborne circumnavigation of the eastern continental United States, using minimal ocean travel, with the Intracoastal Waterway providing its eastern end.\\r\\nThe improvement of the country's natural transportation routes was a major concern for all geographic regions and from a national perspective of building and binding the nation. These improvements were also a source of political division about where and how improvements should be developed, who should pay, and who should perform the work. In 1808, the first federal government report on existing, possible, and likely avenues of transportation improvement was presented; it included much of the distance where the ICW now traverses the Atlantic coast. In 1802, at the request of the Senate, Treasury Secretary Albert Gallatin presented an overall plan for future transportation developments of national importance and scope. Along with inland eastÿwest improvements, Gallatin's northÿsouth improvements included the following:[2]\\r\\nThe map of the United States will show that they possess a tide water inland navigation, secure from storms and enemies, and which, from Massachusetts to the southern extremity of Georgia, is principally, if not solely, interrupted by four necks of land. These are the Isthmus of Barnstable, that part of New Jersey which extends from the Raritan to the Delaware, the peninsula between the Delaware and the Chesapeake, and that low and marshy tract which divides the Chesapeake from Albemarle Sound. ...\\r\\nShould this great work, the expense of which, as will hereafter be shown, is estimated at about three millions of dollars, be accomplished, a sea vessel entering the first canal in the harbor of Boston would, through the bay of Rhode Island, Long Island Sound, and the harbor of New York, reach Brunswick on the Raritan; thence pass through the second canal to Trenton on the Delaware, down that river to Christiana or Newcastle, and through the third canal to Elk River and the Chesapeake, whence, sailing down that bay and up Elizabeth River, it would, through the fourth canal, enter the Albemarle Sound, and by Pamlico, Core, and Bogue sounds, reach Beaufort and Swansborough in North Carolina. From the last-mentioned place, the inland navigation, through Stumpy and Toomer's sounds, is continued until a diminished draught of water, and by cutting two low and narrow necks, not exceeding three miles together, to Cape Fear River, and thence by an open but short and direct run along the coast is reached that chain of islands between which and the main the inland navigation is continued, to St. Marys along the coast of South Carolina and Georgia. It is unnecessary to add any comments on the utility of the work, in peace or war, for the transportation of merchandise or the conveyance of persons.\\r\\nWhile Gallatin discussed the details of engineering, construction, and costs, including the national benefits to accrue from lowered transportation costs between domestic and international markets, his full $20 million, 10-year plan was never approved. That is not to say his plan was never implemented, however, for with experience in the War of 1812 shortly thereafter and the attendant British blockade, the continued need for such facility was soon highlighted. Since Gallatin had based his proposals on the known advantageous natural geographic features of the country, many of his proposals became the locations of navigation improvements that were surveyed, authorized, and constructed starting with the 1824 General Survey Act and the first of many pieces of rivers and harbors legislation,[3] as well by individual state-built improvements. Since these 1824 acts, the United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) has responsibility for navigation waterway improvements and maintenance. All four proposed sections of Gallatin's intracoastal plan were eventually built; the Delaware and Raritan Canal was later abandoned for a better alternative, but the Cape Cod Canal remains in operation, and the Delaware and the Dismal Swamp portions still form part of the larger present-day Intracoastal Waterway.\\r\\nStarting in 1826, Congress authorized the first survey for an inland canal between the Atlantic Ocean and Gulf of Mexico, and during early developments, the growth of steam power to propel water, land, and sea transportation. Over time, additional portions of other coastal improvements were authorized for development, including the Houston Ship Channel and the Delaware River in 1872.[4] Following the Civil War, developments to the waterway system suffered as government funding moved increasingly from navigation to railroads; over time this resulted in anti-competitive pricing and acquisition practices by railroads over water transportation, but also in insufficient haulage capacity to move the required freight to the coasts. These conditions were investigated, accompanied by considered conclusions and recommendations, as early 1873 by the Report of Windom Select Committee from the Senate's Select Committee on Transportation Routes to the Seaboard,[2] but their plans and recommendations \\"received less attention than was anticipated, of course by reason of the rapid growth of interest in railways.\\"[2] While some policy corrections were implemented over the ensuing 30 years, continued insufficient capacity of railroad transportation became apparent following the harvest of 1906.[2]\\r\\nIn the River and Harbors Appropriations Acts of 1882 and 1884, Congress signaled its intent to improve waterways to benefit the nation by promoting competition among transportation modes. The 1882 act was the first act of Congress to combine appropriations for development of the nation's waterways with a reaffirmation of the policy of freedom from tolls and other user charges,[4] first stated in 1787; it was passed over President Chester Arthur's veto, who considered it wasteful spending for the government's growing federal surplus.[5] In 1887, the Interstate Commerce Act established federal regulation of railroads; Congress continued to promote freedom from tolls or special taxes on waterways.[4] In 1890, Congress passed the Sherman Antitrust Act, the first federal statute to limit cartels and monopolies, but the federal government used it minimally until Theodore Roosevelt's presidency more than 10 years later.\\r\\nThe invention of the diesel engine in 1892 eventually led to the conversion of fuels for transportation from coal and steam to diesel and the internal combustion engine. This was greatly enhanced by World War I military uses and the beginning of a new age of fuel usage and consumption. The Rivers and Harbors Act of 1909 set national policy for an intracoastal waterway from Boston to the Rio Grande,[4] and the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1910 authorized a 9-by-100-foot (2.7?m G?30.5?m) channel on the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway between the Apalachicola River and St. Andrews Bay, Florida, as well as a study of the most efficient means to move cargo. Between 1910 and 1914, navigation channels were deepened, and the screw propeller proved efficient for improved steering and flanking qualities.[4] Also during this period the Panama Canal Act was passed, in 1911; it proved key to the revival of waterway transportation in the United States, because the opening of Panama Canal in 1914 allowed coastal shipping to extend to the US west coast for the first time. The law also prohibited railroads from owning, controlling, or operating a water carrier through the canal and led to succeeding legislation that eliminated monopoly of transportation modes by railroads. The country's World War I experience demonstrated the need for bulk cargo transportation, with Congress establishing the Federal Barge Lines and spurring development of cheaper ways to transport farm commodities, including the first use of standardized freight barges.[4]\\r\\nIn 1924, Congress incorporated the Inland Waterways Corporation, generally regarded as the beginning of modern water carrier operations, and in 1925 it authorized construction of the Louisiana and Texas Intracoastal Waterway, as well as surveys east of New Orleans to Apalachicola Bay; this was the first legislation to treat the ICW as a continuous whole.[4] The River and Harbor Act of January 21, 1927, passed by Congress, authorized the portion of the Atlantic Intracoastal Waterway, using the route planned out by the Jacksonville District of the Corps of Engineers.[6] In 1936 the continuous 9?ft G?100?ft (2.7?m G?30.5?m) channel was completed between the Apalachicola River and New Orleans. During World War II, the need for efficient transportation of bulk materials within the continental United States was well demonstrated after German submarines sank numerous merchant ships off the East Coast. By 1942, the 9?ft G?100?ft (2.7?m G?30.5?m) ICW channel was completed between New Orleans and Corpus Christi.\\r\\nToday, federal law provides for the waterway to be maintained at a minimum depth of 12 feet (3.7?m) for most of its length, but inadequate funding has prevented that.[citation needed] Consequently, for larger ships, shoaling or shallow waters are encountered along several sections of the waterway, with these having 7-foot (2.1?m) or 9-foot (2.7?m) minimum depths from earlier improvements. While no tolls are charged for waterway usage, commercial users have been charged a fuel tax since 1978, which is used to maintain and improve facilities. That year, the Inland Waterways Revenue Act imposed a barge fuel tax; originally set at 4 cents per gallon in 1980,[7] it was gradually raised to 10 cents per gallon by 1986.[4] To hold these funds, the act also created the Inland Waterways Trust Fund under the US Treasury, which are used to cover half the cost of new construction and major rehabilitation of the inland waterways infrastructure (33 U.S.C. ch.32).[8] The Water Resources Development Act of 1986 was a wide-ranging bill regarding all water resources utilization nationally. Concerning transportation on waterways, this law established the Inland Waterways Users Board to make recommendations regarding construction and rehabilitation priorities and spending levels for the inland waterways, and also gradually increased the incremental fuel tax to 20 cents per gallon by 1995.[4]\\r\\nThe Intracoastal Waterway runs for most of the length of the Eastern Seaboard, from its unofficial northern terminus at the Manasquan River in New Jersey, where it connects with the Atlantic Ocean at the Manasquan Inlet, then around the Gulf of Mexico to Brownsville, Texas.\\r\\nThe waterway consists of three non-contiguous segments: the Atlantic Intracoastal Waterway (AIWW), extending from Portsmouth, Virginia (milepost 0.0) to Key West, Florida; a section of the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway beginning at Tarpon Springs, Florida, and extending south to Fort Myers;[9] and a second section of the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway extending from Brownsville, Texas, east to Carrabelle, Florida. These segments were intended to be connected via a dredged waterway from St. Marks to Tarpon Springs and the Cross Florida Barge Canal across northern Florida, but these projects were never completed due to environmental concerns. Additional canals and bays extend a navigable waterway to Boston, Massachusetts.\\r\\nThe Intracoastal Waterway has a good deal of commercial activity; barges haul petroleum, petroleum products, foodstuffs, building materials, and manufactured goods.

Ni?o de Cebu, based in the city of Cebu in the Philippines, is a geographical and administrative subdivision of the religious Order of St. Augustine. The Province is actively involved in education, parish administration, mission work and formation of candidates for religious life. It has worked on joint missions with other Augustinian provinces, namely, the Australian Province in South Korea, the Dutch Province in Indonesia, and the Provinces of Villanova (United States), Ireland and England-Scotland in South Africa. In keeping with its goal to become a missionary Province, it has begun sending friars overseas to help in apostolic and pastoral ministries.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first group of Augustinians, under the leadership of the Venerable Andres Urdaneta, came to the Philippines in 1565 from Spain through Mexico as the pioneers in the Catholic Church's task of evangelization in that part of the globe. Originally establishing themselves in Cebu, these missionaries soon expanded their apostolic activities to the neighboring towns and islands and later to almost all the other principal regions of the archipelago.\\r\\nOn March 7, 1575, the then Prior General of the Order, Fr. Tadeo de Perusa, decreed the creation of a new Augustinian Province in the Philippines under the title Santisimo Nombre de Jesus de Filipinas ÿ Most Holy Name of Jesus of the Philippines. During the Spanish colonial times in the Philippines, they founded almost three hundred towns and churches from 1565 to 1898.\\r\\nAt the turn of the twentieth century, the Province of the Most Holy Name of Jesus of the Philippines decided to shift its missionary activities to newer territories, such as Peru, Colombia, and Venezuela. As a logical consequence of this move, the seat of the Province was transferred from Manila to Madrid. The Augustinian presence in the country was then reduced to a minimum.\\r\\nTo compensate for this loss of manpower, the remaining Augustinians intensified the recruitment and formation of Filipino candidates. And as the number of the latter increased and their preparedness adequately established, the idea of creating a new Province came to be seriously considered.\\r\\nPlans for the organization of such a Province began in 1974 when the Regional Assembly of the Philippine Augustinian Vicariate asked for the creation of a Vice-Province in the islands. Though the plan was not realized, it was again revived by a group of Filipino Augustinians at a meeting in the Basilica Minore del Santo Ni?o in Cebu on April 29, 1981. The plan this time was for the creation of a new Province. The move to create a new Province, which would be called the Province of Sto. Ni?o de Cebu-Philippines, was officially endorsed by the Regional Assembly of the Augustinian Vicariate of the Philippines at the closing of its sessions on August 19, 1981, in the Monastery of San Agustin, Intramuros, Manila, and by the Provincial Chapter of the Province of the Most Holy Name of Jesus of the Philippines, held in Valladolid, Spain on July 17, 1982. The proposal was overwhelmingly approved by the members of the 174th General Chapter held in Rome on September 15, 1983, and the new province was canonically established on December 25, 1983.\\r\\nThe province was officially formed on September 13, 1983, inside the Istituto Patristico Augustinianum in Rome during the 174th General Chapter of the Augustinian Order, where ninety-three delegates approved the creation of the first indigenous Augustinian province in Asia after over 400 years of control by Spanish religious leaders. The Province of Sto. Ni?o de Cebu gained autonomy from the mother province, the Province of the Most Holy Name of Jesus of the Philippines, which is based in Spain.[2]\\r\\nThe first Prior Provincial was Rev. Fr. Eusebio B. Berdon, OSA, who later became an assistant Prior General of the Order in Rome. Initially, the Province had thirty-six friars and religious brothers and sixty-one aspirants, novices, postulants and theology students.[3]\\r\\nInstitutions, or houses, owned by the Province, include the following:","input":"When was the santo ni?o de cebu parish of bi?an laguna founded?"},{"output":"August 28, 1963","context":"\\"I Have a Dream\\" is a public speech delivered by American civil rights activist Martin Luther King Jr. during the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom on August 28, 1963, in which he calls for an end to racism in the United States and called for civil and economic rights. Delivered to over 250,000 civil rights supporters from the steps of the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, D.C., the speech was a defining moment of the Civil Rights Movement.[2]\\r\\nBeginning with a reference to the Emancipation Proclamation, which freed millions of slaves in 1863,[3] King observes that: \\"one hundred years later, the Negro still is not free\\".[4] Toward the end of the speech, King departed from his prepared text for a partly improvised peroration on the theme \\"I have a dream\\", prompted by Mahalia Jackson's cry: \\"Tell them about the dream, Martin!\\"[5] In this part of the speech, which most excited the listeners and has now become its most famous, King described his dreams of freedom and equality arising from a land of slavery and hatred.[6] Jon Meacham writes that, \\"With a single phrase, Martin Luther King Jr. joined Jefferson and Lincoln in the ranks of men who've shaped modern America\\".[7] The speech was ranked the top American speech of the 20th century in a 1999 poll of scholars of public address.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom was partly intended to demonstrate mass support for the civil rights legislation proposed by President Kennedy in June. Martin Luther King and other leaders therefore agreed to keep their speeches calm, also, to avoid provoking the civil disobedience which had become the hallmark of the Civil Rights Movement. King originally designed his speech as a homage to Abraham Lincoln's Gettysburg Address, timed to correspond with the 100-year centennial of the Emancipation Proclamation.[6]\\r\\nKing had been preaching about dreams since 1960, when he gave a speech to the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) called \\"The Negro and the American Dream\\". This speech discusses the gap between the American dream and reality, saying that overt white supremacists have violated the dream, and that \\"our federal government has also scarred the dream through its apathy and hypocrisy, its betrayal of the cause of justice\\". King suggests that \\"It may well be that the Negro is God's instrument to save the soul of America.\\"[9][10] In 1961, he spoke of the Civil Rights Movement and student activists' \\"dream\\" of equality\\"the American Dream ... a dream as yet unfulfilled\\"in several national speeches and statements, and took \\"the dream\\" as the centerpiece for these speeches.[11]\\r\\nOn November 27, 1962, King gave a speech at Booker T. Washington High School in Rocky Mount, North Carolina. That speech was longer than the version which he would eventually deliver from the Lincoln Memorial. And while parts of the text had been moved around, large portions were identical, including the \\"I have a dream\\" refrain.[12][13] After being rediscovered,[14] the restored and digitized recording of the 1962 speech was presented to the public by the English department of North Carolina State University.[12]\\r\\nMartin Luther King had also delivered a \\"dream\\" speech in Detroit, in June 1963, when he marched on Woodward Avenue with Walter Reuther and the Reverend C. L. Franklin, and had rehearsed other parts.[15]\\r\\nThe March on Washington Speech, known as \\"I Have a Dream Speech\\", has been shown to have had several versions, written at several different times.[16] It has no single version draft, but is an amalgamation of several drafts, and was originally called \\"Normalcy, Never Again\\". Little of this, and another \\"Normalcy Speech\\", ended up in the final draft. A draft of \\"Normalcy, Never Again\\" is housed in the Morehouse College Martin Luther King Jr. Collection of the Robert W. Woodruff Library, Atlanta University Center and Morehouse College.[17] The focus on \\"I have a dream\\" comes through the speech's delivery. Toward the end of its delivery, noted African American gospel singer Mahalia Jackson shouted to King from the crowd, \\"Tell them about the dream, Martin.\\"[18] King departed from his prepared remarks and started \\"preaching\\" improvisationally, punctuating his points with \\"I have a dream.\\"\\r\\nThe speech was drafted with the assistance of Stanley Levison and Clarence Benjamin Jones[19] in Riverdale, New York City. Jones has said that \\"the logistical preparations for the march were so burdensome that the speech was not a priority for us\\" and that, \\"on the evening of Tuesday, Aug. 27, [12 hours before the march] Martin still didn't know what he was going to say\\".[20]\\r\\nLeading up to the speech's rendition at the Great March on Washington, King had delivered its \\"I have a dream\\" refrains in his speech before 25,000 people in Detroit's Cobo Hall immediately after the 125,000-strong Great Walk to Freedom in Detroit, June 23, 1963.[21][22] After the Washington, D.C. March, a recording of King's Cobo Hall speech was released by Detroit's Gordy Records as an LP entitled \\"The Great March To Freedom\\".[23]\\r\\nWidely hailed as a masterpiece of rhetoric, King's speech invokes pivotal documents in American history, including the Declaration of Independence, the Emancipation Proclamation, and the United States Constitution. Early in his speech, King alludes to Abraham Lincoln's Gettysburg Address by saying \\"Five score years ago...\\" In reference to the abolition of slavery articulated in the Emancipation Proclamation, King says: \\"It came as a joyous daybreak to end the long night of their captivity.\\" Anaphora (i.e., the repetition of a phrase at the beginning of sentences) is employed throughout the speech. Early in his speech, King urges his audience to seize the moment; \\"Now is the time\\" is repeated three times in the sixth paragraph. The most widely cited example of anaphora is found in the often quoted phrase \\"I have a dream\\", which is repeated eight times as King paints a picture of an integrated and unified America for his audience. Other occasions include \\"One hundred years later\\", \\"We can never be satisfied\\", \\"With this faith\\", \\"Let freedom ring\\", and \\"free at last\\". King was the sixteenth out of eighteen people to speak that day, according to the official program.[24]\\r\\nAmong the most quoted lines of the speech include \\"I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin, but by the content of their character. I have a dream today!\\"[26]\\r\\nAccording to U.S. Representative John Lewis, who also spoke that day as the president of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, \\"Dr. King had the power, the ability, and the capacity to transform those steps on the Lincoln Memorial into a monumental area that will forever be recognized. By speaking the way he did, he educated, he inspired, he informed not just the people there, but people throughout America and unborn generations.\\"[27]\\r\\nThe ideas in the speech reflect King's social experiences of ethnocentric abuse, the mistreatment and exploitation of blacks.[28] The speech draws upon appeals to America's myths as a nation founded to provide freedom and justice to all people, and then reinforces and transcends those secular mythologies by placing them within a spiritual context by arguing that racial justice is also in accord with God's will. Thus, the rhetoric of the speech provides redemption to America for its racial sins.[29] King describes the promises made by America as a \\"promissory note\\" on which America has defaulted. He says that \\"America has given the Negro people a bad check\\", but that \\"we've come to cash this check\\" by marching in Washington, D.C.\\r\\nKing's speech used words and ideas from his own speeches and other texts. For years, he had spoken about dreams, quoted from Samuel Francis Smith's popular patriotic hymn \\"America\\" (\\"My Country, 'Tis of Thee\\"), and of course referred extensively to the Bible. The idea of constitutional rights as an \\"unfulfilled promise\\" was suggested by Clarence Jones.[9]\\r\\nThe final passage from King's speech closely resembles Archibald Carey Jr.'s address to the 1952 Republican National Convention: both speeches end with a recitation of the first verse of \\"America\\", and the speeches share the name of one of several mountains from which both exhort \\"let freedom ring\\".[9][30]\\r\\nKing also is said to have used portions of Prathia Hall's speech at the site of a burned-down African American church in Terrell County, Georgia, in September 1962, in which she used the repeated phrase \\"I have a dream\\".[31] The church burned down after it was used for voter registration meetings.[32]\\r\\nThe speech also alludes to Psalm 30:5[33] in the second stanza of the speech. Additionally, King quotes from Isaiah 40:4ÿ5 (\\"I have a dream that every valley shall be exalted...\\"[34]) and Amos 5:24 (\\"But let justice roll down like water...\\"[35]). He also alludes to the opening lines of Shakespeare's Richard III (\\"Now is the winter of our discontent / Made glorious summer...\\") when he remarks that \\"this sweltering summer of the Negro's legitimate discontent will not pass until there is an invigorating autumn...\\"\\r\\nThe \\"I Have a Dream\\" speech can be dissected by using three rhetorical lenses: voice merging, prophetic voice, and dynamic spectacle.[36] Voice merging is the combining of one's own voice with religious predecessors. Prophetic voice is using rhetoric to speak for a population. A dynamic spectacle has origins from the Aristotelian definition as \\"a weak hybrid form of drama, a theatrical concoction that relied upon external factors (shock, sensation, and passionate release) such as televised rituals of conflict and social control.\\"[37]\\r\\nVoice merging is a common technique used amongst African American preachers. It combines the voices of previous preachers and excerpts from scriptures along with their own unique thoughts to create a unique voice. King uses voice merging in his peroration when he references the secular hymn \\"America\\".\\r\\nThe rhetoric of King's speech can be compared to the rhetoric of Old Testament prophets. During King's speech, he speaks with urgency and crisis giving him a prophetic voice. The prophetic voice must \\"restore a sense of duty and virtue amidst the decay of venality.\\"[38] An evident example is when King declares that, \\"now is the time to make justice a reality for all of God's children.\\"\\r\\nWhy King's speech was powerful is debated, but essentially, it came at a point of many factors combining at a key cultural turning point. Executive speechwriter Anthony Trendl writes, \\"The right man delivered the right words to the right people in the right place at the right time.\\"[39]\\r\\n\\"Given the context of drama and tension in which it was situated\\", King's speech can be classified as a dynamic spectacle.[40] A dynamic spectacle is dependent on the situation in which it is used. It can be considered a dynamic spectacle because it happened at the correct time and place: during the Civil Rights Movement and the March on Washington.\\r\\nThe speech was lauded in the days after the event, and was widely considered the high point of the March by contemporary observers.[41] James Reston, writing for The New York Times, said that \\"Dr. King touched all the themes of the day, only better than anybody else. He was full of the symbolism of Lincoln and Gandhi, and the cadences of the Bible. He was both militant and sad, and he sent the crowd away feeling that the long journey had been worthwhile.\\"[9] Reston also noted that the event \\"was better covered by television and the press than any event here since President Kennedy's inauguration\\", and opined that \\"it will be a long time before [Washington] forgets the melodious and melancholy voice of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. crying out his dreams to the multitude.\\"[42] An article in The Boston Globe by Mary McGrory reported that King's speech \\"caught the mood\\" and \\"moved the crowd\\" of the day \\"as no other\\" speaker in the event.[43] Marquis Childs of The Washington Post wrote that King's speech \\"rose above mere oratory\\".[44] An article in the Los Angeles Times commented that the \\"matchless eloquence\\" displayed by King\\"a supreme orator\\" of \\"a type so rare as almost to be forgotten in our age\\"put to shame the advocates of segregation by inspiring the \\"conscience of America\\" with the justice of the civil-rights cause.[45]\\r\\nThe Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), which viewed King and his allies for racial justice as subversive, also noticed the speech. This provoked the organization to expand their COINTELPRO operation against the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC), and to target King specifically as a major enemy of the United States.[46] Two days after King delivered \\"I Have a Dream\\", Agent William C. Sullivan, the head of COINTELPRO, wrote a memo about King's growing influence:\\r\\nIn the light of King's powerful demagogic speech yesterday he stands head and shoulders above all other Negro leaders put together when it comes to influencing great masses of Negroes. We must mark him now, if we have not done so before, as the most dangerous Negro of the future in this Nation from the standpoint of communism, the Negro and national security.[47]\\r\\nThe speech was a success for the Kennedy administration and for the liberal civil rights coalition that had planned it. It was considered a \\"triumph of managed protest\\", and not one arrest relating to the demonstration occurred. Kennedy had watched King's speech on television and been very impressed. Afterwards, March leaders accepted an invitation to the White House to meet with President Kennedy. Kennedy felt the March bolstered the chances for his civil rights bill.[48]\\r\\nMeanwhile, some of the more radical Black leaders who were present condemned the speech (along with the rest of the march)[citation needed] as too compromising. Malcolm X later wrote in his autobiography: \\"Who ever heard of angry revolutionaries swinging their bare feet together with their oppressor in lily pad pools, with gospels and guitars and 'I have a dream' speeches?\\"[6]\\r\\nThe March on Washington put pressure on the Kennedy administration to advance its civil rights legislation in Congress.[49] The diaries of Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr., published posthumously in 2007, suggest that President Kennedy was concerned that if the march failed to attract large numbers of demonstrators, it might undermine his civil rights efforts.\\r\\nIn the wake of the speech and march, King was named Man of the Year by TIME magazine for 1963, and in 1964, he was the youngest person ever awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.[50] The full speech did not appear in writing until August 1983, some 15 years after King's death, when a transcript was published in The Washington Post.[4]\\r\\nIn 1990, the Australian alternative comedy rock band Doug Anthony All Stars released an album called Icon. One song from Icon, \\"Shang-a-lang\\", sampled the end of the speech.\\r\\nIn 1992, the band Moodswings, incorporated excerpts from Martin Luther King, Jr.'s \\"I Have a Dream\\" speech in their song \\"Spiritual High, Part III. on the album Moodfood\\".\\r\\nIn 2002, the Library of Congress honored the speech by adding it to the United States National Recording Registry.[51] In 2003, the National Park Service dedicated an inscribed marble pedestal to commemorate the location of King's speech at the Lincoln Memorial.[52]\\r\\nThe Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial was dedicated in 2011. The centerpiece for the memorial is based on a line from King's \\"I Have A Dream\\" speech: \\"Out of a mountain of despair, a stone of hope.\\"[53] A 30 feet (9.1?m)-high relief of King named the \\"Stone of Hope\\" stands past two other pieces of granite that symbolize the \\"mountain of despair.\\"[53]\\r\\nOn August 26, 2013, UK's BBC Radio 4 broadcast \\"God's Trombone\\", in which Gary Younge looked behind the scenes of the speech and explored \\"what made it both timely and timeless\\".[54]\\r\\nOn August 28, 2013, thousands gathered on the mall in Washington D.C. where King made his historic speech to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the occasion. In attendance were former U.S. Presidents Bill Clinton and Jimmy Carter, and incumbent President Barack Obama, who addressed the crowd and spoke on the significance of the event. Many of King's family were in attendance.[55]\\r\\nOn October 11, 2015, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution published an exclusive report about Stone Mountain officials considering installation of a new \\"Freedom Bell\\" honoring King and citing the speech's reference to the mountain \\"Let freedom ring from Stone Mountain of Georgia.\\"[56] Design details and a timeline for its installation remain to be determined. The article mentioned inspiration for the proposed monument came from a bell-ringing ceremony held in 2013 in celebration of the 50th anniversary of King's speech.\\r\\nOn April 20, 2016, Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew announced that the U.S. $5 bill, which has featured the Lincoln Memorial on its back, would undergo a redesign prior to 2020. Lew said that a portrait of Lincoln would remain on the front of the bill, but the back would be redesigned to depict various historical events that have occurred at the memorial, including an image from King's speech.[57]\\r\\nIn October 2016 Science Friday in a segment on its crowd sourced update to the Voyager Golden Record included the speech.[58]\\r\\nBecause King's speech was broadcast to a large radio and television audience, there was controversy about its copyright status. If the performance of the speech constituted \\"general publication\\", it would have entered the public domain due to King's failure to register the speech with the Register of Copyrights. However, if the performance only constituted \\"limited publication\\", King retained common law copyright. This led to a lawsuit, Estate of Martin Luther King, Jr., Inc. v. CBS, Inc., which established that the King estate does hold copyright over the speech and had standing to sue; the parties then settled. Unlicensed use of the speech or a part of it can still be lawful in some circumstances, especially in jurisdictions under doctrines such as fair use or fair dealing. Under the applicable copyright laws, the speech will remain under copyright in the United States until 70 years after King's death, therefore until 2038.[59]\\r\\nAs King waved goodbye to the audience, he handed George Raveling the original typewritten \\"I Have a Dream\\" speech.[60] Raveling, an All-American Villanova Wildcats college basketball player, had volunteered as a security guard for the event and was on the podium with King at that moment.[61] In 2013, Raveling still had custody of the original copy, for which he had been offered $3,000,000, but he has said he does not intend to sell it.[62][63]\\r\\nCoordinates: 385321.48N 7730.40W? / ?38.8893000N 77.0501111W? / 38.8893000; -77.0501111","input":"When was martin luther king jr speech i have a dream given?"},{"output":"a Native American village near present-day Tallahassee, Florida","context":"","input":"What is the origin of the word appalachian?"},{"output":"February 6, 2015","context":"The Canon EOS 750D, known as the Rebel T6i in the Americas or as the Kiss X8i in Japan, is a 24.2 megapixels entry-mid-level digital SLR announced by Canon on February 6, 2015.

Included on the list are charts of the top box office earners (ranked by both the nominal and real value of their revenue), a chart of high-grossing films by calendar year, a timeline showing the transition of the highest-grossing film record, and a chart of the highest-grossing film franchises and series. All charts are ranked by international theatrical box office performance where possible, excluding income derived from home video, broadcasting rights and merchandise.\\r\\nTraditionally, war films, musicals and historical dramas have been the most popular genres, but franchise films have been among the best performers in the 21st century. Six Harry Potter films and five films from Peter Jackson's Middle-earth series are included in the nominal earnings chart, while the Star Wars and Pirates of the Caribbean franchises feature prominently. There is also continued interest in the superhero genre: Batman and Superman from DC Comics and films based on the Marvel Comics brand, such as Spider-Man, X-Men and films in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, have generally done well. Although the nominal earnings chart is dominated by films adapted from pre-existing properties and sequels, it is headed by Avatar and Titanic (both directed by James Cameron), which are original works. Animated family films have performed consistently well, with Disney films enjoying lucrative re-releases prior to the home-video era. Disney also enjoyed later success with films such as Frozen (the highest-grossing animated film), Zootopia and The Lion King, as well as with its Pixar brand, of which the Toy Story and Finding Nemo films have been the best performers. Beyond Disney and Pixar animation, the Shrek, Ice Age and Despicable Me series have met with the most success.\\r\\nWhile inflation has eroded away the achievements of most films from the 1960s and 1970s, there are franchises originating from that period that are still active. Besides the Star Wars and Superman franchises, James Bond and Star Trek films are still being released periodically; all four are among the highest-grossing franchises. Some of the older films that held the record of highest-grossing film still have respectable grosses by today's standards, but no longer compete numerically against today's top-earners in an era of much higher individual ticket prices. When properly adjusted for inflation, however, on that comparative scale Gone with the Windwhich was the highest-grossing film outright for twenty-five yearsis still the highest-grossing film of all time. All grosses on the list are expressed in U.S. dollars at their nominal value, except where stated otherwise.\\r\\nWith a worldwide box-office gross of over $2.7?billion, Avatar is often proclaimed to be the \\"highest-grossing\\" film, but such claims usually refer to theatrical revenues only and do not take into account home video and television income, which can form a significant portion of a film's earnings. Once revenue from home entertainment is factored in it is not immediately clear which film is the most successful. Titanic earned $1.2?billion from video and DVD sales and rentals,[1] in addition to the $2.2?billion it grossed in theaters. While complete sales data are not available for Avatar, it earned $345?million from the sale of sixteen million DVD and Blu-ray units in North America,[2] and ultimately sold a total of thirty million DVD and Blu-ray units worldwide.[3] After home video income is accounted for, both films have earned over $3?billion. Television broadcast rights will also substantially add to a film's earnings, with a film often earning as much as 20ÿ25% of its theatrical box-office for a couple of television runs on top of pay-per-view revenues;[4] Titanic earned a further $55?million from the NBC and HBO broadcast rights,[1] equating to about 9% of its North American gross.\\r\\nWhen a film is highly exploitable as a commercial property, its ancillary revenues can dwarf its income from direct film sales.[5] The Lion King earned over $2?billion in box-office and home video sales,[6] but this pales in comparison to the $6?billion earned at box offices around the world by the stage adaptation.[7] Merchandising can be extremely lucrative too: The Lion King also sold $3?billion of merchandise,[8] while Pixar's Carswhich earned $462?million in theatrical revenues and was only a modest hit by comparison to other Pixar films[9]generated global merchandise sales of over $8?billion in the five years after its 2006 release.[10][11] Pixar also had another huge hit with Toy Story 3, which generated almost $10?billion in merchandise retail sales in addition to the $1?billion it earned at the box office.[12]\\r\\nOn this chart, films are ranked by the revenues from theatrical exhibition at their nominal value, along with the highest positions they attained. Thirty-four films in total have grossed in excess of $1?billion worldwide, of which four have grossed over $2?billion, with Avatar ranked in the top position. All of the films have had a theatrical run (including re-releases) in the 21st century, and films that have not played during this period do not appear on the chart because of ticket-price inflation, population size and ticket purchasing trends not being considered.\\r\\nFBox Office Mojo stopped updating its main total for Frozen in August 2014, while it was still in release.

Its total now stands at $940.3 million, which would put the first run at $871.0 million after deducting the 3D reissue gross of $69.3 million, and slightly higher than the $864.6 million Box Office Mojo originally had listed. Meanwhile, Box Office Mojo originally had the gross for The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring listed at $871.4 million prior to its 2011 re-release, but this was dropped to $870.8 million by 2009.[18] The slightly higher gross of $871.0 million for Finding Nemo would rank above the slightly lower gross of $870.8 million for The Fellowship of the Ring.\\r\\nBecause of the long-term effects of inflation, notably the significant increase of movie theater ticket prices, the list unadjusted for inflation gives far more weight to later films.[19] The unadjusted list, while commonly found in the press, is therefore largely meaningless for comparing films widely separated in time, as many films from earlier eras will never appear on a modern unadjusted list, despite achieving higher commercial success when adjusted for price increases.[20] To compensate for the devaluation of the currency, some charts make adjustments for inflation, but not even this practice fully addresses the issue since ticket prices and inflation do not necessarily parallel one another. For example, in 1970, tickets cost $1.55 or about $6.68 in inflation-adjusted 2004 dollars; by 1980, prices had risen to about $2.69, a drop to $5.50 in inflation-adjusted 2004 dollars.[21] Ticket prices have also risen at different rates of inflation around the world, further complicating the process of adjusting worldwide grosses.[19]\\r\\nAnother complication is release in multiple formats for which different ticket prices are charged. One notable example of this phenomenon is Avatar, which was also released in 3D and IMAX: almost two-thirds of tickets for that film were for 3D showings with an average price of $10, and about one-sixth were for IMAX showings with an average price over $14.50, compared to a 2010 average price of $7.61 for 2D films.[22] Social and economic factors such as population change[23] and the growth of international markets[24][25][26] also impact on the number of people purchasing theater tickets, along with audience demographics where some films sell a much higher proportion of discounted children's tickets, or perform better in big cities where tickets cost more.[20]\\r\\nThe measuring system for gauging a film's success is based on unadjusted grosses, mainly because historically this is the way it has always been done because of the practices of the film industry: the box office receipts are compiled by theaters and relayed to the distributor, which in turn releases them to the media.[27] Converting to a more representative system that counts ticket sales rather than gross is also fraught with problems because the only data available for older films are the sale totals.[23] As the motion picture industry is highly oriented towards marketing currently released films, unadjusted figures are always used in marketing campaigns so that new blockbuster films can much more easily achieve a high sales ranking, and thus be promoted as a \\"top film of all time\\",[21][28] so there is little incentive to switch to a more robust analysis from a marketing or even newsworthy point of view.[27]\\r\\nDespite the inherent difficulties in accounting for inflation, several attempts have been made. Estimates depend on the price index used to adjust the grosses,[28] and the exchange rates used to convert between currencies can also impact upon the calculations, both of which can have an effect on the ultimate rankings of an inflation adjusted list. Gone with the Windfirst released in 1939is generally considered to be the most successful film, with Guinness World Records in 2014 estimating its adjusted global gross at $3.4 billion. Estimates for Gone with the Wind's adjusted gross have varied substantially: its owner, Turner Entertainment, estimated its adjusted earnings at $3.3 billion in 2007, a few years earlier than the Guinness estimate;[29] other estimates fall either side of this amount, with one putting its gross just under $3 billion in 2010,[30] while another provided an alternative figure of $3.8 billion in 2006.[31] Which film is Gone with the Wind's nearest rival depends on the set of figures used: Guinness had Avatar in second place with $3 billion, while other estimates saw Titanic in the runner-up spot with first-run worldwide earnings of almost $2.9 billion at 2010 prices. The only other film that all sources agreed grossed in excess of $2 billion at recent prices is Star Wars; according to Guinness it has earned $2.8 billion at 2014 price levels, while other sources from 2010/2011 put its adjusted earnings at $2.2ÿ2.6 billion.[30][32]\\r\\nInfInflation adjustment is carried out using the International Monetary Fund's global Consumer price index.[34] The index is uniformly applied to the grosses in the chart published by Guinness World Records in 2014, beginning with the 2014 index. The figures in the above chart take into account inflation that occurred in 2014, and in every available year since then, with 2016 the most recent year available.\\r\\nTGuinness' adjusted total for Titanic only increased by $102,000,000 between the 2012 (published in 2011) and 2015 editions, a rise of 4.2% shared by the other adjusted totals in the chart, and omitted the gross from a 3D re-release in 2012.[35][33] This chart incorporates the gross of $343,550,770 from the reissue and adjusts it from the 2014 index.[36] Titanic was re-released again in 2017 but this figure is not represented in the adjusted total.\\r\\nTFASince Star Wars: The Force Awakens was released in 2015, inflation is only applied to its gross from 2016 onwards.\\r\\nAudience tastes were fairly eclectic during the 20th century, but several trends did emerge. During the silent era, films with war themes were popular with audiences, with The Birth of a Nation (American Civil War), The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse, The Big Parade and Wings (all World War I) becoming the most successful films in their respective years of release, with the trend coming to an end with All Quiet on the Western Front in 1930. With the advent of sound in 1927, the musicalthe genre best placed to showcase the new technologytook over as the most popular type of film with audiences, with 1928 and 1929 both being topped by musical films. The genre continued to perform strongly in the 1930s, but the outbreak of World War II saw war themed films dominate again during this period, starting with Gone with the Wind (American Civil War) in 1939, and finishing with The Best Years of Our Lives (World War II) in 1946. Samson and Delilah (1949) saw the beginning of a trend of increasingly expensive historical dramas set during Ancient Rome/biblical times throughout the 1950s as cinema competed with television for audiences,[40] with Quo Vadis, The Robe, The Ten Commandments, Ben-Hur and Spartacus all becoming the highest-grossing film of the year during initial release, before the genre started to wane after several high-profile failures.[41] The success of White Christmas and South Pacific in the 1950s foreshadowed the comeback of the musical in the 1960s with West Side Story, Mary Poppins, My Fair Lady, The Sound of Music and Funny Girl all among the top films of the decade. The 1970s saw a shift in audience tastes to high concept films, with six such films made by either George Lucas or Steven Spielberg topping the chart during the 1980s. The 21st century has seen an increasing dependence on franchises and adaptations, with the box office dominance of films based on pre-existing intellectual property at record levels.[42]\\r\\nSteven Spielberg is the most represented director on the chart with six films to his credit, occupying the top spot in 1975, 1981, 1982, 1984, 1989 and 1993. Cecil B. DeMille (1932, 1947, 1949, 1952 and 1956) and William Wyler (1942, 1946, 1959 and 1968) are in second and third place with five and four films respectively, while D. W. Griffith (1915, 1916 and 1920), George Roy Hill (1966, 1969 and 1973) and James Cameron (1991, 1997 and 2009) all feature heavily with three films apiece. George Lucas directed two chart-toppers in 1977 and 1999, but also served in a strong creative capacity as a producer and writer in 1980, 1981, 1983, 1984 and 1989 as well. The following directors have also all directed two films on the chart: Frank Lloyd, King Vidor, Frank Capra, Michael Curtiz, Leo McCarey, Alfred Hitchcock, David Lean, Stanley Kubrick, Guy Hamilton, Mike Nichols, William Friedkin, Peter Jackson, Gore Verbinski and Michael Bay; Mervyn LeRoy, Ken Annakin and Robert Wise are each represented by one solo credit and one shared credit, and John Ford co-directed two films. Disney films are usually co-directed and some directors have served on several winning teams: Wilfred Jackson, Hamilton Luske, Clyde Geronimi, David Hand, Ben Sharpsteen, Wolfgang Reitherman and Bill Roberts have all co-directed at least two films on the list. Only five directors have topped the chart in consecutive years: McCarey (1944 and 1945), Nichols (1966 and 1967), Spielberg (1981 and 1982), Jackson (2002 and 2003) and Verbinski (2006 and 2007).\\r\\nBecause of release schedulesespecially in the case of films released towards the end of the yearand different release patterns across the world, many films can do business in two or more calendar years; therefore the grosses documented here are not confined to just the year of release. Grosses are not limited to original theatrical runs either, with many older films often being re-released periodically so the figures represent all the business a film has done since its original release; a film's first-run gross is included in brackets after the total if known. Because of incomplete data it cannot be known for sure how much money some films have made and when they made it, but generally the chart chronicles the films from each year that went on to earn the most. In the cases where estimates conflict both films are recorded, and in cases where a film has moved into first place because of being re-released the previous record-holder is also retained. At least one film every year has generated $100 million in gross revenue at the box office since 1967,[clarification needed] and from 2008 each year has succeeded in producing a billion dollar grossing film.\\r\\n( ... ) Since grosses are not limited to original theatrical runs, a film's first-run gross is included in brackets after the total if known.\\r\\n*Canada and U.S. gross only.\\r\\nRDistributor rental.\\r\\nTBATo be ascertained.\\r\\nINNo contemporary sources provide figures for 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea, although The Numbers provides a figure of $8,000,000 for the North American box office gross.[46] However, it is possible this figure has been mistaken for the gross of the 1954 remake which also earned $8,000,000 in North American rentals.[47]\\r\\nFHSome sources such as The Numbers state that Aloma of the South Seas is the highest grossing film of the year, earning $3 million.[48] However, no contemporary sources provide figures for Aloma of the South Seas, so it is unclear what the $3 million figure relates to. If it were the rental gross then that would have made it not only the highest-grossing film of the year, but one of the highest-grossing films of the silent era, and if that is the case it would be unusual for both International Motion Picture Almanac and Variety to omit it from their lists.\\r\\nSSIt is not clear if the figure for Sunny Side Up is for North America or worldwide. Other sources put its earnings at $2 million,[49] which may suggest the higher figure is the worldwide rental, given the confusion over international figures during this period.[50]\\r\\nONThe figure for It Happened One Night is not truly representative of its success: it was distributed as a package deal along with more than two dozen other Columbia films, and the total earnings were averaged out; the true gross would have been much higher.\\r\\nS7Snow White's $418 million global cume omits earnings outside of North America from 1987 onwards.\\r\\nGWIt is not absolutely clear how much Gone with the Wind earned from its initial release. Contemporary accounts often list it as earning $32 million in North American rentals and retrospective charts have often duplicated this claim; however, it is likely this was the worldwide rental figure. Trade journals would collate the data by either obtaining it from the distributors themselves, who were keen to promote a successful film, or by surveying theaters and constructing an estimate. Distributors would often report the worldwide rental since the higher figure made the film appear more successful, while estimates were limited to performance in North America; therefore it was not unusual for worldwide and North American rentals to be mixed up. Following the outbreak of World War II, many of the foreign markets were unavailable to Hollywood so it became standard practice to just report on North American box-office performance.[50] In keeping with this new approach, the North American rental for Gone with the Wind was revised to $21 million in 1947 ($11 million lower than the previous figure),[51] and as of 1953following the 1947 re-releaseVariety was reporting earnings of $26 million.[52] Through 1956, MGM reported cumulative North American earnings of $30,015,000 and foreign earnings of $18,964,000, from three releases.[53] Worldwide rentals of $32 million from the initial release is consistent with the revised figures and later reported worldwide figures: they indicate that the film earned $21 million in North America and $11 million overseas from the initial release, and added a further $9 million in North America and $8 million overseas from subsequent re-releases up to 1956.\\r\\nMDMom and Dad does not generally feature in 'high-gross' lists such as those published by Variety due to its independent distribution. Essentially belonging to the exploitation genre, it was marketed as an educational sex hygiene film in an effort to circumvent censorship laws. Falling foul of the Motion Picture Production Code, Mom and Dad was prevented from obtaining mainstream distribution and restricted to independent and drive-in theaters. It was the biggest hit of its kind, and remained in continual distribution until the 1970s when hardcore pornography eventually took over. At the end of 1947 it had earned $2 million, and by 1949, $8 million; by 1956 it had earned $22 million in rentals, representing a gross of $80 million, and would have easily placed in the top ten films in the late 1940s and early 1950s. Estimates of its total earnings are as high as $100 million.\\r\\nUNChopra-Gant stipulates that the figure given for Unconquered is for North American box-office, but as was common at the time, the chart confuses worldwide and North American grosses. Other sources state that the takings for Forever Amber ($8 million) and Life with Father ($6.5 million)[54] were in fact worldwide rental grosses, so it is possible this is also true of Unconquered.\\r\\nCIThe Cinerama figures represent gross amounts. Since the Cinerama corporation owned the theaters there were no rental fees for the films, meaning the studio received 100% of the box-office gross, unlike the case with most other films where the distributor typically receives less than half the gross. Since Variety at the time ranked films by their US rental, they constructed a hypothetical rental figure for the Cinerama films to provide a basis for comparison to other films in their chart: in the case of This Is Cinerama, the $50 million worldwide gross was reconfigured as a $12.5 million US rental gross; this is exactly 25% of the amount reported by Cinerama, so Variety's formula seemingly halved the gross to obtain an estimate for the US share, and halved it again to simulate a rental fee. Variety's 'rental' amounts are often repeated, but have no basis in the reality of what the films actually earnedthey are hypothetical figures conceived for comparative analysis.[55] All five Cinerama features collectively generated $120 million in worldwide box office receipts.[56]\\r\\nGSVariety put the worldwide rental for The Greatest Show on Earth at around $18.35 million (with $12.8 million coming from the United States[47]) a year after its release; however, Birchard puts its earnings at just over $15 million up to 1962. It is likely that Birchard's figure is just the North American gross rental, and includes revenue from the 1954 and 1960 reissues.\\r\\nSWThe \\"first run\\" Star Wars grosses do not include revenue from the 1997 special-edition releases; however, the figure does include revenue from the re-releases prior to the special editions.\\r\\nHPProduction costs were shared with Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows?ÿ Part 1.\\r\\nAt least ten films have held the record of 'highest-grossing film' since The Birth of a Nation assumed the top spot in 1915. Both The Birth of a Nation and Gone with the Wind spent twenty-five consecutive years apiece as the highest-grosser, with films directed by Steven Spielberg holding the record on three occasions and James Cameronthe current holdertwice. Spielberg became the first director to break his own record when Jurassic Park overtook E.T., and Cameron emulated the feat when Avatar broke the record set by Titanic.\\r\\nSome sources claim that The Big Parade superseded The Birth of a Nation as highest-grossing film, eventually being replaced by Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, which in turn was quickly usurped by Gone with the Wind.[57] Exact figures are not known for The Birth of a Nation, but contemporary records put its worldwide earnings at $5.2 million as of 1919.[58] Its international release was delayed by World War I, and it was not released in many foreign territories until the 1920s; coupled with further re-releases in the United States, its $10 million earnings as reported by Variety in 1932 are consistent with the earlier figure.[59] At this time, Variety still had The Birth of a Nation ahead of The Big Parade ($6,400,000) on distributor rentals andif its estimate is correctSnow White and the Seven Dwarfs ($8,500,000)[60] would not have earned enough on its first theatrical run to take the record;[61] although it would have been the highest-grossing 'talkie',[62] displacing The Singing Fool ($5,900,000).[63] Although received wisdom holds that it is unlikely The Birth of a Nation was ever overtaken by a silent-era film,[64] the record would fall to 1925's Ben-Hur ($9,386,000) if The Birth of a Nation earned significantly less than its estimated gross.[65] In addition to its gross rental earnings through public exhibition, The Birth of a Nation played at a large number of private, club and organizational engagements which figures are unavailable for.[66] It was hugely popular with the Ku Klux Klan who used it to drive recruitment,[67] and at one point Variety estimated its total earnings to stand at around $50 million.[68] Despite later retracting the claim, the sum has been widely reported even though it has never been substantiated.[58] While it is generally accepted that Gone with the Wind took over the record of highest-grossing film on its initial releasewhich is true in terms of public exhibitionit is likely it did not overtake The Birth of a Nation in total revenue until a much later date, with it still being reported as the highest earner up until the 1960s.[66] Gone with the Wind itself may have been briefly overtaken by The Ten Commandments (1956), which closed at the end of 1960 with worldwide rentals of $58ÿ60 million[69][70] compared to Gone with the Wind's $59 million;[71] if it did claim the top spot its tenure there was short-lived, since Gone with the Wind was re-released the following year and increased its earnings to $67 million. Depending on how accurate the estimates are, the 1959 remake of Ben-Hur may also have captured the record from Gone with the Wind: as of the end of 1961 it had earned $47 million worldwide,[72] and by 1963 it was trailing Gone with the Wind by just $2 million with international takings of $65 million,[73] ultimately earning $66 million from its initial release.[74]\\r\\nAnother film purported to have been the highest-grosser is the 1972 pornographic film, Deep Throat. In 1984, Linda Lovelace testified to a United States Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on juvenile justice that the film had earned $600 million;[75] this figure has been the subject of much speculation, since if it is accurate then the film would have made more money than Star Wars, and finished the 1970s as the highest-grossing film. The main argument against this figure is that it simply did not have a wide enough release to sustain the sort of sums that would be required for it to ultimately gross this amount.[76] Exact figures are not known, but testimony in a federal trial in 1976about four years into the film's releaseshowed the film had grossed over $25 million.[77] Roger Ebert has reasoned it possibly did earn as much as $600 million on paper, since mobsters owned most of the adult movie theaters during this period and would launder income from drugs and prostitution through them, so probably inflated the box office receipts for the film.[78]\\r\\nThe Birth of a Nation, Gone with the Wind, The Godfather, Jaws, Star Wars, E.T. and Avatar all increased their record grosses with re-releases. The grosses from their original theatrical runs are included here along with totals from re-releases up to the point that they lost the record; therefore the total for The Birth of a Nation includes income from its reissues up to 1940; the total for Star Wars includes revenue from the late 1970s and early 1980s reissues but not from the 1997 Special Edition; the total for E.T. incorporates its gross from the 1985 reissue but not from 2002; the total for Avataras the current record-holderincludes all its earnings at the present time. Gone with the Wind is represented twice on the chart: the 1940 entry includes earnings from its staggered 1939ÿ1942 release (roadshow/general release/second-run)[79] along with all of its revenue up to the 1961 reissue prior to losing the record to The Sound of Music in 1966; its 1971 entryafter it took back the recordincludes income from the 1967 and 1971 reissues but omitting later releases. The Godfather was re-released in 1973 after its success at the 45th Academy Awards, and Jaws was released again in 1976, and their grosses here most likely include earnings from those releases. The Sound of Music, The Godfather, Jaws, Jurassic Park and Titanic increased their earnings with further releases in 1973, 1997, 1979, 2013 and 2012 respectively, but they are not included in the totals here since they had already conceded the record prior to being re-released.\\r\\nRDistributor rental.\\r\\nIncludes revenue from re-releases. If a film increased its gross through re-releases while holding the record, the year in which it recorded its highest gross is also noted in italics.\\r\\nPrior to 2000, only seven film series had grossed over $1 billion at the box office: James Bond,[89] Star Wars,[90] Indiana Jones,[91] Rocky,[92][93][94] Batman,[95] Jurassic Park[96] and Star Trek.[97] Since the turn of the century that number has increased to over fifty (not including one-off hits such as Avatar, Titanic and Frozen).[98] This is partly due to inflation and market growth, but also to Hollywood's adoption of the franchise model: films that have built-in brand recognition, such as being based on a well known literary source or an established character. The methodology is based on the concept that films associated with things audiences are already familiar with can be more effectively marketed to them, and as such are known as \\"pre-sold\\" films within the industry.[32]\\r\\nThe films in the cross-franchise Marvel Cinematic Universe have collectively grossed the most, amassing over $16 billion at the box office. The Harry Potter films are the highest-grossing series based on a single property, earning nearly $8 billion at the box office (although the Eon James Bond films have earned over $14 billion in total when adjusted to current prices[99]); Harry Potter has also generated at least $3.5 billion in home video revenue,[100] taking total consumer spending on the films to over $11 billion. If ancillary income from merchandise is included, then Star Wars is the most lucrative property;[101] it holds the Guinness world record for the \\"most successful film merchandising franchise\\" and was valued at S19.51 billion in 2012 (approximately $30 billion).[102][103] Only two franchises have had more than three films gross over $1 billion: the Marvel Cinematic Universe with six, and Star Wars with four. The three Avengers films comprise the only franchise where each installment has grossed over $1 billion. Avengers is also the only franchise to have a series average of over $1 billion per film, although the Star Wars, Pirates of the Caribbean, Jurassic Park and Finding Nemo franchises, Harry Potter films, and Peter Jackson's Middle-earth adaptation all average over $1 billion adjusted for inflation.[32][104]\\r\\nThe following list includes the shared universes Marvel Cinematic Universe and DC Extended Universe. Some films in these franchises are grouped both with the MCU or DCEU and with other films featuring the same character(s).[clarification needed]\\r\\n*Canada and U.S. gross only.\\r\\nRDistributor rental.","input":"What's the top grossing film of all time?"},{"output":"Bart Magunda Katureebe","context":"Bart Magunda Katureebe is a Ugandan judge and the Chief Justice of Uganda.[1] He was appointed to that position on 5 March 2015.[2] Before that, he was a justice of the Supreme Court of Uganda.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was born on 20 June 1950, in Rugazi Village, Rubirizi District in the Western Region of Uganda to Yowana Magunda and Virginia Ngonzi.

These were built in various sizes, ranging from the prototype, which measured 1 inch, to the one created in 2007 that is the largest rubber duck in the world.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe creator and designer of the Rubber Duck sculpture is Florentijn Hofman. He is a Dutch public artist who is actively working throughout the whole world. He was born in the Netherlands on April 16, 1977. He finished secondary school in Emmen and went to an art school that is located in Kampen. He mastered in art at Berlin-Weissensee, Berlin. He mostly worked on reproducing objects that we can usually see around us, in a huge size. A characteristic of Florentijn Hofman's work is that he makes objects with things that we see or use often, including laminate flooring and flip-flops. With these sculptures, he wants to make people's lives happier, and become unified. The purpose of his art is to promote the message of healing.[1]\\r\\nThe size of the rubber duck is varied. His largest rubber duck, in Saint Nazaire, was measured, width, length, height of 26x20x32m. The rubber duck in Beijing was 14x15x18m, and the rubber duck in Seokchon lake was 16.5x19.8x16.5m with a weight of 1000?kg. The rubber duck was constructed with more than 200 pieces of PVC. All the pieces of PVC are connected by hand with sewing machines.\\r\\nIn order to make the durability of the rubber duck stronger, they added another piece on top of one layer.[2] On the rubber duck, there is an opening at the back of the body so that architects and staff can perform a body check of the rubber duck. In addition, there is an electric propeller fan in its body so that it can be inflated at any time, in either good or bad weather.[3] The electric propeller fan also keeps the air circulating inside of the rubber duck, so that the air always keeps the shape of the rubber duck sculpture.\\r\\nThe loops that are in the pontoon edges of the rubber duck are connected to the fence of the lake by 16 ropes. These 16 ropes can hold the rubber duck still without it floating away by the waves of the lake water.\\r\\nOn the bottom of the rubber duck, there is a waterproof cable. The waterproof cable gets the energy from a power distribution board near the lake to make the electric propeller fan work.[4]\\r\\nSince 2007, the ducks have been on display in Amsterdam, Baku, Lommel (Belgium), Osaka, Sydney Harbour, Sao Paulo and Hong Kong.[5] It was on display in Pittsburgh as its first US destination,[6] from 27 September 2013 through 20 October 2013. Over 1,000,000 people are reported to have visited the duck in Pittsburgh.[7][8] Its second United States appearance was in Norfolk, Virginia from 17ÿ26 May 2014, floating in The Hague inlet in front of the Chrysler Museum of Art.\\r\\nIn October 2014, The Lotte group of South Korea asked for the giant rubber duck in order to celebrate the opening of the new Lotte World Mall,[9] the country's largest shopping mall that also has a super tall skyscraper, Lotte World Tower, under construction. The tower is located between the Han River and Seokchon Lake where the giant rubber duck is placed.[10][11] However, the duck deflated during the exhibition.[12]\\r\\nIn 2009, while it was on display in Belgium, vandals stabbed Rubber Duck 42 times.[13]\\r\\nHere are the dimensions and location of each duck in order of date:\\r\\nThe duck on display in Hong Kong, from 1 May to 9 June 2013, deflated on 15 May after losing air.[33] It was re-inflated and was again on exhibition on 20 May.[13] It was damaged and deflated again in Taiwan on 2 November after an earthquake, [34] before bursting at Keelung, Taiwan, on 31 December 2013.[35] The duck was reported as having been swept away in recent floods in China.[36] On 30 September 2017, during its exibition in Santiago, the duck accidentally crashed with a sign, tearing a hole on its structure and causing it to deflate.[37]\\r\\nOn 4 June 2013, Sina Weibo, China's most popular microblog, had blocked the terms \\"Today\\", \\"Tonight\\", \\"June 4\\", and \\"Big Yellow Duck\\". If these were searched, a message would appear stating that according to relevant laws, statutes and policies, the results of the search could not be shown. The censorship occurred because a photoshopped version of Tank Man, which swapped all tanks with this sculpture, had been circulating around Twitter.[38]\\r\\nIn 1992, a Chinese cargo ship travelling from Hong Kong to Tacoma lost 350 containers overboard during a storm. Among the lost containers were a range of bath toys, including beavers, turtles, frogs and ducks.[39] It is claimed that some 28,800 ducks were released into the ocean and they have been travelling around the world for at least a decade.[40] While Hofman is aware of this news item, it isn't clear if it formed part of the origin story for his duck sculpture or not.[4]\\r\\nIn an interview in Chengdu, Hofman stated that his initial inspiration for Rubber Duck came when he was visiting a museum in 2001. He then searched to find what he considered the perfect toy duck and settled on a design by a Hong Kong company, Tolo Toys: \\"And I went to the shops, for weeks, to find the most perfect rubber duck, and that was [it].

Sculptor Gutzon Borglum created the sculpture's design and oversaw the project's execution from 1927 to 1941 with the help of his son, Lincoln Borglum.[2][3] Mount Rushmore features 60-foot (18?m) sculptures of the heads of four United States presidents: George Washington (1732ÿ1799), Thomas Jefferson (1743ÿ1826), Theodore Roosevelt (1858ÿ1919), and Abraham Lincoln (1809ÿ1865).[4] The memorial park covers 1,278.45 acres (2.00?sq?mi; 5.17?km2)[5] and is 5,725 feet (1,745?m) above sea level.[6]\\r\\nSouth Dakota historian Doane Robinson is credited with conceiving the idea of carving the likenesses of famous people into the Black Hills region of South Dakota in order to promote tourism in the region. Robinson's initial idea was to sculpt the Needles; however, Gutzon Borglum rejected the Needles because of the poor quality of the granite and strong opposition from Native American groups. They settled on Mount Rushmore, which also has the advantage of facing southeast for maximum sun exposure. Robinson wanted it to feature American West heroes like Lewis and Clark, Red Cloud,[7] and Buffalo Bill Cody,[8] but Borglum decided the sculpture should have broader appeal and chose the four presidents.\\r\\nAfter securing federal funding through the enthusiastic sponsorship of \\"Mount Rushmore's great political patron\\" U.S. Senator Peter Norbeck,[9] construction on the memorial began in 1927, and the presidents' faces were completed between 1934 and 1939. Upon Gutzon Borglum's death in March 1941, his son Lincoln Borglum took over as leader of the construction project. Each president was originally to be depicted from head to waist. Lack of funding forced construction to end in late October 1941.[10]\\r\\nMount Rushmore has become an iconic symbol of the United States, and it has appeared in works of fiction, as well as being discussed or depicted in other popular works. It attracts over two million visitors annually.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOriginally known to the Lakota Sioux as \\"The Six Grandfathers\\",[11] the mountain was renamed after Charles E. Rushmore, a prominent New York lawyer, during an expedition in 1885.[12] At first, the project of carving Rushmore was undertaken to increase tourism in the Black Hills region of South Dakota. After long negotiations involving a Congressional delegation and President Calvin Coolidge, the project received Congressional approval. The carving started in 1927 and ended in 1941 with no fatalities.[13]\\r\\nAs Six Grandfathers, the mountain was part of the route that Lakota leader Black Elk took in a spiritual journey that culminated at Black Elk Peak. Following a series of military campaigns from 1876 to 1878, the United States asserted control over the area, a claim that is still disputed on the basis of the 1868 Treaty of Fort Laramie (see section \\"Controversy\\" below). Among American settlers, the peak was known variously as Cougar Mountain, Sugarloaf Mountain, Slaughterhouse Mountain, and Keystone Cliffs. It was named Mount Rushmore during a prospecting expedition by Charles Rushmore, David Swanzey (husband of Carrie Ingalls), and Bill Challis.[14]\\r\\nHistorian Doane Robinson conceived the idea for Mount Rushmore in 1923 to promote tourism in South Dakota. In 1924, Robinson persuaded sculptor Gutzon Borglum to travel to the Black Hills region to ensure the carving could be accomplished. Borglum had been involved in sculpting the Confederate Memorial Carving, a massive bas-relief memorial to Confederate leaders on Stone Mountain in Georgia, but was in disagreement with the officials there.[15]\\r\\nThe original plan was to make the carvings in granite pillars known as the Needles. However, Borglum realized that the eroded Needles were too thin to support sculpting. He chose Mount Rushmore, a grander location, partly because it faced southeast and enjoyed maximum exposure to the sun. Borglum said upon seeing Mount Rushmore, \\"America will march along that skyline.\\"[16] Congress authorized the Mount Rushmore National Memorial Commission on March 3, 1925.[16]\\r\\nBetween October 4, 1927, and October 31, 1941, Gutzon Borglum and 400 workers[17] sculpted the colossal 60 foot (18?m) high carvings of U.S. presidents George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Theodore Roosevelt, and Abraham Lincoln to represent the first 130 years of American history. These presidents were selected by Borglum because of their role in preserving the Republic and expanding its territory.[16][18] The carving of Mount Rushmore involved the use of dynamite, followed by the process of \\"honeycombing\\", a process where workers drill holes close together, allowing small pieces to be removed by hand.[19] In total, about 450,000 short tons (410,000?t) of rock were blasted off the mountainside.[20] The image of Thomas Jefferson was originally intended to appear in the area at Washington's right, but after the work there was begun, the rock was found to be unsuitable, so the work on the Jefferson figure was dynamited, and a new figure was sculpted to Washington's left.[16]\\r\\nThe Chief Carver of the mountain was Luigi del Bianco, artisan and headstone carver in Port Chester, NY. Del Bianco emigrated to the U.S. from Friuli in Italy, and was chosen to work on this project because of his remarkable skill at etching emotions and personality into his carved portraits.[2][3]\\r\\nIn 1933, the National Park Service took Mount Rushmore under its jurisdiction. Julian Spotts helped with the project by improving its infrastructure. For example, he had the tram upgraded so it could reach the top of Mount Rushmore for the ease of workers. By July 4, 1934, Washington's face had been completed and was dedicated. The face of Thomas Jefferson was dedicated in 1936, and the face of Abraham Lincoln was dedicated on September 17, 1937. In 1937, a bill was introduced in Congress to add the head of civil-rights leader Susan B. Anthony, but a rider was passed on an appropriations bill requiring federal funds be used to finish only those heads that had already been started at that time.[21] In 1939, the face of Theodore Roosevelt was dedicated.\\r\\nThe Sculptor's Studio?ÿ a display of unique plaster models and tools related to the sculpting?ÿ was built in 1939 under the direction of Borglum. Borglum had planned to make a secret room behind the hairline of Abraham Lincoln which was supposed to be a doorway to a chamber originally intended to hold some of America's most treasured documents but was left unfinished due to his death.[22] Borglum died from an embolism in March 1941. His son, Lincoln Borglum, continued the project. Originally, it was planned that the figures would be carved from head to waist,[23] but insufficient funding forced the carving to end. Borglum had also planned a massive panel in the shape of the Louisiana Purchase commemorating in eight-foot-tall gilded letters the Declaration of Independence, U.S. Constitution, Louisiana Purchase, and seven other territorial acquisitions from Alaska to Texas to the Panama Canal Zone.[18] In total, the entire project cost US$989,992.32.[24] Unusually for a project of such size, no workers died during the carving.[25]\\r\\nOn October 15, 1966, Mount Rushmore was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. A 500-word essay giving the history of the United States by Nebraska student William Andrew Burkett was selected as the college-age group winner in a 1934 competition, and that essay was placed on the Entablature on a bronze plate in 1973.[21][26] In 1991, President George H. W. Bush officially dedicated Mount Rushmore.[27]\\r\\nIn a canyon behind the carved faces is a chamber, cut only 70 feet (21?m) into the rock, containing a vault with sixteen porcelain enamel panels. The panels include the text of the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution, biographies of the four presidents and Borglum, and the history of the U.S. The chamber was created as the entrance-way to a planned \\"Hall of Records\\"; the vault was installed in 1998.[28]\\r\\nTen years of redevelopment work culminated with the completion of extensive visitor facilities and sidewalks in 1998, such as a Visitor Center, the Lincoln Borglum Museum, and the Presidential Trail. Maintenance of the memorial requires mountain climbers to monitor and seal cracks annually. Due to budget constraints, the memorial is not regularly cleaned to remove lichens. However, on July 8, 2005, Alfred K?rcher GmbH, a German manufacturer of pressure washing and steam cleaning machines, conducted a free cleanup operation which lasted several weeks, using pressurized water at over 200?F (93?C).[29]\\r\\nThe flora and fauna of Mount Rushmore are similar to those of the rest of the Black Hills region of South Dakota. Birds including the turkey vulture, bald eagle, hawk, and meadowlark fly around Mount Rushmore, occasionally making nesting spots in the ledges of the mountain. Smaller birds, including songbirds, nuthatches, and woodpeckers, inhabit the surrounding pine forests.[30] Terrestrial mammals include the mouse, least chipmunk, red squirrel, skunk, porcupine, raccoon, beaver, badger, coyote, bighorn sheep, bobcat, elk, mule deer, yellow-bellied marmot, and American bison.[30][31] The striped chorus frog, western chorus frog, and northern leopard frog also inhabit the area,[32] along with several species of snake. Grizzly Bear Brook and Starling Basin Brook, the two streams in the memorial, support fish such as the longnose dace and the brook trout.[citation needed] Mountain goats are not indigenous to the region. Those living near Mount Rushmore are descendents of a tribe that Canada gifted to Custer State Park in 1924, which later escaped.[30][33][34]\\r\\nAt lower elevations, coniferous trees, mainly the ponderosa pine, surround most of the monument, providing shade from the sun. Other trees include the bur oak, the Black Hills spruce, and the cottonwood. Nine species of shrubs grow near Mount Rushmore. There is also a wide variety of wildflowers, including especially the snapdragon, sunflower, and violet. Towards higher elevations, plant life becomes sparser.[34] However, only approximately five percent of the plant species found in the Black Hills are indigenous to the region.[35]\\r\\nThe area receives about 18 inches (460?mm) of precipitation on average per year, enough to support abundant animal and plant life. Trees and other plants help to control surface runoff. Dikes, seeps, and springs help to dam up water that is flowing downhill, providing watering spots for animals. In addition, stones like sandstone and limestone help to hold groundwater, creating aquifers.[36]\\r\\nA study of the fire scars present in tree ring samples indicates that forest fires occur in the ponderosa forests surrounding Mount Rushmore around every 27 years. Large fires are not common. Most events have been ground fires that serve to clear forest debris.[37] The area is a climax community. Recent[when?] pine beetle infestations have threatened the forest.[31]\\r\\nMount Rushmore is largely composed of granite. The memorial is carved on the northwest margin of the Black Elk Peak granite batholith in the Black Hills of South Dakota, so the geologic formations of the heart of the Black Hills region are also evident at Mount Rushmore. The batholith magma intruded into the pre-existing mica schist rocks during the Proterozoic, 1.6 billion years ago.[38] Coarse grained pegmatite dikes are associated with the granite intrusion of Black Elk Peak and are visibly lighter in color, thus explaining the light-colored streaks on the foreheads of the presidents.\\r\\nThe Black Hills granites were exposed to erosion during the Neoproterozoic, but were later buried by sandstone and other sediments during the Cambrian. Remaining buried throughout the Paleozoic, they were re-exposed again during the Laramide orogeny around 70 million years ago.[38] The Black Hills area was uplifted as an elongated geologic dome.[39] Subsequent erosion stripped the granite of the overlying sediments and the softer adjacent schist. Some schist does remain and can be seen as the darker material just below the sculpture of Washington.\\r\\nThe tallest mountain in the region is Black Elk Peak (7,242?ft or 2,207?m). Borglum selected Mount Rushmore as the site for several reasons. The rock of the mountain is composed of smooth, fine-grained granite. The durable granite erodes only 1 inch (25?mm) every 10,000 years, thus was more than sturdy enough to support the sculpture and its long-term exposure.[16] The mountain's height of 5,725 feet (1,745?m) above sea level[6] made it suitable, and because it faces the southeast, the workers also had the advantage of sunlight for most of the day.\\r\\nThe Mount Rushmore area is underlain by well drained alfisol soils of very gravelly loam (Mocmount) to silt loam (Buska) texture, brown to dark grayish brown.[40]\\r\\nMount Rushmore has a humid continental climate (Dwb in the K?ppen climate classification). It is inside a USDA Plant Hardiness Zone of 5a, meaning certain plant life in the area can withstand a low temperature of no less than ?20?F (?29?C).[41]\\r\\nThe two wettest months of the year are May and June. Orographic lift causes brief but strong afternoon thunderstorms during the summer.[42]\\r\\nTourism is South Dakota's second-largest industry, and Mount Rushmore is the state's top tourist attraction.[45] In 2012, 2,185,447 people visited the park.[1] In the 1950s and 1960s, Sioux Benjamin Black Elk (son of medicine man Black Elk) was the \\"Fifth Face of Mount Rushmore\\", posing for photographs with thousands of tourists. He became one of the most photographed people in the world.[46]\\r\\nThe ongoing conservation of the site is overseen by the US National Park Service.[47] Physical efforts to conserve the monument have included replacement of the sealant applied originally by Gutzon Borglum, which had proved ineffective at providing water resistance (components include linseed oil, granite dust and white lead). A modern silicone replacement was used, disguised with granite dust.\\r\\nIn 1998, electronic monitoring devices were installed to track movement in the topology of the sculpture to an accuracy of 3?mm. The site has been subsequently digitally recorded using a terrestrial laser scanning methodology in 2009 as part of the international Scottish Ten project, providing a record of unprecedented resolution and accuracy to inform the conservation of the site. This data was made accessible online to be freely used by the wider community to aid further interpretation and public access.[48]\\r\\nThe United States seized the area from the Lakota tribe after the Great Sioux War of 1876. The Treaty of Fort Laramie from 1868 had previously granted the Black Hills to the Lakota in perpetuity. Members of the American Indian Movement led an occupation of the monument in 1971, naming it \\"Mount Crazy Horse\\". Among the participants were young activists, grandparents, children and Lakota holy man John Fire Lame Deer, who planted a prayer staff atop the mountain. Lame Deer said the staff formed a symbolic shroud over the presidents' faces \\"which shall remain dirty until the treaties concerning the Black Hills are fulfilled.\\"[49]\\r\\nIn 2004, the first Native American superintendent of the park, Gerard Baker, was appointed. Baker has stated that he will open up more \\"avenues of interpretation\\", and that the four presidents are \\"only one avenue and only one focus.\\"[50]\\r\\nThe Crazy Horse Memorial is being constructed elsewhere in the Black Hills to commemorate the famous Native American leader as a response to Mount Rushmore. It is said to be larger than Mount Rushmore and has the support of Lakota chiefs; the Crazy Horse Memorial Foundation has rejected offers of federal funds. However, this memorial is likewise the subject of controversy, even within the Native American community.[51]\\r\\nBecause of its fame as a monument, Mount Rushmore has been depicted in multiple places in popular culture. It is often depicted as a cover for a secret location; shown with faces removed or modified (as in Superman II), or added; or parodied. Trey Parker and Matt Stone used the location as the headquarters for their movie Team America: World Police. The memorial was also famously used as the location of the climactic chase scene in Alfred Hitchcock's 1959 movie North by Northwest.[52]\\r\\nOn August 11, 1952, the U.S. Post Office issued the Mount Rushmore Memorial commemorative stamp on the 25th anniversary of the dedication of the Mt. Rushmore National Memorial in the Black Hills of South Dakota.[53] On January 2, 1974, a 26-cent airmail stamp depicting the monument was also issued.[54]\\r\\nNotes\\r\\nFurther reading","input":"When was mt. rushmore built and finished?"},{"output":"July 4, 1827","context":"Historically, the enslavement of overwhelmingly African people in the United States, began in New York as part of the Dutch slave trade. The Dutch West India Company imported 11 African slaves to New Amsterdam in 1626, with the first slave auction being held in New Amsterdam in 1655. The last slaves were freed on July 4, 1827, although many black New Yorkers continued to serve as bound apprentices to their mothers' masters.[1]\\r\\nThe British expanded the use of slavery, and in 1703, more than 42 percent of New York City households held slaves, often as domestic servants and laborers. This was the second-highest proportion of any city in the colonies after Charleston, South Carolina.[2] Others worked as artisans or in shipping and various trades in the city. Slaves were also used in farming on Long Island and in the Hudson Valley, as well as the Mohawk Valley.\\r\\nDuring the American Revolutionary War, the British troops occupied New York City in 1776. The Crown promised freedom to slaves who left rebel masters, and thousands moved to the city for refuge with the British. By 1780, 10,000 blacks people lived in New York. Many were slaves who had escaped there from slaveholders in North and South.[clarification needed] After the war, 3,000 slaves were evacuated with the British, most being taken to Nova Scotia for freedom.\\r\\nWhen Vermont asserted its independence from both New York and New Hampshire, it abolished slavery within its territory.\\r\\nAfter the American Revolution, the New York Manumission Society was founded in 1785 to work for the abolition of slavery and for aid to free blacks. The state passed a 1799 law for gradual abolition; after that date, children born to slave mothers were free but required to work for the mother's master for an extended period as indentured servants into their late twenties. Existing slaves kept their status. All remaining slaves were finally freed on July 4, 1827.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChattel slavery in the geographical area of the present-day U.S. state of New York began in 1626, when 11 Africans were unloaded into New Amsterdam harbor from a ship of the Dutch West India Company. Before this time, the company had tried to encourage Dutch agricultural laborers to immigrate to and populate New Netherlands. This experiment was unsuccessful, as most immigrants wanted to accrue greater income in the lucrative fur trade and return to their home country in luxury.\\r\\nThe lack of workers in the colony led to the company's reliance on African slaves. While the slaves laid the foundations of the future New York, they were described by the Dutch as \\"proud and treacherous\\", a stereotype for African-born slaves.[3] The Dutch West India Company relaxed its monopoly and allowed New Netherlanders to ship slaves back to Angola. They began to import more numerous \\"seasoned\\" African slaves from the sugar colonies of the Caribbean.\\r\\nBy 1644, some slaves had earned a half-freedom in New Amsterdam and were able to earn wages. They had other rights in the commercial economy, and intermarriage with whites was frequent.[4] According to the principle of partus sequitur ventrem adopted from southern colonies, children born to enslaved women were considered born into slavery, regardless of the ethnicity or status of the father.[3]\\r\\nThe company turned to slavery, which was already well established in the Dutch colonies in the Caribbean, Southeast Asia, and Southern Africa. For more than two decades after the first shipment, the Dutch West India Company was dominant in the importation of slaves from the coasts of West and Central Africa. While the majority of slaves were sent to the sugar plantations of the Dutch colonies in the Caribbean, a number of slaves were imported directly from the company's stations in Angola to New Netherlands. They were used to clear forests, lay roads, and provide other heavy work and public services to the colony.\\r\\nThese first 11 slaves in New Netherland ÿ owned by the Dutch East Indies Company ( called the VOC ) ÿ were to experience a life different from other slaves in other colonies. By definition, they were owned by a master, could not leave their master, and could be bought and sold. This is different than an indentured servant who may have chosen to \\"indenture\\" themselves. This is usually when the indentured servant contracts themselves to a master for a specific length of time, after which they would be free to lead their own lives. Slaves do not have contracts, only their master determines when they will be freed. These first 11 slaves were \\"originally captured by the Portuguese along the West African coast and on the islands in the Gulf of Guinea...\\" They were on a Spanish slave ship which would transport them to the West Indies when the VOC's navy had taken them as prizes. Many of the original New Netherland slaves have Iberian (Portuguese) names. They were given living quarters 5 miles north of the town of New Amsterdam, after which they were moved to a large building at the southern end of William Street next to the fort. \\"The men were employed as field hands by the Company, as well as in building and road construction and other public works projects.\\" Women were placed as domestic servants in company official's homes. \\"Their servitude was involuntary and unremunerated,...\\" These and other slaves that followed had certain basic rights. These basic rights are related to the freedoms and rights the Dutch people in both the Netherlands in Europe and New Netherland in America enjoyed. Slaves had the right to: marry, have children, and could hire themselves out to work and earn wages during their free time. They could own \\"moveable\\" property such as pots, pans, clothes, etc., but not real estate. They could raise their own crops and animals on VOC land. But most importantly they were trusted in ways other colonies did not trust slaves. For instance, Slaves could suit another person whether white or black. Also, \\"They could bring suit in court and their testimony would convict free whites.\\" The right of litigation, \\"On December 9, 1638, a slave known as Anthony the Portuguese sued a white merchant, Anthony Jansen from Salee, and was award reparations for damages caused to his hog by the defendant's dog. In the following year Pedro Negretto successfully sued an Englishman, John Seales, for wages due for tending hogs. Manuel de Reus, a servant of the Director General Willem Kieft, granted a power of attorney to the commas at Fort Orange to collect fifteen guilders in back wages for him from Hendrick Fredricksz.\\" Unique to this colony was how punishment could be given to a Slave. In this case he was suited, \\"...in 1639 a white merchant Jan Jansen Damen, sued Little Manuel (sometimes called Manuel Minuit) and was in turn sued by Manuel de Reus; both cases were settled out of court.\\"\\r\\nThese first 11 slaves and several others experienced something that was not common. The Dutch had a system for leaving slavery with three parts; Slavery, Half-Slave and Freedmen. These 11 slaves were granted partial and then full freedom. \\"The reasons given by Director General Kieft and the Council [who also represented the VOC] include service to the company for 18 or 19 years, a long-standing promise of freedom, 'also, that they are burdened with many children, so that it will be impossible for them to support their wives and children as they have been accustomed to in the past if they must continue in the honorable Company's service.'\\" This concept of \\"that the longer one has served, the more deserving he is of freedom\\", is compared to the standard of \\"a lifetime of servitude\\". Additionally, there was a sense of \\"Quality of life\\", that even a slave's child had a right to a certain standard of living was unique to the New Netherland colony. Enough so that it allowed a parent to move from slave status to half-slave or even freemen. Half-Slaves still worked for their masters when called upon, but could buy land and a home and they would now earn a wage for the work they did for their master, provided good behavior. However, there were no regulations associated with this idea. It was only practiced. Once these 11 received half-slave status, several more slaves did too. This is reflected in land grant records. Some became half-slave while others were granted freedom. After the English seized New Amsterdam in 1664, in a rush right before the English officially took over, all former slaves that were granted half-slave status were freed, so to keep the promises given to them and that the English would not keep them enslaved. The new freemen also had their original land grants finalized and all grants were officially marked as being owned by the new freemen. Freedom and land grants were given to both freed male and female former slaves. Roughly 40 slaves received their freedom prior to the English take over. Freedmen of New Amsterdam, New York State Library, Peter R. Christoph.\\r\\nIn 1664, the English took over New Amsterdam and the colony. They continued to import slaves to support the work needed. Enslaved Africans performed a wide variety of skilled and unskilled jobs, mostly in the burgeoning port city and surrounding agricultural areas. In 1703 more than 42% of New York City's households held slaves, a percentage higher than in the cities of Boston and Philadelphia, and second only to Charleston in the South.[2]\\r\\nIn 1708 the New York Colonial Assembly passed a law entitled \\"Act for Preventing the Conspiracy of Slaves\\" which proscribed a death sentence for any slave who murdered or attempted to murder his or her master. This law, one of the first of its kind in Colonial America, was in part a reaction to the murder of William Hallet III and his family in Newtown (Queens).[5]\\r\\nIn 1711 a formal slave market was established at the end of Wall Street on the East River and it operated until 1762.[6]\\r\\nAs in other slaveholding societies, the city was swept by periodic fears of slave revolt. Incidents were misinterpreted under such conditions. In what was called the New York Conspiracy of 1741, city officials believed a revolt had started. Over weeks, they arrested more than 150 slaves and 20 white men, trying and executing several, in the belief they had planned a revolt. Historian Jill Lepore believes whites unjustly accused and executed many blacks in this event.[7]\\r\\nIn 1991, the remains of 400 Africans from the colonial era were uncovered during excavation for the Foley Square Courthouse in Lower Manhattan. Construction was delayed so the site and some of the remains could be appropriately evaluated by archeologists and anthropologists. Scholars have estimated that 15,000 to 20,000 enslaved Africans and African Americans were buried during the 17th and 18th centuries in the cemetery in lower Manhattan, making it the largest colonial cemetery for Africans in North America.\\r\\nThis discovery demonstrated the large-scale importance of slavery and African Americans to New York and national history and economy. The African Burial Ground has been designated as a National Historic Landmark and a National Monument for its significance. A memorial and interpretive center for the African Burial Ground have been created to honor those buried and to explore the many contributions of African Americans and their descendants to New York and the nation.[8] These sites opened in 2007, followed by a Visitor Center in 2010.\\r\\nAfrican Americans fought on both sides in the American Revolution. Many slaves chose to fight for the British, as they were promised freedom by General Carleton in exchange for their service. After the British occupied New York City in 1776, slaves escaped to their lines for freedom. The black population in New York grew to 10,000 by 1780, and the city became a center of free blacks in North America.[4] The fugitives included Deborah Squash and her husband Harvey, slaves of George Washington, who escaped from his plantation in Virginia and reached freedom in New York.[4]\\r\\nIn 1781 the state of New York offered slaveholders a financial incentive to assign their slaves to the military, with the promise of freedom at war's end for the slaves. In 1783, black men made up one-quarter of the rebel militia in White Plains, who were to march to Yorktown, Virginia for the last engagements.[4]\\r\\nBy the Treaty of Paris (1783), the United States required that all American property, including slaves, be left in place, but General Guy Carleton followed through on his commitment to the freedmen. When the British evacuated from New York, they took 3,000 freedmen with them for resettlement, mostly in Nova Scotia and other colonies.[4] A joint board of enquiry at Fraunces Tavern failed to find evidence of enslavement for most of the Negroes who had fought in the King's cause.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe Book of Negroes lists the 3,000 Black Loyalists who left with the British in 1783 to resettle in Nova Scotia (now Maritime Canada), England, and other parts of the British Empire. With British support, in 1793 a large group of these Black Britons moved on from Nova Scotia to create an independent colony in Sierra Leone to escape discrimination and other conditions in Canada. They were the ancestors of the Krios, Sierra Leone Creole people.\\r\\nIn the aftermath of the Revolution, men assessed slavery against the revolutionary ideals and many, in the North especially, increased their support for abolitionism. In 1781, the state legislature voted to free those slaves who had fought with the rebels during the Revolution. Abolition was not achieved for several years, but the legislature passed a law making the process of manumission easier, and numerous slaveholders individually freed their slaves.\\r\\nThe New York Manumission Society was founded in 1785, and worked to prohibit the international slave trade and to achieve abolition. It established the African Free School in New York City, the first formal educational institution for blacks in North America. It served both free blacks and the children of slaves. The school expanded to seven locations and produced some brilliant alumni, who advanced to higher education and prominent careers. These included James McCune Smith, who gained his medical degree with honors at the University of Glasgow after being denied admittance to two New York colleges. He returned to practice in New York and also published numerous articles in medical and other journals.[4]\\r\\nBy 1790 one in three blacks in New York state were free. Especially in areas of concentrated population, such as New York City, they organized as an independent community, with their own churches, benevolent and civic organizations, and businesses that catered to their interests.[4]\\r\\nSteps toward abolition of slavery accumulated, but the legislature also took steps back. Slavery was important economically, both in New York City and in agricultural areas. In 1799, the legislature passed a law for gradual abolition. It declared children of slaves born after July 4, 1799, to be legally free, but the children had to serve an extended period of indentured servitude: to the age of 28 for males and to 25 for females. Slaves born before that date were redefined as indentured servants but essentially continued as slaves for life.[9]\\r\\nAfrican Americans' participation as soldiers in defending the state during the War of 1812 added to public support for their full rights to freedom. In 1817, the state freed all slaves born before July 4, 1799 (the date of the gradual abolition law), to be effective in 1827. It continued with the indenture of children born to slave mothers until their 20s, as noted above.[9] On July 4, 1827, the African-American community celebrated final emancipation in the state with a long parade through New York City.\\r\\nNew York residents were less willing to give blacks equal voting rights. By the constitution of 1777, voting was restricted to free men who could satisfy certain property requirements for value of real estate. This property requirement disfranchised poor men among both blacks and whites. The reformed Constitution of 1821 conditioned suffrage for black men by maintaining the property requirement, which most could not meet, so effectively disfranchised them. The same constitution eliminated the property requirement for white men and expanded their franchise.[9] No women yet had the vote in New York. \\"As late as 1869, a majority of the state's voters cast ballots in favor of retaining property qualifications that kept New York's polls closed to many blacks. African-American men did not obtain equal voting rights in New York until ratification of the Fifteenth Amendment in 1870.\\"[9]\\r\\nIt is often overlooked how much of a role African Americans had in the movement from slavery to freedom[citation needed], as well as how powerful they were in establishing their own community. The emancipation of slavery in New York was a slow, complicated, and dramatic change of law that significantly affected lives of African Americans and their families. In New York, Black abolitionists began to fight for themselves and plead their cause. Although often overlooked, African-American abolitionists heavily contributed to the gradual abolition of slavery in New York. The fight for their own people helped make the fight for freedom and equality even stronger and more powerful, changing New York and its society. African Americans played a great role in the abolishment of slavery in New York, and once free from slavery, blacks worked through many hardships in order to establish their own community. Through documentation of the abolitionists in the 1800s, as well as laws passed in that period, one can see the fight and dedication put into the effort of emancipation as well as rebuilding the black community as its own. Many times, it is forgotten that there were blacks that contributed to the change during and after the gradual abolition of slavery. It is crucial to note that both white and black protagonists hated slavery and fought for emancipation, but that the struggle was much more personal for blacks. African Americans wanted freedom just as much as the next person, and fought long and hard in order to have it. In New York, after they finally succeeded in 1827, many blacks from Brooklyn needed to start their own community, bringing a new vigilance to the community. Very often, the perspective of gradual abolition was very different for African Americans than whites. Nonetheless, the abolitionists all wanted the same thing: an end to slavery. Often, Blacks are overlooked as abolitionists. It is true, however, that African-American protagonists heavily helped not only the emancipation of slavery, but the notion of being taken seriously by the community.\\r\\nBecause of the gradual abolition laws, there were children still enslaved when their parents were free.[10] This caused an uprise in passion, and lead to the upbringing of more African-American anti-slavery activists.[10]\\r\\nFreedom, of course, did not happen as quickly as a day or two, and neither did the establishment of a new life. The fight for freedom was a long and hard fight, and once free, there was still a long process ahead in order establish a community of their own for black citizens.\\r\\nThe founding in New York City of the Freedom's Journal, the nation's first African-American journal in the New York Newspaper, published just months previous to the celebration of July 4, 1827, showed what the new times were holding for America as well as new stresses and demands.[11] Samuel Cornish and John Russwurm were editors of the journal and used it to control as much as they could.[11] The powerful words published spread rapid positive influence to African Americans who could help establish a newly-found community. The emergence of an African-American-authored journal in a white newspaper was a very important movement in New York. Many blacks were less educated than whites and it proved their capability of being educated.[12]\\r\\nWhite newspapers visually exposed racism and mockery in the publication of a \\"Bobalition\\" print series, which was fictional and corrupt. This was made in mockery of blacks, in that this was the way an uneducated colored person would pronounce abolition.[13]","input":"When did slavery end in new york state?"},{"output":"Leonard Wood","context":"SpanishÿAmerican War\\r\\nThe Rough Riders was a nickname given to the 1st United States Volunteer Cavalry, one of three such regiments raised in 1898 for the SpanishÿAmerican War and the only one of the three to see action. The United States Army was small and understaffed in comparison to its status during the American Civil War roughly thirty years prior. As a measure towards rectifying this situation President William McKinley called upon 125,000 volunteers to assist in the war efforts.[1] The regiment was also called \\"Wood's Weary Walkers\\" in honor of its first commander, Colonel Leonard Wood. This nickname served to acknowledge that despite being a cavalry unit they ended up fighting on foot as infantry.\\r\\nWood's second in command was former Assistant Secretary of the Navy, Theodore Roosevelt, a man who had pushed for American involvement in the Cuban War of Independence. When Colonel Wood became commander of the 2nd Cavalry Brigade, the Rough Riders then became \\"Roosevelt's Rough Riders.\\" That term was familiar in 1898, from Buffalo Bill who called his famous western show \\"Buffalo Bill's Wild West and Congress of Rough Riders of the World.\\" The Rough Riders were mostly made of college athletes, cowboys, ranchers, miners, and other outdoorsmen. With these men being from southwestern ranch country, they were quite skilled in horsemanship.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe volunteers were gathered in four areas: Arizona, New Mexico, Oklahoma and Texas. They were gathered mainly from the southwest because the hot climate region that the men were used to was similar to that of Cuba where they would be fighting. \\"The difficulty in organizing was not in selecting, but in rejecting men.\\"[2]:5 The allowed limit set for the volunteer cavalry men was promptly met. They gathered a diverse bunch of men consisting of cowboys, gold or mining prospectors, hunters, gamblers, Native Americans and college boysall of whom were able-bodied and capable on horseback and in shooting. Among these men were also police officers and military veterans who wished to see action again, most of whom had already retired. Men who had served in the regular army during campaigns against Native Americans or during the Civil War would serve as higher ranking officers,[2]:10 since they already had the knowledge and experience to lead and train the men. The unit thus would not be without experience. Leonard Wood, an Army doctor who served as the medical adviser for both the President and Secretary of War, was appointed colonel of The Rough Riders, with Roosevelt serving as lieutenant colonel.[3] One particularly famous spot where volunteers were gathered was in San Antonio, Texas, at the Menger Hotel Bar. The bar is still open and serves as a tribute to the Rough Riders, containing much of their, and Theodore Roosevelt's, uniforms and memorabilia.[4]\\r\\nBefore training began, Lieutenant Colonel Roosevelt used his political influence as Assistant Secretary of the Navy to ensure that his volunteer regiment would be properly equipped to serve as any regular Army unit. The Rough Riders were armed with Model 1896 Carbines in caliber .30 US (i.e. 30-40 Krag). \\"They succeeded in getting their cartridges, Colt Single Action Army revolvers, clothing, shelter-tents, and horse gear ... and in getting the regiment armed with the KragÿJ?rgensen carbine used by the regular cavalry.\\"[2]:5 The Rough Riders also used Bowie knives. A last-minute gift from a wealthy donor were a pair of modern tripod mounted, gas-operated M1895 ColtÿBrowning machine guns in 7mm Mauser caliber.\\r\\nIn contrast, the uniforms of the regiment were designed to set the unit apart: \\"The Rough Rider uniform was a slouch hat, blue flannel shirt, brown trousers, leggings, and boots, with handkerchiefs knotted loosely around their necks. They looked exactly as a body of cowboy cavalry should look.\\"[2]:22 This \\"rough and tumble\\" appearance contributed to earning them the title of \\"The Rough Riders.\\"\\r\\nTraining was very standard, even for a cavalry unit. They worked on basic military drills, protocol, and habits involving conduct, obedience and etiquette. The men proved eager to learn what was necessary, and the training went smoothly. It was decided that the men would not be trained to use the saber as cavalry often did, as they had no experience with it. Instead, they used their carbines and revolvers as primary and secondary weapons. Although the men, for the most part, were already experienced horsemen, the officers refined their techniques in riding, shooting from horseback, and practicing in formations and in skirmishes. Along with these practices, the high-ranking men heavily studied books filled with tactics and drills to better themselves in leading the others. During times which physical drills could not be run, either because of confinement on board the train, ship, or during times where space was inadequate, there were some books that were read further as to leave no time wasted in preparation for war. The competent training that the volunteer men received prepared them best as possible for their duty. They were not simply handed weapons and given vague directions to engage in a disorderly brawl.[2]:1ÿ22\\r\\nOn May 29, 1898, 1060 Rough Riders and 1258 of their horses and mules made their way to the Southern Pacific railroad to travel to Tampa, Florida where they would set off for Cuba. The lot awaited orders for departure from Major General William Rufus Shafter. Under heavy prompting from Washington D.C., General Shafter gave the order to dispatch the troops early before sufficient traveling storage was available. Due to this problem, only eight of the twelve companies of The Rough Riders were permitted to leave Tampa to engage in the war, and many of the horses and mules were left behind. Aside from Lieutenant-Colonel Roosevelt's first hand mention of deep, heartfelt sorrow from the men left behind, this situation resulted in a premature weakening of the men. Approximately one fourth of them who received training had already been lost, most dying of malaria and yellow fever. This sent the remaining troops into Cuba with a significant loss in men and morale.[5]\\r\\nUpon arrival on Cuban shores on June 23, 1898, the men promptly unloaded themselves and the small amount of equipment they carried with them. Camp was set up nearby and the men were to remain there until further orders had been given to advance. Further supplies were unloaded from the ships over the next day including the very few horses that were allowed on the journey. \\"The great shortcoming throughout the campaign was the utterly inadequate transportation. If they had been allowed to take our mule-train, they could have kept the whole cavalry division supplied.\\"[2]:45 Each man was only able to carry a few days worth of food which had to last them longer and fuel their bodies for rigorous tasks. Even after only seventy-five percent of the total number of cavalry men was allowed to embark into Cuba they were still without most of the horses they had so heavily been trained and accustomed to using. They were not trained as infantry and were not conditioned to doing heavy marching, especially long distance in hot, humid, and dense jungle conditions. This ultimately served as a severe disadvantage to the men who had yet to see combat.[2]:45\\r\\nWithin another day of camp being established, men were sent forward into the jungle for reconnaissance purposes, and before too long they returned with news of a Spanish outpost, Las Guasimas. By afternoon, The Rough Riders were given the command to begin marching towards Las Guasimas, to eliminate opposition and secure the area which stood in the path of further military advance. Upon arrival at their relative destination, the men slept through the night in a crude encampment nearby the Spanish outpost they would attack early the next morning.[6]\\r\\nThe Spanish held an advantage over the Americans by knowing their way through the complicated trails in the area of combat. They predicted where the Americans would be traveling on foot and exactly what positions to fire on. They also were able to utilize the land and cover in such a way that they were difficult to spot. Along with this, their guns used smokeless powder which did not give away their immediate position upon firing as other gunpowders would have. This increased the difficulty of finding the opposition for the U.S. soldiers. In some locations the jungle was too thick to see very far.[6]\\r\\nGeneral Young, who was in command of the regulars and cavalry, began the attack in the early morning. Using long-range, large-caliber Hotchkiss guns he fired at the opposition, who were reportedly concealed along trenches, roads, ridges, and jungle cover. Colonel Wood's men, accompanied by Lieutenant-Colonel Roosevelt, were not yet in the same vicinity as the other men at the start of the battle. They had a more difficult path to travel around the time the battle began, and at first they had to make their way up a very steep hill. \\"Many of the men, footsore and weary from their march of the preceding day, found the pace up this hill too hard, and either dropped their bundles or fell out of line, with the result that we went into action with less than five hundred men.\\"[2]:50 Lieutenant-Colonel Roosevelt became aware that there were countless opportunities for any man to fall out of formation and resign from battle without notice as the jungle was often too thick in places to see through. This was yet another event that left the group with fewer men than they had at the start.\\r\\nRegardless, The Rough Riders pushed forward toward the outpost along with the regulars. Using careful observation, the officers were able to locate where the opposition was hidden in the brush and entrenchments and they were able to target their men properly to overcome them. Toward the end of the battle, Edward Marshall, a newspaper writer, was inspired by the men around him in the heat of battle to pick up a rifle and begin fighting alongside them. When he suffered a gunshot wound in the spine from one of the Spaniards another soldier mistook him as Colonel Wood from afar and ran back from the front line to report his death. Due to this misconception, Roosevelt temporarily took command as Colonel and gathered the troops together with his leadership charisma. The battle lasted an hour and a half from beginning to end with The Rough Riders suffering only 8 dead and 31 wounded, including Captain Allyn K. Capron, Jr. Roosevelt came across Colonel Wood in full health after the battle finished and stepped down from his position to Lieutenant-Colonel.[2]:49-60\\r\\nThe United States had full control of this Spanish outpost on the road to Santiago by the end of the battle. General Shafter had the men hold position for six days while additional supplies were brought ashore. During this time The Rough Riders ate, slept, cared for the wounded, and buried the dead from both sides. During the six day encampment, some men died from fever. Among those stricken by illness was General Joseph Wheeler. Brigadier General Samuel Sumner assumed command of the cavalry and Wood took the second brigade as Brigadier General. This left Roosevelt as Colonel of The Rough Riders.[5]\\r\\nThe order was given for the men to march the eight miles along the road to Santiago from the outpost they had been holding. Originally, Colonel Roosevelt had no specific orders for himself and his men. They were simply to march to San Juan Heights where over one thousand Spanish soldiers held the area and hold position. It was decided that Brigadier General Henry Lawton's division would be the main fighters in the battle while taking El Caney, a Spanish stronghold, a few miles away. The cavalry was to simply serve as a distraction while artillery and battery struck the Spanish from afar. Lawton's infantry would begin the battle and The Rough Riders were to march and meet with them mid-battle. In this way, The Rough Riders were not seen as a critical tool to the United States Army in this battle.[2]:69ÿ70\\r\\nSan Juan Hill and another hill were separated by a small valley and pond; the river ran near the foot of both. Together, this geography formed San Juan Heights. Colonel Roosevelt and The Rough Riders made their way to the foot of what was dubbed Kettle Hill because of the old sugar refinement cauldrons that lay along it.[5] The battle of San Juan Heights began with the firing of the artillery and battery at the Spanish location. Soon after battery-fire was returned and The Rough Riders, standing at the position of the friendly artillery, had to promptly move to avoid shells. The men moved down from their position and began making their way through and along the San Juan River towards the base of Kettle Hill. There they took cover along the riverbank and in the tall grass to avoid sniper and artillery fire that was being directed towards their position, however they were left vulnerable and pinned down. The Spanish rifles were able to discharge eight rounds in the twenty seconds it took for the United States rifles to reload. In this way they had a strong advantage over the Americans. The rounds they fired were 7mm Mauser bullets which moved at a high velocity and inflicted small, clean wounds. Some of the men were hit, but few were mortally wounded or killed.[2]:70ÿ80 Theodore Roosevelt, deeply dissatisfied with General Shafter's inaction with sending men out for reconnaissance and failure to issue more direct orders, became uneasy with the idea of leaving himself and his men sitting in the line of fire. He sent messengers to seek out one of the generals to try to coax orders from them to advance from their position. Finally, the Rough Riders received orders to assist the regulars in their assault on the hill's front. Roosevelt, riding on horseback, got his men onto their feet and into position to begin making their way up the hill. He claimed that he wished to fight on foot as he did at Las Guasimas; however he would have found it difficult to move up and down the hill to supervise his men in a quick and efficient manner on foot. He also recognized that he could see his men better from the elevated horseback, and they could see him better as well.[2]:75 Roosevelt chided his own men to not leave him alone in a charge up the hill, and drawing his sidearm promised nearby black soldiers separated from their own units that he would fire at them if they turned back, warning them he kept his promises. His Rough Riders chanted (likely in jest) \\"Oh he always does, he always does!\\" The soldiers, laughing, fell in with the volunteers to prepare for the assault.[2]:49\\r\\nAs the troops of the various units began slowly creeping up the hill, firing their rifles at the opposition as they climbed, Roosevelt went to the captain of the platoons in back and had a word with him. He stated that it was his opinion that they could not effectively take the hill due to an insufficient ability to effectively return fire, and that the solution was to charge it full-on. The captain reiterated his colonel's orders to hold position. Roosevelt, recognizing the absence of the other Colonel, declared himself the ranking officer and ordered a charge up Kettle Hill. The captain stood hesitant, and Colonel Roosevelt rode off on his horse, Texas, leading his own men uphill while waving his hat in the air and cheering. The Rough Riders followed him with enthusiasm and obedience without hesitation. By then, the other men from the different units on the hill became stirred by this event and began bolting up the hill alongside their countrymen. The 'charge' was actually a series of short rushes by mixed groups of regulars and Rough Riders. Within twenty minutes Kettle Hill was taken, though casualties were heavy. The rest of San Juan Heights was taken within the hour following.\\r\\nThe Rough Riders' charge on Kettle Hill was facilitated by a hail of covering fire from three Gatling Guns commanded by Lt. John H. Parker, which fired some 18,000 .30 Army rounds into the Spanish trenches atop the crest of both hills. Col. Roosevelt noted that the hammering sound of the Gatling guns visibly raised the spirits of his men:\\r\\n\\"There suddenly smote on our ears a peculiar drumming sound. One or two of the men cried out, \\"The Spanish machine guns!\\" but, after listening a moment, I leaped to my feet and called, \\"It's the Gatlings, men! Our Gatlings!\\" Immediately the troopers began to cheer lustily, for the sound was most inspiring.\\"[7][8]\\r\\nTrooper Jesse D. Langdon of the 1st Volunteer Infantry, who accompanied Col. Theodore Roosevelt and the Rough Riders in their assault on Kettle Hill, reported:\\r\\n\\"We were exposed to the Spanish fire, but there was very little because just before we started, why, the Gatling guns opened up at the bottom of the hill, and everybody yelled, \\"The Gatlings! The Gatlings!\\" and away we went. The Gatlings just enfiladed the top of those trenches. Wed never have been able to take Kettle Hill if it hadn't been for Parker's Gatling guns.\\"[9]\\r\\nA Spanish counterattack on Kettle Hill by some 600 infantry was quickly devastated by one of Lt. Parker's Gatling guns recently emplaced on the summit of San Juan Hill, which killed all but forty of the attackers before they had closed to within 250 yards of the Americans on Kettle Hill.[10] Col. Roosevelt was so impressed by the actions of Lt. Parker and his men that he placed his regiment's two 7mm ColtÿBrowning machine guns and the volunteers manning them under Parker, who immediately emplaced themalong with 10,000 rounds of captured 7mm Mauser ammunitionat tactical firing points in the American line.[11]\\r\\nColonel Roosevelt gave a large share of the credit for the successful charge to Lt. Parker and his Gatling Gun Detachment:\\r\\n\\"I think Parker deserved rather more credit than any other one man in the entire campaign...he had the rare good judgment and foresight to see the possibilities of the machine-guns..He then, by his own exertions, got it to the front and proved that it could do invaluable work on the field of battle, as much in attack as in defence.\\"[12]\\r\\nTheodore Roosevelt and the Rough Riders played a key role in the outcome of the SpanishÿAmerican War by assisting the American forces in forming a constricting ring around the city of Santiago de Cuba. The ultimate goal of the Americans in capturing the San Juan Heights (also known as Kettle Hill and San Juan Hill) was to attain a strategic position from which to move downhill and attack Santiago, a strong point for the Spanish military. The Spanish had a fleet of cruisers in port. The United States drove the Spanish cruisers out of their port by taking areas around Santiago and subsequently moving in on the city from multiple directions. Two days after the battle on San Juan Heights, the US navy destroyed Spain's Caribbean cruiser fleet at Santiago Bay. This took a tremendous toll on the Spanish military due to their widespread empire and heavy reliance upon naval capabilities.[13]\\r\\nHowever, the sinking of the Spanish cruisers did not mean the end of the war. Battles continued in and around Santiago. By July 17, 1898, the Spanish forces in Santiago surrendered to General Shafter and the United States military. Various battles in the region continued on and the United States was continuously victorious. On August 12, 1898, the Spanish Government surrendered to the United States and agreed to an armistice that relinquished their control of Cuba. The armistice also gained the United States the territories of Puerto Rico, Guam, and the Philippines. This large acquisition of land elevated the United States to the level of an imperial power. The SpanishÿAmerican War also began a trend of United States intervention in foreign affairs which has lasted to the present day.[13]\\r\\nOn August 14, the Rough Riders landed at Montauk Point on Long Island, New York. There, they met up with the other four companies that had been left behind in Tampa. Colonel Roosevelt made note of how very many of the men who were left behind felt guilty for not serving in Cuba with the others. However, he also stated that \\"those who stayed had done their duty precisely as did those who went, for the question of glory was not to be considered in comparison to the faithful performance of whatever was ordered.\\"[2]:130 During the first portion of the month that the men stayed in Montauk they received hospital care. Many of the men were stricken with Malarial fever (described at the time as \\"Cuban fever\\") and died in Cuba, while some were brought back to the United States on board the ship in makeshift quarantine. \\"One of the distressing features of the Malaria which had been ravaging the troops was that it was recurrent and persistent. Some of the men died after reaching home, and many were very sick.\\"[2]:129 Aside from malaria, there were cases of yellow fever, dysentery and other illnesses. Many of the men suffered from general exhaustion and were in poor condition upon returning home, some twenty pounds lighter. Everyone received fresh food and most were nourished back to their normal health.[2]:129\\r\\nThe rest of the month in Montauk, New York was spent in celebration of victory among the troops. The regiment was presented with three different mascots that represented the Rough Riders: a mountain lion by the name of Josephine that was brought to Tampa by some troops from Arizona, a war eagle named in Colonel Roosevelt's honor brought in by some New Mexican troops, and lastly a small dog by the name of Cuba who had been brought along on the journey overseas. Accompanying the presented mascots was a young boy who had stowed away on the ship before it embarked to Cuba. He was discovered with a rifle and boxes of ammunition and was, of course, sent ashore before departure from the United States. He was taken in by the regiment that was left behind, given a small Rough Riders uniform, and made an honorary member. The men also made sure to honor their colonel in return for his stellar leadership and service. They presented him with a small bronze statue of Remington's \\"Bronco Buster\\" which portrayed a cowboy riding a violently bucking horse. \\"There could have been no more appropriate gift from such a regiment ... most of them looked upon the bronze with the critical eyes of professionals. I doubt if there was any regiment in the world which contained so large a number of men able to ride the wildest and most dangerous horses.\\"[2]:133 After the turning over of their gift, each and every man in the regiment walked by and shook Colonel Roosevelt's hand and bid him a good-bye.[2]:133\\r\\nOn the morning of September 15, 1898, the regimental property including all equipment, firearms and horses were turned back over to the United States government. The soldiers said one last good-bye to each other and the United States First Volunteer Cavalry, Roosevelt's Rough Riders, was disbanded at last. Before they all returned to their respective homes across the country, Colonel Roosevelt gave them a short speech that commended their efforts in the war, expressed his profound pride and reminded them that, although heroes, they would have to integrate back into normal society and work as hard as everyone else. Many of the men were unable to gain their jobs back from when they lost them before leaving for war. Some, due to illness or injury, were unable to work for a long time. Money was donated by a number of wealthier supporters of the regiment and used to supplement the well being of the needy veterans, many of whom were too proud to accept the help.[2]:134ÿ138\\r\\nA first reunion of the Rough Riders was held in the Plaza Hotel in Las Vegas, New Mexico in 1899.[14] Roosevelt, then Governor of New York, attended this event.[15] In 1948, fifty years after the Rough Riders disbandment, the U.S. Post office issued a commemorative stamp in their honor and memory. The stamp depicts Captain William Owen \\"Bucky\\" O'Neill, who was killed in action while leading troop A at the Battle of San Juan Hill, July 1, 1898.[16] The Rough Riders continued to have annual reunions in Las Vegas until 1967, when the sole veteran to attend was Jesse Langdon. He died in 1975.[15]\\r\\nThe last two surviving veterans of the regiment were Frank C. Brito and Jesse Langdon. Brito, from Las Cruces, New Mexico, whose father was a Yaqui Indian stagecoach operator. Brito was 21 when he enlisted with his brother in May 1898. He never made it to Cuba, having been a member of H Troop, one of the four left behind in Tampa. He later became a mining engineer and lawman. He died April 22, 1973, at the age of 96.\\r\\nLangdon, born 1881 in what is now North Dakota, \\"hoboed\\" his way to Washington, D.C., and called on Roosevelt at the Navy Department, reminding him that his father, a veterinarian, had treated Roosevelt's cattle at his Dakota ranch during his ranching days. Roosevelt arranged a railroad ticket for him to San Antonio, where Langdon enlisted in the Rough Riders at age 16. He was the last surviving member of the regiment and the only one to attend the final two reunions, in 1967 and 1968. He died June 29, 1975 at the age of 94, twenty-six months after Brito.\\r\\nJust after the United States entered the war against the Central Powers, the U.S. Congress gave Roosevelt the authority to raise up to four divisions similar to the Rough Riders. Roosevelt immediately selected eighteen officers (including: Seth Bullock, Frederick Russell Burnham, and James Rudolph Garfield) to raise a volunteer infantry division, and began corresponding with Newton D. Baker, Secretary of War. After several months, many more men joined Roosevelt's World War I volunteers, but Baker refused to offer any assistance or guidance to the new unit. Frustrated, Roosevelt telegraphed President Woodrow Wilson requesting his assistance; however, as Commander-in-chief, Wilson refused to make use of the volunteers and Roosevelt disbanded the unit.[17]\\r\\nColonel Theodore Roosevelt and the Rough Riders were popularly portrayed in Wild West Shows such as Buffalo Bill's Wild West and Congress of Rough Riders of the World and in Minstrel shows such as William H. West's Big Minstrel Jubilee. Roosevelt himself had a hand in popularizing the legends of the Rough Riders, recruiting Mason Mitchell, a fellow Rough Rider with theatrical talent, to perform for the Republican State Committee of New York.[18] More than anyone else, William Frederick Cody, better known as Buffalo Bill, can be credited with helping to create and preserve the dramatic myth of the Rough Riders and the American Old West. His extravaganzas glamorized it into an appealing show for Eastern American audiences and helped permanently preserve the legends.","input":"Who were the two leaders of the rough riders?"},{"output":"in the back of a Brown Derby liquor store owned by his father, located in Springfield MO on the road to Table Rock Lake and Branson, Missouri","context":"BPS Direct LLC (doing business as Bass Pro Shops) is an American privately-held retailer of hunting, fishing, camping and related outdoor recreation merchandise, known for stocking a wide selection of gear. Bass Pro Shops supports and sells merchandise for the National Audubon Society.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe majority owner, John Morris, began his career in sporting goods with a fishing section in the back of a Brown Derby liquor store owned by his father, located in Springfield MO on the road to Table Rock Lake and Branson, Missouri. That small fishing department sold homemade bait and worms, proving popular enough that Bass Pro Shops was incorporated in 1971. These homemade baits were so popular that many people wanted the opportunity to buy these when they had returned home. Thus began the Bass Pro Shops catalog, first mailed in 1974. Soon, it became the world's largest mail order sporting goods store.\\r\\nIn 1975, to meet the burgeoning demand for Bass Pro Shops exclusive products, American Rod and Gun was established. Acting as a separate wholesaling entity ARG serves more than 7,000 independently owned retail stores worldwide. In 1977, Bass Pro Shops introduced the first fish-ready complete boat motor and trailer package with the Bass Tracker. In 1984, construction began on the Outdoor World Catalog Showroom in Springfield, Missouri. Big Cedar Lodge opened in 1988 on Table Rock Lake.\\r\\nIn 1995, Bass Pro Shops Sportsman's Warehouse opened in Atlanta, Georgia, its first store outside the state of Missouri. In November 2001, taking advantage of Outdoor World's popularity as a tourist destination, the Wonders of Wildlife museum was opened next door to the store in Springfield.[2][3] The Wonders of Wildlife Museum & Aquarium closed for renovation in 2007. As of October 2016 it is still closed with an expected reopening by the end of the year. Bass Pro Shops has announced that the grand reopening of the Wonders of Wildlife museum will take place on September 21st, 2017. [4]\\r\\nIn 2015, Bass Pro Shops opened a store inside the Memphis Pyramid, a former sports arena and concert venue in Memphis, Tennessee. In addition to the retail store itself, the building houses two restaurants, a bowling alley, a 100-room hotel, an observation deck, and the tallest free-standing elevator in America. At 535,000 sq ft, The Pyramid is Bass Pro's largest store.\\r\\nIn October 2016, Bass Pro Shops announced that they had reached a deal to acquire competitor Cabela's for $5.5 billion. The deal is being financed via preferred equity financing from Goldman Sachs and Pamplona. Goldman Sachs will contribute $1.8 billion towards financing and Pamplona will contribute the remainder for a total commitment of $2.4 billion.[13] The new entity is expected to be formed and in operation in Q1 or Q2 of 2017.[5] The new entity will keep Cabelas base in Sidney and Lincoln, Nebraska. Morris will continue as CEO of the new entity. He will also be the majority shareholder of the new privately held entity. Tommy Milner stressed that the company had reviewed a range of options that would maximize value, with the board choosing to go the route of Bass Pro Shops.\\r\\nBass Pro Shops carries a number of house brands. Among these are:\\r\\nFor the article on the company, see Tracker Marine Group.\\r\\nIn 1978, Bass Pro Shops introduced the Bass Tracker boat, produced by the Tracker Marine Group. Its brands include Tracker Boats, Nitro, Sun Tracker, Tahoe, Fisher, ProCraft, Kenner, Mako Myacht and SeaCraft. These boats are sold in showrooms attached to every Bass Pro Shops store, in stand alone Tracker dealerships, and to independent marine dealers throughout the United States. All Tracker Marine Group boats are manufactured in multiple plants in southern Missouri. Over 400,000 people have purchased Tracker boats since 1978.[2]\\r\\nBass Pro Shops has 94 existing stores in the United States and Canada. The store sizes range from 20,000 square feet (1,900?m2) up to 535,000 square feet (49,700?m2). The largest flagship stores are known as Outdoor World stores. The decor of the stores includes taxidermy mounts native to the local area. All stores have an indoor water feature that showcases fish species that are indigenous to the area. The fish in their tanks are game fish of great size. In some of these aquariums, professional anglers and store pro-staff hold demonstrations showing the use of an artificial bait. They catch the fish in these tanks to show how well the bait works. Bass Pro Shops is also known for its Outdoor Skills Workshops, teaching skills as varied as fly fishing, Dutch oven cooking, archery hunting with an archery range in the store, and GPS navigation. They hold many skills workshops with the top names in the outdoor world.[2]\\r\\nThe Rancho Cucamonga, California Outdoor World store is used for the exterior shots of the fictional \\"Outdoor Man\\" store in the ABC sitcom Last Man Standing, starring Tim Allen, that premiered in 2011. Camera crews have also visited the store several times to film interior shots.[6]\\r\\nBass Pro Shops have several other stores that do not fall under the Outdoor World flagship brand.\\r\\nPrior to the Cabela's acquisition, Bass Pro Shops had several stores under construction.

It showcases almost 1,000 sporting artifacts from the 1600s to today, including some historically significant firearms from the NRA Museum Collection. The museum will host firearms and artwork from the Remington Arms Company factory collection, a multimillion-dollar collection of U.S. military sidearms, engraved Colt revolvers of the American frontier, the guns of Annie Oakley and firearms of U.S. Presidents like Teddy Roosevelt and Dwight Eisenhower.[98]\\r\\nBass Pro Shops and its owner, John Morris, have had a longtime interest in NASCAR racing. The company has sponsored such racers as Dale Earnhardt, Kerry Earnhardt, and Martin Truex Jr. Truex won the 2004 and 2005 Busch Series championships in the No. 8 Bass Pro Shops-sponsored Chevy, and drove the No. 1 Chevy for Earnhardt Ganassi Racing in the Sprint Cup series from 2005 to 2009. He got his first win at Dover International Speedway and finished 11th in the Chase for the Nextel Cup in 2007. While Truex, Jr. renewed with Bass Pro Shops as his main sponsor for three years in 2007. In 2009, he announced he would be leaving Earnhardt Ganassi Racing for Michael Waltrip Racing in 2010. Jamie McMurray, former driver of the Roush Fenway Racing Crown Royal Ford Fusion and who is from Joplin, MO (approx. 60 miles away from the national headquarters in Springfield), replaced Truex, Jr. for the 2010 season.\\r\\nMcMurray won the 2010 Daytona 500 in his first race driving in the Bass Pro Shops-sponsored Chevrolet. He followed that up by winning the 2010 Brickyard 400 at Indianapolis, making him the 3rd driver to win both races in the same season. He also won the 2010 Bank of America 500 at Lowe's Motor Speedway.\\r\\nIn the Xfinity Series, Bass Pro Shops was the main sponsor for the No. 3 car driven by Ty Dillon. Also in the Truck Series, Bass Pro Shops sponsors the No. 32 truck driven by Ryan Truex.[99]\\r\\nBeginning with the 2013 season, Bass Pro Shops signed a multi-year agreement to be the primary sponsor for the No. 14 Stewart-Haas Racing Chevrolet SS driven by three-time Sprint Cup Champion Tony Stewart.\\r\\nBass Pro Shops reunited with Martin Truex Jr. in 2016 to be the primary sponsor of the No. 78 Furniture Row Sprint Cup car at the Daytona 500 and eight more races during the 2016 season.\\r\\nAlso in 2016, Bass Pro Shops became the primary sponsor of the August race at Bristol Motor Speedway, one of the most iconic events in NASCAR.

Teams started training camp no earlier than 15 days before the team's first scheduled preseason game.\\r\\nPrior to the start of the regular season, each team played four preseason exhibition games, beginning on August 10. The preseason began on the evening of August 3 with the 2017 Pro Football Hall of Fame Game, that featured the Dallas Cowboys (represented in the 2017 Hall of Fame Class by owner Jerry Jones) who hosted Arizona Cardinals (represented by former quarterback Kurt Warner). It was televised nationally on NBC.[18] The 64-game preseason schedule ended on August 31; a 65th game, that of the 2017 Texas Governor's Cup, was canceled due to the aftermath of Hurricane Harvey.\\r\\nThe 2017 regular season's 256 games will be played over a 17-week schedule which began on September 7.

In addition to this, Rooney was considered an active and progressive owner in the league's operations, most famously by successfully pushing for the Rooney Rule, an affirmative action policy requiring all NFL franchises to interview persons of color for head coaching vacancies. Concurrently with his role with the Steelers, Rooney also served as United States Ambassador to Ireland from 2009 to 2014.

Sporting goods retailer Sports Authority, which had owned the naming rights to the Broncos' home field since 2011, filed for bankruptcy in March 2016, and liquidated all of their stores.[94] The Broncos bought out the existing naming rights contract with permission from the Delaware District United States bankruptcy court in August 2016.[95] Three months later, the Broncos selected American talent agency WME-IMG to secure a new naming rights partner for their home field,[96] which, to date, still carries the name Sports Authority Field at Mile High.\\r\\nOn January 12, 2017, the San Diego Chargers exercised their option to relocate to Los Angeles as the Los Angeles Chargers. They will be joining the Los Angeles Rams as tenants in their new stadium, Los Angeles Stadium at Hollywood Park in Inglewood, California when that stadium is complete in 2020. For the time being, the Chargers will play at the 30,000 seat StubHub Center in Carson, California, the smallest venue (in terms of number of seats) the league has used for a full season since 1956.[2]\\r\\nOn January 19, 2017, the Oakland Raiders filed paperwork to relocate to Las Vegas, Nevada. The NFL officially approved the Raiders relocation to Las Vegas on March 27. Unlike the Chargers, the Raiders will remain at the OaklandÿAlameda County Coliseum through at least the 2018 season (with the 2019 season to be determined) while Las Vegas Stadium is built, with the team moving to Nevada in 2019 or 2020.[97]\\r\\nThe Los Angeles Rams, who had capped season ticket sales at 55,000 for the 2017 season, announced to have 60,128 spectators in the first home game on week 1. However, reports estimate that spectators only filled a third of the 93,607 seats of the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum.[98] The Los Angeles Chargers did not sell out their week 2 game at the StubHub Center, which was never expanded to 30,000 seats as originally stated and has typically had less than 26,000 fans in attendance.[99] When the StubHub Center is at capacity, the majority of the fans present are of the opposing team.[100]\\r\\nThe Los Angeles teams were not the only ones with visible attendance problems. The San Francisco 49ers reported a Week 3 attendance total that exceeded the capacity of Levi's Stadium, even as wide swaths of empty seats were visible in the stadium throughout the game.[101] This followed similar sparse attendance for the 49ers' home opener.[102]\\r\\nThis is the fourth season under the current broadcast contracts with ESPN, CBS, Fox, and NBC. This includes \\"cross-flexing\\" (switching) Sunday Afternoon games between CBS and Fox before or during the season (regardless of the conference of the visiting team). NBC will continue to air Sunday Night Football, the annual Kickoff game, and the primetime Thanksgiving game. ESPN will continue to air Monday Night Football and the Pro Bowl. NBC will also serve as the broadcaster of Super Bowl LII. This will also be the second and final year of the current Thursday Night Football contract with CBS, NBC, and NFL Network. Along with ESPN's simulcasted Wild Card game on ABC, ESPN announced on May 24, 2017, that the 2018 Pro Bowl will also be simulcast on ABC, marking the return of the Pro Bowl to the network for the first time since 2003.[113] For the first 9 weeks of the regular season, ESPN2 simulcasted ESPN Deportes' Spanish-language Monday Night Football broadcasts. The simulcasts ended after Week 9 due to ESPN2's Monday-night college basketball broadcasts.[114]\\r\\nAlthough never explicitly announced, the league continued the moratorium on its blackout policy, ensuring all games will be televised in the market of their home teams regardless of ticket sales.[115]\\r\\nIn over-the-top rights, Amazon Video acquired non-exclusive streaming rights to the 10 broadcast television Thursday Night Football games for $50 million. These streams will be exclusive to paid Amazon Prime subscribers, in contrast to Twitter, which held the rights to the same package in 2016 and had made those streams free to most of the world.[116][117] This is the final season of the NFL's exclusive mobile streaming contract with Verizon Wireless; the league intends to no longer have a single exclusive partner going forward, citing changes to viewing habits.[118]\\r\\nVerizon Communications acquired international streaming rights to an NFL London Game between the Baltimore Ravens and Jacksonville Jaguars, in a similar arrangement to the 2015 game that was streamed by Yahoo!which was acquired by Verizon in 2017. The game was streamed by Yahoo and other Verizon-owned platforms, including AOL, go90, and Complex.[119][120] NFL Network remains a partner with Twitter for online content, including its new streaming news program NFL Blitz Live.[121][122] The NFL also reached a deal with Facebook in September 2017 to offer video highlights following games, and streaming programs on the service's new Watch platform.[123]\\r\\nThis is also the final season of the NFL's current national radio contract with Westwood One.[124]\\r\\nTwo new international digital rights deals also led to user criticism over their quality of service. In Canada, NFL Sunday Ticket shifted from distribution through television providers to the over-the-top provider DAZN, while in Europe, Deltatre took over European distribution of NFL Game Pass and launched new mobile apps. Both services faced criticism over their streaming quality, while Delatre's app faced criticism for having bugs and initially lacking features seen in the previous version of the platform. The Independent exposed that Deltatre had also issued an internal e-mail instructing its employees to give the apps 5-star reviews. DAZN subsequently announced that it would return to distributing Sunday Ticket through Canadian television providers in addition to their OTT service.[125][126]\\r\\nThe league has sought to reduce the number of standard commercial breaks (media timeouts) on its telecasts from 21 to 16, four in each quarter, with each break extended by one additional 30-second commercial. One particular scenario the league sought to eliminate is the \\"double-up,\\" in which a network cuts to a commercial after a scoring play, then airs the kickoff, and again goes to commercial before play from scrimmage resumes. Under the proposal, the league will allow networks to cut to commercial during instant replay reviews, which it had not been allowed to do before. Commissioner Roger Goodell stated that the changes are being made in an attempt to consolidate downtime between the actual game play so that there are fewer and less noticeable interruptions; he does not expect the changes to have an appreciable impact on the real-time length of a game, which currently clocks in at slightly over three hours.[127]\\r\\nThe NFL will also, as a trial, lift its ban on the broadcast of commercials for distilled spirits during its telecasts. However, they are subject to restrictions; a maximum of four liquor ads may be broadcast per-game, along with two per-pregame and postgame show. These ads may not contain football-related themes or target underage viewers, and must contain a \\"prominent social responsibility message\\".[128][129]\\r\\nTony Romo, who announced his retirement as a player on April 4, 2017, joined CBS, where he replaced Phil Simms as lead color commentator. Simms and Nate Burleson, who comes over from NFL Network, will replace Tony Gonzalez and Bart Scott on CBS's pregame show, The NFL Today.[130][131] Jay Cutler also announced his retirement from professional football on May 5 and was slated to join Fox as a color analyst for its NFL coverage;[132] he later rescinded that announcement in August and joined the Miami Dolphins.[17] Gonzalez will move to Fox, where he will join Fox NFL Kickoff; upon his departure, Gonzalez stated that he wished to pursue opportunities closer to his home in California, rather than travel to New York weekly to appear on CBS. James Lofton, coming over from radio, will replace Solomon Wilcots as a CBS analyst.[133]\\r\\nOn May 31, 2017, it was announced that Mike Tirico would replace Al Michaels on play-by-play on NBC's portion of the Thursday Night Football package, joined by Cris Collinsworth.[134] The NFL had previously required this role to be filled by NBC's lead broadcast team of Michaels and Collinsworth; Tirico called a limited slate of games in 2016, including several NBC-broadcast games as a fill-in for Michaels (who voluntarily took several games off due to the increased number he was calling that season), and as part of a secondary team for selected games the TNF package.[135][136] He will also succeed Bob Costas as the lead studio host for NBC.[137][138] Due to its proximity to the 2018 Winter Olympics (where he is also succeeding Bob Costas as lead host), Tirico will not participate in NBC's Super Bowl LII coverage.[139]\\r\\nBeth Mowins became the second woman to call play-by-play for a national NFL broadcast, following Gayle Sierens in 1987, when she served as play-by-play announcer for the nightcap in ESPN's Week 1 Monday Night doubleheader, with Rex Ryan as her color commentator.[140] In an unusual case of a broadcaster working for two networks in the same season, Mowins also called a regional game for CBS in Week 3, with Jay Feely as her partner.[141]\\r\\n*Note  Late DH matchups listed in table are the matchups that were shown to the largest percentage of the market.","input":"What is the first game in the nfl season?"},{"output":"three to four days","context":"The honey bee life cycle, here referring exclusively to the domesticated Western honey bee, depends greatly on their social structure.\\r\\n\\r\\nUnlike a bumble bee colony or a paper wasp colony, the life of a honey bee colony is perennial.  The three types of honey bees in a hive are: queens (egg-producers), workers (non-reproducing females), and drones (males whose main duty is to find and mate with a queen). Honey bees hatch from eggs in three to four days. They are then fed by worker bees and develop through several stages in the cells.  Cells are capped by worker bees when the larva pupates.  Queens and drones are larger than workers, so require larger cells to develop. A colony may typically consist of tens of thousands of individuals.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile some colonies live in hives provided by humans, so-called \\"wild\\" colonies (although all honey bees remain wild, even when cultivated and managed by humans) typically prefer a nest site that is clean, dry, protected from the weather, about 20 liters in volume with a 4- to 6-cm2 entrance about 3 m above the ground, and preferably facing south or south-east (in the Northern Hemisphere) or north or north-east (in the Southern Hemisphere).\\r\\n\\r\\nDevelopment from egg to emerging bee varies among queens, workers, and drones. Queens emerge from their cells in 15ÿ16 days,workers in 21 days, and drones in 24 days.  Only one queen is usually present in a hive.  New virgin queens develop in enlarged cells through differential feeding of royal jelly by workers.  When the existing queen ages or dies or the colony becomes very large, a new queen is raised by the worker bees.  When the hive is too large, the old queen will take half the hive and half the reserves with her in a swarm. This occurs a few days prior to the new queen hatching. If several queens emerge they will begin piping (a high buzzing noise) signaling their location for the other virgin queens to come fight. Once one has eliminated the others, she will go around the hive chewing the sides of any other queen cells and stinging and killing the pupae. The queen takes one or several nuptial flights. The drones leave the hive when the queen is ready and mate, and mate in turns, dying after doing so. After mating the queen begins laying eggs. A fertile queen is able to lay fertilized or unfertilized eggs.  Each unfertilized egg contains a unique combination of 50% of the queen's genes[1] and develops into a haploid drone. The fertilized eggs develop into either diploid workers or virgin queens if fed royal jelly.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe average lifespan of a queen is three to four years; drones usually die upon mating or are expelled from the hive before the winter; and workers may live for a few weeks in the summer and several months in areas with an extended winter.\\r\\n\\r\\n(Days until emergence)\\r\\n\\r\\n(range: 18ÿ22 days)\\r\\n\\r\\nThe weight progression of the worker egg, larva:\\r\\n\\r\\n[2]","input":"How long does it take bee brood to hatch?"},{"output":"Warren Robinett","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nAdventure is a video game for the Atari 2600 video game console, released in late 1979ÿ1980.[a] In the game, the player controls a square avatar whose quest is to explore an open-ended environment to find a magical chalice and return it to the golden castle.

It took developer Warren Robinett approximately one year to design and code the game, during which time he had to overcome a variety of technical limitations in the Atari 2600 console hardware, as well as difficulties with management within Atari. In this game, he introduced the first widely known video game Easter egg, a secret room containing text crediting himself for the game's creation. Robinett's Easter egg became a tradition for future Atari 2600 titles.\\r\\n\\r\\nAdventure received mostly positive reviews at the time of its release and has continued to be viewed positively in the decades since, often named as one of the industry's most influential titles. It is considered the first action-adventure and console fantasy game, and inspired other titles in the genres. More than one million cartridges of Adventure were sold, and the game has been included in numerous Atari 2600 game collections for modern computer hardware. The game's prototype code was used as the basis for the 1979 Superman game, and a planned sequel eventually formed the basis for the Swordquest games. The Easter egg concept pioneered by the game has transcended video games and entered popular culture.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Adventure, the player's goal is to recover the Enchanted Chalice that an evil magician has stolen and hidden in the kingdom and return it to the Golden Castle.[5] The kingdom includes two other castles (White and Black) and various obstacles and mazes within them. Further, the kingdom is guarded by three dragons: Yorgle (yellow dragon), Grundle (green dragon), and Rhindle (red dragon who moves much faster than the other two), that protect various items in the game and will try to chase and eat the player's avatar.[6] There is also a bat that can roam across the kingdom freely, carrying a single item (which can include the chalice or a dragon) around; the bat was to be named Knubberrub but the name did not make it into the manual.[7] The bat has two states, agitated and non-agitated; when in the agitated state, the bat will either pick up or swap what it currently carries with an object in the present room, eventually returning to the non-agitated state where it will not pick up an object. The bat continues to fly around even if not present on the player's current screen and may continue moving or swapping around objects.[8][9]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe player's avatar is a simple square shape that can move within and between rooms, each represented by a single screen. While Robinett originally intended for all rooms to be bidirectionally connected, a few such connections (including one inside the White Castle) were unidirectional, which he considered to be bugs.  Such problems were explained away as \\"bad magic\\" in the game's manual.[10] The player's goal is to find objects to help defeat the dragons and recover the Chalice. These include various keys that open the castles, a magnet that pulls items towards the player, a magic bridge that the player can use to cross certain obstacles, and a sword which can be used to defeat the dragons.[11] Only one object can be carried at a time. The player can be eaten by a dragon if it is caught in its \\"bite\\" cycle, at which point the avatar is stuck in the dragon's stomach. At this point, the player can opt to restore their avatar's life instead of completely restarting the game, reappearing at the Golden Castle while leaving all objects where they were last left, but this will also regenerate any dragon previously killed as well.[12] The ability to reset the player's avatar without resetting the entire game is considered the first known \\"continue game\\" option in video games.[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe game offers three different skill levels. Level 1 is the easiest, as it uses a simplified room layout missing one of the castles and one of the mazes, and doesn't include the bat and one of the dragons. Level 2 is the full version of the game, with the various objects appearing in set positions at the start of the game. Level 3 is similar to Level 2, but the location of the objects is randomized to provide a more challenging game. In addition, the player can use the difficulty switches on the Atari 2600 to further control the game's difficulty by affecting the behavior of the dragons: one switch controls the dragons' bite speed, and one causes them to flee when the player is wielding the sword.[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nAdventure was published by the developer of the 2600 console, Atari, Inc, and programmed by Atari employee Warren Robinett. At the time, Atari programmers were generally given full control on the creative direction and development cycle for their games, but this required them to plan for their next game as they neared completion of their current one to stay productive.[13] Robinett was finishing his work on Slot Racers when he was given an opportunity to visit the Stanford Artificial Intelligence Laboratory by Julius Smith, one of several friends he was sharing a house with. There, he was introduced to the 1977 version of the computer text game Colossal Cave Adventure, created by Will Crowther and modified by Don Woods. After playing the game for several hours, he was inspired to create a graphical version of the game.[1][13][15]\\r\\n\\r\\nAdventure was named after Colossal Cave Adventure.[16] Robinett began designing the graphics-based game, loosely based on the text game, on a Hewlett-Packard 1611A microprocessor computer around May to June 1978.[17][15] Robinett was aware early on that memory use was going to be critical: Atari 2600 cartridges had room for only 4096 bytes (4 KB) on the cartridge ROM,[8] and 128 bytes for program variables in the 2600's RAM;[18] in contrast, Colossal Cave Adventure took hundreds of kilobytes of memory.[15] The final game used nearly all of the available memory (including 5% of the cartridge storage for Robinett's Easter egg),[19] with 15 unused bytes from the ROM capacity.[15] Robinett credits Ken Thompson, his professor at University of California, Berkeley, with teaching him the skills needed to use the limited memory efficiently. Thompson had required his students to learn the C programming language; Robinett carried techniques from that language into his programming of Adventure.[20]\\r\\n\\r\\nRobinett first identified ways to translate the elements of Colossal Cave Adventure into simple, easy-to-recognize graphics that the player could interact with directly, replacing text-based commands with joystick controls.[13][15] Due to the limitations of the system's graphical hardware, Robinett noted the dragons ended up looking more like ducks.[15] Robinett developed workarounds for various technical limitations of the Atari 2600. The system has only one playfield and five memory-mapped registers available to represent moving objects.  Only two of these registers are capable of representing more complex sprites.  Robinett used those for objects and creatures within the game. He used the register originally designated for the ball in games such as Pong to represent the player's avatar.  Finally, he used the registers assigned for missiles, such as the bullets in Combat, for additional walls in the playing field to be able to represent different rooms within the game with the same playfield.[21][13] Another hardware limitation forces the left and right sides of nearly every screen to be mirror images of each other; this fostered the creation of the game's confusing mazes.[22] The notable exceptions are two screens in the black castle catacombs and two in the main hallway beneath the Yellow Castle. These two hallway screens are mirrored, but contain a vertical \\"wall\\" object in the room in order to achieve a non-symmetrical shape, as well as act as a secret door for an Easter egg.[23]\\r\\n\\r\\nDespite the limitations, Robinett was able to introduce concepts that at the time were unfamiliar to players. He had been able to construct different rooms in the games (thirty in the final version), in days where most games took place only on a single screen.[15] Further, off-screen objects such as the bat would continue to move according to their programming behavior.[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn addition to the technical limitations, Robinett had struggled with Atari's management over the game. Around the time of Adventure's development, Atari, now owned by Warner Communications, had hired Ray Kassar as general manager of their Consumer Division, and he was later promoted to president and CEO of Atari in December 1978. Kassar interacted with the programmers rarely and generally treated their contributions with indifference.[24] Robinett was initially discouraged from working on Adventure by his supervisor, George Simcock, who said the ambitious game could not be done based on knowing how much memory Colossal Cave Adventure used.[13][25][26] When Robinett developed a working prototype within a month, the management at Atari were impressed, encouraging him to continue the game despite his supervisor's initial response.[13][20] The management later tried to convince Robinett to make it a tie-in work for the upcoming Superman movie, which was owned by Warner Communication. Robinett remained committed to his initial idea.[15] Instead, Atari developer John Dunn agreed to take Robinett's prototype source code to make the 1979 Superman game.[13][20]\\r\\n\\r\\nA second prototype, completed near the end of 1978, had only about eight rooms, a single dragon, and two objects, and Robinett recognized that the game, though demonstrating what he had set out to do, was boring. He put the game aside for a few months and came back with additional ideas to improve the game, finishing it by June 1979.[13][25] Two changes that Robinett added were the possibility of being eaten by the dragon, as well as the means to reset the avatar if this should happen, and the addition of the sword object, which could kill the dragon. Robinett found the various possibilities that arose from this combination of elements improved the excitement of the game, and subsequently made three dragons, reusing the same code for the behavior of all three.[13] The magnet was created to work around a potential situation where the player could drop an object into a wall space and make it irretrievable.[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nRobinett worked with Steve Harding, the author for nearly all Atari 2600 game manuals at that point in time, to develop the plot for the game. Harding developed most of the plot after playing the game himself, with Robinett revising elements where he saw fit. Robinett states that he had come up with the names for the three dragons as well as offering a friend's suggestion for \\"Knubberrub\\" for the bat.[13]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nRobinett submitted the source code for Adventure to Atari management in June 1979;[27] he left Atari soon afterward.[15][28] The game was released by Atari some time later, though the exact date is unclear. In a 2003 interview, Robinett recalled the release date as being Christmas 1979 though noted he had left the company by this point and was traveling in Europe at that time, but knew the game had been released worldwide by early 1980. And in fact, early releases of the game cartridge showing only the game modes on the label (also known as the \\"text label\\" version) showed a copyright of 1980 on the bottom.[1][28] A 1979 date is also listed in various other sources.[2][29][30][31] Atari began advertising the game as \\"coming soon\\" in its 1980 catalog,[32] and several sources indicate the game was released that year, after the Atari 2600 version of Space Invaders was released in early 1980.[3][4]\\r\\n\\r\\nGenerally defined as a \\"message, trick, or unusual behavior hidden inside a computer program by its creator\\", the Easter egg concept was popularized by Adventure, influenced by the corporate culture at Atari. Atari removed the names of game developers from their products, seeing it as a means to prevent competitors from identifying and luring away Atari's programmers.[33][24] Atari's decisions led to several programmers leaving the company; notably, David Crane, Larry Kaplan, Alan Miller, and Bob Whitehead all left Atari due to lack of recognition and royalties from the company, and formed Activision.[34]\\r\\n\\r\\nRobinett, as a means to maintain his name on his game, included a hidden message in Adventure identifying himself as the creator,[26] inspired by the supposedly hidden messages left on various songs recorded by The Beatles.[24] In discussing the game in 2015, Robinett considered the message as a means of self-promotion, noting that he had been paid only around $22,000 a year from Atari without any royalties, while Atari would sell a million units of a game at $25 a piece.[15] This secret is one of the earliest known Easter eggs in a video game.[19]\\r\\n\\r\\nWithin Adventure, the Easter egg is accessed by first retrieving the \\"Gray Dot\\" from the black castle catacombs in difficulty levels 2 or 3.[25] The dot is a 1-pixel object which is embedded in the south wall of a sealed chamber accessible only with the bridge, and the player must bounce the avatar along the bottom wall to pick it up. The dot becomes invisible when carried or dropped in most rooms, but is can be seen when in a catacombs passage or when held over a normal wall. The dot is also not attracted to the magnet, unlike all other inanimate objects in Adventure. The player must bring the dot along with two or more other objects to the east end of the corridor below the yellow castle. This causes the barrier on the right side of the screen to blink rapidly, and the player avatar is then able to push through the wall into a new room displaying the words \\"Created by Warren Robinett\\" in text which continuously changes color.[33][35]\\r\\n\\r\\nRobinett kept the Gray Dot and the hidden room a secret for over a year, and did not mention it to anyone at Atari prior to his departure.[24] He was unsure of whether or not it would be discovered by other Atari personnel prior to publishing; the dot was not mentioned in the game's manual, as the manual's author was unaware of the dot's existence.  After the game was released, Adam Clayton, a fifteen-year-old from Salt Lake City, discovered the Dot and sent a letter to Atari explaining how to retrieve it.[24] Robinett had already quit the company by this point, so Atari tasked designers with finding the responsible code. The employee who found it said that if he were to fix it, he would change the message in the game to say \\"Fixed by Brad Stewart\\". Further, the cost of creating a new read-only memory (ROM) mask, or memory chip, was around $10,000 US at the time of the game's release, making this change a costly endeavor.[36][15] Steve Wright, the director of software development of the Atari Consumer Division, argued for retaining the message, believing it gave players additional incentive to find it and play their games more, and suggested these were like Easter eggs for players to find.[24] Atari eventually decided to leave the Dot in-game, and dubbed such hidden features Easter eggs,[37] saying they would be adding more such secrets to later games.[38] Wright made it an official policy at Atari that all future games should include Easter eggs, often limited to being the initials of the game developer.[24]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Easter egg text with Warren Robinett's name was removed from the version on the Atari Classics 10-in-1 TV Games standalone gaming unit, replaced with \\"TEXT?\\"[39] It has been included in most subsequent reissues of the game, however.\\r\\n\\r\\nAdventure received mostly positive reviews in the years immediately after its release and has generally been viewed positively in subsequent decades.\\r\\n\\r\\nNorman Howe reviewed Adventure in The Space Gamer No. 31.[42] Howe commented that \\"Adventure is a good game, as video games are measured. It is neither as interesting nor as complex as Superman, but it shows great promise for things to come. If you have access to the Atari game computer, it is an entertaining cartridge to have.\\"[42]\\r\\n\\r\\nBill Kunkel and Frank Laney in the January 1981 issue of Video magazine called Adventure a \\"major design breakthrough\\" and said that it \\"shatters several video-game conventions\\" such as scoring and time limits. They added that it was \\"much more ambitious\\" than average home video games, but noted that the graphics were underwhelming, such as the hero being a simple square.[43] The 1982 book How to Win at Home Video Games called it too unpredictable with an \\"illogical mission\\", concluding that \\"even devoted strategists may soon tire of Adventure's excessive trial and error.\\"[41] Electronic Games in 1983 stated that the game's \\"graphics are tame stuff\\", but it \\"still has the power to fascinate\\" and that \\"the action adventure concepts introduced in Adventure are still viable today\\".[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nAtari Headquarters scored the game 8 of 10, and noted its historical importance while panning the graphics and sound, concluding that Adventure was \\"very enjoyable\\" regardless of its technological shortcomings.[44]\\r\\n\\r\\nJeremy Parish of 1UP.com wrote in 2010 that Adventure is \\"a work of interpretive brilliance\\" that \\"cleverly extracted the basic elements of exploration, combat and treasure hunting from the text games and converted them into icons\\", but also conceded that it \\"seems almost unplayably basic these days\\".[29]\\r\\n\\r\\nAdventure was included in the popular 2010 book 1001 Video Games You Must Play Before You Die.[45]\\r\\n\\r\\nAtari's Adventure yielded sales of one million copies.[46] As the first action-adventure video game[46] and first console fantasy game,[16] Adventure established its namesake genres on video game consoles.[47] In addition to being the first graphical adventure game on the Atari 2600 console,[8] it is the first video game to contain a widely known Easter egg, and the first to allow a player to use multiple, portable, on-screen items while exploring an open-ended environment, making it one of the first examples, even as small and primitive as it is, of an open world game.[9][48] The game is also the first to use a fog of war effect in its catacombs, which obscures most of the playing area except for the player's immediate surroundings.[49]  The game has been voted the best Atari 2600 cartridge in numerous polls,[9] and has been noted as a significant step in the advancement of home video games.[50] GamePro ranked it as the 28th most important video game of all time in 2007.[51] In 2010, 1UP.com listed it as one of the most important games ever made in its \\"The Essential 50\\" feature.[29] Entertainment Weekly named Adventure as one of the top 10 games for the Atari 2600.[52]\\r\\n\\r\\nA sequel to Adventure was first announced in early 1982. The planned sequel eventually evolved into the Swordquest series of games.[53] In 2005, a sequel written by Curt Vendel was released by Atari on the Atari Flashback 2 system. In 2007, AtariAge released a self-published sequel called Adventure II for the Atari 5200, which is heavily inspired by the original; its name is used with permission from Atari Interactive.[54] Robinett himself took the idea of using items from Adventure into his next game, Rocky's Boots, but added the ability to combine them to form new items.[37]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn both the novel and film versions of Ready Player One, the Easter egg in Adventure is prominently mentioned as the inspiration for a contest to find an Easter egg hidden in the fictional virtual reality game OASIS, and finding the secret room within Adventure is a core plot element within both versions.[55][56]\\r\\n\\r\\nAdventure has been ported to or re-released on several platforms:","input":"Who created the first video game easter egg?"},{"output":"May 1830","context":"Wooden railroads, called wagonways were built in Unites States starting from 1720s. A railroad was reportedly used in the construction of the French fortress at Louisburg, Nova Scotia in 1720. Between 1762 and 1764, at the close of the French and Indian War, a gravity railroad (mechanized tramway) (Montresor's Tramway) is built by British military engineers up the steep riverside terrain near the Niagara River waterfall's escarpment at the Niagara Portage (which the local Senecas called \\"Crawl on All Fours.\\") in Lewiston, New York.\\r\\nRailroads played a large role in the development of the United States from the industrial revolution in the North-east (1810ÿ1850) to the settlement of the West (1850ÿ1890). The American railroad mania began with the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad in 1828 and flourished until the Panic of 1873 bankrupted many companies and temporarily ended growth.\\r\\nAlthough the South started early to build railways, it concentrated on short lines linking cotton regions to oceanic or river ports, and the absence of an interconnected network was a major handicap during the Civil War. The North and Midwest constructed networks that linked every city by 1860. In the heavily settled Midwestern Corn Belt, over 80 percent of farms were within 5 miles (8?km) of a railway, facilitating the shipment of grain, hogs, and cattle to national and international markets. A large number of short lines were built, but thanks to a fast developing financial system based on Wall Street and oriented to railway bonds, the majority were consolidated into 20 trunk lines by 1890. State and local governments often subsidized lines, but rarely owned them.\\r\\nThe system was largely built by 1910, but then trucks arrived to eat away the freight traffic, and automobiles (and later airplanes) to devour the passenger traffic. After 1940, the use of diesel electric locomotives made for much more efficient operations that needed fewer workers on the road and in repair shops.\\r\\nA series of bankruptcies and consolidations left the rail system in the hands of a few large operations by the 1980s. Almost all long-distance passenger traffic was shifted to Amtrak in 1971, a government-owned operation. Commuter rail service is provided near a few major cities such as New York, Chicago, Boston, Philadelphia, Baltimore, and the District of Columbia. Computerization and improved equipment steadily reduced employment, which peaked at 2.1 million in 1920, falling to 1.2 million in 1950 and 215,000 in 2010. Route mileage peaked at 254,251 miles (409,177?km) in 1916 and fell to 139,679 miles (224,792?km) in 2011.[1]\\r\\nFreight railroads continue to play an important role in the United States' economy, especially for moving imports and exports using containers, and for shipments of coal and, since 2010, of oil. According to the British news magazine The Economist, \\"They are universally recognized in the industry as the best in the world.\\"[2] Productivity rose 172% between 1981 and 2000, while rates rose 55% (after accounting for inflation). Rail's share of the American freight market rose to 43%, the highest for any rich country.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA railroad was reportedly used in the construction of the French fortress at Louisburg, Nova Scotia in 1720.[4] Between 1762 and 1764, at the close of the French and Indian War, a gravity railroad (mechanized tramway) (Montresor's Tramway) is built by British military engineers up the steep riverside terrain near the Niagara River waterfall's escarpment at the Niagara Portage (which the local Senecas called \\"Crawl on All Fours.\\") in Lewiston, New York.[5]\\r\\nThe animal powered Leiper Railroad followed in 1810 after the preceding successful experiment  designed and built by merchant Thomas Leiper, the railway connects Crum Creek to Ridley Creek, in Delaware County, Pennsylvania. It was used until 1829, when it was temporarily replaced by the Leiper Canal, then is reopened to replace the canal in 1852. This became the Crum Creek Branch of the Baltimore and Philadelphia Railroad (part of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad) in 1887. This is the first railroad meant to be permanent, and the first to evolve into trackage of a common carrier after an intervening closure.\\r\\nIn 1826 Massachusetts incorporated the Granite Railway as a common freight carrier[6] to primarily haul granite for the construction of the Bunker Hill Monument; operations began later that year.\\r\\nOther railroads authorized by states in 1826 and constructed in the following years included the Delaware and Hudson Canal Company's gravity railroad; and the Mohawk and Hudson Railroad, to carry freight and passengers around a bend in the Erie Canal. To link the port of Baltimore to the Ohio River, the state of Maryland in 1827 chartered the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad (B&O), the first section of which opened in 1830. Similarly, the South Carolina Canal and Railroad Company was chartered in 1827 to connect Charleston to the Savannah River, and Pennsylvania built the Main Line of Public Works between Philadelphia and the Ohio River.\\r\\nThe Americans closely followed and copied British railroad technology. The Baltimore and Ohio Railroad was the first common carrier and started passenger train service in May 1830, initially using horses to pull train cars.[7]:90 The South Carolina Canal and Rail Road Company was the first to use steam locomotives regularly beginning with the Best Friend of Charleston, the first American-built locomotive intended for revenue service, in December 1830.\\r\\nThe B&O started developing steam locomotives in 1829 with Peter Cooper's Tom Thumb.[8] This was the first American-built locomotive to run in the U.S., although it was intended as a demonstration of the potential of steam traction rather than as a revenue-earning locomotive.[7]:96 Many of the earliest locomotives for American railroads were imported from England, including the Stourbridge Lion and the John Bull, but a domestic locomotive manufacturing industry was quickly established, with locomotives like the DeWitt Clinton being built in the 1830s.[9] The B&O's westward route reached the Ohio River in 1852, the first eastern seaboard railroad to do so.[10]:Ch.V\\r\\nBy 1850, 9,000 miles (14,000?km) of railroad lines had been built.[11] The federal government operated a land grant system between 1855 and 1871, through which new railway companies in the uninhabited West were given millions of acres they could sell or pledge to bondholders. A total of 129?million acres (520,000?km2) were granted to the railroads before the program ended, supplemented by a further 51?million acres (210,000?km2) granted by the states, and by various government subsidies. This program enabled the opening of numerous western lines, especially the Union Pacific-Central Pacific with fast service from San Francisco to Omaha and east to Chicago. West of Chicago, many cities grew up as rail centers, with repair shops and a base of technically literate workers.[12]\\r\\nRailroads soon replaced many canals and turnpikes and by the 1870s had significantly displaced steamboats as well.[13] The railroads were superior to these alternative modes of transportation, particularly water routes because they lowered costs in two ways. Canals and rivers were unavailable in the winter season due to freezing, but the railroads ran year-round despite poor weather. And railroads were safer: the likelihood of a train crash was less than the likelihood of a boat sinking. The railroads provided cost-effective transportation because they allowed shippers to have a smaller inventory of goods, which reduced storage costs during winter, and to avoid insurance costs from the risk of losing goods during transit.[14]\\r\\nLikewise, railroads changed the style of transportation. For the common person in the early 1800s, transportation was often travel by horse or stage coach. The network of trails along which coaches navigated were riddled with ditches, potholes, and stones. This made travel fairly uncomfortable. Adding to injury, coaches were cramped with little leg room. Travel by train offered a new style. Locomotives proved themselves a smooth, headache free ride with plenty of room to move around. Some passenger trains offered meals in the spacious dining car followed by a good night sleep in the private sleeping quarters.[15] Railroad companies in the North and Midwest constructed networks that linked nearly every major city by 1860. In the heavily settled Corn Belt (from Ohio to Iowa), over 80 percent of farms were within 5 miles (8.0?km) of a railway. A large number of short lines were built, but thanks to a fast developing financial system based on Wall Street and oriented to railway securities, the majority were consolidated into 20 trunk lines by 1890.[16] Most of these railroads made money and ones that didn't were soon bought up and incorporated in a larger system or \\"rationalized\\". Although the transcontinental railroads dominated the media, with the completion of the First Transcontinental Railroad in 1869 dramatically symbolizing the nations unification after the divisiveness of the Civil War, most construction actually took place in the industrial Northeast and agricultural Midwest, and was designed to minimize shipping times and costs.[17] The railroads in the South were repaired and expanded and then, after a lot of preparation, changed from a 5-foot gauge to standard gauge of 4 foot 8 ? inches in two days in May 1886.[18]\\r\\nWith its extensive river system the United States supported a large array of horse-drawn or mule-drawn barges on canals and paddle wheel steamboats on rivers that competed with railroads after 1815 until the 1870s. The canals and steamboats lost out because of the dramatic increases in efficiency and speed of the railroads, which could go almost anywhere year round. The railroads were faster and went to many places a canal would be impractical or too expensive to build or a natural river never went. Railroads also had better scheduling since they often could go year round, more or less ignoring the weather. Canals and river traffic were cheaper if you lived on or near a canal or river that wasn't frozen over part of the year; but only a few did. Long distance transport of goods by wagon to a canal or river was slow and expensive. A railroad to a city made it an inland \\"port\\" that often prospered or turned a town into a city.[19]\\r\\nRail was strategic during the American Civil War, and the Union used its much larger system much more effectively. Practically all the mills and factories supplying rails and equipment were in the North, and the Union blockade kept the South from getting new equipment or spare parts. The war was fought in the South, and Union raiders (and sometimes Confederates too) systematically destroyed bridges and rolling stock  and sometimes bent rails  to hinder the logistics of the enemy.[20]\\r\\nIn the South, most railroads in 1860 were local affairs connecting cotton regions with the nearest waterway. Most transport was by boat, not rail, and after the Union blockaded the ports in 1861 and seized the key rivers in 1862, long-distance travel was difficult. The outbreak of war had a depressing effect on the economic fortunes of the railroad companies, for the hoarding of the cotton crop in an attempt to force European intervention left railroads bereft of their main source of income.[21] Many had to lay off employees, and in particular, let go skilled technicians and engineers. For the early years of the war, the Confederate government had a hands-off approach to the railroads. Only in mid-1863 did the Confederate government initiate an overall policy, and it was confined solely to aiding the war effort.[22] With the legislation of impressment the same year, railroads and their rolling stock came under the de facto control of the Confederate military.\\r\\nConditions deteriorated rapidly in the Confederacy, as there was no new equipment and raids on both sides systematically destroyed key bridges, as well as locomotives and freight cars. Spare parts were cannibalized; feeder lines were torn up to get replacement rails for trunk lines, and the heavy use of rolling stock wore them out.[23] In 1864-65 the Confederate railroad network collapsed; little traffic moved in 1865.\\r\\nThe Southern states had blocked westward rail expansion before 1860, but after secession the Pacific Railway Acts were passed in 1862,[24] allowing the first transcontinental railroad to be completed in 1869, making possible a six-day trip from New York to San Francisco. Other transcontinentals were built in the South (Southern Pacific, Santa Fe) and along the CanadaÿUS border (Northern Pacific, Great Northern), accelerating the settlement of the West by offering inexpensive farms and ranches on credit, carrying pioneers and supplies westward, and cattle, wheat and minerals eastward.\\r\\nDuring the Reconstruction era, Northern money financed the rebuilding and dramatic expansion of railroads throughout the South; they were modernized in terms of track gauge, equipment and standards of service. The Southern network expanded from 11,000 miles (17,700?km) in 1870 to 29,000 miles (46,700?km) in 1890. The lines were owned and directed overwhelmingly by Northerners. Railroads helped create a mechanically skilled group of craftsmen and broke the isolation of much of the region. Passengers were few, however, and apart from hauling the cotton crop when it was harvested, there was little freight traffic.[25][26][27]\\r\\nThe Panic of 1873 was a major global economic depression which ended rapid rail expansion in the United States. Many lines went bankrupt or were barely able to pay the interest on their bonds, and workers were laid off on a mass scale, with those still employed subject to large cuts in wages. This worsening situation for railroad workers led to strikes against many railroads, culminating in the Great Railroad Strike of 1877.\\r\\nThe Great Strike began on July 14 in Martinsburg, West Virginia, in response to the cutting of wages for the second time in a year by the B&O Railroad. The strike, and related violence, spread to Cumberland, Maryland, Baltimore, Pittsburgh, Buffalo, Philadelphia, Chicago and the Midwest. The strike lasted for 45 days, and ended only with the intervention of local and state militias, and federal troops.[28]:112[29][30] Labor unrest continued into the 1880s, such as the Great Southwest Railroad Strike of 1886, which involved over 200,000 workers.\\r\\nBy 1880 the nation had 17,800 freight locomotives carrying 23,600 tons of freight, and 22,200 passenger locomotives. The U.S. railroad industry was the nation's largest employer outside of the agricultural sector.[31] The effects of the American railways on rapid industrial growth were many, including the opening of hundreds of millions of acres of very good farm land ready for mechanization, lower costs for food and all goods, a huge national sales market, the creation of a culture of engineering excellence, and the creation of the modern system of management.[32][33]\\r\\nNew York financier J.P. Morgan played an increasingly dominant role in consolidating the rail system in the late 19th century. He orchestrated reorganizations and consolidations in all parts of the United States. Morgan raised large sums in Europe, but instead of only handling the funds, he helped the railroads reorganize and achieve greater efficiencies. He fought against the speculators interested in speculative profits, and built a vision of an integrated transportation system. In 1885, he reorganized the New York, West Shore & Buffalo Railroad, leasing it to the New York Central. In 1886, he reorganized the Philadelphia & Reading, and in 1888 the Chesapeake & Ohio. He was heavily involved with railroad tycoon James J. Hill and the Great Northern Railway.[34]:331ÿ2\\r\\nIndustrialists such as Morgan, Cornelius Vanderbilt and Jay Gould became wealthy through railroad ownerships, as large railroad companies such as the Grand Trunk Railway and the Southern Pacific Transportation Company spanned several states. In response to monopolistic practices and other excesses of some railroads and their owners, Congress passed the Interstate Commerce Act and created the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) in 1887.[28]:123ÿ4[35] The ICC indirectly controlled the business activities of the railroads through issuance of extensive regulations.\\r\\nMorgan set up conferences in 1889 and 1890 that brought together railroad presidents in order to help the industry follow the new laws and write agreements for the maintenance of \\"public, reasonable, uniform and stable rates.\\" The conferences were the first of their kind, and by creating a community of interest among competing lines paved the way for the great consolidations of the early 20th century.[34]:352ÿ96 Congress responded by enacting antitrust legislation to prohibit monopolies of railroads (and other industries), beginning with the Sherman Antitrust Act in 1890.[36]\\r\\nThe Panic of 1893 was the largest economic depression in U.S. history at that time. It was the result of railroad overbuilding and shaky railroad financing, which set off a series of bank failures. One-quarter of U.S. railroads had failed by mid-1894, representing over 40,000 miles (64,000?km). The failed lines included the Northern Pacific Railway, the Union Pacific Railroad and the Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe Railroad. Acquisitions of the bankrupt companies led to further consolidation of ownership. As of 1906, two-thirds of the rail mileage in the U.S. was controlled by seven entities, with the New York Central, Pennsylvania Railroad (PRR), and Morgan having the largest portions.[28]:125ÿ6\\r\\nJames J. Hill joined forces with Morgan and others to gain control of the Northern Pacific. Hill formed the Northern Securities Company to consolidate the operations of the Northern Pacific with Hill's own Great Northern, but President Theodore Roosevelt, a trust-buster, strongly disapproved and took it to court. In 1904 the federal courts dissolved the Northern Security company (see Northern Securities Co. v. United States) and the railroads had to go their separate, competitive ways. By that time Morgan and Hill had ensured the Northern Pacific was well-organized and able to survive easily on its own.[34]:352ÿ96\\r\\nIn 1901 the Union Pacific Railroad acquired all of the stock of the Southern Pacific. The Federal government charged UP with violating the Sherman Act, and in 1913 the Supreme Court ordered UP to divest itself of all SP stock.[37] This ruling was received with considerable alarm throughout the industry, as UP and SP were widely considered at that time not to be significant competitors.[38] (Later in the 20th century, with different economic conditions and changes in the law, UP successfully acquired the SP. See Resurgence of freight railroads.)\\r\\nContinuing concern over rate discrimination by railroads led Congress to enact additional laws, giving increased regulatory powers to the ICC. The 1906 Hepburn Act gave the ICC authority to set maximum rates and review the companies' financial records.[39]\\r\\nThe United States Railroad Administration (USRA) temporarily took over management of railroads during World War I to address inadequacy in critical facilities throughout the overall system, such as terminals, trackage, and rolling stock. President Woodrow Wilson issued an order for nationalization on December 26, 1917.[40] Management by USRA led to standardization of equipment, reductions of duplicative passenger services, and better coordination of freight traffic.[28]:175 Federal control of the railroads ended in March 1920.[41]\\r\\nIn the early 20th century, some members of Congress, the ICC, and some railroad executives developed concerns about inefficiencies in the American railroad system. Memories of the 1893 panic, the continuing proliferation of railroad companies, and duplicative facilities, fueled this concern. To an extent the need to nationalize the system during the war was an example of this inefficiency. These concerns were the impetus for legislation to consider improvements to the system.[42] The 1920 Esch-Cummins Act directed the ICC to prepare and adopt a plan for the consolidation of the railroad companies into a limited number of systems.[41] In 1929 the ICC published its proposed Complete Plan of Consolidation, also known as the \\"Ripley Plan,\\" after its author, William Z. Ripley of Harvard University.[43][44] The agency held hearings on the plan, but none of the proposed consolidations was ever implemented. Many small railroads failed during the Great Depression of the 1930s. Of those lines that survived, the stronger ones were not interested in supporting the weaker ones.[45] In 1940 Congress formally abandoned the Ripley Plan.[46]\\r\\nDuring the post-World War II boom many railroads were driven out of business due to competition from airlines and Interstate highways. The rise of the automobile led to the end of passenger train service on most railroads. Trucking businesses had become major competitors by the 1930s with the advent of improved paved roads, and after the war they expanded their operations as the Interstate highway network grew, and acquired increased market share of freight business.[28]:219 Railroads continued to carry bulk freight such as coal, steel and other commodities. However, the ICC continued to regulate railroad rates and other aspects of railroad operations, which limited railroads' flexibility in responding to changing market forces.\\r\\nIn 1966, Congress created the Federal Railroad Administration, to issue and enforce rail safety regulations, administer railroad assistance programs, and conduct research and development in support of improved railroad safety and national rail transportation policy. The safety functions were transferred from the ICC. The FRA was established as part of the new federal Department of Transportation.[47]\\r\\nTwo of the largest remaining railroads, the Pennsylvania Railroad and the New York Central, merged in 1968 to form the Penn Central. At the insistence of the ICC the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad was added to the merger in 1969; in 1970 the Penn Central declared bankruptcy, the largest bankruptcy in U.S. history until then.[28]:234 Other bankrupt railroads included the Ann Arbor Railroad (1973), Erie Lackawanna Railway (1972), Lehigh Valley Railroad (1970), Reading Company (1971), Central Railroad of New Jersey (1967) and Lehigh and Hudson River Railway (1972).\\r\\nIn 1970 Congress created a government corporation, Amtrak, to take over operation of Penn Central passenger lines and selected inter-city passenger services from other private railroads, under the Rail Passenger Service Act.[28]:234[48] Amtrak began operations in 1971.[49]\\r\\nCongress passed the Regional Rail Reorganization Act of 1973 (sometimes called the \\"3R Act\\") to salvage viable freight operations from the bankrupt Penn Central and other lines in the northeast, mid-Atlantic and midwestern regions, through the creation of the Consolidated Rail Corporation (ConRail), a government-owned corporation.[50] Conrail began operations in 1976.[51] The 3R Act also formed the United States Railway Association, another government corporation, taking over the powers of the ICC with respect to allowing the bankrupt railroads to abandon unprofitable lines.\\r\\nAmtrak acquired most of the right-of-way and facilities of the Penn Central Northeast Corridor from Washington, D.C. to Boston, under the Railroad Revitalization and Regulatory Reform Act (the \\"4R Act\\") of 1976.[28]:238[49]\\r\\nIn addition to freight railroads, Conrail inherited commuter rail operations from several predecessor railroads in the northeast, and these operations continued to be unprofitable. State and local government transportation agencies took over the passenger operations and acquired the various rights-of-way from Conrail in 1983.[51][52]\\r\\nThe National Association of Railroad Passengers, a non-profit advocacy group, was organized in the late 1960s to support operation of passenger trains.\\r\\nBeginning in the late 1970s Amtrak eliminated several of its lightly-traveled lines. Ridership stagnated at roughly 20 million passengers per year amid uncertain government aid from 1981 to about 2000.[53][54] Ridership increased during the first decade of the 21st century after implementation of capital improvements in the Northeast Corridor and rises in automobile fuel costs.\\r\\nResurgence of freight railroads in the 1980s\\r\\nIn 1980 Congress enacted the Staggers Rail Act to revive freight traffic, by removing restrictive regulations and enabling railroads to be more competitive with the trucking industry.[55] The Northeast Rail Service Act of 1981 authorized additional deregulation of northeast railroads.[56] Among other things, these laws reduced the role of the ICC in regulating the railroads and allowed the carriers to discontinue unprofitable routes. More railroad companies merged and consolidated their lines in order to remain successful. These changes led to the current system of fewer, but profitable, Class I railroads covering larger regions of the United States.[28]:245ÿ252\\r\\nSince the beginning of the current deregulatory era, the following Class I railroads have been involved in mergers:\\r\\nIn 1995, when most of the ICC's powers had been eliminated, Congress finally abolished the agency and transferred its remaining functions to a new agency, the Surface Transportation Board.[57]\\r\\nIn the early 21st century, several of the railroads, along with the federal government and various port agencies, began to reinvest in freight rail infrastructure, such as intermodal terminals and bridge and tunnel improvements. These projects are designed to increase capacity and efficiency across the national rail network.[58][59] See Heartland Corridor and National Gateway.\\r\\nBoth the Bill Clinton and Barack Obama administrations had announced plans for new high-speed rail lines in their first terms. In the case of Clinton era, the only tangible outcome was the introduction of Amtrak's Acela Express, serving the Northeast Corridor, in 2000. Obama even mentioned his rail plans in his State of the Union address, the first time in decades a President had done so. While several small scale improvements to rail lines were financed by federal money, more ambitious plans in Florida, Ohio and other states failed when newly elected Republican governors stopped existing high-speed rail plans and returned federal funding.[citation needed]\\r\\nIn 2015 construction began on the California High-Speed Rail line. The Phase I portion, which will link Los Angeles and San Francisco in under three hours, is projected to be complete in 2029.[60]\\r\\nThe B&O established its Mount Clare Shops in Baltimore in 1829. This was the first railroad manufacturing facility in the U.S., and the company built locomotives, railroad cars, iron bridges and other equipment there.[7]:208 Following the B&O example, U.S. railroad companies soon became self-sufficient, as thousands of domestic machine shops turned out products and thousands of inventors and tinkerers improved the equipment.\\r\\nIn general, U.S. railroad companies imported technology from Britain in the 1830s, particularly strap iron rails, as there were no rail manufacturing facilities in the United States at that time. Heavy iron \\"T\\" rails were first manufactured in the U.S. in the mid-1840s at Mount Savage, Maryland[61] and Danville, Pennsylvania.[62] This improved rail design permitted higher train speeds and more reliable operation. Discovery of high-quality iron ores in the mid-19th century, particularly in the Great Lakes region, led to fabrication of better-quality rails.[63][64]\\r\\nSteel rails began to replace iron later in the 19th century. Several railroads imported steel rails from England in the 1860s, and the first commercially available steel rails in the U.S. were manufactured in 1867 at the Cambria Iron Works in Johnstown, Pennsylvania. By the mid-1880s U.S. railroads were using more steel rails than iron in building new or replacement tracks.[65]\\r\\nThrough the 1830s, 1840s, and 1850s, not only local projects, but long-distance links, were completed, so that by 1860 the eastern half of the continent, especially the Northeast, was linked by a network of connecting railroads. However, although England had early adopted a standard gauge of 4?ft?8?1?2?in (1,435?mm), once Americans started building locomotives, they experimented with different gauges, resulting in the standard gauge, or a close approximation, being adopted in the Northeast and Midwest U.S., but a 5?ft (1,524?mm) gauge in the South, and a 5?ft?6?in (1,676?mm) gauge in Canada. In addition, the Erie Railway was built to 6?ft (1,829?mm) broad gauge, and in the 1870s a widespread movement looked at the cheaper 3?ft (914?mm) narrow gauge. Except for the latter, gauges were standardized across North America after the end of the Civil War in 1865.[66]\\r\\nIn the early years American railroads imported many steam locomotives from England. While the B&O and the PRR built many of their own steam locomotives, other railroads purchased from independent American manufacturers. Prominent among the early steam manufacturers were Norris, Baldwin and Rogers,[67] followed by Lima and Alco later in the 19th and 20th centuries.[68]\\r\\nDiesel locomotives were first developed in Europe after World War I, and U.S. railroads began to use them widely in the 1930s and 1940s. Most U.S. roads discontinued use of steam locomotives by the 1950s. A diesel engine was expensive to build, but was less complex and easier to maintain than a steam locomotive, and required only one person to operate. This meant reduced costs and greater reliability for the railroads.[28]:213ÿ14 Several companies developed fast streamliner trains, such as the Super Chief and the California Zephyr during the 1930s and 1940s. Their locomotives used either diesel or similar internal combustion engine designs. See Dieselisation in North America.\\r\\nThough electric railways expanded in Europe, they never reached the same popularity in North America. They were built primarily in the north-west and the north-east beginning in the late 19th century. While some railroads used electric locomotives for both freight and passenger trains, by the end of the 20th century most freight trains were pulled only by diesel locomotives. The Northeast Corridor, the most heavily travelled passenger line in the US, is one of few long lines currently operating with electrification. See Railroad electrification in the United States.\\r\\nEarly forms of American railroad signaling and communication were virtually non-existent. Before telegraphs, the American railroads initially managed their train operations using timetables. However, there were no means of communication between drivers and dispatchers, and occasionally, two trains were sent on a collision course, or \\"cornfield meets.\\"[69] With the advent of the telegraph in the 1840s, a more sophisticated system was developed that allowed the dissemination of alterations to the timetable, known as train orders. These orders overrode the timetable, allowing the cancellation, rescheduling and addition of trains. The earliest recorded use of train orders was by the Erie Railroad in 1851.[70]\\r\\nThe development of the electrical track circuit in the 1870s led to the use of systems of block signals, which improved the railroads' speed, safety and efficiency. Mechanical interlockings, which prevent conflicting movements at rail junctions and crossings, were also introduced in the U.S. in the 1870s, after their initial development in Britain.[71]\\r\\nRailways changed employment practices in many ways. Lines with hundreds or thousands of employees developed systematic rules and procedures, not only for running the equipment but in hiring, promoting, paying and supervising employees. The railway system of management was adopted by all major business sectors. Railways offered a new type of work experience in enterprises vastly larger in size, complexity and management. At first workers were recruited from occupations where skills were roughly analogous and transferable, that is, workshop mechanics from the iron, machine and building trades; conductors from stagecoach drivers, steamship stewards and mail boat captains; station masters from commerce and commission agencies; and clerks from government offices.[72]\\r\\nIn response to the strikes of the 1870s and 1880s, Congress passed the Arbitration Act of 1888, which authorized the creation of arbitration panels with the power to investigate the causes of labor disputes and to issue non-binding arbitration awards.[73] The Act was a complete failure: only one panel was ever convened under the Act, and that one, in the case of the 1894 Pullman Strike, issued its report only after the strike had been crushed by a federal court injunction backed by federal troops.\\r\\nCongress attempted to correct these shortcomings in the Erdman Act, passed in 1898.[74] This law likewise provided for voluntary arbitration, but made any award issued by the panel binding and enforceable in federal court. It also outlawed discrimination against employees for union activities, prohibited \\"yellow dog\\" contracts (employee agrees not to join a union while employed), and required both sides to maintain the status quo during any arbitration proceedings and for three months after an award was issued. The arbitration procedures were rarely used. A successor statute, the Newlands Act, was passed in 1913 and proved more effective,[75] but was largely superseded when the federal government nationalized the railroads in 1917.\\r\\nAs railroads expanded after the Civil War, so too did the rate of accidents among railroad personnel, especially brakemen. Many accidents were associated with the coupling and uncoupling of railroad cars, and the operation of manually operated brakes (hand brakes). The rise in accidents led to calls for safety legislation, as early as the 1870s.[76]:2ÿ4 In the 1880s, the number of on-the-job fatalities of railroad workers was second only to those of coal miners.[76]:5 Through that decade, several state legislatures enacted safety laws. However, the specific requirements varied among the states, making implementation difficult for interstate rail carriers, and Congress passed the Safety Appliance Act in 1893 to provide a uniform standard.[76]:6ÿ7[77] The law required railroads to install air brakes and automatic couplers on all trains, and led to a sharp drop in accidents.\\r\\nThe EschÿCummins Act of 1920 terminated the nationalization program and created a Railway Labor Board (RLB) to regulate wages and issue non-binding proposals to settle disputes. In 1921 the RLB ordered a twelve percent reduction in employees' wages,[78] which led to the Great Railroad Strike of 1922, involving rail shop workers nationwide, followed by a court injunction to end the strike.[79] Congress passed the Railway Labor Act of 1926 to rectify the shortcomings of the RLB procedures.[80]\\r\\nCongress added railroad worker safety laws throughout the 20th century.[76]:16-25 Significant among this legislation is the Federal Railroad Safety Act of 1970, which gave the FRA broad resposibilities over all aspects of rail safety, and expanded the agency's authority to cover all railroads, both interstate and intrastate.[81]\\r\\nAccording to historian Henry Adams the system of railroads needed:\\r\\nThe impact can be examined through five aspects: shipping, finance, management, careers, and popular reaction.[83]\\r\\nFirst they provided a highly efficient network for shipping freight and passengers across a large national market. The result was a transforming impact on most sectors of the economy including manufacturing, retail and wholesale, agriculture and finance. Supplemented with the telegraph that added rapid communications, the United States now had an integrated national market practically the size of Europe, with no internal barriers or tariffs, all supported by a common language, and financial system and a common legal system. The railroads at first supplemented, then largely replaced the previous transportation modes of turnpikes and canals, rivers and intracoastal ocean traffic. For highly efficient Northern railroads played a major role in winning the Civil War, while the overburdened Southern lines collapsed in the face of an insurmountable challenge.[84] In the late 19th century pipelines were built for the oil trade, and in the 20th century trucking and aviation emerged.[85][86]\\r\\nRailroads financing provided the basis of the private (non-governmental) financial system. Construction of railroads was far more expensive than factories or canals. The famous Erie canal, 300 miles long in upstate New York, cost $7 million of state money, which was about what private investors spent on one short railroad in Western Massachusetts. A new steamboat on the Hudson, Mississippi, Missouri, or Ohio rivers cost about the same as one mile of track.\\r\\nIn 1860, the combined total of railroad stocks and bonds was $1.8 billion; 1897 it reached $10.6 billion (compared to a total national debt of $1.2 billion).[87] Funding came from financiers throughout the Northeast, and from Europe, especially Britain.[88] The federal government provided no cash to any other railroads. However it did provide unoccupied free land to some of the Western railroads, so they could sell it to farmers and have customers along the route. Some cash came from states, or from local governments that use money as a leverage to prevent being bypassed by the main line. Larger sound came from the southern states during the Reconstruction era, as they try to rebuild their destroyed rail system. Some states such as Maine and Texas also made land grants to local railroads; the state total was 49 million acres.[89] The emerging American financial system was based on railroad bonds. Boston was the first center, but New York by 1860 was the dominant financial market. The British invested heavily in railroads around the world, but nowhere more so than the United States; The total came to about $3 billion by 1914.[90] In 1914ÿ1917, they liquidated their American assets to pay for war supplies.[91][92][93]\\r\\nThe third dimension was in designing complex managerial systems that could handle far more complicated simultaneous relationships than could be dreamed of by the local factory owner who could patrol every part of his own factory in a matter of hours. Civil engineers became the senior management of railroads. The leading innovators were the Western Railroad of Massachusetts and the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad in the 1840s, the Erie in the 1850s and the Pennsylvania in the 1860s.[94]\\r\\nAfter a serious accident, the Western Railroad of Massachusetts put in place a system of responsibility for district managers and dispatchers keep track of all train movement. Discipline was essentialeveryone had to follow the rules exactly to prevent accidents. Decision-making powers had to be distributed to ensure safety and to juggle the complexity of numerous trains running in both directions on a single track, keeping to schedules that could easily be disrupted by weather mechanical breakdowns, washouts or hitting a wandering cow.[95] As the lines grew longer with more and more business originating at dozens of different stations, the Baltimore and Ohio set up more complex system that separated finances from daily operations. The Erie Railroad, faced with growing competition, had to make lower bids for freight movement, and had to know on a daily basis how much each train was costing them. Statistics was the weapon of choice. By the 1860s, the Pennsylvania Railroadthe largest in the worldwas making further advances in using bureaucracy under John Edgar Thomson, president 1852-1874. He divided the system into several geographical divisions, which each reported daily to a general superintendent in Philadelphia. All the American railroads copied each other in the new managerial advances, and by the 1870s emerging big businesses in the industrial field likewise copied the railroad model.[96]\\r\\nThe fourth dimension was in management of the workforce, both blue-collar workers and white-collar workers. Railroading became a career in which young men entered at about age 18 to 20, and spent their entire lives usually with the same line. Young men could start working on the tracks, become a fireman, and work his way up to engineer. The mechanical world of the roundhouses have their own career tracks. A typical career path would see a young man hired at age 18 as a shop laborer, be promoted to skilled mechanic at age 24, brakeman at 25, freight conductor at 27, and passenger conductor at age 57. Women were not hired.[97]\\r\\nWhite-collar careers paths likewise were delineated. Educated young men started in clerical or statistical work and moved up to station agents or bureaucrats at the divisional or central headquarters. At each level they had more and more knowledge experience and human capital. They were very hard to replace, and were virtually guaranteed permanent jobs and provided with insurance and medical care. Hiring, firing and wage rates were set not by foreman, but by central administrators, in order to minimize favoritism and personality conflicts. Everything was by the book, and increasingly complex set of rules told everyone exactly what they should do it every circumstance, and exactly what their rank and pay would be.[98] Young men who were first hired in the 1840s and 1850s retired from the same railroad 40 or 50 years later. To discourage them from leaving for another company, they were promised pensions when they retired. Indeed, the railroads invented the American pension system.[99]\\r\\nAmerica developed a loveÿhate relationship with railroads. Boosters in every city worked feverishly to make sure the railroad came through, knowing their urban dreams depended upon it. The mechanical size, scope and efficiency of the railroads made a profound impression; people would dress in their Sunday best to go down to the terminal to watch the train come in. David Nye argues that:\\r\\nTravel became much easier, cheaper and more common. Shoppers from small towns could make day trips to big city stores. Hotels, resorts and tourist attractions were built to accommodate the demand. The realization that anyone could buy a ticket for a thousand-mile trip was empowering. Historians Gary Cross and Rick Szostak argue:\\r\\nThe engineers became model citizens, bringing their can-do spirit and their systematic work effort to all phases of the economy as well as local and national government.[102] By 1910, major cities were building magnificent palatial railroad stations, such as the Pennsylvania Station in New York City, and the Union Station in Washington DC.[103]\\r\\nBut there was also a dark side. As early as the 1830s, novelists and poets began fretting that the railroads would destroy the rustic attractions of the American landscape. By the 1840s concerns were rising about terrible accidents when speeding trains crashed into helpless wooden carriages.[104] By the 1870s, railroads were vilified by Western farmers who absorbed the Granger movement theme that monopolistic carriers controlled too much pricing power, and that the state legislatures had to impose maximum prices. Local merchants and shippers supported the demand and got some \\"Granger Laws\\" passed.[105] Anti-railroad complaints were loudly repeated in late 19th century political rhetoric.[106] The idea of establishing a strong rate fixing federal body was achieved during the Progressive Era, primarily by a coalition of shipping interests.[107] Railroad historians mark the Hepburn Act of 1906 that gave the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) the power to set maximum railroad rates as a damaging blow to the long-term profitability and growth of railroads.[108] After 1910 the lines faced an emerging trucking industry to compete with for freight, and automobiles and buses to compete for passenger service.[109]\\r\\nThere is no question about the importance of railroads in American history. Churella finds that back in the 1950s business and economic historians, led by Alfred D. Chandler, Jr. and Robert Fogel, made railroads the centerpiece of advanced historiography.[110] That era has passed as graduate programs have faded away, courses on railroad history do not make the curriculum, and the historiography has shifted away from professional historian to the \\"rail fans\\"very well informed amateur writers fascinated by the memorabilia, technology and locomotives of the steam era. Looking at the voluminous output of rail fan authors, Klein says:\\r\\nThe result is a multiplicity of histories of specific railroads, large and small. Typically they deal with standard topics: the builders and their organizational, legislative and financial dealings; colorful construction crews laying down wood ties and steel rail; the development of locomotives and passenger cars; boosters who sought a stop in their little town else it would die; the 1880ÿ1920 golden age of the passenger long-distance travel and local excursions; the steady erosion of passenger service during the automobile age; the freight agent and the small-town depot. They end with the more recent saga of retrenchment, merger, and abandonment.[113][114] Klein, Churella, Roth, and Franham all find that the popular writers show little interest in the development of managerial and organizational complexity of the sort that Chandler studied, or the economic impact that concerned Fogel's cohort.[115] From outside the field of railroad history, academic labor historians now deal with the culture of the workers, strikes, the careers for blue collar and white collar men, and racial discrimination. Academic political historians deal with the Granger, Populist and Progressive attacks, and in federal or state regulation.[113]","input":"When did scheduled common carrier freight and passenger service begin in the u.s. ??"},{"output":"a minimum of 6 grams of gold","context":"A gold medal is a medal awarded for highest achievement in a non-military field. Its name derives from the use of at least a fraction of gold in form of plating or alloying in its manufacture.\\r\\nSince the eighteenth century, gold medals have been awarded in the arts, for example, by the Royal Danish Academy, usually as a symbol of an award to give an outstanding student some financial freedom. Others offer only the prestige of the award. Many organizations now award gold medals either annually or extraordinarily, including UNESCO and various academic societies.\\r\\nWhile some gold medals are solid gold, others are gold-plated or silver-gilt, like those of the Olympic Games, the Lorentz Medal, the United States Congressional Gold Medal and the Nobel Prize medal. Nobel Prize medals consist of 18 karat green gold plated with 24 karat gold. Before 1980 they were struck in 23 karat gold.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore the establishment of standard military awards, e.g., the Medal of Honor, it was common practice to have a medal specially created to provide national recognition for a significant military or naval victory or accomplishment. In the United States, Congress would enact a resolution asking the President to reward those responsible. The commanding officer would receive a gold medal and his officers silver medals.[1] Other countries similarly honored their military and naval victors in a similar fashion.\\r\\nMedals have historically been given as prizes in various types of competitive activities, especially athletics.\\r\\nTraditionally, medals are made of the following metals:\\r\\nOccasionally, Platinum medals can be awarded.\\r\\nThese metals designate the first three Ages of Man in Greek mythology: the Golden Age, when men lived among the gods, the Silver Age, where youth lasted a hundred years, and the Bronze Age, the era of heroes.\\r\\nThe custom of awarding the sequence of gold, silver, and bronze medals for the first three highest achievers dates from at least the 18th century, with the National Association of Amateur Athletes in the United States awarding such medals as early as 1884.[2]\\r\\nThis standard was adopted for Olympic competition at the 1904 Summer Olympics. At the 1896 event, silver was awarded to winners and bronze to runners-up, while at 1900 other prizes were given, not medals.\\r\\nAt the modern Olympic Games, winners of a sporting discipline receive a gold medal in recognition of their achievement.\\r\\nAt the Ancient Olympic Games only one winner per event was crowned with kotinos, an olive wreath made of wild olive leaves from a sacred tree near the temple of Zeus at Olympia. Aristophanes in Plutus makes a remark why victorious athletes are crowned with wreath made of wild olive instead of gold.[3] Herodotus describes a story that explains why there were only a few Greek men at the Battle of Thermopylae since \\"all other men were participating in the Olympic Games\\" and that the prize for the winner was \\"an olive-wreath\\". When Tigranes, an Armenian general learned this, he uttered to his leader: \\"Good heavens! what kind of men are these against whom you have brought us to fight? Men who do not compete for possessions, but for honour\\".[4] Hence medals were not awarded at the ancient Olympic Games.\\r\\nAt the 1896 Summer Olympics, winners received a silver medal and the second-place finisher received a bronze medal. In 1900, most winners received cups or trophies instead of medals. The next three Olympics (1904, 1908, 1912) awarded the winners solid gold medals, but the medals themselves were smaller. The use of gold rapidly declined with the onset of the First World War and also with the onset of the Second World War.[5] The last series of Olympic medals to be made of solid gold were awarded at the 1912 Olympic Games in Stockholm, Sweden.\\r\\nOlympic Gold medals are required to be made from at least 92.5% silver, and must contain a minimum of 6 grams of gold.[6] All Olympic medals must be at least 60mm in diameter and 3mm thick.[6] Minting the medals is the responsibility of the Olympic host. From 1928 through 1968 the design was always the same: the obverse showed a generic design by Florentine artist Giuseppe Cassioli of Greek goddess Nike with Rome's Colloseum in the background and text naming the host city; the reverse showed another generic design of Nike saluting an Olympic champion.\\r\\nFrom the 1972 Summer Olympics through 2000, Cassioli's design (or a slight modification) remained on the obverse with a custom design by the host city on the reverse. Noting that Cassioli's design showed a Roman amphitheater for what originally were Greek games, a new obverse design was commissioned for the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens. For the 2008 Beijing Olympics medals had a diameter of 70mm and were 6mm thick, with the front displaying a winged figure of victory and the back showed a Beijing Olympics symbol surrounded by an inset jade circle.\\r\\nWinter Olympics medals have been of more varied design. The silver and bronze medals have always borne the same designs.\\r\\nThe award of a gold medal, often coupled with the award of silver and bronze medals to the next place finishers, has been adopted in other sports competitions and in other competitive fields, such as music and writing, as well as some competitive games. Typically bronze medals are awarded only to third place, but in some contests there is some variety, such as International barbershop music contests where bronze medals are awarded for third, fourth, and fifth place.","input":"How much gold is in the olympics gold medal?"},{"output":"The afghani","context":"The afghani (sign: Afs;[1] code: AFN; Pashto: ??????; Dari ??????) is the currency of Afghanistan, issued by the central bank Da Afghanistan Bank. It is nominally subdivided into 100 pul (???), although there are no pul coins currently in circulation.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe original afghani (ISO 4217 code: AFA) was introduced in 1925, replacing the Afghan rupee that had been in use from 1891. In addition to being subdivided into 100 pul, 20 afghani were equal to one amani. The rate of conversion from the rupee is sometimes quoted as 1 afghani = 1 rupee 6 paisa,[2] based on the silver contents of the last rupee coins and the first Afghani coins. The Afghani initially contained 9 grams of silver.[3] The rupee was still in circulation until 1978.\\r\\nThe first afghani banknotes were introduced in 1935.\\r\\nExcept during World War I Afghanistan's foreign exchange rate has been freely determined by market forces.[4] However, for some periods, a dual exchange rate regime existed in Afghanistan: an official exchange rate which was fixed by the Afghan Central Bank, and a free market exchange rate which was determined by the supply and demand forces in Kabul's money bazaar called Saraye Shahzada.[5] For example, in order to avoid the seasonal fluctuations in the exchange rate, a fixed exchange rate was adopted in 1935 by the Bank-e Milli, which was then responsible for the country's exchange rate system and official reserves.[5] Bank-e Milli agreed to exchange afghanis at 4 Afs against 1 Indian rupee in 1935. After the establishment of Da Afghanistan Bank as the Central Bank of Afghanistan, such a preferential official fixed exchange rate continued to be practiced. Although Da Afghanistan Bank tried to keep its official rate close to the Saraye Shahzada's exchange rate, the gap between the official and free-market exchange rates widened in the 1980s and during the civil war thereafter.\\r\\nThe afghani traded at 67 AFA to the U.S. dollar in 1973, whereas by 1992 a dollar bought 16,000 afghanis.[6]\\r\\nBanknotes from the period of King Zahir Shah's monarchy ceased to be legal tender by 1991.\\r\\nAfter the creation of a dysfunctional government and the start of civil war, different warlords and factions, foreign powers and forgers each made their own afghani banknotes to support themselves financially, with no regard to standardization or honouring serial numbers.\\r\\nIn December 1996, shortly after the Taliban took control of Afghanistan's institutions, Ehsanullah Ehsan, the chairman of the Taliban's Central Bank, declared most afghani notes in circulation to be worthless (approximately 100 trillion Afghani) and cancelled the contract with the Russian firm that had been printing the currency since 1992. Ehsan accused the firm of sending new shipments of afghani notes to ousted president Burhanuddin Rabbani in northern Takhar province. The exchange rate at the time of Ehsan's announcement was 21,000 afghani to the US dollar. It was then devalued to 43 afghani to the dollar. The Northern Alliance then had banknotes produced in Russia which were sold on the markets of Kabul at half their value.[citation needed]\\r\\nAbdul Rashid Dostum, who controlled a self-declared autonomous region in northern Afghanistan until 1998, also printed his own issues for the region.\\r\\nFollowing the United States invasion of Afghanistan, the currency became highly destabalized. The afghani traded at 73,000 AFA per USD in September 2001, steeply soaring to 23,000 AFA after the fall of Kabul in November 2001, before plunging again to 36,000 AFA in January 2002.[7] Around seven different versions of the currency were in circulation by that time. A former governor said at the time that maybe \\"trillions\\" of banknotes are in circulation as a result.[8]\\r\\nIn April 2000, the afghani traded at 6,400 AFA per USD. By mid-2002, the afghani was valued at 43,000 AFA per USD, and 52,000 AFA by September 2002.\\r\\nIn 2002, the afghani was denominated, and it received new ISO 4217 code AFN. No subdivisions were issued. It replaced the previous afghani at two distinct rates - issues of the government of former President Burhanuddin Rabbani (de jure 1992-2001) were replaced at a rate of 1,000 to the new afghani, whilst the issues of warlord Abdul Rashid Dostum (1992ÿ1997 in northern Afghanistan) were replaced at a rate of 2,000 to the new afghani. It was created in an effort to stabilize the economy and stop the rapid inflation. The notes were printed in Germany.[9]\\r\\nThe new currency was announced by President Hamid Karzai on September 4, 2002, and was introduced to the market on October 8, 2002.[10] This monetary reform was well received by the public as it was a sign of security and stability, especially the country's rebuilding effort. People also no longer had to carry many bags of money for ordinary things. It was the first time in many years that a sole currency was under the control of the central bank instead of warlords.[11] Most old banknotes were destroyed by the end of 2002. Prior to the reissue, there were more than 15 trillion afghani in circulation after unrestrained printing under Taliban rule and during wars and occupation.[citation needed]\\r\\nDa Afghanistan Bank has adopted a floating exchange rate regime and has let the exchange rate to be determined freely by market forces.\\r\\nThe new afghani was valued at 43 afghani to the U.S. dollar.\\r\\nAfter depreciating during the last quarter of 2003/04, the afghani has been appreciating steadily, gaining 8 percent against the U.S. dollar between end-March 2004 and end-July 2004. This appreciation, at a time of increasing inflation, appears to reflect a greater willingness by the population to use the afghani as a medium of exchange and as a store of value. This trend appears to be attributable to the relative stability of the exchange rate since the introduction of the new currency, administrative measures aimed at promoting its use, such as the requirement that shopkeepers must price goods in afghani. Donors are increasingly making payments in afghani instead of U.S. dollars and this appears to be widely accepted.\\r\\nBy 2009, the afghani was valued at 45 AFN per USD.\\r\\nIn 1925, bronze and brass 2, 5 and 10 pul, billon 20 pul, silver ?1?2 and 1 afghani, and gold ?1?2 and 1 amani coins were introduced, followed by silver ?2?1?2 afghani and gold ?2?1?2 amani in 1926.[citation needed] In 1930, bronze and brass 1 and 25 pul were added, along with bronze 3 pul and cupro-nickel 10 and 20 pul in 1937.[citation needed]\\r\\nIn 1952, aluminium 25 pul and nickel-clad steel 50 pul were introduced, followed by aluminium 2 and 5 afghani in 1958.

The membranes of the ER are continuous with the outer nuclear membrane. The endoplasmic reticulum occurs in most types of eukaryotic cells, but is absent from red blood cells and spermatozoa. There are two types of endoplasmic reticulum: rough and smooth. The outer (cytosolic) face of the rough endoplasmic reticulum is studded with ribosomes that are the sites of protein synthesis. The rough endoplasmic reticulum is especially prominent in cells such as hepatocytes. The smooth endoplasmic reticulum lacks ribosomes and functions in lipid manufacture and metabolism, the production of steroid hormones, and detoxification.[1] The smooth ER is especially abundant in mammalian liver and gonad cells. The lacy membranes of the endoplasmic reticulum were first seen in 1945 using electron microscopy.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe lacy membranes of the endoplasmic reticulum were first seen in 1945 by Keith R. Porter, Albert Claude, Brody Meskers and Ernest F. Fullam, using electron microscopy.[2] The word reticulum, which means \\"network\\", was applied to describe this fabric of membranes.\\r\\nThe general structure of the endoplasmic reticulum is a network of membranes called cisternae. These sac-like structures are held together by the cytoskeleton. The phospholipid membrane encloses the cisternal space (or lumen), which is continuous with the perinuclear space but separate from the cytosol. The functions of the endoplasmic reticulum can be summarized as the synthesis and export of proteins and membrane lipids, but varies between ER and cell type and cell function. The quantity of both rough and smooth endoplasmic reticulum in a cell can slowly interchange from one type to the other, depending on the changing metabolic activities of the cell. Transformation can include embedding of new proteins in membrane as well as structural changes. Changes in protein content may occur without noticeable structural changes.[3][4][citation needed]\\r\\nThe surface of the rough endoplasmic reticulum (often abbreviated RER or Rough ER) (also called granular endoplasmic reticulum) is studded with protein-manufacturing ribosomes giving it a \\"rough\\" appearance (hence its name).[5] The binding site of the ribosome on the rough endoplasmic reticulum is the translocon.[6] However, the ribosomes are not a stable part of this organelle's structure as they are constantly being bound and released from the membrane. A ribosome only binds to the RER once a specific protein-nucleic acid complex forms in the cytosol. This special complex forms when a free ribosome begins translating the mRNA of a protein destined for the secretory pathway.[7] The first 5ÿ30 amino acids polymerized encode a signal peptide, a molecular message that is recognized and bound by a signal recognition particle (SRP). Translation pauses and the ribosome complex binds to the RER translocon where translation continues with the nascent (new) protein forming into the RER lumen and/or membrane. The protein is processed in the ER lumen by an enzyme (a signal peptidase), which removes the signal peptide. Ribosomes at this point may be released back into the cytosol; however, non-translating ribosomes are also known to stay associated with translocons.[8]\\r\\nThe membrane of the rough endoplasmic reticulum forms large double membrane sheets that are located near, and continuous with, the outer layer of the nuclear envelope.[9] The double membrane sheets are stacked and connected through several right or left-handed helical ramps, the so-called Terasaki ramps, giving rise to a structure resembling a multi-storey car park.[10][11] Although there is no continuous membrane between the endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi apparatus, membrane-bound transport vesicles shuttle proteins between these two compartments.[12] Vesicles are surrounded by coating proteins called COPI and COPII. COPII targets vesicles to the Golgi apparatus and COPI marks them to be brought back to the rough endoplasmic reticulum. The rough endoplasmic reticulum works in concert with the Golgi complex to target new proteins to their proper destinations. A second method of transport out of the endoplasmic reticulum involves areas called membrane contact sites, where the membranes of the endoplasmic reticulum and other organelles are held closely together, allowing the transfer of lipids and other small molecules.[13][14]\\r\\nThe rough endoplasmic reticulum is key in multiple functions:\\r\\nIn most cells the smooth endoplasmic reticulum (abbreviated SER) is scarce. Instead there are areas where the ER is partly smooth and partly rough, this area is called the transitional ER. The transitional ER gets its name because it contains ER exit sites. These are areas where the transport vesicles that contain lipids and proteins made in the ER, detach from the ER and start moving to the Golgi apparatus. Specialized cells can have a lot of smooth endoplasmic reticulum and in these cells the smooth ER has many functions.[3] It synthesizes lipids, phospholipids, and steroids. Cells which secrete these products, such as those in the testes, ovaries, and sebaceous glands have an abundance of smooth endoplasmic reticulum.[15] It also carries out the metabolism of carbohydrates, detoxification of natural metabolism products and of alcohol and drugs, attachment of receptors on cell membrane proteins, and steroid metabolism.[16] In muscle cells, it regulates calcium ion concentration. Smooth endoplasmic reticulum is found in a variety of cell types (both animal and plant), and it serves different functions in each. The smooth endoplasmic reticulum also contains the enzyme glucose-6-phosphatase, which converts glucose-6-phosphate to glucose, a step in gluconeogenesis. It is connected to the nuclear envelope and consists of tubules that are located near the cell periphery. These tubes sometimes branch forming a network that is reticular in appearance.[9] In some cells, there are dilated areas like the sacs of rough endoplasmic reticulum. The network of smooth endoplasmic reticulum allows for an increased surface area to be devoted to the action or storage of key enzymes and the products of these enzymes.\\r\\nThe sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR), from the Greek ? sarx (\\"flesh\\"), is smooth ER found in myocytes. The only structural difference between this organelle and the smooth endoplasmic reticulum is the medley of proteins they have, both bound to their membranes and drifting within the confines of their lumens. This fundamental difference is indicative of their functions: The endoplasmic reticulum synthesizes molecules, while the sarcoplasmic reticulum stores calcium ions and pumps them out into the sarcoplasm when the muscle fiber is stimulated.[17][18] After their release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, calcium ions interact with contractile proteins that utilize ATP to shorten the muscle fiber. The sarcoplasmic reticulum plays a major role in excitation-contraction coupling.[19]\\r\\nThe endoplasmic reticulum serves many general functions, including the folding of protein molecules in sacs called cisternae and the transport of synthesized proteins in vesicles to the Golgi apparatus. Correct folding of newly made proteins is made possible by several endoplasmic reticulum chaperone proteins, including protein disulfide isomerase (PDI), ERp29, the Hsp70 family member BiP/Grp78, calnexin, calreticulin, and the peptidylpropyl isomerase family. Only properly folded proteins are transported from the rough ER to the Golgi apparatus ÿ unfolded proteins cause an unfolded protein response as a stress response in the ER. Disturbances in redox regulation, calcium regulation, glucose deprivation, and viral infection[20] or the over-expression of proteins[21] can lead to endoplasmic reticulum stress response (ER stress), a state in which the folding of proteins slows, leading to an increase in unfolded proteins. This stress is emerging as a potential cause of damage in hypoxia/ischemia, insulin resistance, and other disorders.[22]\\r\\nSecretory proteins, mostly glycoproteins, are moved across the endoplasmic reticulum membrane. Proteins that are transported by the endoplasmic reticulum throughout the cell are marked with an address tag called a signal sequence. The N-terminus (one end) of a polypeptide chain (i.e., a protein) contains a few amino acids that work as an address tag, which are removed when the polypeptide reaches its destination. Nascent peptides reach the ER via the translocon, a membrane-embedded multiprotein complex. Proteins that are destined for places outside the endoplasmic reticulum are packed into transport vesicles and moved along the cytoskeleton toward their destination. In human fibroblasts, the ER is always co-distributed with microtubules and the depolymerisation of the latter cause its co-aggregation with mitochondria, which are also associated with the ER.[23]\\r\\nThe endoplasmic reticulum is also part of a protein sorting pathway. It is, in essence, the transportation system of the eukaryotic cell. The majority of its resident proteins are retained within it through a retention motif. This motif is composed of four amino acids at the end of the protein sequence. The most common retention sequences are KDEL for lumen located proteins and KKXX for transmembrane protein.[24] However, variations of KDEL and KKXX do occur, and other sequences can also give rise to endoplasmic reticulum retention. It is not known whether such variation can lead to sub-ER localizations. There are three KDEL (1, 2 and 3) receptors in mammalian cells, and they have a very high degree of sequence identity. The functional differences between these receptors remain to be established.[25]\\r\\nAbnormalities in XBP1 lead to a heightened endoplasmic reticulum stress response and subsequently causes a higher susceptibility for inflammatory processes that may even contribute to Alzheimer's disease.[26] In the colon, XBP1 anomalies have been linked to the inflammatory bowel diseases including Crohn's disease.[27]\\r\\nThe unfolded protein response (UPR) is a cellular stress response related to the endoplasmic reticulum.[28] The UPR is activated in response to an accumulation of unfolded or misfolded proteins in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum. The UPR functions to restore normal function of the cell by halting protein translation, degrading misfolded proteins, and activating the signaling pathways that lead to increasing the production of molecular chaperones involved in protein folding. Sustained overactivation of the UPR has been implicated in prion diseases as well as several other neurodegenerative diseases and the inhibition of the UPR could become a treatment for those diseases.[29]","input":"What is the location of smooth endoplasmic reticulum?"},{"output":"a strategy intended to dissuade an adversary from taking an action not yet started, or to prevent them from doing something that another state desires","context":"Deterrence theory gained increased prominence as a military strategy during the Cold War with regard to the use of nuclear weapons. It took on a unique connotation during this time as an inferior nuclear force, by virtue of its extreme destructive power, could deter a more powerful adversary, provided that this force could be protected against destruction by a surprise attack. Deterrence is a strategy intended to dissuade an adversary from taking an action not yet started, or to prevent them from doing something that another state desires. A credible nuclear deterrent, Bernard Brodie wrote in 1959, must be always at the ready, yet never used.[1][a]\\r\\nIn Thomas Schelling's (1966) classic work on deterrence, the concept that military strategy can no longer be defined as the science of military victory is presented. Instead, it is argued that military strategy was now equally, if not more, the art of coercion, of intimidation and deterrence.[2] Schelling says the capacity to harm another state is now used as a motivating factor for other states to avoid it and influence another state's behavior. To be coercive or deter another state, violence must be anticipated and avoidable by accommodation. It can therefore be summarized that the use of the power to hurt as bargaining power is the foundation of deterrence theory, and is most successful when it is held in reserve.[2]\\r\\nIn 2004 Frank C. Zagare made the case that deterrence theory is logically inconsistent, not empirically accurate, and that it is deficient as a theory. In place of classical deterrence, rational choice scholars have argued for perfect deterrence, which assumes that states may vary in their internal characteristics and especially in the credibility of their threats of retaliation.[3]\\r\\nIn a January 2007 article in the Wall Street Journal, veteran cold-war policy makers Henry Kissinger, Bill Perry, George Shultz, and Sam Nunn reversed their previous position and asserted that far from making the world safer, nuclear weapons had become a source of extreme risk.[4] Their rationale and conclusion was not based on the old world with only a few nuclear players, but on the instability in many states possessing the technologies and the lack of wherewithal to properly maintain and upgrade existing weapons in many states:\\r\\nThe risk of accidents, misjudgments or unauthorised launches, they argued, was growing more acute in a world of rivalries between relatively new nuclear states that lacked the security safeguards developed over many years by America and the Soviet Union. The emergence of pariah states, such as North Korea (possibly soon to be joined by Iran), armed with nuclear weapons was adding to the fear as was the declared ambition of terrorists to steal, buy or build a nuclear device.[4]\\r\\nAccording to The Economist, \\"Senior European statesmen and women\\" called for further action in 2010 in addressing problems of nuclear weapons proliferation. They said: \\"Nuclear deterrence is a far less persuasive strategic response to a world of potential regional nuclear arms races and nuclear terrorism than it was to the cold war\\".[5]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe use of military threats as a means to deter international crises and war has been a central topic of international security research for at least two hundred years.[6] Research has predominantly focused on the theory of rational deterrence to analyze the conditions under which conventional deterrence is likely to succeed or fail. Alternative theories however have challenged the rational deterrence theory and have focused on organizational theory and cognitive psychology.\\r\\nThe concept of deterrence can be defined as the use of threats by one party to convince another party to refrain from initiating some course of action.[7] A threat serves as a deterrent to the extent that it convinces its target not to carry out the intended action because of the costs and losses that target would incur. In international security, a policy of deterrence generally refers to threats of military retaliation directed by the leaders of one state to the leaders of another in an attempt to prevent the other state from resorting to the threat of use of military force in pursuit of its foreign policy goals.\\r\\nAs outlined by Huth,[7] a policy of deterrence can fit into two broad categories being (i) preventing an armed attack against a state's own territory (known as direct deterrence); or (ii) preventing an armed attack against another state (known as extended deterrence). Situations of direct deterrence often occur when there is a territorial dispute between neighboring states in which major powers like the United States do not directly intervene. On the other hand, situations of extended deterrence often occur when a great power becomes involved. It is the latter that has generated the majority of interest in academic literature. Building on these two broad categories, Huth goes on to outline that deterrence policies may be implemented in response to a pressing short-term threat (known as immediate deterrence) or as strategy to prevent a military conflict or short term threat from arising (known as general deterrence).\\r\\nA successful deterrence policy must be considered in not only military terms, but also in political terms. In military terms, deterrence success refers to preventing state leaders from issuing military threats and actions that escalate peacetime diplomatic and military cooperation into a crisis or militarized confrontation which threatens armed conflict and possibly war. The prevention of crises of wars however is not the only aim of deterrence. In addition, defending states must be able to resist the political and military demands of a potential attacking nation. If armed conflict is avoided at the price of diplomatic concessions to the maximum demands of the potential attacking nation under the threat of war, then it cannot be claimed that deterrence has succeeded.\\r\\nFurthermore, as Jentleson et al.[8] argue, two key sets of factors for successful deterrence are important being (i) a defending state strategy that firstly balances credible coercion and deft diplomacy consistent with the three criteria of proportionality, reciprocity, and coercive credibility, and secondly minimizes international and domestic constraints; and (ii) the extent of an attacking state's vulnerability as shaped by its domestic political and economic conditions. In broad terms, a state wishing to implement a strategy of deterrence is most likely to succeed if the costs of non-compliance it can impose on, and the benefits of compliance it can offer to, another state are greater than the benefits of noncompliance and the costs of compliance.\\r\\nDeterrence theory holds that nuclear weapons are intended to deter other states from attacking with their nuclear weapons, through the promise of retaliation and possibly mutually assured destruction (MAD). Nuclear deterrence can also be applied to an attack by conventional forces; for example, the doctrine of massive retaliation threatened to launch US nuclear weapons in response to Soviet attacks.\\r\\nA successful nuclear deterrent requires that a country preserve its ability to retaliate, either by responding before its own weapons are destroyed or by ensuring a second strike capability. A nuclear deterrent is sometimes composed of a nuclear triad, as in the case of the nuclear weapons owned by the United States, Russia, the People's Republic of China and India. Other countries, such as the United Kingdom and France, have only sea- and air-based nuclear weapons.\\r\\nJentleson et al. provide further detail in relation to these factors.[8] Firstly, proportionality refers to the relationship between the defending state's scope and nature of the objectives being pursued, and the instruments available for use to pursue this. The more the defending state demands of another state, the higher that state's costs of compliance and the greater need for the defending state's strategy to increase the costs of noncompliance and the benefits of compliance. This is a challenge, as deterrence is, by definition, a strategy of limited means. George (1991) goes on to explain that deterrence may, but is not required to, go beyond threats to the actual use of military force; but if force is actually used, it must be limited and fall short of full-scale use or war otherwise it fails.[9] The main source of disproportionality is an objective that goes beyond policy change to regime change. This has been seen in the cases of Libya, Iraq, and North Korea where defending states have sought to change the leadership of a state in addition to policy changes relating primarily to their nuclear weapons programs.\\r\\nSecondly, Jentleson et al.[8] outline that reciprocity involves an explicit understanding of linkage between the defending state's carrots and the attacking state's concessions. The balance lies neither in offering too little too late or for too much in return, not offering too much too soon or for too little return.\\r\\nFinally, coercive credibility requires that, in addition to calculations about costs and benefits of cooperation, the defending state convincingly conveys to the attacking state that non-cooperation has consequences. Threats, uses of force, and other coercive instruments such as economic sanctions must be sufficiently credible to raise the attacking state's perceived costs of noncompliance. A defending state having a superior military capability or economic strength in itself is not enough to ensure credibility. Indeed, all three elements of a balanced deterrence strategy are more likely to be achieved if other major international actors like the United Nations or NATO are supportive and if opposition within the defending state's domestic politics is limited.\\r\\nThe other important consideration outlined by Jentleson et al.[8] that must be taken into consideration is the domestic political and economic conditions within the attacking state affecting its vulnerability to deterrence policies, and the attacking state's ability to compensate unfavourable power balances. The first factor is whether internal political support and regime security are better served by defiance, or if there are domestic political gains to be made from improving relations with the defending state. The second factor is an economic calculation of the costs that military force, sanctions, and other coercive instruments can impose, and the benefits that trade and other economic incentives may carry. This in part is a function of the strength and flexibility of the attacking state's domestic economy and its capacity to absorb or counter the costs being imposed. The third factor is the role of elites and other key domestic political figures within the attacking state. To the extent these actors' interests are threatened with the defending state's demands, they act to prevent or block the defending state's demands.\\r\\nThe predominant approach to theorizing about deterrence has entailed the use of rational choice and game-theoretic models of decision making (see game theory). Deterrence theorists have consistently argued that deterrence success is more likely if a defending state's deterrent threat is credible to an attacking state. Huth[7] outlines that a threat is considered credible if the defending state possesses both the military capabilities to inflict substantial costs on an attacking state in an armed conflict, and if the attacking state believes that the defending state is resolved to use its available military forces. Huth[7] goes on to explain the four key factors for consideration under rational deterrence theory being (i) the military balance; (ii) signaling and bargaining power; (iii) reputations for resolve; and (iv) interests at stake.\\r\\nDeterrence is often directed against state leaders who have specific territorial goals that they seek to attain either by seizing disputed territory in a limited military attack or by occupying disputed territory after the decisive defeat of the adversary's armed forces. In either case, the strategic orientation of potential attacking states is generally short term and driven by concerns about military cost and effectiveness. For successful deterrence, defending states need the military capacity to respond quickly and in strength to a range of contingencies. Where deterrence often fails is when either a defending state or an attacking state under or overestimate the others' ability to undertake a particular course of action.\\r\\nThe central problem for a state that seeks to communicate a credible deterrent threat through diplomatic or military actions is that all defending states have an incentive to act as if they are determined to resist an attack, in the hope that the attacking state will back away from military conflict with a seemingly resolved adversary. If all defending states have such incentives, then potential attacking states may discount statements made by defending states along with any movement of military forces as merely bluffs. In this regards, rational deterrence theorists have argued that costly signals are required to communicate the credibility of a defending state's resolve. Costly signals are those actions and statements that clearly increase the risk of a military conflict and also increase the costs of backing down from a deterrent threat. States that are bluffing are unwilling to cross a certain threshold of threat and military action for fear of committing themselves to an armed conflict.\\r\\nThere are three different arguments that have been developed in relation to the role of reputations in influencing deterrence outcomes. The first argument focuses on a defending state's past behaviour in international disputes and crises, which creates strong beliefs in a potential attacking state about the defending state's expected behaviour in future conflicts. The credibilities of a defending state's policies are arguably linked over time, and reputations for resolve have a powerful causal impact on an attacking state's decision whether to challenge either general or immediate deterrence. The second approach argues that reputations have a limited impact on deterrence outcomes because the credibility of deterrence is heavily determined by the specific configuration of military capabilities, interests at stake, and political constraints faced by a defending state in a given situation of attempted deterrence. The argument of this school of thought is that potential attacking states are not likely to draw strong inferences about a defending states resolve from prior conflicts because potential attacking states do not believe that a defending state's past behaviour is a reliable predictor of future behaviour. The third approach is a middle ground between the first two approaches. It argues that potential attacking states are likely to draw reputational inferences about resolve from the past behaviour of defending states only under certain conditions. The insight is the expectation that decision makers will use only certain types of information when drawing inferences about reputations, and an attacking state updates and revises its beliefs when the unanticipated behaviour of a defending state cannot be explained by case-specific variables. An example both shows that the problem extends to the perception of the third parties as well as main adversaries and underlies the way in which attempts at deterrence can not only fail but backfire if the assumptions about the others' perceptions are incorrect.[10]\\r\\nAlthough costly signaling and bargaining power are more well established arguments in rational deterrence theory, the interests of defending states are not as well known, and attacking states may look beyond the short term bargaining tactics of a defending state and seek to determine what interests are at stake for the defending state that would justify the risks of a military conflict. The argument here is that defending states that have greater interests at stake in a dispute are more resolved to use force and be more willing to endure military losses to secure those interests. Even less well established arguments are the specific interests that are more salient to state leaders such as military interests versus economic interests.\\r\\nFurthermore, Huth[7] argues that both supporters and critics of rational deterrence theory agree that an unfavourable assessment of the domestic and international status quo by state leaders can undermine or severely test the success of deterrence. In a rational choice approach, if the expected utility of not using force is reduced by a declining status quo position, then deterrence failure is more likely, since the alternative option of using force becomes relatively more attractive.\\r\\nIn 1966 Schelling[2] is prescriptive in outlining the impact of the development of nuclear weapons in the analysis of military power and deterrence. In his 1966 analysis, before the widespread use of assured second strike capability, or immediate reprisal, in the form of SSBN submarines, Schelling argues that nuclear weapons give nations the potential to not only destroy their enemies but humanity itself without drawing immediate reprisal because of the lack of a conceivable defense system and the speed with which nuclear weapons can be deployed. A nation's credible threat of such severe damage empowers their deterrence policies and fuels political coercion and military deadlock, which in turn can produce proxy warfare.\\r\\nHistorical analysis of nuclear weapons deterrent capabilities has led modern researchers to the concept of the stability-instability paradox, whereby nuclear weapons confer large scale stability between nuclear weapon states, as in over 60 years none have engaged in large direct warfare due primarily to nuclear weapons deterrence capabilities, but instead are forced into pursuing political aims by military means in the form of comparatively smaller scale acts of instability, such as proxy wars and minor conflicts.\\r\\nUnited States policy of deterrence during the Cold War underwent significant variations. The early stages of the Cold War were generally characterized by ideology of containment, an aggressive stance on behalf of the United States especially regarding developing nations under their sphere of influence. This period was characterized by numerous proxy wars throughout most of the globe, particularly Africa, Asia, Central America, and South America. A notable such conflict was the Korean War. In contrast to general opinion, George F. Kennan, who is taken to be the founder of this ideology in his Long Telegram, asserted that his ideas had been misinterpreted and that he never advocated military intervention, merely economic support.\\r\\nWith the U.S. drawdown from Vietnam, the normalization of U.S. relations with China, and the Sino-Soviet Split, the policy of Containment was abandoned and a new policy of dtente was established, whereby peaceful coexistence was sought between the United States and the Soviet Union. Although all factors listed above contributed to this shift, the most important factor was probably the rough parity achieved in stockpiling nuclear weapons with the clear capability of Mutual Assured Destruction (MAD). Therefore, the period of dtente was characterized by a general reduction in the tension between the Soviet Union and the United States and a thawing of the Cold War, lasting from the late 1960s until the start of the 1980s. The doctrine of mutual nuclear deterrence characterized relations between the United States and the Soviet Union during this period, and present relations with Russia.\\r\\nA third shift occurred with President Ronald Reagan's arms build-up during the 1980s. Reagan attempted to justify this policy in part due to concerns of growing Soviet influence in Latin America and the new republic of Iran, established after the Iranian Revolution of 1979. Similar to the old policy of containment, the United States funded several proxy wars, including support for Saddam Hussein of Iraq during the IranÿIraq War, support for the mujahideen in Afghanistan, who were fighting for independence from the Soviet Union, and several anti-communist movements in Latin America such as the overthrow of the Sandinista government in Nicaragua. The funding of the Contras in Nicaragua led to the Iran-Contra Affair, while overt support led to a ruling from the International Court of Justice against the United States in Nicaragua v. United States.\\r\\nWhile the army was dealing with the breakup of the Soviet Union and the spread of nuclear technology to other nations beyond the United States and Russia, the concept of deterrence took on a broader multinational dimension. The U.S. policy on postÿCold War deterrence was outlined in 1995 in a document called \\"Essentials of PostÿCold War Deterrence\\".[11] This document explains that while relations with Russia continue to follow the traditional characteristics of Mutual Nuclear Deterrence, due to both nations continuing MAD, U.S. policy of deterrence towards nations with minor nuclear capabilities should ensure through threats of immense retaliation (or even preemptive action) that they do not threaten the United States, its interests, or allies. The document explains that such threats must also be used to ensure that nations without nuclear technology refrain from developing nuclear weapons and that a universal ban precludes any nation from maintaining chemical or biological weapons. The current tensions with Iran and North Korea over their nuclear programs are due in part to the continuation of this policy of deterrence.\\r\\nDeterrence theory is criticized for its assumptions about opponent rationales.\\r\\nFirst, it is argued that suicidal or psychotic opponents may not be deterred by either forms of deterrence.[12] Second, if two enemy states both possess nuclear weapons, Country X may try to gain a first-strike advantage by suddenly launching weapons at Country Y, with a view to destroying its enemy's nuclear launch silos thereby rendering Country Y incapable of a response. Third, diplomatic misunderstandings and/or opposing political ideologies may lead to escalating mutual perceptions of threat, and a subsequent arms race that elevates the risk of actual war, a scenario illustrated in the movies WarGames (1983) and Dr. Strangelove (1964). An arms race is inefficient in its optimal output, as all countries involved expend resources on armaments that would not have been created if the others had not expended resources, a form of positive feedback. Fourth, escalation of perceived threat can make it easier for certain measures to be inflicted on a population by its government, such as restrictions on civil liberties, the creation of a militaryÿindustrial complex, and military expenditures resulting in higher taxes and increasing budget deficits.\\r\\nIn recent years, many mainstream politicians, academic analysts, and retired military leaders have also criticised deterrence and advocated nuclear disarmament. Sam Nunn, William Perry, Henry Kissinger, and George Shultz have all called upon governments to embrace the vision of a world free of nuclear weapons, and in three Wall Street Journal opeds proposed an ambitious program of urgent steps to that end. The four have created the Nuclear Security Project to advance this agenda. Organisations such as Global Zero, an international non-partisan group of 300 world leaders dedicated to achieving nuclear disarmament, have also been established.[13] In 2010, the four were featured in a documentary film entitled Nuclear Tipping Point. The film is a visual and historical depiction of the ideas laid forth in the Wall Street Journal op-eds and reinforces their commitment to a world without nuclear weapons and the steps that can be taken to reach that goal.[14][15]\\r\\nFormer Secretary Kissinger puts the new danger, which cannot be addressed by deterrence, this way: \\"The classical notion of deterrence was that there was some consequences before which aggressors and evildoers would recoil. In a world of suicide bombers, that calculation doesn't operate in any comparable way.\\"[16] Shultz has said, \\"If you think of the people who are doing suicide attacks, and people like that get a nuclear weapon, they are almost by definition not deterrable\\".[17]\\r\\nAs opposed to the extreme mutually assured destruction form of deterrence, the concept of minimum deterrence in which a state possesses no more nuclear weapons than is necessary to deter an adversary from attacking is presently the most common form of deterrence practiced by nuclear weapon states, such as China, India, Pakistan, Britain, and France.[18] Pursuing minimal deterrence during arms negotiations between United States and Russia allows each state to make nuclear stockpile reductions without the state becoming vulnerable, however it has been noted that there comes a point where further reductions may be undesirable, once minimal deterrence is reached, as further reductions beyond this point increase a state's vulnerability and provide an incentive for an adversary to secretly expand its nuclear arsenal.[19]\\r\\n\\"Senior European statesmen and women\\" called for further action in addressing problems of nuclear weapons proliferation in 2010. They said: \\"Nuclear deterrence is a far less persuasive strategic response to a world of potential regional nuclear arms races and nuclear terrorism than it was to the cold war\\".[5]\\r\\nPaul Virilio has criticized nuclear deterrence as anachronistic in the age of information warfare since disinformation and kompromat are the current threats to suggestible populations. The wound inflicted on unsuspecting populations he calls an \\"integral accident\\":","input":"What is the main premise of deterrence theory?"},{"output":"By the late 19th century","context":"Obstetrics is the field of study concentrated on pregnancy, childbirth, and the postpartum period. As a medical specialty, obstetrics is combined with gynecology under the discipline known as obstetrics and gynaecology (OB/GYN) which is a surgical field.\\r\\n\\r\\nPrenatal care is important in screening for various complications of pregnancy.

The newer integrated screen (formerly called F.A.S.T.E.R for First And Second Trimester Early Results) can be done at 10 plus weeks to 13 plus weeks with an ultrasound of the fetal neck (thicker nuchal skin correlates with higher risk of Down syndrome being present) and two chemicals (analytes) PAPP-A and HCG (pregnancy hormone level itself). It gives an accurate risk profile very early. A second blood screen at 15 to 20 weeks refines the risk more accurately. The cost is higher than an \\"AFP-quad\\" screen due to the ultrasound and second blood test, but it is quoted to have a 93% pick up rate as opposed to 88% for the standard AFP/QS. This is an evolving standard of care in the United States.\\r\\n\\r\\nMost doctors do a sugar load in a drink form of 50?grams of glucose in cola, lime or orange and draw blood an hour later (plus or minus 5 minutes)?; the standard modified criteria have been lowered to 135 since the late 1980s\\r\\n\\r\\nObstetric ultrasonography is routinely used for dating the gestational age of a pregnancy from the size of the fetus, determine the number of fetuses and placentae, evaluate for an ectopic pregnancy and first trimester bleeding, the most accurate dating being in first trimester before the growth of the foetus has been significantly influenced by other factors. Ultrasound is also used for detecting congenital anomalies (or other foetal anomalies) and determining the biophysical profiles (BPP), which are generally easier to detect in the second trimester when the foetal structures are larger and more developed. Specialised ultrasound equipment can also evaluate the blood flow velocity in the umbilical cord, looking to detect a decrease/absence/reversal or diastolic blood flow in the umbilical artery.\\r\\n\\r\\nX-rays and computerized tomography (CT) are not used, especially in the first trimester, due to the ionizing radiation, which has teratogenic effects on the foetus. No effects of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) on the foetus have been demonstrated,[1] but this technique is too expensive for routine observation. Instead, obstetric ultrasonography is the imaging method of choice in the first trimester and throughout the pregnancy, because it emits no radiation, is portable, and allows for realtime imaging.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe safety of frequent ultrasound scanning has not be confirmed. Despite this, increasing numbers of women are choosing to have additional scans for no medical purpose, such as gender scans, 3D and 4D scans. A normal gestation would reveal a gestational sac, yolk sac, and fetal pole. The gestational age can be assessed by evaluating the mean gestational sac diameter (MGD) before week 6, and the crown-rump length after week 6. Multiple gestation is evaluated by the number of placentae and amniotic sacs present.\\r\\n\\r\\nOther tools used for assessment include:\\r\\n\\r\\nA pregnant woman may have intercurrent diseases, that is, other diseases or conditions (not directly caused by the pregnancy) that may become worse or be a potential risk to the pregnancy.\\r\\n\\r\\nInduction is a method of artificially or prematurely stimulating labour in a woman.

The infant's health is also monitored.\\r\\n\\r\\nCertain things must be kept in mind as the physician proceeds with the post-natal care.\\r\\n\\r\\nPrior to the 18th century, caring for pregnant women in Europe was confined exclusively to women, and rigorously excluded men. The expectant mother would invite close female friends and family members to her home to keep her company during childbirth.[3] Skilled midwives managed all aspects of the labour and delivery. The presence of physicians and surgeons was very rare and only occurred if a serious complication had taken place and the midwife had exhausted all measures at her disposal. Calling a surgeon was very much a last resort and having men deliver women in this era was seen as offending female modesty.[4][5]\\r\\n\\r\\nPrior to the 18th and 19th centuries, midwifery was well established but obstetrics was not recognized as a specific medical specialty. However, the subject matter and interest in the female reproductive system and sexual practice can be traced back to Ancient Egypt[6]  and Ancient Greece.[7] Soranus of Ephesus sometimes is called the most important figure in ancient gynecology. Living in the late first century A.D. and early second century, he studied anatomy and had opinions and techniques on abortion, contraception?ÿmost notably coitus interruptusÿ and birth complications. After his death, techniques and works of gynecology declined; very little of his works were recorded and survived to the late 18th century when gynaecology and obstetrics reemerged as a medical specialism.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 18th century marked the beginning of many advances in European midwifery, based on better knowledge of the physiology of pregnancy and labour. By the end of the century, medical professionals began to understand the anatomy of the uterus and the physiological changes that take place during labour. The introduction of  forceps in childbirth also took place at this time. All these medical advances in obstetrics were a lever for the introduction of men into an arena previously managed and run by womenmidwifery.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe addition of the male-midwife (or man-midwife) is historically a significant change to the profession of obstetrics. In the 18th century medical men began to train in area of childbirth and believed with their advanced knowledge in anatomy that childbirth could be improved. In France these male-midwives were referred to as accoucheurs, a title later used all over Europe. The founding of lying-in hospitals also contributed to the medicalization and male-dominance of obstetrics. These early maternity hospitals were establishments where women would come to have their babies delivered, as opposed to the practice since time immemorial of the midwife attending the home of the woman in labour. This institution provided male-midwives with endless patients to practice their techniques on and was a way for these men to demonstrate their knowledge.[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nMany midwives of the time bitterly opposed the involvement of men in childbirth. Some male practitioners also opposed the involvement of medical men like themselves in midwifery and even went as far as to say that male-midwives only undertook midwifery solely for perverse erotic satisfaction. The accoucheurs argued that their involvement in midwifery was to improve the process of childbirth. These men also believed that obstetrics would forge ahead and continue to strengthen.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\n18th century physicians expected that obstetrics would continue to grow, but the opposite happened. Obstetrics entered a stage of stagnation in the 19th century, which lasted until about the 1880s.[3] The central explanation for the lack of advancement during this time was the rejection of obstetrics by the medical community. The 19th century marked an era of medical reform in Europe and increased regulation over the profession. Major European institutions such as The College of Physicians and Surgeons[disambiguation needed][where?] considered delivering babies ungentlemanly work and refused to have anything to do with childbirth as a whole. Even when Medical Act 1858 was introduced, which stated that medical students could qualify as doctors, midwifery was entirely ignored. This made it nearly impossible to pursue an education in midwifery and also have the recognition of being a doctor or surgeon. Obstetrics was pushed to the side.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nBy the late 19th century, the foundation of modern-day obstetrics and midwifery began developing. Delivery of babies by doctors became popular and readily accepted, but midwives continued to play a role in childbirth. Midwifery also changed during this era due to increased regulation and the eventual need for midwives to become certified. Many European countries by the late 19th century were monitoring the training of midwives and issued certification based on competency. Midwives were no longer uneducated in the formal sense.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs midwifery began to develop, so did the profession of obstetrics near the end of the century. Childbirth was no longer unjustifiably despised by the medical community as it once had been at the beginning of the century. But obstetrics was underdeveloped compared to other medical specialites. Many male physicians would deliver children but very few would have referred to themselves as obstetricians. The end of the 19th century did mark a significant accomplishment in the profession with the advancements in asepsis and anaesthesia, which paved the way for the mainstream introduction and later success of the Caesarean Section.[12][13]\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore the 1880s mortality rates in lying-hospitals would reach unacceptably high levels and became an area of public concern. Much of these maternal deaths were due to puerperal fever, then known as childbed fever. In the 1800s Dr. Ignaz Semmelweis noticed that women giving birth at home had a much lower incidence of childbed fever than those giving birth by physicians in lying-hospitals. His investigation discovered that washing hands with an antiseptic solution before a delivery reduced childbed fever fatalities by 90%.[14] So it was concluded that it was physicians who had been spreading disease from one labouring mother to the next. Despite the publication of this information, doctors still would not wash. It was not until the 20th century when advancements in aseptic technique and the understanding of disease would play a significant role in the decrease of maternal mortality rates among many populations.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe development of obstetrics as a practice for accredited doctors happened at the turn of the 18th century and thus was very differently developed in Europe and in the Americas due to the independence of many countries in the Americas from European powers. Unlike in Europe and the British Isles, where midwifery laws were national, in America, midwifery laws were local and varied widely.[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nGynaecology and Obstetrics gained attention in the American medical field at the end of the nineteenth century through the development of such procedures as the ovariotomy. These procedures then were shared with European surgeons who replicated the surgeries. This was a period when antiseptic, aseptic or anaesthetic measures were just being introduced to surgical and observational procedures and without these procedures surgeries were dangerous and often fatal. Following are two surgeons noted for their contributions to these fields include Ephraim McDowell and James Marion Sims.\\r\\n\\r\\nEphraim McDowell developed a surgical practice in 1795 and performed the first ovariotomy in 1809 on a 47-year-old widow who then lived on for thirty-one more years. He had attempted to share this with John Bell whom he had practiced under who had retired to Italy. Bell was said to have died without seeing the document but it was published by an associate in Extractions of Diseased Ovaria in 1825. By the mid-century the surgery was both successfully and unsuccessfully being performed. Pennsylvanian surgeons the Attlee brothers made this procedure very routine for a total of 465 surgeriesÿJohn Attlee performed 64 successfully of 78 while his brother William reported 387ÿ between the years of 1843 and 1883. By the middle of the nineteenth century this procedure was successfully performed in Europe by English surgeons Sir Spencer Wells and Charles Clay as well as French surgeons Eugne Koeberl, Auguste Nlaton and Jules Pan.[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nJ. Marion Sims was the surgeon responsible for being the first treating a vesicovaginal fistula [16]ÿa condition linked to many caused mainly by prolonged pressing of the feotus against the pelvis or other causes such as rape, hysterectomy, or other operationsÿ and also having been doctor to many European royals and the 20th President of the United States James A. Garfield after he had been shot. Sims does have a controversial medical past. Under the beliefs at the time about pain and the prejudice towards African people, he had practiced his surgical skills and developed skills on slaves.[17] These women were the first patients of modern gynecology. One of the women he operated on was named Anarcha Westcott, the woman he first treated for a fistula.[18]\\r\\n\\r\\nWomen and men inhabited very different roles in natal care up to the 18th century. The role of a physician was exclusively held by men who went to university, an overly male institution, who would theorize anatomy and the process of reproduction based on theological teaching and philosophy. Many beliefs about the female body and menstruation in the 17th and 18th centuries were inaccurate; clearly resulting from the lack of literature about the practice.[19] Many of the theories of what caused menstruation prevailed from Hippocratic philosophy.[20] Midwives of this time were those assisted in the birth and care of both born and unborn children, and as the name suggests, this position was held mainly by women.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the birth of a child, men were rarely present. Women from the neighbourhood or family would join in on the process of birth and assist in many different ways. The one position where men would help with the birth of a child would be in the sitting position, usually when performed on the side of a bed to support the mother.[21]\\r\\n\\r\\nMen were introduced into the field of obstetrics in the nineteenth century and resulted in a change of the focus of this profession. Gynaecology directly resulted as a new and separate field of study from obstetrics and focused on the curing of illness and indispositions of female sexual organs. This had some relevance to some conditions as menopause, uterine and cervical problems, and childbirth could leave the mother in need of extensive surgery to repair tissue. But, there was also a large blame of the uterus for completely unrelated conditions. This led to many social consequences of the nineteenth century.[19]","input":"When did the field of obstetrics first emerge in the field of medicine?"},{"output":"Thon Maker","context":"The NBA high school draftees are players who have been drafted to the National Basketball Association (NBA) straight out of high school without playing basketball at the collegiate level. The process of jumping directly from high school to the professional level is also known as going prep-to-pro. Since 2006, the practice of drafting high school players has been prohibited by the new collective bargaining agreement, which requires that players who entered the draft be 19 years of age and at least one year removed from high school.[1] Contrary to popular belief, the player does not have to play at least a year in college basketball, as the player can choose to instead play in another professional league (especially overseas) like Brandon Jennings or Emmanuel Mudiay in Italy and China respectively, simply take the year off, such as the case with Satnam Singh Bhamara, or even hold themselves back a year in high school before declaring for the draft, such as the case with Thon Maker.\\r\\nThe NBA has long had a preference for players who played basketball at the collegiate level;[2] the vast majority of players to play in the NBA have had college experience. However, there have been numerous notable players who attended high school in the United States and then jumped directly to the NBA without playing college basketball.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the early years of the NBA draft, a player had to finish his four-year college eligibility to be eligible for selection. Reggie Harding, who had graduated from high school but did not enroll in a college, became the first player drafted out of high school when the Detroit Pistons selected him in the fourth round of the 1962 draft.[3] However, the NBA rules at that time prohibited a high school player to play in the league until one year after his high school class graduated.[4][5] Thus, he spent a year playing in a minor basketball league before he was drafted again in the 1963 draft by the Pistons.[6] He finally entered the league in the 1963ÿ64 season and played four seasons in the NBA and American Basketball Association (ABA).[7]\\r\\nIn 1971, the U.S. Supreme Court decision Haywood v. National Basketball Association ruled, 7ÿ2 against the National Basketball Association's requirement that a player must wait four years after high school graduation (which in most cases was spent playing in college) before turning professional. This ruling allowed players to enter the NBA Draft without four years of college, provided they could give evidence of hardship to the NBA office.[8]\\r\\nIn 1974, the NBA's rival, the ABA, drafted high school star Moses Malone. He was immediately signed by the Utah Stars and became the first player to go directly from high school basketball to a professional league.[9] He became an instant success, averaging 18 points and 14 rebounds per game in his rookie season. He played in the ABA until the ABAÿNBA merger in 1976. He then played 19 successful seasons with 7 NBA teams. He won the NBA championship, along with the Finals Most Valuable Player Award, with the Philadelphia 76ers in 1983. His other achievements include 3 Most Valuable Player Awards, 12 consecutive All-Star Game selections, 8 All-NBA Team selections and 6 rebounding titles. He has been inducted to the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame and was also named in the 50 Greatest Players in NBA History list announced at the league's 50th anniversary in 1996.[10]\\r\\nA year later, two high school players, Darryl Dawkins and Bill Willoughby, applied for hardship and were declared eligible to be selected in the 1975 draft.[11] They had applied and gave evidence of financial hardship to the league, which granted them the right to start earning their living by starting their professional careers earlier.[8] Dawkins was selected 5th by the Philadelphia 76ers while Willoughby was selected 19th by the Atlanta Hawks. Dawkins played 14 seasons and averaged 12 points and 6 rebounds per game. Willoughby played 8 seasons with 6 different teams and averaged only 6 points per game. Neither player reached the level of success that was expected. It is argued that they could have been better players if they had college basketball experience before entering the NBA.[12][13][14]\\r\\nAfter Dawkins and Willoughby, no high schoolers were drafted for 14 years, though several players entered the league without playing college basketball. One notable player, Shawn Kemp, enrolled in college but never played any games due to personal problems. In 1989, a year after his high school graduation, he was drafted by the Seattle SuperSonics.[15] He played 14 seasons in the NBA and was selected to 6 All-Star Games and 3 All-NBA Teams.[16]\\r\\nIn 1995, Kevin Garnett, USA Today's high school basketball player of the year, announced his intentions to forgo college, and declared himself eligible for the 1995 NBA draft. The move was highly controversial; the conventional wisdom at the time was that high-schoolers were neither emotionally nor physically mature enough for the rigors of the NBA game. On draft day, Garnett was selected with the #5 pick in the first round by the Minnesota Timberwolves. Garnett led the Timberwolves to eight consecutive playoff berths and was a multiple All-Star during his time with the team. In 2004, the Wolves advanced to the Western Conference Finals before losing to the Lakers; Garnett was named Most Valuable Player that year. After a trade in the 2007 offseason to the Boston Celtics, he was a core player in the Celtics' first NBA title in over 20 years.\\r\\nIn 1996, two notable players made the jump from high school to the NBA. The first was Kobe Bryant, selected by the Charlotte Hornets with the 13th pick of the NBA draft, but traded almost immediately to the Los Angeles Lakers. The second was Jermaine O'Neal, selected by the Trail Blazers with the 17th pick. O'Neal was traded in 2000 to the Indiana Pacers (and later to the Miami Heat). In 1997, another All-Star caliber player, Tracy McGrady, was selected by the Toronto Raptors. In 1998, three high-schoolers were drafted with Al Harrington and Rashard Lewis experiencing the most success. Darius Miles became the highest high school player selected with the third pick in the 2000, until the following year.\\r\\nIn 2001, Kwame Brown (selected by the Washington Wizards) became the first high-schooler to be selected with the number one pick in the draft; since then, LeBron James (2003) and Dwight Howard (2004) have also been selected with the first pick. Other notable high-schoolers include Tyson Chandler and Eddy Curry (2001); Amar'e Stoudemire (2002); Josh Smith, Sebastian Telfair, J. R. Smith, and Shaun Livingston (2004); Andrew Bynum and Monta Ellis (2005).\\r\\nMany prep-to-pro players like Kevin Garnett, Kobe Bryant, LeBron James, and Tracy Mcgrady went on to become star players in the NBA. Kevin Garnett, Kobe Bryant, LeBron James have all won the league's MVP Award; as well as holding at least one NBA title under their belt, and are widely regarded as future Hall-of-Famers. Dwight Howard, Jermaine O'Neal and Amar'e Stoudemire also became perennial All-Stars in their prime. However, not all high-schoolers were successful. Kwame Brown and Eddy Curry are widely regarded as draft busts, while Jonathan Bender and Darius Miles had their careers cut short by injury. Korleone Young (drafted in 1998) and Leon Smith (drafted in 1999) only played a handful of games in the NBA, while Lenny Cooke and DeAngelo Collins, both of whom declared for the 2002 Draft, went undrafted and never played in the NBA.\\r\\nBeginning 2005, both the NBA and the players' union started to discuss the possibility of implementing a new age limit. The league lobbied for an age minimum of 20 while the union was against an age limit.[17] Finally in July 2005, both sides compromised in the new collective bargaining agreement, requiring that the minimum age for entry into the NBA be 19 and that entrants be at least one year removed from high school.[18] For the first time, teams are also allowed to send players, with two years of NBA experience or less, to the NBA Development League (NBA D-League).[17]\\r\\nThe terms of the new agreement ended the practice of drafting high school players, starting in the 2006 Draft. A high school player must wait at least a year to be eligible for selection. However, they are not required to spend that year in college. In 2008, high school star Brandon Jennings decided to skip college and play professional basketball in Italy. After a year, he was eligible for the 2009 draft and was selected 10th by the Milwaukee Bucks.[19] In the 2010 draft, Latavious Williams, who did not qualify academically to go to college, spent a year playing in the NBA D-League before he was drafted in the second round.[20] Emmanuel Mudiay decided to take a route similar to that of Brandon Jennings by skipping college to play professionally in China in 2014 before being selected by the Denver Nuggets at pick 7 a year later. In the 2015 draft, Satnam Singh Bhamara, who did not qualify academically to go to college, went straight to the NBA draft as a post-graduate after being at IMG Academy for five years. He would be taken by the Dallas Mavericks with the 52nd pick in the draft, thus becoming the first high school student to be drafted since the rule changes. Most recently, in the 2016 draft, one of the Topÿ10 players that was declared eligible for NCAA play in 2016, Thon Maker, decided to enter the draft instead as a post-graduate from Orangeville Prep in Orangeville, Ontario, Canada due to him originally declaring himself as eligible for college in 2015. Thon would also mark the first player to be drafted directly from a Canadian high school, as well as the second player to enter as a post-graduate. He'd also be the first high schooler to be drafted in the first round since 2005. He would be drafted by the Milwaukee Bucks with the tenth pick in the draft, becoming the first high school student to be taken in the first round in that range since 2005.\\r\\nSome players support the new age limit. Gerald Green called it \\"a smart move\\", saying that \\"[not everybody is] LeBron James ... He came in ready and he dominated the league. There's a lot of players that have to get developed. Me, I've got to get developed. But I guess that age limit, that one year of college experience, can get you more developed and I think that's pretty good.\\"[17] Others, however, strongly criticize the rule. Andrew Bynum said \\"That's something I'll never understand. Because in no other business can the owner, or a stock trader or a C.E.O. of a company try to protect themselves by putting rules like that.\\"[21] Former Florida Gators and current Oklahoma City Thunder head coach Billy Donovan believed that the rule made high schoolers feel like they were being punished.[22]\\r\\nThere have been 44 high school draftees in the NBA Draft. Three draftees were selected first overall; Kwame Brown in 2001 NBA draft, LeBron James in 2003 and Dwight Howard in 2004 NBA draft. Two draftees went on to win the Rookie of the Year Award in their first season; LeBron James and 2002 draftee Amar'e Stoudemire.[23] Three draftees went on to win the Most Valuable Player Award; Kevin Garnett in 2004, Kobe Bryant in 2008 and LeBron James in 2009, 2010, 2012, and 2013.[24] Ten draftees have been selected to the All-Star Game while seven draftees have been selected to the All-NBA Team.\\r\\n^?1:?Reggie Harding played and graduated from Detroit Eastern High School in January but he played high school basketball in Nashville, Tennessee prior to the draft.[70][71]\\r\\n^?2:?While Ndudi Ebi was originally born and raised in London, England, he also holds Nigerian nationality due to his parents being born and raised there.\\r\\n^?3:?Andray Blatche was born and raised in Syracuse, New York and holds American nationality, but he had become a naturalized Filipino since June 2014 and has officially represented the Philippines since.\\r\\n^?4:?Satnam Singh officially marks the first ever player to be taken from India in the NBA. He also marks the first time since 2005 after their latest ruling on high school players that someone directly from high school would be taken in the draft, albeit as a postgraduate senior.\\r\\n^?5:?Thon Maker was born in Wau, Sudan at the time, but Wau has now since become a part of South Sudan instead due to war. Even then, though, he would be raised as an Australian representative.\\r\\n^?6:?Thon Maker would become the first high schooler (and second overall high school postgraduate student) to be selected from the nation of Canada instead of somewhere in the United States of America. Also, while Thon attended classes at Orangeville Prep, he would play basketball games for the Athlete Institute nearby in Mono, Ontario as well.\\r\\nThe following players also played in the NBA or were drafted without playing college basketball; however, these players did not get drafted or join the NBA directly after their high school graduation.\\r\\n^?5:?Secondary source mentions that Connie Simmons attended Forest Hills High School (Queens, New York).[76]\\r\\nDespite the success of some high school players drafted, the entry of high school players into the NBA remains controversial. Critics say that high school players are not mentally and physically mature or prepared enough to handle the pressure of professional play. Thus, they are more likely to fail.[14][102] Instead, they believe that colleges are useful at filtering out players who can dominate against weak competition in high school, but cannot succeed at a higher level of play. They also think that the influx of high schoolers bypassing colleges in favor of the NBA has caused collegiate game to deteriorate. Universities are wary of spending time recruiting as many players that are motivated financially to turn pro fresh out of high school.[102][103]\\r\\nOn the other hand, proponents argue that there is no valid reason to exclude high school players. Michael McCann, writer of law article \\"Illegal Defense: The Irrational Economics of Banning High School Players from the NBA Draft\\", contends that players drafted straight out of high school can do as well as any other players in the NBA. The article finds that \\"on average, these [high school] players perform better in every major statistical category than does the average NBA player\\".[104] Others instead believe that the problem was due to the lack of established farm system in basketball until recently. In other major sports, such as baseball and hockey, it is common for young players to develop in their minor league systems.[102]\\r\\n1961\\r\\n1966\\r\\n1967\\r\\n1968\\r\\n1970\\r\\n1974\\r\\n1980\\r\\n1988\\r\\n1989\\r\\n1995\\r\\n2004","input":"Who was the last high school player drafted?"},{"output":"John McKay","context":"The Tampa Bay Buccaneers are a professional American football team based in Tampa, Florida.

Only 5.4% of eligible Girl Scouts successfully earn the Gold Award.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nGirl Scout's highest award was created in 1916, and has gone through numerous changes over the years.\\r\\nThis award was a pin of an eagle with its wings spread, on a red, white, and blue ribbon.[2][3]\\r\\nIn 1919 the name of the award was changed to the Golden Eaglet. Requirements for the award ranged through the years from earning 14 out of 17 specific badges, earning the Medal of Merit, earning a different number of badges, and the acceptance of a letter of Commendation instead of the Medal of Merit. The award itself changed from the spread-winged eagle and ribbon to an eagle with half-furled wings and a \\"G\\" and an \\"S\\" on either side of its head.[2]\\r\\nThe founder of Girl Scouts, Juliette Gordon Low, wrote in November 1923: The five requirements for winning the Golden Eaglet are character, health, handicraft, happiness and service, and that others will expect to find in our Golden Eaglet a perfect specimen of girlhood: mentally, morally, and physically.[3]\\r\\nIn 1938 the Golden Eaglet changed to the First Class Award.[4]\\r\\nThis award was earned by Intermediate Scouts who had already earned the First Class Award, and was the way to bridge to Senior rank. Because of the shortage of metal during WWII, at first the award was a curved embroidered patch worn on the uniform. In 1947, the Curved Bar pin was introduced.[5]\\r\\nIn 1963 the award went back to being called First Class.[4] Requirements for earning the First Class Award changed over the 17 years it was offered. Beginning in 1963, Cadette Scouts were required to earn four Challenges, plus at least six badges in specific areas:\\r\\nIn 1972, eight new Challenges were offered:\\r\\nThe Scout was permitted to choose any four of the twelve Challenges.\\r\\nIn addition to the four Challenges, a Scout was required to earn at least one badge in each of six areas:\\r\\nAlternately, from 1972 to 1980, a Scout could earn any seven of the twelve Challenges, with no badge requirements.\\r\\nIn 1980 the Gold Award was introduced. In 1990, National Council Session delegates approved a proposal which would keep the name of the Gold Award in perpetuity.[7]\\r\\nUntil 2004, requirements for earning the award were:\\r\\nOnce these steps have been met, girls use their vision for change to complete a service project that reaches beyond the Girl Scout organization and provides lasting benefit to the girl's larger community. It requires a minimum of 80 hours of work in planning and actually completing the project. All of these hours must be completed by the Awardee, and though it is encouraged that the girl use troop members and others from the community to help her, their time spent does not count towards her 80-hour requirement. Plans must be developed with the aid of an advisor, then a project proposal must be submitted and approved by the girl's local council before starting the project, and a final report submitted and approved after the project's completion.\\r\\nThe Gold Award emblem is presented as a pin resembling an eight-pointed gold star with rays radiating from a central, polished trefoil.\\r\\nRecipients of the Gold Award who enlist in the U.S. Armed Forces may receive advanced rank in recognition of their achievements.[8][9][10] Some universities and colleges offer scholarships to Gold Award recipients.

It currently has a range of 1,000 products which it sells in over 3,049 owned and franchised stores internationally in 66 countries.[2] The company is based in East Croydon and Littlehampton, West Sussex.\\r\\nThe company is owned by Brazilian cosmetics company Natura. The company had been owned by the French cosmetics company L'Oral between 2006 and 2017. In June 2017, L'Oral agreed to sell the company to Natura for S880 million. The deal was approved in September 2017.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1970, Anita Roddick (then Anita Perella) visited \\"The Body Shop\\" housed in a car repairs garage in Berkeley, California selling naturally-scented soaps and lotions. The shop run by Peggy Short and Jane Saunders used natural ingredients, and helped to employ and train immigrant women. Six years later, in 1976, Roddick opened a similar shop in the UK, using the same business name, colour scheme, and cosmetic lines. In 1987, Roddick offered Short and Saunders $3.5 million to purchase the name \\"The Body Shop\\". [3][4][5] From its first launch in the UK in 1976, The Body Shop experienced rapid growth, expanding at a rate of 50 percent annually.\\r\\nThe Body Shop stock was floated on London's Unlisted Securities Market in April 1984, opening at 95p. After it obtained a full listing on the London Stock Exchange, the stock was given the nickname \\"The shares that defy gravity,\\" as its price increased by more than 500%.\\r\\nThe Body Shop turned increasingly toward social and environmental campaigns to promote its business in the late 1980s. In 1997, Roddick launched a global campaign to raise self-esteem in women and against the media stereotyping of women. It focused on unreasonably skinny models in the context of rising numbers in bulimia and anorexia.\\r\\nThe opening of Roddick's first modest shop received early attention when the Brighton newspaper, The Evening Argus, carried an article about an undertaker with a nearby store who complained about the use of the name \\"The Body Shop.\\"[6]\\r\\nIn March 2006, The Body Shop agreed to a S652.3 million takeover by L'Oral. It was reported that Anita and Gordon Roddick, who set up The Body Shop 30 years previously, made S130 million from the sale.[7]\\r\\nIn 2017, LOrel sold The Body Shop to the ethical Brazilian cosmetics B-Corp, Natura.\\r\\nThere was a media controversy surrounding claims that L'Oral continues to test on animals, which contradicts The Body Shop's core value of Against Animal Testing.\\r\\nRoddick addressed the controversy over selling The Body Shop to the world's largest cosmetics company in an interview with The Guardian,[8] which reported that \\"she sees herself as a kind of \\"trojan horse\\" who, by selling her business to a huge firm, will be able to influence the decisions it makes. Suppliers who had formerly worked with the Body Shop will in future have contracts with L'Oral, and working with the company 25 days a year Roddick was able to have an input into decisions.\\"\\r\\nFollowing her death in 2007, Prime Minister Gordon Brown paid tribute to Dame Anita, calling her \\"one of the country's true pioneers\\" and an \\"inspiration\\" to businesswomen. He said: \\"She campaigned for green issues for many years before it became fashionable to do so and inspired millions to the cause by bringing sustainable products to a mass market. She will be remembered not only as a great campaigner but also as a great entrepreneur.\\"[9][10]\\r\\nThe social activism dimension of the company first evidenced in 1986 when The Body Shop proposed an alliance with Greenpeace in the UK to save the whales. Roddick began launching other promotions tied to social causes, with much public and media interest. The Body Shop regularly featured posters on shop windows and sponsorship of local charity and community events. Over time, Roddick blossomed into a full-time critic of business in general and the cosmetic industry in particular, criticising what she considered the environmental insensitivity of the industry and traditional views of beauty, and aimed to change standard corporate practices[12] Roddick said: \\"For me, campaigning and good business is also about putting forward solutions, not just opposing destructive practices or human rights abuses\\".[13]\\r\\nThe Body Shop instituted pioneering social audits in the mid-1990s, reflecting its avowed practice of trading with communities in need and giving them a fair price for natural ingredients or handcrafts, including brazil nut oil, sesame seed oil, honey, and shea butter. The first Community Trade activity in 1987 was a wooden footsie roller which was supplied by a small community in Southern India, today known as Teddy Exports, which is still a key Community Trade supplier.[14] The Body Shop now works with 29 suppliers in over 20 different countries, benefiting 25,000 people directly each year. The Body Shop aims to double this programme to 40 ingredients by 2020.\\r\\nCriticism has been made of the programme by fair trade activists. \\"The company's prominently displayed claims claim to pay fairer prices to the Third World poor but covered less than a fraction of 1 percent of its turnover\\", wrote Paul Vallely, the former chair of Traidcraft, in the obituary of Anita Roddick published in The Independent.\\r\\nSometimes considered anti-capitalist or against globalisation,[by whom?] The Body Shop philosophy is in favour of international marketplaces.[contradictory] The chain uses its influence and profits for programmes such as Community Trade, aimed at enacting fair labour practices, safe working environments and pay equality. According to The Body Shop, 95% of the company's products contain community traded ingredients.\\r\\nThe Body Shop regularly invites employees and stakeholders to visit Community Trade suppliers to see the benefits that the Community Trade programme has brought to communities and The Body Shop products.[15]\\r\\nThe Body Shop does not export its products to China, because cosmetics sold in the country have to be tested on animals, according to Roddick.[16] However, The Body Shop has always sourced many of its baskets and other non cosmetic supplies from China.\\r\\nAs part of the Community Trade programme, The Body Shop undertakes periodic social audits of its sourcing activities through Ecocert Environment.[17]\\r\\nA campaign by Christian Peacemaker Team and other allies protested the alleged role of The Body Shop in purchasing palm oil from Daabon, a third-party supplier in Colombia, who forcefully evicted 123 families from their land at Las Pavas, Columbia on 14 July 2009.[18][19] The Body Shop initially denied intentionally purchasing palm oil from the Las Pavas area [20], but later dropped Daabon as a supplier after the company failed to provide proof that it was not involved in the land seizures.[21][22][23]\\r\\nThe Body Shop has campaigned to end animal testing in cosmetics alongside animal cruelty NGO Cruelty Free International since 1989. The company's products are non-animal tested and are certified cruelty-free by Cruelty Free Internationals Leaping Bunny[24].\\r\\nThe Body Shops campaigning has led to many changes in law. The companys campaign, Ban Animal Testing, launched in 1996 and led to a UK wide ban 8 years later. In 2013, the campaign launched as Against Animal Testing and made history when the EU banned animal testing in cosmetics, and marketing of any animal tested products.\\r\\nIn June 2017, The Body Shop and Cruelty Free International launched Forever Against Animal Testing, its largest ever campaign, aimed at banning animal testing in cosmetics everywhere and forever. The campaign aims to receive 8 million signatures which will be presented to the UN General Assembly, to call for a global ban on animal testing in cosmetics.\\r\\nIn October 2009, The Body Shop was awarded a 'Lifetime Achievement Award' by the RSPCA in Britain, in recognition of its uncompromised policy which ensures ingredients are not tested by its suppliers[25].\\r\\nThe Roddicks founded The Body Shop Foundation in 1990, which supports innovative global projects working in the areas of human and civil rights and environmental and animal protection. It is The Body Shop International Plc's charitable trust funded by annual donations from the company and through various fundraising initiatives.[26] The Body Shop Foundation was formed to consolidate all the charitable donations made by the company. To date, The Body Shop Foundation has donated over S24 million sterling in grants. The Foundation regularly gives gift-in-kind support to various projects and organisations such as Children On The Edge (COTE).[27] Approximately 65% of the grants that the company funds come to nominations from the staff, consultants or franchisers attached to the company from all over the world.\\r\\nIn 2017, The Body Shop announced its new approach to corporate philanthropy, the World Bio-Bridges Mission (Re-Wilding the World), which aims to build 10 Bio-Bridges by 2020. The purpose of the World Bio-Bridges Mission is to enrich biodiversity around the world while creating truly sustainable supply chains where possible[28].\\r\\nThe Body Shop carries a wide range of products for the body, face, hair and home. The Body Shop claims its products are \\"inspired by nature\\" and feature ingredients such as marula oil and sesame seed oil sourced through the Community Trade program.\\r\\nIn 2010, The Body Shop produced its first ECOCERT certified organic skincare line, Nutriganics. Following the launch of Nutriganics, The Body Shop reformulated their hair line to contain no colourants (Rainforest Hair Care), and produced a new line of deodorants that contain no aluminium salts, and use volcanic minerals as a substitute.\\r\\nProducts include:","input":"What type of business is the body shop?"},{"output":"first aired Sunday, December 6, 1964","context":"Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer is a 1964 Christmas stop-motion animated television special produced by Videocraft International, Ltd. (later known as Rankin/Bass Productions) and currently distributed by Universal Television. It first aired Sunday, December 6, 1964, on the NBC television network in the United States, and was sponsored by General Electric under the umbrella title of The General Electric Fantasy Hour. The special was based on the Johnny Marks song \\"Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer\\" which was itself based on the poem of the same name written in 1939 by Marks' brother-in-law, Robert L. May. Since 1972, the special has aired on CBS, with the network unveiling a high-definition, digitally remastered version of the program in 2005. As with A Charlie Brown Christmas and How the Grinch Stole Christmas, Rudolph no longer airs just once annually, but several times during the Christmas and holiday season on CBS. Unlike other holiday specials that also air on several cable channels (including Freeform), Rudolph only airs on CBS. It has been telecast every year since 1964, making it the longest continuously running Christmas TV special in history. 2014 marked the 50th anniversary of the television special[1] and a series of postage stamps featuring Rudolph was issued by the United States Postal Service on November 6, 2014.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSam the Snowman welcomes the viewers to Christmastown at the North Pole and introduces Santa and Mrs. Claus who live in a castle located north of the Christmas Tree Forest. Mrs. Claus fusses over Santa as she wants him to fatten up by Christmas Eve. Sam then recalls the year Christmas was almost cancelled due to a snowstorm and tells the story of how a very special reindeer saved the day.\\r\\nDonner, Santa's lead reindeer, and his wife have given birth to their new baby fawn, Rudolph. Upon admiring him, they are surprised to see that Rudolph has been born with a glowing red nose. When Santa arrives, he warns Donner that Rudolph will not make the sleigh team because of his nose. Donner then decides to hide the nose by covering it with mud to allow Rudolph to fit in with all the other reindeer.\\r\\nOver Rudolph's first year of life, Donner trains him in the basics of being a reindeer, including hiding from the Abominable Snow Monster of the North. Rudolph enters the reindeer games, competing against his fellow fawns. During flight practice, Rudolph meets a doe named Clarice who tells him he is cute, and kisses him, which causes an elated Rudolph to fly higher and faster than everyone else. However, while celebrating with the other bucks, Rudolph's nose cover pops off, and the others react with fear, then scorn and finally rejection as Rudolph is kicked out of the Reindeer Games. Walking away, Rudolph walks with Clarice, who supports him, until her father firmly tells her to never have any more contact with a red-nosed reindeer. Then, Rudolph meets up with Hermey, an elf who ran away from Santa's workshop because he wanted to be a dentist instead of making toys, and they decide to run away together. The pair then meet a prospector named Yukon Cornelius, who has fruitlessly searched his whole life for silver and gold. After escaping the snow monster on an ice floe, the trio crash land on the Island of Misfit Toys where unloved or unwanted toys live with their ruler, a winged lion named King Moonracer. The king allows the group to stay one night on the island in exchange for returning to Christmastown to ask Santa to find homes for the unwanted toys. However, Rudolph leaves the island in the middle of the night on his own, fearing that his nose, which attracts the snow monster, will endanger his friends.\\r\\nTime goes by and Rudolph grows into adulthood; he tries and fails to find a place to settle where he will be accepted despite his nose, and eventually decides to return home. There, he finds that his parents and Clarice have been out looking for him for months; he sets out once again to find them, only to discover that the snow monster has captured them. Rudolph tries to save Clarice from being eaten, but the monster hits him in the head with a stalactite, dazing him. Hermey and Yukon return to Christmastown and go to save Rudolph. Hermey, posing as a pig, lures the monster out of his cave and Yukon drops rocks on his head to knock him out. Hermey then pulls out all the monster's teeth; the monster regains consciousness and attempts to attack the group again before discovering this. Yukon drives the toothless (and now terrified) monster back, only to end up tackling it over a cliff with all his pack dogs. Mourning Yukon's presumed death, Rudolph, Hermey, Clarice, and the Donners return home. After hearing the group's story, everyone apologizes to Rudolph and Hermey for their mistreatment, and Santa welcomes them back to Christmastown, promising that he will find homes for the Misfit Toys; in addition, Hermey opens his own dentist's office, and Clarice's father apologizes for being so hard on Rudolph. Yukon then returns with a reformed snow monster (Yukon notes that they bounce) and demonstrates the beast's ability to trim a Christmas tree. While everybody's celebrating, Santa interrupts, grimly informing everyone that because of the storm, he is forced to cancel the Christmas trip. Santa is soon distracted by Rudolph's red nose and realizes that its light could cut through the storm. He asks Rudolph to lead the sleigh and Rudolph agrees. The team then flies off to the island and pick up the toys. The special ends with Santa wishing the viewers a merry Christmas as he and Rudolph fly off into the night.\\r\\nThe TV special, with the teleplay by Romeo Muller, introduced several new characters inspired by the song's lyrics. Muller told an interviewer shortly before his death that he would have preferred to base the teleplay on May's original book, but could not find a copy.[6] Other than Burl Ives, all characters were portrayed by Canadian actors recorded at RCA studios in Toronto under the supervision of Bernard Cowan.[7]\\r\\nAfter the script, concept designs and storyboards for Rudolph were done by Arthur Rankin, Jr. and his staff of artists at Rankin/Bass in New York City. The company's trademark stop motion animation process, known as \\"Animagic\\", was filmed at MOM Productions in Tokyo with supervision by Tadahito Mochinaga and associate direction by Kizo Nagashima.[6] Besides Rudolph, Mochinaga and the rest of the Japanese puppet animation staff are also known for their partnership with Rankin/Bass on their other Animagic productions almost throughout the 1960s, from The New Adventures of Pinocchio, to Willy McBean and his Magic Machine, to The Daydreamer and Mad Monster Party?.[6]\\r\\nSince those involved with the production had no idea of the future value of the stop-motion puppet figures used in the production, many were not preserved. Rankin claimed in 2007 to be in possession of an original Rudolph figure.[8] Nine other puppetsincluding Santa and young Rudolphwere given to a secretary, who gave them to family members. Eventually seven were discarded.[8] In 2005, the remaining two puppets of Rudolph and Santa were appraised on Antiques Roadshow; the episode aired in 2006 on PBS. At that time, their appraised value was between $8,000 and $10,000. The puppets had been damaged through years of rough handling by children and storage in an attic.[9] Toy aficionado Kevin Kriess bought Santa and Rudolph in 2005; in 2007, he had both puppets restored by Screen Novelties, a Los Angeles-based collective of film directors specializing in stop motion animation with puppet fabricator Robin Walsh leading the project.[8][10] The figures have been shown at conventions since then.[11]\\r\\nThis version has the NBC \\"living color\\" peacock at the introduction. It includes the original end credits, where an elf drops presents that list all the technical credits. It also includes commercials that were exclusively for GE small appliances with some of the same animated elves from the main program introducing each of the products, and closing NBC network bumpers, including promos for the following week's episodes of GE College Bowl and Meet the Press, which were presumably pre-empted that Sunday for the inaugural 5:30 PM (EST) telecast. The College Bowl quiz show was also sponsored by GE.[12] The original does not include Santa traveling to the Island of Misfit Toys, but does include a scene near the end of the special in which Yukon Cornelius discovers a peppermint mine near Santa's workshop. He can be seen throughout the special tossing his pickax into the air, sniffing, then licking the end that contacts the snow or ice. Deletion of the peppermint segment in 1965, to make room for Santa traveling to the Island of Misfit Toys, leaves audience to assume that Cornelius was attempting to find either silver or gold by taste alone.[6]\\r\\nThe 1965 broadcast also included a new duet between Rudolph and Hermey called \\"Fame and Fortune\\", which replaced a scene in which the same characters sang \\"We're a Couple of Misfits\\". Viewers of the 1964 special complained that Santa was not shown fulfilling his promise to the Misfit Toys (to include them in his annual toy delivery).[6] In reaction, a new scene for subsequent rebroadcasts was produced with Santa making his first stop at the Island to pick up the toys. This is the ending that has been shown on all telecasts and video releases ever since. Until sometime in the 1970s the special aired without additional cuts, but eventually more commercial time was required by the network. In 1978, several sequences were deleted to make room for more advertising: the instrumental bridge from \\"We Are Santa's Elves\\" featuring the elf orchestra, additional dialogue by Burl Ives, and the \\"Peppermint Mine\\" scene resolving the fate of Yukon Cornelius.[6] The special's 1993 restoration saw \\"Misfits\\" returned to its original film context, and the 2004 DVD release showcases \\"Fame and Fortune\\" as a separate musical number.\\r\\nMost of the 1965 deletions were restored in 1998, and \\"Fame and Fortune\\" was replaced with the original \\"We're a Couple of Misfits\\" reprise. A short slide reading \\"Rankin/Bass Presents\\" was inserted at the beginning of the special to reflect the company's name change. The \\"Peppermint Mine\\" scene was not restored; it has not aired on CBS since the mid 70s.\\r\\nStarting in 2005, CBS aired the video of the \\"Fame and Fortune\\" scene with the soundtrack replaced by an edited version of \\"We're a Couple of Misfits\\".[6] The special has been edited to make more time for commercial advertising by shortening some musical numbers.\\r\\nWhen Rudolph was first issued on VHS, Betamax, and LaserDisc by Family Home Entertainment and Broadway Video from 1989 to 1997 under the Christmas Classics Series label, the 1965 rebroadcast print described above was used. All current video prints of Rudolph by Classic Media are a compendium of the two previous telecast versions of the special. All the footage in the current versions follow the original NBC airing (without the original GE commercials) up until the \\"Peppermint Mine\\" scene, followed by the final act of the 1965 edit (with the Island of Misfit Toys finale and the 1965 alternate credits in place of the original end credit sequence).\\r\\nIn 1998, the special was released by Sony Wonder on VHS. In 2000, it was released on DVD, and on Blu-ray Disc in 2010 (although the Blu-ray does not contain the bonus features from the previous DVD release.) This edit has been made available in original color form by former rights holders Classic Media,[13] (which in 2012 became the DreamWorks Classics division of DreamWorks Animation, and finally in 2016, part of Universal Pictures)[14] As previously mentioned, this is also the version currently airing on CBS, albeit in edited form to accommodate more commercial time. In November 2014, Classic Media released a 50th anniversary edition of the special on Blu-ray.[15] Walmart released an exclusive 50th anniversary Blu-ray edition with a storybook.\\r\\nThe songs and incidental music were all written by Johnny Marks, with Maury Laws supervising. In addition to the songs previously mentioned, the score also includes the film's love theme \\"There's Always Tomorrow\\", sung by Clarice after Rudolph is kicked out of the reindeer games. Marks' holiday standard \\"Rockin' Around the Christmas Tree\\" appears as instrumental background music when Rudolph first arrives at the Reindeer Games. Also included in the soundtrack is an instrumental version of Marks' setting of the Christmas hymn \\"I Heard the Bells on Christmas Day.\\"\\r\\nIn 1964, an LP record of the soundtrack was released on Decca Records. It contained all the original songs performed as they are in the special, with the exception of Burl Ives' material, which has been re-recorded. MCA Special Products released the soundtrack on CD in June 1995. It is an exact duplication of the original LP released in 1964. Tracks 1-9 are the original soundtrack selections while tracks 10-19 are the same songs performed by the Decca Concert Orchestra. The song \\"Fame and Fortune\\" is not contained on either release. On November 30, 2004 the soundtrack was certified Gold by the Recording Industry Association of America for selling over 500,000 copies.\\r\\nIves re-recorded \\"Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer\\" and \\"A Holly Jolly Christmas\\", with different arrangements, for his own album Have a Holly Jolly Christmas in 1965.[16]\\r\\nBooks and other items related to the show have in some cases misspelled \\"Hermey\\" as \\"Herbie\\". Rich Goldschmidt, who wrote Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer: The Making of the Rankin/Bass Holiday Classic, says the scripts by Romeo Muller show the spelling to be \\"Hermey\\".[17]\\r\\nA Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer video game was released on November 9, 2010. The adaptation was published by Red Wagon Games for the Wii and Nintendo DS, and was developed by High Voltage Software and Glyphic Entertainment respectively. The Wii version was received poorly, and garnered extremely negative reviews from sites such as IGN giving it a 1.5/10.[18]\\r\\nRudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer received an approval rating of 92% on review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, based on thirteen reviews.[19]\\r\\nThe Rankin/Bass special, which currently airs on CBS, inspired numerous television sequels made by the same studio:\\r\\nThe television special's familiarity to American audiences through its annual rebroadcasts, along with its primitive stop-motion animation that is easy to recreate with modern technology and the special's ambiguous copyright status, has lent itself to numerous parodies and homages over the years.\\r\\nAnimator Corky Quakenbush has produced parodies of Rudolph for several American television shows:\\r\\nIn the sci-fi/comedy series The Orville, in the episode \\"About a Girl\\", characters watch Rudolph to make the character Bortus consider his plans to arrange gender reassignment surgery for his newborn daughter (Bortus's species, the Moclans, are a single-gender species who statistically produce only one female every seventy-five years, with females thus having no clear place in their society) by demonstrating how unconventional people can accomplish great things, although Bortus humorously misinterprets the film to suggest that Rudolph's father might have considered euthanizing his child as an anomaly.\\r\\nThe copyright of the Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer special lies in an area of uncertainty in regard to American federal copyright law. When the recording was originally published, the date of copyright (published in Roman numerals) was accidentally listed as 1164 (MCLXIV), omitting an M that should have been present (1964 in Roman numerals is MCMLXIV); this mistake was not corrected with subsequent edits and remains on televised prints to this day.[27] The songs were validly and separately copyrighted, and the original character on which the special was based also remains under copyright and trademark protection, extending some indirect copyright protection to the special as a derivative work. (A number of films, such as It's a Wonderful Life and His Girl Friday, fall under similar circumstances: a public domain film loosely based on a copyrighted work.)\\r\\nAssuming the error in the copyright is considered substantial enough to invalidate it (U.S. copyright law before 1988 required works to have a valid date on a copyright notice, while providing some leeway in regard to non-substantial errors), the error puts large portions of the special not directly tied to the songs or original story into the public domain. (Some of the characters, particularly Santa Claus and the adult reindeer, relied on material that was already public domain anyway; all of the characters except Rudolph, most of the images, and large portions of the spoken soundtrack would thus be public domain in this interpretation.) Because of the indirect copyright protections and uncertainty over their extent, permission is still required to show the program as a whole. The extensive derivative works seen in popular culture are likely a byproduct of this uncertain copyright status.","input":"When was rudolph the red nosed reindeer movie created?"}]`),I={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:C},data(){return{visibleCount:20,poemsData:x}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{loadMore(){this.visibleCount+=20}}},M={class:"card-container"};function B(h,t,n,c,u,o){const m=p("PoemCard");return a(),i(l,null,[t[1]||(t[1]=e("section",null,[e("div",{class:"top-Banner"},[e("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title"},[e("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title-Text"},"🎉Q&A Life🥳")])])],-1)),e("section",null,[e("div",M,[(a(!0),i(l,null,g(o.visiblePoems,(r,f)=>(a(),y(m,{key:f,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),o.hasMorePoems?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",onClick:t[0]||(t[0]=(...r)=>o.loadMore&&o.loadMore(...r))},"See more")):w("",!0)])],64)}const P=d(I,[["render",B]]),N=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"qapage/11.md","filePath":"qapage/11.md"}'),W={name:"qapage/11.md"},H=Object.assign(W,{setup(h){return(t,n)=>(a(),i("div",null,[b(P)]))}});export{N as __pageData,H as default};
