The nervous system detects environmental changes that impact the body , then works in tandem with the endocrine system to respond to such events . Nervous tissue first arose in wormlike organisms about 550 to 600 million years ago . In vertebrates it consists of two main parts , the central nervous system ( CNS ) and the peripheral nervous system ( PNS ) . The CNS consists of the brain and spinal cord . The PNS consists mainly of nerves , which are enclosed bundles of the long fibers or axons , that connect the CNS to every other part of the body . Nerves that transmit signals from the brain are called motor or efferent nerves , while those nerves that transmit information from the body to the CNS are called sensory or afferent . Spinal nerves serve both functions and are called mixed nerves . The PNS is divided into three separate subsystems , the somatic , autonomic , and enteric nervous systems . Somatic nerves mediate voluntary movement . The autonomic nervous system is further subdivided into the sympathetic and the parasympathetic nervous systems . The sympathetic nervous system is activated in cases of emergencies to mobilize energy , while the parasympathetic nervous system is activated when organisms are in a relaxed state . The enteric nervous system functions to control the gastrointestinal system . Both autonomic and enteric nervous systems function involuntarily . Nerves that exit from the cranium are called cranial nerves while those exiting from the spinal cord are called spinal nerves ."},{"query":"i'm a celebrity get me outta here extra cast","short_answer":"","abstract":"I 'm a Celebrity ...

These transactions are made by individuals , firms and government bodies . Thus the balance of payments includes all external visible and non-visible transactions of a country . It is an important issue to be studied , especially in international financial management field , for a few reasons . First , the balance of payments provides detailed information concerning the demand and supply of a country 's currency . For example , if Mauritius imports more than it exports , then this means that the supply of rupees is likely to exceed the demand in the foreign exchanging market , ceteris paribus . One can thus infer that the Mauritius rupee would be under pressure to depreciate against other currencies . On the other hand , if Mauritius exports more than it imports , then the rupee would be likely to appreciate . Second , a country 's balance - of - payment data may signal its potential as a business partner for the rest of the world . If a country is grappling with a major balance - of - payment difficulty , it may not be able to expand imports from the outside world . Instead , the country may be tempted to impose measures to restrict imports and discourage capital outflows in order to improve the balance - of - payment situation . On the other hand , a country experiencing a significant balance - of payment surplus would be more likely to expand imports , offering marketing opportunities for foreign enterprises , and less likely to impose foreign exchange restrictions . Third , balance - of - payments data can be used to evaluate the performance of the country in international economic competition . Suppose a country is experiencing trade deficits year after year . This trade data may then signal that the country 's domestic industries lack international competitiveness . To interpret balance - of - payments data properly , it is necessary to understand how the balance of payments account is constructed . These transactions include payments for the country 's exports and imports of goods , services , financial capital , and financial transfers . It is prepared in a single currency , typically the domestic currency for the country concerned . Sources of funds for a nation , such as exports or the receipts of loans and investments , are recorded as positive or surplus items . Uses of funds , such as for imports or to invest in foreign countries , are recorded as negative or deficit items ."},{"query":"what does a private in the marines make","short_answer":"","abstract":"Specialist ( abbreviated \`\` SPC '' ) is a military rank in some countries ' armed forces .

One of the most well - known and heavily studied hotspots in the world , the Hawaii plume is responsible for the creation of the Hawaiian -- Emperor seamount chain , a chain of volcanoes over 5,800 kilometres ( 3,600 mi ) long . Four of these volcanoes are active , two are dormant , and more than 123 are extinct , many having since been ground beneath the waves by erosion as seamounts and atolls . The chain extends from south of the island of Hawai ʻi to the edge of the Aleutian Trench , near the eastern edge of Russia . While most volcanoes are created by geological activity at tectonic plate boundaries , the Hawaii hotspot is located far from plate boundaries . The classic hotspot theory , first proposed in 1963 by John Tuzo Wilson , proposes that a single , fixed mantle plume builds volcanoes that then , cut off from their source by the movement of the Pacific Plate , become increasingly inactive and eventually erode below sea level over millions of years . According to this theory , the nearly 60 ° bend where the Emperor and Hawaiian segments of the chain meet was caused by a sudden shift in the movement of the Pacific Plate . In 2003 , fresh investigations of this irregularity led to the proposal of a mobile hotspot theory , suggesting that hotspots are mobile , not fixed , and that the 47 - million - year - old bend was caused by a shift in the hotspot 's motion rather than the plate 's ."},{"query":"when did world war 2 end in europe","short_answer":"early May 1945","abstract":"The final battles of the European Theatre of World War II as well as the German surrender to the Allies took place in late April and early May 1945 ."},{"query":"who laid foundation of modern minting of coins","short_answer":"Roman Empire","abstract":"A mint is an industrial facility which manufactures coins that can be used in currency ."},{"query":"sam is determining the area of a triangle","short_answer":"","abstract":"Area is the quantity that expresses the extent of a two - dimensional figure or shape , or planar lamina , in the plane .

Goodwill represents assets that are not separately identifiable . Goodwill does not include identifiable assets that are capable of being separated or divided from the entity and sold , transferred , licensed , rented , or exchanged , either individually or together with a related contract , identifiable asset , or liability regardless of whether the entity intends to do so . Goodwill also does not include contractual or other legal rights regardless of whether those are transferable or separable from the entity or other rights and obligations . Examples of identifiable assets that are not goodwill include a company 's brand name , customer relationships , artistic intangible assets , and any patents or proprietary technology . The goodwill amounts to the excess of the \`\` purchase consideration '' ( the money paid to purchase the asset or business ) over the total value of the assets and liabilities . It is classified as an intangible asset on the balance sheet , since it can neither be seen nor touched . Under US GAAP and IFRS , goodwill is never amortized . Instead , management is responsible for valuing goodwill every year and to determine if an impairment is required . If the fair market value goes below historical cost ( what goodwill was purchased for ) , an impairment must be recorded to bring it down to its fair market value . However , an increase in the fair market value would not be accounted for in the financial statements . Private companies in the United States , however , may elect to amortize goodwill over a period of ten years or less under an accounting alternative from the Private Company Council of the FASB ."},{"query":"suddenly i see what you mean to me","short_answer":"","abstract":"\`\` Suddenly I See '' is a song by Scottish singer - songwriter KT Tunstall and is featured on her debut album , Eye to the Telescope .

The movement began in 1914 when a group of political radicals in New York City , led by Emma Goldman , Mary Dennett , and Margaret Sanger , became concerned about the hardships that childbirth and self - induced abortions brought to low - income women . Sanger , in particular , simultaneously sought to connect birth control to the organized eugenics movement , regularly appealing to the authority of eugenic scientists Karl Pearson , Charles Davenport , and others in her Birth Control Review from the early 1920s Such figures sought to prevent population segments they deemed genetically ' undesirable ' from reproducing .

One quantum generates what is known as a miniature end plate potential ( MEPP ) which is the smallest amount of stimulation that one neuron can send to another neuron . Quantal release is the mechanism by which most traditional endogenous neurotransmitters are transmitted throughout the body . The aggregate sum of many MEPPs is known as an end plate potential ( EPP ) . A normal end plate potential usually causes the postsynaptic neuron to reach its threshold of excitation and elicit an action potential .

Seawater is slightly basic ( meaning pH > 7 ) , and the process in question is a shift towards pH - neutral conditions rather than a transition to acidic conditions ( pH < 7 ) . Ocean alkalinity is not changed by the process , or may increase over long time periods due to carbonate dissolution . An estimated 30 -- 40 % of the carbon dioxide from human activity released into the atmosphere dissolves into oceans , rivers and lakes . To achieve chemical equilibrium , some of it reacts with the water to form carbonic acid . Some of these extra carbonic acid molecules react with a water molecule to give a bicarbonate ion and a hydronium ion , thus increasing ocean acidity ( H ion concentration ) . Between 1751 and 1996 surface ocean pH is estimated to have decreased from approximately 8.25 to 8.14 , representing an increase of almost 35 % in H ion concentration in the world 's oceans . Earth System Models project that within the last decade ocean acidity exceeded historical analogues and in combination with other ocean biogeochemical changes could undermine the functioning of marine ecosystems and disrupt the provision of many goods and services associated with the ocean ."},{"query":"family guy stewie pregnant with brian's child","short_answer":"","abstract":"Harvey Fierstein as Buster Keaton"},{"query":"why is rocky's son older in rocky 5","short_answer":"","abstract":""},{"query":"who wrote the shallow from a star is born","short_answer":"","abstract":""},{"query":"when was the last time england reached a world cup semi-final","short_answer":"2018","abstract":"The England national football team has competed at the FIFA World Cup since 1950 .

Each protein exists as an unfolded polypeptide or random coil when translated from a sequence of mRNA to a linear chain of amino acids . This polypeptide lacks any stable ( long - lasting ) three - dimensional structure ( the left hand side of the first figure ) . As the polypeptide chain is being synthesized by the ribosome , the linear chain begins to fold into its three dimensional structure . Folding begins to occur even during translation of the polypeptide chain . Amino acids interact with each other to produce a well - defined three - dimensional structure , the folded protein ( the right hand side of the figure ) , known as the native state . The resulting three - dimensional structure is determined by the amino acid sequence or primary structure ( Anfinsen 's dogma ) . The energy landscape describes the folding pathways in which the unfolded protein is able to assume its native state . Experiments beginning in the 1980s indicate the codon for an amino acid can also influence protein structure ."},{"query":"who played stretch in all in the family","short_answer":"James Oliver Cromwell","abstract":"James Oliver Cromwell ( born January 27 , 1940 ) is an American actor .

FFS is the dominant physician payment method in the United States , and it raises costs , discourages the efficiencies of integrated care , and a variety of reform efforts have been attempted , recommended , or initiated to reduce its influence ( such as moving towards bundled payments and capitation ) . In capitation , physicians are not incentivized to perform procedures , including necessary ones , because they are not paid anything extra for performing them .

The renal tubule extends from the capsule . The capsule and tubule are connected and are composed of epithelial cells with a lumen . A healthy adult has 0.8 to 1.5 million nephrons in each kidney . Blood is filtered as it passes through three layers : the endothelial cells of the capillary wall , its basement membrane , and between the foot processes of the podocytes of the lining of the capsule . The tubule has adjacent peritubular capillaries that run between the descending and ascending portions of the tubule . As the fluid from the capsule flows down into the tubule , it is processed by the epithelial cells lining the tubule : water is reabsorbed and substances are exchanged ( some are added , others are removed ) ; first with the interstitial fluid outside the tubules , and then into the plasma in the adjacent peritubular capillaries through the endothelial cells lining that capillary . This process regulates the volume of body fluid as well as levels of many body substances .
