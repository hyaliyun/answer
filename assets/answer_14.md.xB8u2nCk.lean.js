The main function of the SR is to store calcium ions ( Ca ) .

This means that small increases in calcium ions within the cell are easily detected and can bring about important cellular changes ( the calcium is said to be a second messenger ; see calcium in biology for more details ) . Calcium is used to make calcium carbonate ( found in chalk ) and calcium phosphate , two compounds that the body uses to make teeth and bones . This means that too much calcium within the cells can lead to hardening ( calcification ) of certain intracellular structures , including the mitochondria , leading to cell death .

Much of the literary record of Japanese poetry begins when Japanese poets encountered Chinese poetry during the Tang dynasty ( although the Chinese classic anthology of poetry , Shijing , was well known by the literati of Japan by the 6th century ) . Under the influence of the Chinese poets of this era Japanese began to compose poetry in Chinese kanshi ) ; and , as part of this tradition , poetry in Japan tended to be intimately associated with pictorial painting , partly because of the influence of Chinese arts , and the tradition of the use of ink and brush for both writing and drawing . It took several hundred years to digest the foreign impact and make it an integral part of Japanese culture and to merge this kanshi poetry into a Japanese language literary tradition , and then later to develop the diversity of unique poetic forms of native poetry , such as waka , haikai , and other more Japanese poetic specialties . For example , in the Tale of Genji both kanshi and waka are frequently mentioned . The history of Japanese poetry goes from an early semi-historical / mythological phase , through the early Old Japanese literature inclusions , just before the Nara period , the Nara period itself ( 710 to 794 ) , the Heian period ( 794 to 1185 ) , the Kamakura period ( 1185 to 1333 ) , and so on , up through the poetically important Edo period ( 1603 and 1867 , also known as \`\` Tokugawa '' ) and modern times ; however , the history of poetry often is different than socio - political history ."},{"query":"who was the president when alaska was purchased","short_answer":"Andrew Johnson","abstract":"The Alaska Purchase ( Russian : Продажа Аляски , tr .

Many engines ( older motorcycle engines in particular ) do not require any fuel pump at all , requiring only gravity to feed fuel from the fuel tank or under high pressure to the fuel injection system . Often , carbureted engines use low pressure mechanical pumps that are mounted outside the fuel tank , whereas fuel injected engines often use electric fuel pumps that are mounted inside the fuel tank ( and some fuel injected engines have two fuel pumps : one low pressure / high volume supply pump in the tank and one high pressure / low volume pump on or near the engine ) . Fuel pressure needs to be within certain specifications for the engine to run correctly . If the fuel pressure is too high , the engine will run rough and rich , not combusting all of the fuel being pumped making the engine inefficient and a pollutant .

He passed a law which would have abolished colonial slavery in 1542 , although this law was not passed in the largest colonial states , and was not enforced . In the late 17th century , the Roman Catholic Church , taking up a plea by Lourenço da Silva de Mendouça , officially condemned the slave trade , which was affirmed vehemently by Pope Gregory XVI in 1839 . The abolitionist movement only started in the late 18th century , however , when English and American Quakers began to question the morality of slavery . James Oglethorpe was among the first to articulate the Enlightenment case against slavery , banning it in the Province of Georgia on humanitarian grounds , and arguing against it in Parliament , and eventually encouraging his friends Granville Sharp and Hannah More to vigorously pursue the cause .

The central question for classical pluralism is how power and influence are distributed in a political process . Groups of individuals try to maximize their interests . Lines of conflict are multiple and shifting as power is a continuous bargaining process between competing groups . There may be inequalities but they tend to be distributed and evened out by the various forms and distributions of resources throughout a population . Any change under this view will be slow and incremental , as groups have different interests and may act as \`\` veto groups '' to destroy legislation . The existence of diverse and competing interests is the basis for a democratic equilibrium , and is crucial for the obtaining of goals by individuals . A polyarchy -- a situation of open competition for electoral support within a significant part of the adult population -- ensures competition of group interests and relative equality . Pluralists stress civil rights , such as freedom of expression and organization , and an electoral system with at least two parties . On the other hand , since the participants in this process constitute only a tiny fraction of the populace , the public acts mainly as bystanders . This is not necessarily undesirable for two reasons : ( 1 ) it may be representative of a population content with the political happenings , or ( 2 ) political issues require continuous and expert attention , which the average citizen may not have ."},{"query":"how many times have the seahawks been to the playoffs","short_answer":"16","abstract":"National Football League ( 1976 -- present )"},{"query":"is there a temporary passport to go to canada","short_answer":"","abstract":"The Canadian passport is the passport issued to citizens of Canada .

This theory is based therefore on the association between words but not on neuropsychological experiments . This theory uses descriptors of common language and therefore suggests five broad dimensions commonly used to describe the human personality and psyche . The five factors have been defined as openness to experience , conscientiousness , extraversion , agreeableness , and neuroticism , often represented by the acronyms OCEAN or CANOE . Beneath each proposed global factor , a number of correlated and more specific primary factors are claimed .

From the late 15th century to the early 19th , Spain controlled a huge overseas territory in the New World and the Philippines , what they called \`\` The Indies '' ( Spanish : Las Indias ) . Castile became the dominant kingdom in Iberia because of its jurisdiction over the overseas empire in the Americas and the Philippines . The crown 's main source of wealth was from silver mined in Mexico and Peru . The structure of empire was established under the Spanish Hapsburgs ( 1516 -- 1700 ) and under the Spanish Bourbon monarchs , the empire was brought under greater crown control and increased its revenues from the Indies . The crown 's authority in The Indies was enlarged by the papal grant of powers of patronage , giving it power in the religious sphere . An important element in the formation of Spain 's empire was the dynastic union between Isabella I of Castile and Ferdinand II of Aragon , known as the Catholic Monarchs , which initiated political , religious and social cohesion but not political unification .

Cold air subsides at the poles creating the high pressure , forcing an equatorward outflow of air ; that outflow is then deflected westward by the Coriolis effect . Unlike the westerlies in the middle latitudes , the polar easterlies are often weak and irregular . These prevailing winds blow from the polar easterlies are one of the five primary wind zones , known as wind belts , that make up our atmosphere 's circulatory system . This particular belt of wind begins at approximately 60 degrees north and south latitude and reaches to the poles . When air moves near the poles , cold temperatures shrink the air . This promotes air from warmer latitudes to flow into the area , causing a polar high - pressure zone . Air from this high - pressure zone then rushes toward the low - pressure zone surrounding the sub-polar region . The flow of air is altered by the Earth 's rotation and deflected west , hence the name , between high - and low - pressure zones . Temperature and air pressure differentials and the earth 's rotation combine to form global currents ."},{"query":"papa don't preach kelly osbourne official video","short_answer":"","abstract":"\`\` Papa Do n't Preach '' is a song by American singer Madonna from her third studio album True Blue ( 1986 ) .

In 2010 , Microsoft Forefront Unified Access Gateway ( UAG ) was released , which simplifies the deployment of DirectAccess for Windows 2008 R2 , and includes additional components that make it easier to integrate without the need to deploy IPv6 on the network , and with a dedicated user interface for the configuration and monitoring . Some requirements and limitations that were part of the design of DirectAccess with Windows Server 2008 R2 and UAG have been changed ( see requirements below ) . While DirectAccess is based on Microsoft technology , third - party solutions exist for accessing internal UNIX and Linux servers through DirectAccess . With Windows Server 2012 , DirectAccess is fully integrated into the operating system , providing a user interface to configure and native IPv6 and IPv4 support ."},{"query":"shake rattle and roll bill haley & the comets","short_answer":"","abstract":"Shake , Rattle and Roll is the title of an early rock and roll compilation album issued by Decca Records ( DL 5560 ) in 1955 , and featuring music by Bill Haley & His Comets .

The Gestalt theory of perception has been criticized as being descriptive of the end products of perception without providing much insight into the processes that lead to perception . In the introduction to a 2016 special issue of the journal Vision Research on Gestalt perception , the authors concluded that \`\` even though they study the same phenomena as earlier Gestaltists , there is little theoretical coherence .
