From the beginning unions could be viewed as a reflection of the racial disunity of the country, with the earliest unions being predominantly for white workers.[2] Through the turbulent years of 1948ÿ1991 trade unions played an important part in developing political and economic resistance, and eventually were one of the driving forces in realising the transition to an inclusive democratic government.\\r\\nToday trade unions are still an important force in South Africa, with 3.11 million members representing 25.3% of the formal work force.[1] The Congress of South African Trade Unions (COSATU) is the largest of the three major trade union centres, with a membership of 1.8 million, and is part of the Tripartite alliance with the ruling African National Congress (ANC) and the South African Communist Party (SACP).\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nEarly trade unions were often for whites only, with organizations like the South African Confederation of Labour (SACoL) favouring employment policies based on racial discrimination.[2] They also often did not fully accept women into the unions.[3] Mary Fitzgerald is considered the first female South African trade unionist and who led many strikes and sit ins before 1911.[3] The first trade union to organise black workers was the Industrial Workers of Africa (IWA), formed in September 1917 by the revolutionary syndicalist International Socialist League (ISL).[4] The IWA merged into the Industrial and Commercial Workers' Union of Africa (ICU), formed in 1919, in 1920.[5]:482 The ICU was initially a union for black and coloured dockworkers in Cape Town and formed by Clements Kadalie and Arthur F. Batty.[5]:482 It was the first nationally organized union for black workers who would eventually include rural farm workers, domestic and factory workers, dockworkers, teachers and retailers.[5]:483 By the 1920s it was said to be more popular than the ANC and eventually had branches in the Free State, Transvaal and Natal and in 1925 it moved its headquarters to Johannesburg.[5]:483 In 1924, the South African Trade Union Congress (SATUC) was formed with 30,000 members of black trade unions with Bill Andrews as its secretary.[5]:486 It would attract black trade unions from the dry-cleaning, furniture, sweets and automobile industries.[5]:486\\r\\nBy the 1930s the South African Trades and Labour Council (SATLC) had united much of the country. The SATLC maintained an explicitly non-racial stance, and accepted affiliation of black trade unions, as well as calling for full legal rights for black trade unionists.[6] Some black unions joined SATLC, while in the 1940s others affiliated with the Council of Non-European Trade Unions, raising it to a peak of 119 unions and 158,000 members in 1945.\\r\\nIn 1946, the CNETU with the African National Congress and the South African Communist Party pushed for the African Mine Workers' Strike to become a General Strike. The strike was broken by the police brutality which was part of the rise of the National Party (NP) and their slogan of apartheid as all black trade unions were violently suppressed.\\r\\nBy 1954 SATLC was disbanded, and with the formation of the Trade Council of South Africa (TUCSA) union membership included white, coloured, and Asians, with blacks in dependent organizations. Independent black unions were excluded from affiliation and 14 previous unions from SATLC founded the South African Congress of Trade Unions (SACTU). SACTU merged with the Council of Non-European Trade Unions and became the trade union arm of the ANC. The union grew to a membership of 53,000 by 1961, but was driven underground, and for a decade black unionism was again virtually silenced in South Africa.H\\r\\nIn 1979 the Federation of South African Trade Unions (FOSATU) was formed, with the Council of Unions of South Africa (CUSA) being created in the following year.\\r\\nWhat was to become one of the largest unions in South Africa, the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) was created in 1982, and was deeply involved in the political conflict against the ruling National Party. The union embraced four \\"pillars\\" of action - armed struggle, mass mobilisation (ungovernability), international solidarity, and underground operation.[7]\\r\\nThe Congress of South African Trade Unions (COSATU) was formed in 1985, and FOSATU merged into it in the same year(more formally known in the teaching industry).\\r\\nThe largest strike up to that date in South Africa's history took place on 1 May 1986, when 1.5 million black workers \\"stayed away\\" in a demand for recognition of an official May Day holiday. In the following June up to 200 trade union officials, including Elijah Barayi and Jay Naidoo of the COSATU, and Phiroshaw Camay, the general secretary of the CUSA, were reported to be arrested under a renewed state of emergency.\\r\\nAlso in 1986, CUSA joined with the Azanian Confederation of Trade Unions (AZACTU) to form the National Council of Trade Unions (NACTU), and Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi created the United Workers' Union of South Africa (UWUSA), particularly to oppose disinvestment in South Africa. The UWUSA eventually faded from view, but not before revelations in July 1991 that it had collaborated with anti-union employers in a campaign against both COSATU and NACTU activists, and had received at least 1.5 million Rand from the security police.[2]\\r\\nIn 1988 a new Labour Relations Act placed restrictions on labour activities, including giving the Labour Court the power to ban lawful strikes and lock-outs. This was to be short-lived, and negotiations between COSATU, NACTU and the South African Committee on Labour Affairs (SACCOLA) eventually produced a 1991 amendment which effectively repealed the previous powers.\\r\\nIn 1990 SACTU, which had continued underground activities from exile, dissolved and advised its members to join COSATU. COSATU, as a member of the Tripartite alliance with the ANC and SACP, provided material support in the form of strikes and both political and economic unrest, which eventually led to the displacement of the National Party, and the majority victory of the ANC in the 1994 political elections.\\r\\nTrade unions are recognized within the 1996 Constitution of South Africa, which provides for the right to join trade unions, and for unions to collectively bargain and strike.[8] This has translated into the Labour Relations Act which established the working framework for both unions and employers. Three institutions have also been created to further the goals of reducing industrial relations conflict, and both eliminating unfair discrimination and redressing past discrimination in the workplace: the National Economic Development and Labour Council (NEDLAC), the Labour Court, and the Council for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration (CCMA).[9]\\r\\nWith the creation of the Federation of Unions of South Africa (FEDUSA) from the merger of the Federation of South African Labour Unions (FEDSAL) and several smaller unions in 1997, the three main union organizations were established. COSATU, with a membership of 1.8 million, is followed by FEDUSA with 560,000 members and NACTU with almost 400,000 members including the powerful mineworkers union. All three are affiliated with the International Trade Union Confederation.\\r\\nA fourth national trade union centre was formed in 2003. The Confederation of South African Workers' Unions (CONSAWU) is affiliated with the World Confederation of Labour (WCL).\\r\\nThe 2006 ICFTU Annual Survey of violations of trade union rights noted South Africa:\\r\\n\\"Serious violations were reported during the year, including the death of two workers killed by their employer in a wage dispute, and a striking farm worker killed by security guards. Protest strikes and demonstrations met with violent repression, such as the use of rubber bullets, which in the case of striking truck drivers, led to injuries.\\"[10]\\r\\nSouth Africa has one of the largest incidence of HIV/AIDS in the world, with a 2005 estimate of 5.5 million people living with HIV  12.4% of the population.[11][12] The trade union movement has taken a role in combating this pandemic. COSATU is a key partner in the Treatment Action Campaign (TAC), a registered charity and political force working to educate and promote understanding about HIV/AIDS, and to prevent new infections, as well as push for greater access to antiretrovirals. COSATU passed a resolution in 1998 to campaign for treatment. \\"It was clear to the labour movement at that time that its lowest paid members were dying because they couldnt afford medicines,\\" says Theodora Steel, Campaigns Coordinator at COSATU. \\"We saw TAC as a natural ally in a campaign for treatment. We passed a formal resolution at our congress to assist and build TAC.\\"[13]\\r\\nNotwithstanding the formal alliance of COSATU with the ruling ANC party, it has been at odds with the government, calling for the roll-out of comprehensive public access to antiretroviral drugs.[14]\\r\\nThe Labour Relations Act was passed in 1995, and subsequently experienced major amendments in 1996,[15] 1998[16] and 2002.[17] Its stated purpose is to \\"give effect to section 27 of the Constitution\\" by regulating organisational rights of trade unions, promoting collective bargaining, regulating the right to strike and the recourse to lockouts, as well as providing mechanisms for dispute resolution and the establishment of Labour Court and Labour Appeal Court as superior courts, \\"with exclusive jurisdiction to decide matters arising from the Act\\". The act also addresses employee participation in decision-making, and international law obligations in respect to labour relations.[18]\\r\\nThe Labour Relations Act does not apply to the South African National Defence Force, the National Intelligence Agency, or the South African Secret Service.\\r\\nBargaining councils are formed by registered trade unions and employers organisations. They deal with collective agreements, attempt to solve labour disputes, and make proposals on labour policies and laws. As well, they may administer pension funds, sick pay, unemployment and training schemes, and other such benefits for their members.[19] The Amended Labour Relations Act also notes that these councils are to \\"extend the services and functions of the bargaining council to workers in the informal sector and home workers.\\"\\r\\nAgency Shop Agreements are struck by a majority trade union (either one union, or a coalition of unions representing the majority of workers employed) and an employer or employers' organisation. This agreement requires employers to deduct a fee from the wages of non-union workers to \\"ensure that non-union workers, who benefit from the unions bargaining efforts, make a contribution towards those efforts\\".[20]\\r\\nPermission from the employee is not required for deductions to be assessed. However, if the employee is a conscientious objector, that is refuses membership in a trade union on the grounds of conscience, she or he may request that their fees are paid to a fund administered by the Department of Labour.\\r\\nClosed shop agreements, which require all workers in the covered workplace to join unions, can be struck if 2 thirds of the workers have voted in favour of the agreement. Workers must join the union or face dismissal. In addition, \\"if a union expels a member or refuses to allow a new worker to become a union member , and if this expulsion or refusal is in accordance with the unions constitution or is for a fair reason, then the employer will have to dismiss the worker. This dismissal is not considered unfair.\\"[21] Conscientious objectors may not be dismissed for refusing to join the union.\\r\\nRestrictions on closed shops include the requirement that workers are not compelled to be trade union members before obtaining employment, and that dues collected from employees are only used to \\"advance or protect the socio-economic interests of workers.\\"","input":"What are three largest trade unions in south africa?"},{"output":"12,595","context":"National Association of Evangelicals\\r\\nPentecostal/Charismatic Churches of North America\\r\\nPentecostal World Fellowship\\r\\nWesleyan Holiness Consortium\\r\\nWorld Assemblies of God Fellowship\\r\\n3,127,857 adherents*[4]\\r\\nThe Assemblies of God USA (AG), officially the General Council of the Assemblies of God, is a Pentecostal Christian denomination in the United States founded in 1914 during a meeting of Pentecostal ministers at Hot Springs, Arkansas. It is the U.S. branch of the World Assemblies of God Fellowship, the world's largest Pentecostal body. With a constituency of over 3 million, the Assemblies of God was the ninth largest Christian denomination and the second largest Pentecostal denomination in the United States in 2011.[8]\\r\\nThe Assemblies of God holds to a conservative, evangelical and Arminian theology as expressed in the Statement of Fundamental Truths and position papers, which emphasize such core Pentecostal doctrines as the baptism in the Holy Spirit, speaking in tongues, divine healing and the Second Coming of Jesus Christ. It defines for itself a fourfold mission to evangelize others, worship God, disciple believers, and show compassion.[9]\\r\\nThe fellowship's polity is a hybrid of presbyterian and congregational models. This tension between local independence and national authority is seen in the AG's historical reluctance to refer to itself as a denomination, preferring the terms fellowship and movement.[10] The national headquarters are in Springfield, Missouri, where the administrative and executive offices and Gospel Publishing House are located.\\r\\nIt maintains relationships with other Pentecostal groups at both regional and national levels through the Pentecostal/Charismatic Churches of North America and the Pentecostal World Fellowship. It is also a member of the Wesleyan Holiness Consortium and the National Association of Evangelicals.\\r\\nThe central beliefs of the Assemblies of God are summarized in its Statement of Fundamental Truths.[11] The following is a summary of these 16 non-negotiable Truths:\\r\\nThe AG considers salvation, baptism in the Holy Spirit with the evidence of speaking in tongues, divine healing and the Second Coming of Christ to be its four core beliefs.[12]\\r\\nThe Statement of Fundamental Truths states, \\"Man's only hope of redemption is through the shed blood of Jesus Christ the Son of God\\". The Assemblies of God holds the Arminian position on salvation. While it agrees with the Calvinist position that God is sovereign, at the same time, it believes that mankind has free willfree to accept or reject God's gift of salvation and eternal life.[13] Therefore, the Assemblies of God disapproves of the doctrines of double predestination and the unconditional security of the believer, which holds that once saved it is impossible for a person to be lost. Instead, the Assemblies of God believes that salvation is received and kept by faith, if faith in Christ is lost, then salvation is lost.[14]\\r\\nAccording to the Statement of Fundamental Truths, \\"All believers are entitled to and should ardently expect and earnestly seek\\" the baptism in the Spirit. It also states, \\"This was the normal experience of all in the early Christian Church\\". It is a separate experience from and occurs after salvation. This baptism gives to the receiver an \\"enduement of power for life and service, the bestowment of the gifts and their uses in the work of the ministry\\". There are four experiences listed in the Fundamental Truths that result from Spirit baptism: \\"overflowing fullness of the Spirit\\", \\"a deepened reverence for God\\", intensified consecration and dedication to God and his work, and \\"a more active love for Christ, for His Word and for the lost\\". In addition, this experience initiates the believer in the use of spiritual gifts. The \\"initial physical sign\\" of having received this baptism is \\"speaking with other tongues as the Spirit of God gives them utterance\\".[11]\\r\\nBaptism in the Holy Spirit with the evidence of speaking in tongues is a requirement for ministerial licensing and ordination. However, Spirit baptism and speaking in tongues is not a requirement for membership or participation in an Assembly of God church.[15] An increasing minority of pastors has expressed concern that there is a lack of biblical support for the claim that Spirit baptism must always be accompanied with speaking in tongues.[16] This concern corresponds with a decrease in the number of Assembly of God adherents reporting baptism in the Holy Spirit; according to the AG's Office of Statistics as of 2003 less than 50 percent of adherents had this experience.[17] These challenges to the AG's traditional position were noted in a 2007 report by the AG's Spiritual Life Committee:\\r\\nYet, the distinctive doctrine that once united us has, in some circles, become a point of contention. We lament the increasing rarity of the gifts of the Spirit in our worship setting. We wonder where, in our busy church schedules, will people have an opportunity to tarry at the altars for a transforming Pentecostal experience?[18]\\r\\nDespite these challenges, the 53rd General Council in 2009 passed a resolution reaffirming the doctrine of initial physical evidence.[19]\\r\\nThe Assemblies of God understands divine healing to have been provided for in the atonement. Looking to scripture, such as James 5 and Isaiah 53:5, the AG believes that Christians can pray for healing. Indeed, it believes scripture gives elders of the church the responsibility to pray \\"the prayer of faith\\" over the sick. It believes God can and does heal, but believes that God is sovereign and that, whether one is healed or not, a person's trust must be in God.[20] It sees no conflict in trusting God for healing while receiving medical care.[21] Healing testimonies regularly appear in the official publication, the Pentecostal Evangel, and prayer for healing and testimony commonly occur in church services.[22]\\r\\nWhile adamant that divine healing is a reality, the AG is not dogmatic on the subject of how one is healed. Margaret Poloma summarized this view stating, \\"Physical healing is not certain, automatic, or subject to formula. At the same time, it remains a tenet and practice of the Assemblies of God\\". Officially, the AG rejects the view that healing is caused or influenced by \\"positive confession\\", a belief found in prosperity theology and Word of Faith teachings. Nevertheless, these teachings have influenced some congregations.[23]\\r\\nThe Statement of Fundamental Truths articles 13 and 14 articulate the Assemblies of God's official teaching on the return of Christ to Earth. It is a dispensationalist and premillennialist eschatology that includes the pre-Tribulation rapture of the Churchthe \\"imminent and blessed hope\\". The rapture of the Church will be followed by Christ's visible return to earth and his reign of 1,000 years. This millennial reign will usher in the salvation of the nation of Israel and universal peace. The Assemblies of God is specifically opposed to the theologies and practices of universal salvation, setting dates for Christ's return, post-Tribulation rapture, and amillennialism.[24]\\r\\nThe Assemblies of God has released statements on various issues not addressed in the Statement of Fundamental Truths.[25] These position papers are usually written by the Doctrinal Purity Commission, a standing committee of the General Council, which reviews and responds to issues referred to it by the Executive Presbytery. Position papers are not official positions of the Assemblies of God unless recommended by the Executive Presbytery and approved by the General Council.[26] Position statements touch on biblical, theological, and social concerns.\\r\\nBecause of the congregational nature of the Assemblies of God, it is difficult to define a typical local church. Church identity is influenced by members' social class, ethnicity, and musical or worship style preferences. Sociologists Margaret Poloma and John Green have categorized AG congregations into four types: traditional, evangelical, renewalist, and alternative. Traditional congregations are those that strongly identify with the AG (and Pentecostalism in general), while encouraging \\"more intense experiences of the charismata, or gifts of the Holy Spirit\\" such as Spirit baptism and speaking in tongues. Evangelical AG congregations, the most common type, identify with the AG and Pentecostalism but \\"are moving (in varying degrees) away from the unique experiences that were once important markers of Pentecostal identity\\". Renewalist or charismatic AG churches are those that encourage supernatural gifts of the Spirit but weakly identify with the AG or Pentecostalism. Alternative churches are those where both identity with the AG and occurrence of unique Pentecostal experiences are low; these include churches adopting seeker-sensitive and emerging church models.[40]\\r\\nDespite the diversity found in the AG, shared beliefs and values are reflected in local churches. The Assemblies of God is \\"experience-oriented\\", and the local church is where experience of the activity of the Holy Spirit will primarily occur.[41] Regular services are usually held on Sunday mornings and Sunday and Wednesday evenings. There is no formal liturgy or order of service; though, many churches have a familiar routine: opening prayer, congregational and special singing, an offering, a time of intercessory prayer, a sermon, and an altar call. In the traditional and charismatic AG churches, this routine is subject to change spontaneously within a servicepossibly being interrupted by an interpretation of a message in tongues, a prophecy, a word of wisdom, or a word of knowledgeand this change is believed to be directed by the Holy Spirit. In addition, evening services may incorporate a time of prayer for those who are seeking something from God either around the altar or in an adjacent prayer room.[42]\\r\\nDuring praise and worship, participants may raise their hands as an act of worship. Congregational singing is usually led by a choir or worship team. Full drum sets, a piano, an organ, and various other instruments are frequently used. The type of music sung is generally popular worship choruses, such as those by Calvary Chapel and Hillsong. Worship is often characterized as intense and enthusiastic.[43]\\r\\nPrayer features prominently in services. Services may feature moments where special prayer is offered, often with laypersons leading the prayer and the rest of the congregation audibly participating. During these corporate prayers, some may pray in tongues. While not in every service, the pastor will pray for the sick. This prayer may include the pastor anointing the sick with olive oil and with the assistance of church elders along with pastoral associates laying hands on the one seeking healing.[44][45]\\r\\nArchitecturally, smaller churches will feature bright lighting, large windows, a simple platform with a pulpit in the center, and an altar (\\"a bench across the front of the church below the platform\\"). Larger churches will have direct access from the balcony to the main sanctuary near the platform so that respondents to altar calls can easily come forward, a large open area in front of the platform to accommodate altar call gatherings, and the platform itself is usually large to accommodate a large choir and musical instruments. Because the Assemblies of God practice baptism by immersion, many churches will include a baptistry at the rear of the platform.[46]\\r\\nThe Assemblies of God is defined in its constitution as a \\"cooperative fellowship\\" of \\"churches and credentialed ministers\\".[47] It has a representative form of government derived from presbyterian polity and organized in three levels of administration: congregations, district councils and the General Council.[48] The AG has, however, elements of congregational polity, which are limited by the powers of the districts and General Council to license and discipline ordained ministers.[42]\\r\\nThe Assemblies of God uses several classifications of congregations based on their level of local autonomy and their relationship to the General Council. Mature, fully functioning congregations are classified as \\"General Council affiliated churches\\". These churches are \\"sovereign\\" and self-governing, but in matters of doctrine local assemblies are subordinate to districts and the General Council.[49] A church is qualified for General Council affiliated status if it:\\r\\nEach local church operates according to its own bylaws and calls its own pastor. The office of pastor is equivalent to that of elder or overseer and is tasked with preaching and teaching the Word of God, in addition to conducting the day-to-day operations of the church.[48][51] Laypersons are elected as a board of deacons to assist the pastor. A General Council affiliated church may withdraw from the Assemblies of God by a two-thirds vote of the church membership.[52]\\r\\nAt the request of the pastor, deacon board, or 20 percent of voting members, district officials may intervene in the internal affairs of a General Council affiliated church. If district leaders conclude that district supervision is warranted, the church will lose its status as a self-governing church and revert to the status of \\"district affiliated assembly\\" until its problems are resolved.[53] A church may also revert to district affiliated status if it no longer meets the minimum requirements for General Council membership, such as having less than 20 voting members.[54]\\r\\nLocal churches, sections, and district councils are able to establish new churches.[55] A church plant may initially be classified as \\"district affiliated\\" until it meets requirements for General Council affiliation. District affiliated congregations are under the direct supervision of district officials but are encouraged to develop into fully self-governing churches. In 2009, the General Council created a new category called \\"parent affiliated churches\\". These are either church plants or campuses of a multi-site church under the supervision of a General Council affiliated \\"parent\\" church.[56]\\r\\nExisting Pentecostal churches considering affiliation with the General Council may request temporary status as a \\"cooperating assembly\\" for a term of four years before officially joining the denomination.[57]\\r\\nChurches are organized into sections and sections into middle judicatories called districts. The 61 districts oversee \\"all the ecclesial and sacerdotal activities\\" within their jurisdiction,[58] which includes recommending ministers for national credentialing and mediating disputes within local congregations.[48] There are two types of districts. Geographical districts serve areas corresponding to state boundaries, while non-geographical language or ethnic districts serve a particular language or ethnic group, such as Hispanic and Samoan churches.[48]\\r\\nDistricts are governed by representative bodies called district councils, which meet annually. District council membership includes all resident ministers and one lay delegate per AG church located within the district. When the district council is not in session, a district is led by a superintendent and a presbytery (board of directors) whose members are elected by and represent the sections.[59] A presbyter \\"minister[s] to ministers\\" and \\"model[s] spiritual maturity and leadership\\" to the ministers and churches in his section.[60]\\r\\nAt the top of this organizational framework is the biennial General Council, the highest governing body of the Assemblies of God. All ordained and licensed ministers and one delegate per Assembly of God church are entitled to attend and participate at the General Council. The size of General Council is not static but fluctuating, changing from year to year as there is no requirement that pastors attend or that churches send delegates. In general, however, there are over 3,000 voting members.[61]\\r\\nGeneral Council enacts legislation, credentials ministers, oversees the national and worldwide missions programs, and directs the churchs colleges and seminary.[48] The General Council also elects the general superintendentthe chief executive officer of the national organizationand other officers, such as the assistant general superintendent, general secretary, general treasurer, and the directors of U.S. and world missions. These manage the AG's day-to-day operations and work together as the Executive Leadership Team.\\r\\nIn between General Council sessions, approximately 300 elected representatives from the various districts and foreign mission areas meet as the General Presbytery.[62] When the General Council is not in session, the General Presbytery acts as the official policy-making body of the Assemblies of God.[63][64] A 20-member Executive Presbytery, led by the Executive Leadership Team, meets bimonthly and functions as the Assemblies of God's board of directors. Executive Presbyters are responsible to the General Presbytery and are ex officio members of that body.[63]\\r\\nThe office of General Superintendent was originally known as the Chairman of the General Council, until it was changed in 1927. The outgoing General Superintendent of the General Council is Dr. George O. Wood. Wood's tenure began October 8, 2007. On August 9, 2017, Rev. Doug Clay was elected to replace Wood. The following is a list of General Superintendents and their tenures:\\r\\nThe Assemblies of God recognizes three classifications of ministers: certified, licensed, and ordained. District councils examine candidates for all levels of ministry and recommend those qualified to the Executive Presbytery (which is the General Council's Credentials Committee), which has authority to issue ministerial credentials.[66] The AG's constitution guarantees that \\"formal academic achievement (diploma or degree) shall not be a requirement for credentials\\", but the General Presbytery does mandate courses and examinations.\\r\\nIn preparation for receiving credentials, applicants must either complete correspondence courses through Global University (the AG's distance education program), receive training through a postsecondary institution such as a college or seminary approved by the AG, or be recommended by a district credentials committee as qualifying for credentials based on self-study and ministerial experience of \\"substantial duration\\". In addition, applicants must pass a standardized exam that tests their knowledge of the Bible, AG doctrines, and ministerial practices. After passing the exam, they are interviewed by their district's credentials committee. If judged qualified, the district will recommend the applicant to the General Council credentials committee.[67]\\r\\nThe Assemblies of God will not grant credentials to divorced and remarried persons if either partner has a former spouse living unless for specific exceptions. Exceptions include if the divorce occurred prior to an applicant's conversion or for \\"scriptural causes\\" such as a former spouse's marital unfaithfulness or the abandonment of a Christian by a non-Christian partner (see Pauline privilege).[68] The Executive Presbytery has authority to issue ecclesiastical annulments in cases involving conditions that prevent \\"the creation of a valid marriage union\\", such as fraud.[69] Clergy are also barred from membership in secret societies.[70]\\r\\nThe Assemblies also recognize a local church credential, which can be issued by a General Council affiliated church for those engaged only in local ministry, such as prison or hospital ministry. Local church credential holders may perform the ordinances of the church with the authorization of the issuing church's senior pastor.[71]\\r\\nIn 2008, there were a total of 34,178 Assemblies of God ministers (excluding local church credentials). Of these, 11,544 were senior pastors and 6,730 were female.[72]\\r\\nA primary reason the General Council was formed in 1914 was to create cooperation in Pentecostal missionary work. Missions have remained a central focus of the denomination since that time. In 2009, there were Assemblies of God churches in 213 countries and territories around the world. Missionary work outside of the United States is overseen by Assemblies of God World Missions. As of December 2009, AG World Missions was reporting 2,719 personnel worldwide.[73] The agency also provides medical evangelism through HealthCare Ministries, founded in 1983 as the Medical Missions Program. This ministry provides free optical, dental, and medical care as well as evangelism.[74] It has operated in 86 countries since its founding.\\r\\nMissions in the United States are overseen by Assemblies of God U.S. Missions. Its seven departments include chaplaincy, Chi Alpha Campus Ministries, church planting, U.S. Mission America Placement Service (MAPS), intercultural ministries, Teen Challenge, and Youth Alive.[75] MAPS offers volunteers the opportunity to contribute to U.S. missions in several ways. One is through church construction and evangelism, and another is through short or long term missions through summer and missionary associate programs. Youth Alive oversees missionary outreach to elementary and high schools. In 2010, U.S. Missions reported 1,059 appointed missionaries, candidates, and spouses. The same year, it reported 542 endorsed chaplains.[76]\\r\\nThe following are some of the ministries and programs of the Assemblies of God USA:\\r\\nIn the United States, the Assemblies of God endorses 10 Bible colleges, 7 universities, and the Assemblies of God Theological Seminary.[77] Enrollment for all AG endorsed colleges and universities was 15,584 for 2013.[78]\\r\\nAssemblies of God churches operate 842 Christian schools, which may have membership with the Association of Christian Teachers and Schools (ACTS), incorporated as the Association of Assemblies of God Christian Schools in 1992. In 2008, there were 105,563 students enrolled in these schools.[78]\\r\\nThe Assemblies of God operates Gospel Publishing House, located in Springfield, Missouri, which publishes books, curriculum, and church ministry resources primarily for Pentecostals and charismatics, but also for the general evangelical market. The Assemblies of God publishes an official weekly magazine, the Pentecostal Evangel, and Enrichment Journal, a resource for Pentecostal ministers.[79][80]\\r\\nThe Assemblies of God in the United States \\"has grown steadily during the 20th century\\".[81] In 1925, there were just 50,386 members in 909 churches, but by the early 1970s membership had reached 1 million. Its most rapid growth occurred from 1971 to 1984, when the AG grew from a constituency of around 1 million to 2 million over a 13-year period.[82] In 2011, average Sunday morning worship attendance for all AG churches in the U.S. was 1,872,399 people. In the same year, the AG's inclusive membership (includes persons of any age that identify with the AG) was 3,041,957 people attending 12,595 churches. That is an increase of 0.4 percent since 2010.[83]\\r\\nThe ethnic diversity of the American AG is increasing; however, its constituency is still largely white. From 1990 to 2000, there was a slight decline in white AG churches while ethnic churches, mainly Hispanic, were responsible for much of the denomination's numerical growth.[84] In 2010, the AG reported 61.1 percent of its adherents as white, 20.4 percent as Hispanic, 9.1 percent as black, 4.1 percent as Asian/Pacific Islander, and 1.6 percent as Native American. The remaining 3.7 percent were listed as other/mixed.[85]\\r\\nThe AG has created various non-geographical language districts to serve immigrant communities whose primary language is not English. There are nine Spanish and two Korean language districts in addition to one each for Brazilian and German speakers. In 2009, the language districts oversaw 2,195 churches with a combined membership of 279,422.[86]\\r\\nMembers are fairly well distributed across the United States. California has the largest number of members, followed by Texas and Florida.[87] However, the states with the highest membership rates are Oklahoma, Arkansas, Alaska, Montana, and Hawaii.[87] Growing AG congregations tend to be located in suburban areas, as opposed to urban and rural ones.[88]\\r\\nThe Assemblies of God has roots in the Pentecostal revival in the early 20th century. The Pentecostal aspects of the revival were not generally welcomed by the established churches, and participants in the movement soon found themselves outside existing religious bodies. They were forced to seek their own places of worship, and soon there were hundreds of distinctly Pentecostal congregations.[89]\\r\\nAfter Charles Parham began promoting the idea that speaking in tongues was the initial evidence of the baptism in the Spirit around 1901, he began to attract a considerable following which he organized loosely as the Apostolic Faith Movement (AFM) in 1906. However, with the rise of the Azusa Street Revival in Los Angeles, California, and an accusation of sodomy against him in 1907, he lost and never recovered his influence. After renouncing Parham, the severely weakened AFM regrouped around Howard A. Goss, L. C. Hall, D. C. O. Opperman, and A. G. Canada. They were later joined by Eudorus N. Bell, previously a Southern Baptist minister. The AFM had its strength in the rural areas of Kansas, Texas, Arkansas, Oklahoma, and Missouri.[90]\\r\\nIn Pentecostalism's early years, organizational affiliation was fluid, and many ministers of the AFM, which was a white organization, were also licensed by Charles Harrison Mason's predominantly African-American Church of God in Christ.[91] In 1907, Goss had received a license to preach from Mason's group, and he claimed that Mason had given him permission to issue ministerial credentials under the Churches of God in Christ name for the \\"white work\\". By 1910, the name \\"Churches of God in Christ\\" was seen as a more biblical name and began to be preferred over \\"Apostolic Faith\\".[90]\\r\\nThe AFM played a leading role in organizing and institutionalizing Pentecostalism in the Midwest and Southwest and from 1909ÿ1912 absorbed smaller Pentecostal groups.[92] It also established relationships with Pentecostal missions in the Midwest. The Midwestern Pentecostal movement centered around the Stone Church, pastored by William Piper, and the North Avenue Mission, pastored by William Howard Durham, both in Chicago, Illinois.[93] Durham was the lead promoter of the Finished Work doctrine which, in time, the AFM would adopt and in doing so discard the Wesleyan view of sanctification as a second work of grace.\\r\\nBetween 1906 and 1908, the Pentecostal message had spread among Christian and Missionary Alliance (CMA) churches and conferences. At first, it was greeted positively by the CMA leadership, but the doctrine of initial evidence divided the organization. Former CMA Pentecostal congregations in the Midwest and Northeast were left without oversight and began associating with the Apostolic Faith Movement and the Chicago Pentecostal missions.[94]\\r\\nBy 1914, many white ministers nominally affiliated with the Church of God in Christ had become dissatisfied with the arrangement.[95] AFM leaders Bell, Goss, Opperman, M. M. Pinson, and A. P. Collins issued the call for a general council to \\"Churches of God in Christ, and to all Pentecostal or Apostolic Faith Assemblies\\". What resulted was a merger of the AFM, Chicago, and CMA Pentecostals in 1914 at Hot Springs, Arkansas.[94] The 1st General Council was attended by predominantly white representatives from 20 states and missions in Egypt and South Africa.[96] The fellowship that emerged was incorporated as the General Council of the Assemblies of God. Bell was elected the first general superintendent. Five major reasons were given for calling the meeting:[97]\\r\\nOther actions taken at the 1st General Council addressed women in ministry. The Pentecostals who founded the Assemblies of God had no objections to women being engaged in ministry. The Pentecostal belief in personal experience, Spirit baptism as empowerment for service, and the need for evangelists and missionaries encouraged women to be active in all types of ministry. What concerned some Pentecostal leaders, such as Bell, were women exercising independent authority over men. The council therefore approved of the granting of credentials to female evangelists and missionaries while restricting the office of pastor to men, and it was not until 1920 that female evangelists could vote at denominational meetings. By the fall of 1914, out of 512 credential holders, 142 were female missionaries and evangelists.[98]\\r\\nAfter 1914, the Church of God in Christ would become predominantly black and the Assemblies of God would remain predominantly white. However, there were African Americans involved in the early years of the Assemblies of God. The African-American pastor Garfield Thomas Haywood, for example, pastored one of the largest churches and was an influential voice within the fellowship until he withdrew from the denomination after 1916.[99]\\r\\nThe founders of the fellowship did not intend to create a denomination and originally had no creed or doctrinal statement. However, in response to several doctrinal issues, the most important being the Oneness teaching, the AG felt the need for agreement on central doctrines and to reassure evangelical Christians of its adherence to orthodox belief.[100] Oneness Pentecostalism rejected Trinitarian theology, instead identifying the Jehovah of the Old Testament with the Christ of the New. Furthermore, Oneness adherents believed that Christians, regardless of a previous baptism, should be baptized in the name of Jesus, rather than in the name of the Trinity. By 1915, it was adhered to by many in the fellowship, including founders such as Goss, Opperman, Hall, and Henry G. Rodgers.[101] Other influential leaders, such as G. T. Haywood, adopted the Oneness doctrine as well.\\r\\nIn 1916, the 4th General Council met in St. Louis to resolve the \\"new issue\\". In a move that caused not a little anxiety, a committee introduced the Statement of Fundamental Truths. Oneness proponents and others saw this as an attack on the authority of the Bible, yet it was adopted along with a recommendation that AG ministers use the Trinitarian baptismal formula. Old preaching credentials were recalled and new ones issued with the Fundamental Truths included. Oneness believers, including a third of the fellowships ministers,[102] were forced to withdraw, a loss especially felt in the South where the Oneness doctrine had the most influence. A side effect of this was a transition in leadership from former Apostolic Faith leaders, many of whom accepted the Oneness teaching, to men with Christian and Missionary Alliance backgrounds.[101] The Oneness dissenters formed the General Assembly of the Apostolic Churches, which later merged with another group to form the Pentecostal Assemblies of the World.[103]\\r\\nAmong the Fundamental Truths was a statement regarding speaking in tongues as the initial physical evidence of Spirit baptism. Its inclusion was challenged by F.F. Bosworth, an executive presbyter, who argued that while for many speaking in tongues was an evidence of the baptism it was not the only evidence. The issue was decided at the General Council of September 1918 where Bosworth, who two months earlier had resigned so as not to damage the fellowship, was present and invited to address the council. Following debate two resolutions were passed which assured that initial evidence would remain an official teaching of the fellowship.[104]\\r\\nWhile doctrinal controversy led to the withdrawal of ministers, the fellowship experienced growth in subsequent years. District councils were organized in various regions of the country and, where these did not exist, home missionary fields were designated to maximize evangelistic efforts. In 1917, W. Jethro Walthall led his Holiness Baptist Association of southwestern Arkansas into the Assemblies of God.[105] District councils and missionary stations were established outside the U.S. also. By 1921, there were districts in Canada (see Pentecostal Assemblies of Canada), China, Japan (see Japan Assemblies of God), India (see Assemblies of God in India), and Egypt.[106] Central Bible College was started in the basement of the Central Assembly of God church in Springfield, Missouri, in 1922.[107] In 1929, the fellowship claimed 91,981 members in 1,612 churches.[108]\\r\\nDespite Pentecostalism's origins in a racially inclusive revival, it accommodated itself to America's culture of racial segregation rather early. The Assemblies of God was no different. As early as 1915, an executive presbyter wrote in an article for the Pentecostal Evangel that segregation was \\"ordained of God\\"; however, it was not until 1939 that the General Presbytery enacted a policy prohibiting the ordination of African Americans to the ministry.[109] Districts were still allowed to license African Americans to preach but only in the district where the license was issued. Black Pentecostals seeking ordination were referred to \\"one of the colored organizations\\". This was especially true of the Church of God in Christ, which, despite the fact that it predates the Assemblies of God, was seen as a \\"younger sibling\\". It was not until 1962, under the leadership of General Superintendent Thomas F. Zimmerman, that the denomination finally began issuing ordinations without regard to race.[110] Three years later the 1965 General Council adopted a resolution affirming the goals of the Civil Rights Movement and condemning racism and discrimination.[111] By the 1970s, there was renewed focus on inner-city evangelism and integrated urban efforts.\\r\\nWhile blacks were excluded from the AG until the 1960s, the denomination's work among Spanish-speaking people has a long history, first sanctioned explicitly in 1918. Hispanic outreach became independent of the Foreign Missions Department in 1929 when the first Latin American District was established. By the end of World War II, the AG's Latin American constituency formed the largest Protestant presence among Hispanics in the United States.[112] The AG also focused on major European immigrant populations, but as later generations assimilated into American culture, these separate European segments were absorbed into the regular geographic districts.\\r\\nDuring the time when African Americans were barred from ordination, women began to receive greater opportunities for leadership. Women formed an important part of the Assemblies of God's constituency, many being Sunday School workers and evangelists, most prominent being Aimee Semple McPherson (who would later found the Foursquare Church). This made the issue of women's place in the movement important in the 1930s.[113] It was also recognized that many congregations who could not afford male pastors relied on women preachers. Despite the fact that opposition to female pastors had been regularly affirmed since 1914, the office of pastor was opened to women in 1935.[114]\\r\\nBetween the World Wars, the movement kept a relative isolation from other Pentecostal and evangelical groups, but after World War II, the AG started an approximation with Pentecostal groups overseas. Like the Federation of Pentecostal Churches in Germany and the Assemblies of God in Australia, at that time many national denominations came to affiliate with the U.S. fellowship. These partnerships would later develop into the World Assemblies of God Fellowship. As well as establishing fellowships in other nations, the AG also began to communicate with other U.S. churches. The Assemblies of God was a founding member of both the National Association of Evangelicals and the Pentecostal Fellowship of North America (now Pentecostal/Charismatic Churches of North America).[115]\\r\\nIn the 1950s, the AG was challenged by the Latter Rain Movement, which began among former members of the Pentecostal Assemblies of Canada, the AG's Canadian counterpart, and quickly spread to the United States. The \\"New Order\\" as it was known was highly critical of denominations, such as the AG, and taught that the gifts of the Spirit are channeled through church elders and are given to others by the laying on of hands. However, the Assemblies of God and other classical Pentecostal groups maintained that the charismata are not personally received or imparted but are manifested as the Holy Spirit wills.[116] In 1949 with a meeting of the General Council approaching, there were fears that the fellowship might split over the Latter Rain issue, but in the end, the General Council was united against what were seen as the excesses of the movement. A General Council resolution specified six errors which included: imparting, identifying, bestowing, or confirming gifts by prophecy and the laying on of hands. It also rejected the idea that the Church is built on present-day apostles and prophets. The Latter Rain theology of no pre-tribulation rapture and the manifested sons of God teaching were condemned as heresy.[117][118] The Latter Rain and the Salvation/Healing Revival of the late 1940s and 50s would be a major influence on later renewal movements.\\r\\nThe affiliation of the Assemblies of God with the National Association of Evangelicals in 1942 signaled the AG's alignment with evangelicalism and its opposition to mainline Protestantism and the ecumenical movement. The AG and its evangelical partners agreed on most issues and shared similar world views though the AG's Pentecostal distinctivesSpirit baptism and the operation of spiritual giftswere not embraced by most evangelical Christians. The AG's response then to the charismatic movement that began in the 1960s was a cautious one, affirming the move of the Holy Spirit yet urging that all revival must be judged by scripture. For the first time, beliefs and practices which had largely remained confined to the classical Pentecostal denominations began to impact mainline Protestant and Roman Catholic churches on a large scale. The fact that this occurred in these churches (which were historically seen by Pentecostals as suspect), the multifaceted nature of the movement owing to the many different traditions its participants came from, and the perception by Pentecostals that the movement was based too much on experience and not on biblical teaching led some in the Assemblies of God to see it in relation to the ecumenical movement.[119]\\r\\nThe charismatic movement forced a reevaluation of what it was to be Pentecostal. The Assemblies of God understood Spirit baptism in the context of baptistic evangelical theology and, by the 1950s, emphasized certain doctrines and practices as requisite for Spirit baptism. Charismatics challenged these views by claiming to receive Holy Spirit baptism outside of this context (such as remaining in liturgical churches, failing to reject sacramental theologies, and not adopting Pentecostal taboos on dancing, drinking, smoking, etc.).[120] On the local level, Assemblies of God churches were influenced by the charismatic movement. Some charismatics left their original churches and joined less formal Assemblies of God congregations. In addition, the contemporary decreased emphasis on traditional Pentecostal taboos in the AG is in part attributable to the charismatic movement, which accelerated a trend already in existence.[121]\\r\\nSince their movement's emergence early in the 20th century, Pentecostals saw themselves as \\"peculiar people\\", and one of the components of this identity were particular prohibitions on behavior. Prohibitions on drug use, gambling, social dancing, consuming alcohol, smoking, attending theaters, bowling, swimming in public pools and beaches, owning television sets, and restrictions on feminine attire and fashion helped distinguish Pentecostals from the larger society.[121][122] Starting in the 1950s, attitudes in the Assemblies of God on many of these activities underwent dramatic change. The most change probably occurred over views on women's attire, with the former stance against wearing make-up and jewelry giving way to the acceptance of popular fashion. Most of these \\"holiness standards\\" are no longer adhered to; however, some are still held to, such as proscriptions on smoking, alcohol and drug use.[122]\\r\\nFor much of its history, the Assemblies of God officially opposed Christian participation in war[123] and was listed by The Pacifist Handbook as America's third largest peace church in 1940. The official position of the church until 1967 encouraged Christian nonviolence: \\"We . . . are nevertheless constrained to declare we cannot conscientiously participate in war and armed resistance which involves the actual destruction of human life, since this is contrary to our view of the clear teachings of the inspired Word of God\\".[124] Most of the founders and first generation members of the denomination held to this view, and it was presented as official teaching throughout World War I and World War II. The official pacifist position remained unchanged until 1967 when the denomination affirmed \\"the right of each member to choose whether to declare their position as a combatant, a noncombatant, or a conscientious objector\\".[125] This was the culmination of a process begun during World War I, when it was unpopular to hold antiwar views, in which AG adherents questioned their denomination's pacifist stance.[126]\\r\\nThe Assemblies of God emerged as the leading Pentecostal denomination in terms of status, wealth, influence, and global adherence.[127] In the 1980s, the Assemblies of God saw rapid growth in the US, for several years ranking as the fastest growing American denomination. This growth was mainly the result of its Hispanic outreach (in 1988 Hispanic members made up some 15 percent of the fellowship's total constituency).[128] The growth of an Asian immigrant constituency was also recognized in this decade when the first Korean district was created. The Assemblies of God gained national visibility in the late 1980s from the popularity and later scandals surrounding two of its ministers, Jimmy Swaggart and Jim Bakker.[129] The Assemblies of God launched an effort to increase evangelism and growth in the 1990s called the \\"Decade of Harvest\\". Such efforts failed to sustain the impressive growth of the 1980s, however. From 2003 to 2008, growth had slowed to an average annual increase of just over 1 percent.[127]\\r\\nWith increased growth came increased acceptance and acculturation. Since the 1980s, a growing number of AG ministers have been educated and risen to leadership positions at evangelical institutions, such as Fuller Theological Seminary, Gordon-Conwell, and Trinity Evangelical Divinity School.[127] This \\"evangelicalization of the Assemblies of God\\" has led to the weakening of Pentecostal distinctives, especially the doctrine of initial evidence.[130] Other traditional practices, such as holding prayer meetings and altar services, have faded over time as well. Despite the efforts of denominational leaders to reassert Pentecostal identity and remain more than \\"evangelicals plus tongues\\", the process of acculturation has continued.[127]\\r\\nEven so, churches within the Assemblies of God have experienced revivals in the last two decades which featured worship and practices reminiscent of early Pentecostalism. The most prominent of these was the Brownsville Revival, which occurred at the Brownsville Assembly of God in Pensacola, Florida, from 1995 into the early 2000s. These revivals often faced criticism from within and without the Assemblies of God for their unpredictability and the dramatic religious experiences of participants. In the case of the Brownsville Revival, the AG's national leadership gave it cautious approval and support.[131]","input":"How many assemblies of god churches in america?"},{"output":"Jeanne Calment","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is a list of the 100 verified oldest people, arranged in descending order of each individual's age in years and days.

It travels through the states of California, Oregon, and Washington, serving several large cities on the U.S. West Coast, including San Diego, Los Angeles, Sacramento, Portland, and Seattle. It is currently the only continuous Interstate highway to touch both the Mexican border and the Canadian border. Upon crossing the Mexican border at its southern terminus, Interstate 5 continues to Tijuana, Baja California as Mexico Federal Highway 1. Upon crossing the Canadian border at its northern terminus, it continues to Vancouver as British Columbia Highway 99.\\r\\n\\r\\nInterstate 5 was originally created in 1956 as part of the Interstate Highway System, but was predated by several auto trails and highways built in the early 20th century. The Pacific Highway auto trail was built in the 1910s and 1920s by the states of California, Oregon, and Washington, and was later incorporated into U.S. Route 99 (US 99) in 1926. Interstate 5 largely follows the route of US 99, with the exception of a portion in the Central Valley of California. The freeway was built in segments between 1956 and 1979, including expressway sections of US 99 that were built earlier to bypass various towns along the route.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe southernmost point of I-5 is at the Mexican border at the San Ysidro border crossing, one of the busiest in the world.[2] Beginning at the border in San Ysidro, which is part of the city of San Diego, as the John J. Montgomery Freeway, I-5 goes through the suburbs of Chula Vista and National City before reaching downtown San Diego. It then parallels the Pacific coastline, going through the northern suburbs of San Diego, bisecting the University of California, San Diego campus, and passing the I-805 merge (where it becomes the widest Interstate in the United States for a short stretch), before passing through the 28 miles (45?km) of Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton in northern San Diego County. Here I-5 is also known as the San Diego Freeway.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt Dana Point, I-5 turns inland and heads due north through Mission Viejo to the El Toro Y interchange in southeastern Irvine. I-5 becomes the Santa Ana Freeway as it runs southeast to northwest, passing through major cities and suburbs in Orange and Southern Los Angeles counties. Southern Californians refer to it as \\"the 5\\" or as the Santa Ana Freeway in the Los Angeles area. From this point, the San Diego Freeway continues northward as I-405.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the freeway reaches the East Los Angeles Interchange one mile (1.6?km) east of downtown Los Angeles, I-5 becomes the Golden State Freeway. The route continues through the San Fernando Valley and then crosses the Newhall Pass through the Santa Susana Mountains into the Santa Clarita Valley. The interchange with State Route 14 (SR?14) is unusual in that truck traffic is separated into its own lanes for both the mainline of the freeway and the transition ramps to and from SR?14. For about a four-mile (6.4?km) stretch between Santa Clarita Valley and the Pyramid Lake, the northbound and southbound lanes separate and cross sides, with the southbound lanes running to the east of the northbound ones. At that point, the Golden State Freeway rises sharply to the north through the Grapevine to eventually reach the second-highest point of its entire length, the Tejon Pass (elevation 4,183?ft or 1,275?m). Through the Tehachapi Mountains. Path 26 power lines generally follow the freeway along this stretch. The freeway then descends sharply for 12 miles (19?km) at Tejon Pass to around 1,600 feet (490?m) at Grapevine near the southernmost point of the San Joaquin Valley, approximately 30 miles (48?km) south of Bakersfield and 4?mi (6.4?km) south from where SR?99 splits away from it in Wheeler Ridge.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom SR?99 to south of Tracy, I-5 skirts along the far more remote western edge of the great Central Valley, and thus here is removed from population centers such as Bakersfield and Fresno; other state highways provide these connections. This part of I-5 is known as the West Side Freeway, and is a major connector between the San Francisco Bay Area and Southern California. I-580 splits from I-5 at a point south of Tracy as the West Side Freeway Scenic Byway, the last stretch of the West Side Freewayproviding a loop-route connection to the San Francisco Bay Area. East of Tracy, I-5 intersects with I-205, another freeway that links I-5 to the Bay Area and passes through Tracy. After passing Tracy, I-5 heads north through Stockton and Sacramento before turning west to Woodland. At Woodland, the Interstate heads northwest again towards Dunnigan, where it converges with I-505.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom Dunnigan, I-5 skirts north along the western edge of the Sacramento Valley to Red Bluff. I-5 then enters the Shasta Cascade region, passing through Redding and Shasta Lake before climbing up to near the foot of Mount Shasta. The interstate then travels to Weed and Yreka before reaching the Oregon border.\\r\\n\\r\\nAbout three miles (4.8?km) north of the California border, the highway crosses 4,310 feet (1,310?m) Siskiyou Summit, the highest point on I-5, and then drops down into the Rogue Valley through Oregon's southern mountains and towns such as Ashland, Medford and Grants Pass. Turning north across three passes to the Umpqua Valley and through Roseburg, the mountains tend to turn into hills, and as it reaches Cottage Grove, the road enters the Willamette River Valley. At Eugene the highway intersects I-105, a short spur route into Downtown Eugene. Some city highways intersect on I-5 in the Eugene Metro. The Interstate then heads almost due north, skirting Albany and Corvallis, passing through Salem, and crossing through Woodburn. There were plans to build a spur, called I-305, into Salem. I-5 covers 308 miles (496?km) in Oregon.\\r\\n\\r\\nJust north of Salem, between mile markers 259 and 260 just short of mile marker 260, signs in the median and on both shoulders mark the place where the 45th parallel crosses I-5. It reads \\"45th Parallel half way between the Equator and the North Pole\\".\\r\\n\\r\\nThe highway then tracks a little to the northeast, and I-205 splits off south of the Portland metro area. From here I-5 passes through Tualatin and Tigard along former U.S. Route 99W (US?99W) before hitting the southern terminus of I-405 and the Marquam Bridge. Also planned was a spur in Portland off I-405, called I-505, but it was never built and has been removed from city plans. A stub of I-505 exists as a long exit ramp to US?30.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter crossing the Willamette River on the Marquam Bridge, I-5 has junctions at the western end of I-84 and the northern end of I-405. It then continues through the northern parts of the city of Portland, and crosses into Washington via the Interstate Bridge.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe highway continues over the Columbia River and drops down into the city of Vancouver. About seven miles (11?km) into the state, it reaches the northern terminus of I-205, which is on the eastern edge of the PortlandÿVancouver metropolitan area. It then tracks north by northwest through Woodland to Kelso and Longview, at which point it ceases to parallel a large bend of the Columbia River. Continuing north between the Willapa Hills and the Cascade foothills, the freeway eventually reaches Olympia, where it bends sharply east. The highway passes though the northern end of Joint Base Lewis-McChord (formerly Fort Lewis and McChord Air Force Base) and Tacoma, where it bends sharply north again to reach Seattle. The Ship Canal Bridge carries it over Portage Bay in Seattle. The freeway continues north out of the SeattleÿTacomaÿEverett metro area, crosses the floodplains of three rivers, through the Skagit Valley and the Mount VernonÿBurlington Metropolitan Area to the northern city of Bellingham, to arrive at the Peace Arch CanadaÿUS border crossing between Blaine, Washington, and Surrey, British Columbia. Highway 99 continues northwest from the border into Vancouver, BC. I-5 covers 277 miles (446?km) in Washington.\\r\\n\\r\\nAn extensive section of this highway (over 600 miles (970?km)), from approximately Stockton, California, to Portland, Oregon, follows very closely the track of the Siskiyou Trail.[3] This trail was based on an ancient network of Native American footpaths connecting the Pacific Northwest with California's Central Valley. By the 1820s, trappers from the Hudson's Bay Company were the first non-Native Americans to use the route of today's I-5 to move between today's Washington State and California. During the second half of the 19th century, mule trains, stagecoaches, and the Central Pacific railroad also followed the route of the Siskiyou Trail.[3] By the early 20th century, pioneering automobile roads were built along the path of the Siskiyou Trail, notably the Pacific Highway. The Pacific Highway ran from British Columbia to San Diego, California, and was the immediate predecessor of much of US?99. The route of US?99 was in turn used as a basis for much of the route of today's I-5.\\r\\n\\r\\nA major deviation from the old US?99 route is the Westside Freeway portion of I-5 in California's Central Valley. To provide a faster and more direct north-south route through the state, the decision was made to build a new freeway to the west and bypass Fresno, Bakersfield, and the rest of population centers in the area instead of upgrading the existing highway (which was re-designated as part of SR?99).[4]\\r\\nThis re-route through California's Central Valley was the last section of I-5 to be constructed, with the final segment dedicated and opened to traffic near Stockton, California, on October 12, 1979. Representatives from both Canada and Mexico attended the dedication to commemorate the first contiguous freeway connecting the North American countries.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nThis direct route also bypasses San Francisco and the rest of the San Francisco Bay Area. Original plans called for a loop Interstate with a directional suffix, I-5W.[4] This route now roughly corresponds to I-580 from I-5 south of Tracy to Oakland, I-80 from Oakland to Vacaville, and I-505 from Vacaville to I-5 near Dunnigan. I-5W and most of the other Interstates around the country with directional suffixes were eventually renumbered or eliminated. Nevertheless, San Francisco is still listed as a control city on northbound I-5 between SR?99 and I-580.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn May 23, 2013, a portion of a bridge on I-5 collapsed in Washington (near Mount Vernon, between Seattle and the CanadaÿUS border at mile marker 228.3), sending two cars into the water and requiring traffic in both directions to bypass the crossing.[6] The Washington State Department of Transportation used a temporary structure to restore access across the river while a permanent bridge replacement was built. That process was completed September 15, 2013.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn December 18, 2017 an Amtrak Train derailed by an overpass on I-5 near Tacoma, Washington and blocked several lanes of traffic.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nI-5 will have a complete set of auxiliary routes (i.e. 105, 205, 305, 405, 505, 605, 705, 805, 905), with the completion of I-905 in San Diego County. Currently, I-80 and I-90 are the only two Interstates to have complete sets of auxiliary routes.\\r\\n\\r\\nRoute map: Google","input":"What freeway runs through seattle portland sacramento and los angeles?"},{"output":"Green","context":"25,000 years before present to 1944\\r\\nMount Vesuvius ( /v??su?vi?s/; Italian: Monte Vesuvio [?monte ve?zu?vjo]; Neapolitan: Vesuvio; Latin: Mons Vesuvius [m??s w??s?w?.?s]; also Vesevus or Vesaevus in some Roman sources)[1] is a somma-stratovolcano located on the Gulf of Naples in Campania, Italy, about 9?km (5.6?mi) east of Naples and a short distance from the shore. It is one of several volcanoes which form the Campanian volcanic arc. Vesuvius consists of a large cone partially encircled by the steep rim of a summit caldera caused by the collapse of an earlier and originally much higher structure.\\r\\nMount Vesuvius is best known for its eruption in AD 79 that led to the burying and destruction of the Roman cities of Pompeii and Herculaneum, as well as several other settlements. The eruption ejected a cloud of stones, ashes and volcanic gases to a height of 33?km (21?mi), spewing molten rock and pulverized pumice at the rate of 6G105 cubic metres (7.8G105?cu?yd) per second,[2] ultimately releasing a hundred thousand times the thermal energy released by the Hiroshima-Nagasaki bombings.[3] More than 1,000 people died in the eruption, but exact numbers are unknown. The only surviving eyewitness account of the event consists of two letters by Pliny the Younger to the historian Tacitus.[4]\\r\\nVesuvius has erupted many times since and is the only volcano on the European mainland to have erupted within the last hundred years. Today, it is regarded as one of the most dangerous volcanoes in the world because of the population of 3,000,000 people living nearby and its tendency towards violent, explosive eruptions of the Plinian type, making it the most densely populated volcanic region in the world.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nVesuvius has a long historic and literary tradition. It was considered a divinity of the Genius type at the time of the eruption of AD 79: it appears under the inscribed name Vesuvius as a serpent in the decorative frescos of many lararia, or household shrines, surviving from Pompeii. An inscription from Capua[6] to IOVI VESVVIO indicates that he was worshipped as a power of Jupiter; that is, Jupiter Vesuvius.[7]\\r\\nThe historian Diodorus Siculus relates a tradition that Hercules, in the performance of his labors, passed through the country of nearby Cumae on his way to Sicily and found there a place called \\"the Phlegraean Plain\\" (phlegraion pedion, \\"plain of fire\\"), \\"from a hill which anciently vomited out fire ... now called Vesuvius.\\"[8] It was inhabited by bandits, \\"the sons of the Earth,\\" who were giants. With the assistance of the gods he pacified the region and went on. The facts behind the tradition, if any, remain unknown, as does whether Herculaneum was named after it. An epigram by the poet Martial in 88 AD suggests that both Venus, patroness of Pompeii, and Hercules were worshipped in the region devastated by the eruption of 79.[9] Mount Vesuvius was regarded by the Romans as being devoted to the hero and demigod Hercules.[10]\\r\\nVesuvius was a name of the volcano in frequent use by the authors of the late Roman Republic and the early Roman Empire. Its collateral forms were Vesaevus, Vesevus, Vesbius and Vesvius.[11] Writers in ancient Greek used Ѯ?? or Ѯ???. Many scholars since then have offered an etymology. As peoples of varying ethnicity and language occupied Campania in the Roman Iron Age, the etymology depends to a large degree on the presumption of what language was spoken there at the time. Naples was settled by Greeks, as the name Nea-polis, \\"New City\\", testifies. The Oscans, a native Italic people, lived in the countryside. The Latins also competed for the occupation of Campania. Etruscan settlements were in the vicinity. Other peoples of unknown provenance are said to have been there at some time by various ancient authors.\\r\\nSome theories about its origin are:\\r\\nVesuvius is a distinctive \\"humpbacked\\" peak, consisting of a large cone (Gran Cono) partially encircled by the steep rim of a summit caldera caused by the collapse of an earlier and originally much higher structure called Mount Somma.[15] The Gran Cono was produced during the A.D. 79 eruption. For this reason, the volcano is also called Somma-Vesuvius or Somma-Vesuvio.\\r\\nThe caldera started forming during an eruption around 17,000 (or 18,300) years ago[16][17][18] and was enlarged by later paroxysmal eruptions,[19] ending in the one of AD 79. This structure has given its name to the term \\"somma volcano\\", which describes any volcano with a summit caldera surrounding a newer cone.[20]\\r\\nThe height of the main cone has been constantly changed by eruptions but was 1,281?m (4,203?ft) in 2010.[17] Monte Somma is 1,132?m (3,714?ft) high, separated from the main cone by the valley of Atrio di Cavallo, which is 5?km (3.1?mi) long. The slopes of the volcano are scarred by lava flows, while the rest are heavily vegetated, with scrub and forests at higher altitudes and vineyards lower down. Vesuvius is still regarded as an active volcano, although its current activity produces little more than sulfur-rich steam from vents at the bottom and walls of the crater. Vesuvius is a stratovolcano at the convergent boundary where the African Plate is being subducted beneath the Eurasian Plate. Layers of lava, ash, scoria and pumice make up the volcanic peak. Their mineralogy is variable, but generally silica-undersaturated and rich in potassium, with phonolite produced in the more explosive eruptions.[21]\\r\\nVesuvius was formed as a result of the collision of two tectonic plates, the African and the Eurasian. The former was subducted beneath the latter, deeper into the earth. As the water-saturated sediments of the oceanic African plate were pushed to hotter depths inside the planet, the water boiled off and caused the melting point of the upper mantle to drop enough to create partial melting of the rocks. Because magma is less dense than the solid rock around it, it was pushed upward. Finding a weak spot at the Earth's surface, it broke through, thus forming the volcano.\\r\\nThe volcano is one of several which form the Campanian volcanic arc. Others include Campi Flegrei, a large caldera a few kilometers to the north west, Mount Epomeo, 20 kilometres (12?mi) to the west on the island of Ischia, and several undersea volcanoes to the south. The arc forms the southern end of a larger chain of volcanoes produced by the subduction process described above, which extends northwest along the length of Italy as far as Monte Amiata in Southern Tuscany. Vesuvius is the only one to have erupted within recent history, although some of the others have erupted within the last few hundred years. Many are either extinct or have not erupted for tens of thousands of years.\\r\\nMount Vesuvius has erupted many times. The famous eruption in AD 79 was preceded by numerous others in prehistory, including at least three significantly larger ones, the best known being the Avellino eruption around 1800 BC which engulfed several Bronze Age settlements. Since AD 79, the volcano has also erupted repeatedly, in 172, 203, 222, possibly in 303, 379, 472, 512, 536, 685, 787, around 860, around 900, 968, 991, 999, 1006, 1037, 1049, around 1073, 1139, 1150, and there may have been eruptions in 1270, 1347, and 1500.[19] The volcano erupted again in 1631, six times in the 18th century (especially in 1779 and 1794), eight times in the 19th century (notably in 1872), and in 1906, 1929 and 1944. There have been no eruptions since 1944, and none of the eruptions after AD 79 were as large or destructive as the Pompeian one.\\r\\nThe eruptions vary greatly in severity but are characterized by explosive outbursts of the kind dubbed Plinian after Pliny the Younger, a Roman writer who published a detailed description of the 79 AD eruption, including his uncle's death.[22] On occasion, eruptions from Vesuvius have been so large that the whole of southern Europe has been blanketed by ash; in 472 and 1631, Vesuvian ash fell on Constantinople (Istanbul), over 1,200 kilometres (750?mi) away. A few times since 1944, landslides in the crater have raised clouds of ash dust, raising false alarms of an eruption.\\r\\nScientific knowledge of the geologic history of Vesuvius comes from core samples taken from a 2,000?m (6,600?ft) plus bore hole on the flanks of the volcano, extending into Mesozoic rock. Cores were dated by potassiumÿargon and argonÿargon dating.[23] The volcano started forming 25,000 years ago. Although the area has been subject to volcanic activity for at least 400,000 years, the lowest layer of eruption material from the Somma caldera lies on top of the 40,000 year?old Campanian ignimbrite produced by the Campi Flegrei complex, and was the product of the Codola Plinian eruption 25,000 years ago.[15]\\r\\nIt was then built up by a series of lava flows, with some smaller explosive eruptions interspersed between them. However, the style of eruption changed around 19,000 years ago to a sequence of large explosive Plinian eruptions, of which the AD 79 one was the most recent. The eruptions are named after the tephra deposits produced by them, which in turn are named after the location where the deposits were first identified:[24]\\r\\nThe volcano was then quiet (for 295 years, if the 217 BC date for the last previous eruption is true) and was described by Roman writers as having been covered with gardens and vineyards, except at the top, which was craggy. The volcano may have had only one summit at that time, judging by a wall painting, \\"Bacchus and Vesuvius\\", found in a Pompeian house, the House of the Centenary (Casa del Centenario).\\r\\nSeveral surviving works written over the 200?years preceding the AD 79 eruption describe the mountain as having had a volcanic nature, although Pliny the Elder did not depict the mountain in this way in his Naturalis Historia:[30]\\r\\nOn August 24, in the year AD 79, Vesuvius erupted in one of the most catastrophic and famous eruptions of all time. Historians have learned about the eruption from the eyewitness account of Pliny the Younger, a Roman administrator and poet.[34]\\r\\nThe volcano ejected a cloud of stones, ashes and volcanic gases to a height of 33?km (21?mi), spewing molten rock and pulverized pumice at the rate of 6G105 cubic metres (7.8G105?cu?yd) per second, ultimately releasing a hundred thousand times the thermal energy released by the Hiroshima-Nagasaki bombings.[3] The cities of Pompeii and Herculaneum were destroyed by pyroclastic surges and the ruins buried under dozens of feet of tephra.[3][34]\\r\\nThe AD 79 eruption was preceded by a powerful earthquake seventeen years beforehand on February 05 of AD 62, which caused widespread destruction around the Bay of Naples, and particularly to Pompeii.[35] Some of the damage had still not been repaired when the volcano erupted.[36] The deaths of 600 sheep from \\"tainted air\\" in the vicinity of Pompeii indicates that the earthquake of AD 62 may have been related to new activity by Vesuvius[37]\\r\\nThe Romans grew accustomed to minor earth tremors in the region; the writer Pliny the Younger even wrote that they \\"were not particularly alarming because they are frequent in Campania\\". Small earthquakes started taking place on 20 August 79[36] becoming more frequent over the next four days, but the warnings were not recognized.[a]\\r\\nReconstructions of the eruption and its effects vary considerably in the details but have the same overall features. The eruption lasted two days. The morning of the first day was perceived as normal by the only eyewitness to leave a surviving document, Pliny the Younger. In the middle of the day an explosion threw up a high-altitude column from which ash and pumice began to fall, blanketing the area. Rescues and escapes occurred during this time. At some time in the night or early the next day pyroclastic surges in the close vicinity of the volcano began. Lights were seen on the peak interpreted as fires. People as far away as Misenum fled for their lives. The flows were rapid-moving, dense and very hot, knocking down wholly or partly all structures in their path, incinerating or suffocating all population remaining there and altering the landscape, including the coastline. These were accompanied by additional light tremors and a mild tsunami in the Bay of Naples. By late afternoon of the second day, the eruption was over, leaving only haze in the atmosphere through which the sun shone weakly.\\r\\nThe latest scientific studies of the ash produced by Vesuvius reveals a multi-phase eruption.[38] The initial major explosion produced a column of ash and pumice ranging between 15 and 30 kilometres (49,000 and 98,000?ft) high, which rained on Pompeii to the southeast but not on Herculaneum upwind. The chief energy supporting the column came from the escape of steam superheated by the magma, created from seawater seeping over time into the deep faults of the region, that came into interaction with magma and heat.\\r\\nSubsequently, the cloud collapsed as the gases expanded and lost their capability to support their solid contents, releasing it as a pyroclastic surge, which first reached Herculaneum but not Pompeii. Additional blasts reinstituted the column. The eruption alternated between Plinian and Pelan six times. Surges 3 and 4 are believed by the authors to have buried Pompeii.[39] Surges are identified in the deposits by dune and cross-bedding formations, which are not produced by fallout.\\r\\nAnother study used the magnetic characteristics of over 200 samples of roof-tile and plaster fragments collected around Pompeii to estimate equilibrium temperature of the pyroclastic flow.[40] The magnetic study revealed that on the first day of the eruption a fall of white pumice containing clastic fragments of up to 3 centimetres (1.2?in) fell for several hours.[41] It heated the roof tiles up to 140?C (284?F).[42] This period would have been the last opportunity to escape.\\r\\nThe collapse of the Plinian columns on the second day caused pyroclastic density currents (PDCs) that devastated Herculaneum and Pompeii. The depositional temperature of these pyroclastic surges ranged up to 300?C (572?F).[43] Any population remaining in structural refuges could not have escaped, as the city was surrounded by gases of incinerating temperatures. The lowest temperatures were in rooms under collapsed roofs. These were as low as 100?C (212?F).[44]\\r\\nThe only surviving eyewitness account of the event consists of two letters by Pliny the Younger to the historian Tacitus.[4] Pliny the Younger describes, amongst other things, the last days in the life of his uncle, Pliny the Elder. Observing the first volcanic activity from Misenum across the Bay of Naples from the volcano, approximately 35 kilometres (22?mi), the elder Pliny launched a rescue fleet and went himself to the rescue of a personal friend. His nephew declined to join the party. One of the nephew's letters relates what he could discover from witnesses of his uncle's experiences.[45][46] In a second letter the younger Pliny details his own observations after the departure of his uncle.[47][48]\\r\\nThe two men saw an extraordinarily dense cloud rising rapidly above the peak. This cloud and a request by a messenger for an evacuation by sea prompted the elder Pliny to order rescue operations in which he sailed away to participate. His nephew attempted to resume a normal life, but that night a tremor awoke him and his mother, prompting them to abandon the house for the courtyard. Further tremors near dawn caused the population to abandon the village and caused disastrous wave action in the Bay of Naples.\\r\\nThe early light was obscured by a black cloud through which shone flashes, which Pliny likens to sheet lightning, but more extensive. The cloud obscured Point Misenum near at hand and the island of Capraia (Capri) across the bay. Fearing for their lives, the population began to call to each other and move back from the coast along the road. A rain of ash fell, causing Pliny to shake it off periodically to avoid being buried. Later that same day the pumice and ash stopped falling and the sun shone weakly through the cloud, encouraging Pliny and his mother to return to their home and wait for news of Pliny the Elder.\\r\\nPliny's uncle Pliny the Elder was in command of the Roman fleet at Misenum, and had meanwhile decided to investigate the phenomenon at close hand in a light vessel. As the ship was preparing to leave the area, a messenger came from his friend Rectina (wife of Tascius[49]) living on the coast near the foot of the volcano explaining that her party could only get away by sea and asking for rescue. Pliny ordered the immediate launching of the fleet galleys to the evacuation of the coast. He continued in his light ship to the rescue of Rectina's party.\\r\\nHe set off across the bay but in the shallows on the other side encountered thick showers of hot cinders, lumps of pumice and pieces of rock. Advised by the helmsman to turn back, he stated \\"Fortune favors the brave\\" and ordered him to continue on to Stabiae (about 4.5 kilometers from Pompeii).\\r\\nPliny the Elder and his party saw flames coming from several parts of the crater. After staying overnight, the party was driven from the building by an accumulation of material, presumably tephra, which threatened to block all egress. They woke Pliny, who had been napping and emitting loud snoring. They elected to take to the fields with pillows tied to their heads to protect them from the raining debris. They approached the beach again but the wind prevented the ships from leaving. Pliny sat down on a sail that had been spread for him and could not rise even with assistance when his friends departed. Though Pliny the Elder died, his friends ultimately escaped by land.[50]\\r\\nIn the first letter to Tacitus, Pliny the Younger suggested that his uncle's death was due to the reaction of his weak lungs to a cloud of poisonous, sulphurous gas that wafted over the group. However, Stabiae was 16?km from the vent (roughly where the modern town of Castellammare di Stabia is situated) and his companions were apparently unaffected by the volcanic gases, and so it is more likely that the corpulent Pliny died from some other cause, such as a stroke or heart attack.[51] His body was found with no apparent injuries on the next day, after dispersal of the plume.\\r\\nAlong with Pliny the Elder, the only other noble casualties of the eruption to be known by name were Agrippa (a son of the Herodian Jewish princess Drusilla and the procurator Antonius Felix) and his wife.[52]\\r\\nBy 2003, around 1,044?casts made from impressions of bodies in the ash deposits had been recovered in and around Pompeii, with the scattered bones of another 100.[53] The remains of about 332 bodies have been found at Herculaneum (300 in arched vaults discovered in 1980).[54] What percentage these numbers are of the total dead or the percentage of the dead to the total number at risk remain completely unknown.\\r\\nThirty-eight percent of the 1,044 were found in the ash fall deposits, the majority inside buildings. These are thought to have been killed mainly by roof collapses, with the smaller number of victims found outside of buildings probably being killed by falling roof slates or by larger rocks thrown out by the volcano. The remaining 62% of remains found at Pompeii were in the pyroclastic surge deposits,[53] and thus were probably killed by them ÿ probably from a combination of suffocation through ash inhalation and blast and debris thrown around. In contrast to the victims found at Herculaneum, examination of cloth, frescoes and skeletons show that it is unlikely that high temperatures were a significant cause. Herculaneum, which was much closer to the crater, was saved from tephra falls by the wind direction, but was buried under 23 metres (75?ft) of material deposited by pyroclastic surges. It is likely that most, or all, of the known victims in this town were killed by the surges.\\r\\nPeople caught on the former seashore by the first surge died of thermal shock. The rest were concentrated in arched chambers at a density of as high as 3 persons per square metre. As only 85 metres (279?ft) of the coast have been excavated, casualties may be waiting to be excavated.\\r\\nSince the eruption of AD 79, Vesuvius has erupted around three dozen times. It erupted again in 203, during the lifetime of the historian Cassius Dio. In 472, it ejected such a volume of ash that ashfalls were reported as far away as Constantinople. The eruptions of 512 were so severe that those inhabiting the slopes of Vesuvius were granted exemption from taxes by Theodoric the Great, the Gothic king of Italy. Further eruptions were recorded in 787, 968, 991, 999, 1007 and 1036 with the first recorded lava flows. The volcano became quiescent at the end of the 13th century and in the following years it again became covered with gardens and vineyards as of old. Even the inside of the crater was moderately filled with shrubbery.\\r\\nVesuvius entered a new phase in December 1631, when a major eruption buried many villages under lava flows, killing around 3,000 people. Torrents of lahar were also created, adding to the devastation. Activity thereafter became almost continuous, with relatively severe eruptions occurring in 1660, 1682, 1694, 1698, 1707, 1737, 1760, 1767, 1779, 1794, 1822, 1834, 1839, 1850, 1855, 1861, 1868, 1872, 1906, 1926, 1929 and 1944.\\r\\nThe eruption of April 05 in 1906,[55][56] killed more than 100 people and ejected the most lava ever recorded from a Vesuvian eruption. Italian authorities were preparing to hold the 1908 Summer Olympics when Mount Vesuvius violently erupted, devastating the city of Naples and surrounding comunes. Funds were diverted to the reconstruction of Naples, requiring a new location for the Olympics to be found.\\r\\nThe last major eruption was in March 1944. It destroyed the villages of San Sebastiano al Vesuvio, Massa di Somma, Ottaviano, and part of San Giorgio a Cremano.[57] From March 18 to 23, 1944, lava flows appeared within the rim. There were outflows. Small explosions then occurred until the major explosion took place on March 18, 1944.[58]\\r\\nAt the time of the eruption, the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) 340th Bombardment Group was based at Pompeii Airfield near Terzigno, Italy, just a few kilometres from the eastern base of the volcano. The tephra and hot ash damaged the fabric control surfaces, the engines, the Plexiglas windscreens and the gun turrets of the 340th's B-25 Mitchell medium bombers. Estimates ranged from 78 to 88 aircraft destroyed.[59]\\r\\nThe eruption could be seen from Naples. Different perspectives and the damage caused to the local villages were recorded by USAAF photographers and other personnel based nearer to the volcano.[60]\\r\\nLarge Vesuvian eruptions which emit volcanic material in quantities of about 1 cubic kilometre (0.24?cu?mi), the most recent of which overwhelmed Pompeii and Herculaneum, have happened after periods of inactivity of a few thousand years. Sub-Plinian eruptions producing about 0.1 cubic kilometres (0.024?cu?mi), such as those of 472 and 1631, have been more frequent with a few hundred years between them. Following the 1631 eruption until 1944 every few years saw a comparatively small eruption which emitted 0.001ÿ0.01?km3 of magma. It seems that for Vesuvius, the amount of magma expelled in an eruption increases very roughly linearly with the interval since the previous one, and at a rate of around 0.001 cubic kilometres (0.00024?cu?mi) for each year. This gives an approximate figure of 0.06 cubic kilometres (0.014?cu?mi) for an eruption after 60?years of inactivity.[61]\\r\\nMagma sitting in an underground chamber for many years will start to see higher melting point constituents such as olivine crystallizing out. The effect is to increase the concentration of dissolved gases (mostly sulfur dioxide and carbon dioxide) in the remaining liquid magma, making the subsequent eruption more violent. As gas-rich magma approaches the surface during an eruption, the huge drop in internal pressure caused by the reduction in weight of the overlying rock (which drops to zero at the surface) causes the gases to come out of solution, the volume of gas increasing explosively from nothing to perhaps many times that of the accompanying magma. Additionally, the removal of the higher melting point material will raise the concentration of felsic components such as silicates potentially making the magma more viscous, adding to the explosive nature of the eruption.\\r\\nThe government emergency plan for an eruption therefore assumes that the worst case will be an eruption of similar size and type to the 1631 VEI 4[62] one. In this scenario the slopes of the volcano, extending out to about 7 kilometres (4.3?mi) from the vent, may be exposed to pyroclastic surges sweeping down them, whilst much of the surrounding area could suffer from tephra falls. Because of prevailing winds, towns and cities to the south and east of the volcano are most at risk from this, and it is assumed that tephra accumulation exceeding 100 kilograms per square metre (20?lb/sq?ft) ÿ at which point people are at risk from collapsing roofs ÿ may extend out as far as Avellino to the east or Salerno to the south-east. Towards Naples, to the north west, this tephra fall hazard is assumed to extend barely past the slopes of the volcano.[61] The specific areas actually affected by the ash cloud will depend upon the particular circumstances surrounding the eruption.\\r\\nThe plan assumes between two weeks and 20 days' notice of an eruption and foresees the emergency evacuation of 600,000?people, almost entirely comprising all those living in the zona rossa (\\"red zone\\"), i.e. at greatest risk from pyroclastic flows.[5][63] The evacuation, by trains, ferries, cars, and buses is planned to take about seven days, and the evacuees will mostly be sent to other parts of the country rather than to safe areas in the local Campania region, and may have to stay away for several months. However, the dilemma that would face those implementing the plan is when to start this massive evacuation, since if it is left too late then thousands could be killed, while if it is started too early then the precursors of the eruption may turn out to have been a false alarm. In 1984, 40,000?people were evacuated from the Campi Flegrei area, another volcanic complex near Naples, but no eruption occurred.[63]\\r\\nOngoing efforts are being made by the government at various levels (especially of Campania) to reduce the population living in the red zone, by demolishing illegally constructed buildings, establishing a national park around the whole volcano to prevent the future construction of buildings[63] and by offering sufficient financial incentives to people for moving away.[64] One of the underlying goals is to reduce the time needed to evacuate the area, over the next 20 or 30?years, to two or three days.[65]\\r\\nThe volcano is closely monitored by the Osservatorio Vesuvio in Naples with extensive networks of seismic and gravimetric stations, a combination of a GPS-based geodetic array and satellite-based synthetic aperture radar to measure ground movement and by local surveys and chemical analyses of gases emitted from fumaroles. All of this is intended to track magma rising underneath the volcano. No magma has been detected within 10?km of the surface, and so the volcano is classified by the Observatory as at a Basic or Green Level.[66]\\r\\nThe area around Vesuvius was officially declared a national park on June 5, 1995.[67] The summit of Vesuvius is open to visitors and there is a small network of paths around the volcano that are maintained by the park authorities on weekends. There is access by road to within 200 metres (660?ft) of the summit (measured vertically), but thereafter access is on foot only. There is a spiral walkway around the volcano from the road to the crater.\\r\\nThe first funicular cable car on Mount Vesuvius opened in 1880. It was later destroyed by the March 1944 eruption. \\"Funicul, Funicul\\", a famous Neapolitan language song with lyrics by journalist Peppino Turco set to music by composer Luigi Denza, commemorates its opening.","input":"What is the risk level of mt. vesuvius today?"},{"output":"Bernard John Taupin","context":"Bernard John Taupin (born 22 May 1950) is an English lyricist, poet, and singer, best known for his long-term collaboration with Elton John, writing the lyrics for the majority of the star's songs.\\r\\nIn 1967, Taupin answered an advertisement placed in the UK music paper New Musical Express by Liberty Records, a company that was seeking new songwriters.[1] Around the same time, Elton John responded to the same advertisement, and the duo were brought together, collaborating on many projects since.[1][2]\\r\\nIn 1971, journalist Penny Valentine wrote that \\"Bernie Taupin's lyrics were to become as important as Elton [John] himself, proved to have a mercurial brilliance.

Taupin's 11-year younger brother, Kit, was born there.[5][6]\\r\\nUnlike his older brother Tony who attended a grammar school (selective secondary school), Taupin was not a diligent student, although he showed an early flair for writing. At age 15, he left school and started work as a trainee in the print room of the local newspaper, The Lincolnshire Standard, with aspirations of becoming a journalist. Taupin soon left that job, and spent the rest of his teenage years hanging out with friends, hitchhiking the country roads to attend youth club dances in the surrounding villages, playing snooker in the Aston Arms Pub[8] in Market Rasen and drinking. Taupin had worked at several part-time, dead-end jobs when, at age 17, he answered the advertisement that eventually led to his collaboration with Elton John.[5][6]\\r\\nTaupin's mother had studied French literature and his maternal grandfather Poppy was a classics teacher and graduate of the University of Cambridge.[5] They taught him an appreciation for nature and for literature and narrative poetry, both of which influenced his early lyrics.[5][6]\\r\\nIn 1967, Taupin answered an advertisement for talent that was placed in the New Musical Express by Liberty records A&R man Ray Williams. Elton John answered the same advert. Neither Taupin nor John passed the audition for Liberty Records. Elton told the man behind the desk that he could not write lyrics, so the man handed Elton a sealed envelope from the pile of people submitting lyrics, which he opened on the London Underground ride home. The envelope contained poems by Taupin.[9] The duo have collaborated on more than thirty albums to date. The team took some time off from each other for a while between 1977 and 1979, while Taupin worked with other songwriters, including Alice Cooper, and John worked with other lyricists, including Gary Osborne and Tom Robinson. (The 1978 single-only A side \\"Ego\\" was their only collaboration of note during the period, although John/Taupin B-sides such as \\"Lovesick\\" and \\"I Cry at Night\\" were issued with the respective singles \\"Song for Guy\\" and \\"Part-time Love\\" from the album A Single Man.)\\r\\nJohn and Taupin resumed writing together on (at first) an occasional basis in 1980, with Taupin contributing lyrics to only three or four songs each on albums such as The Fox, 21 at 33 and Jump Up!. However, by 1983's Too Low for Zero, the two renewed their partnership on a full-time basis and from that point forward Taupin was again John's primary lyricist. (John often works with other lyricists on specific theatrical or film projects such as 1994's The Lion King and 2000's Aida, both of which featured lyrics by Tim Rice.)\\r\\nTaupin's lyrics include such songs as \\"Rocket Man\\", \\"Levon\\", \\"Crocodile Rock\\", \\"Honky Cat\\", \\"Tiny Dancer\\", \\"Candle in the Wind\\", \\"Saturday Night's Alright for Fighting\\", \\"Bennie and the Jets\\", \\"Goodbye Yellow Brick Road\\", \\"Mona Lisas and Mad Hatters\\", \\"Don't Let the Sun Go Down on Me\\", \\"The Bitch is Back\\", \\"Daniel\\", and 1970's \\"Your Song\\", their first hit. Hits in the 1980s include \\"I'm Still Standing\\", \\"I Guess That's Why They Call It The Blues\\", \\"Sad Songs\\", and \\"Nikita.\\" In the 1990s, Taupin and John had more hits, including \\"The One\\", \\"Simple Life\\", \\"The Last Song\\", \\"Club at the End of the Street\\" and \\"Believe.\\" In September 1997, Taupin rewrote the lyrics of \\"Candle in the Wind\\" for \\"Candle in the Wind 1997\\", a tribute to the late Diana, Princess of Wales.[10]\\r\\nBernie Taupin on writing the lyrics\\r\\nfor \\"Candle in the Wind 1997\\"[10]\\r\\nThe 1991 film documentary, Two Rooms, described the John/Taupin writing style, which involves Taupin writing the lyrics on his own and John then putting them to music, with no further interaction between the two. The process is still fundamentally the same, with John composing to Taupin's words, but the two interact on songs far more today, with Taupin joining John in the studio as the songs are written and occasionally during recording sessions.\\r\\nTaupin and John had their first Broadway musical open in March 2006 with Lestat: The Musical. Taupin wrote lyrics for 10 songs (and an 11th completed non-album track \\"Across the River Thames\\") for John's 2006 album The Captain & The Kid (sequel to Captain Fantastic and the Brown Dirt Cowboy) and appeared on the cover with him for the first time marking their 40th anniversary of working together. (\\"Across the River Thames\\" was issued as an Internet-only download as a bonus with certain editions of The Captain & the Kid.)\\r\\nOn 25 March 2007, Taupin made a surprise appearance at John's 60th birthday celebration at Madison Square Garden, briefly discussing their 40-year songwriting partnership. Of Taupin's importance to their careers, as recorded on the Elton 60 - Live at Madison Square Garden DVD, John told the audience that without Taupin there probably wouldn't be an Elton John as the public has come to know him. Taupin and John also composed several songs for The Union, a collaboration album between Elton and his longtime hero Leon Russell released in October 2010. They also collaborated on five original songs for the 2011 Miramax movie Gnomeo and Juliet, including the Golden Globe-nominated \\"Hello Hello\\".\\r\\nThe duo collaborated on their 31st studio album, \\"The Diving Board,\\" which was released in September 2013. Their next studio album, \\"Wonderful Crazy Night,\\" was released in February 2016.\\r\\nIn addition to writing for Elton John, Taupin has also written lyrics for use by other composers, with notable successes including \\"We Built This City\\", which was recorded by Starship, and \\"These Dreams,\\" recorded by Heart (both of which were collaborations with English composer/musician Martin Page). In 1978, he co-wrote the album From the Inside with Alice Cooper.\\r\\nTaupin has also produced American Gothic for singer-songwriter David Ackles. Released in 1972, it did not enjoy big sales, but the album was highly acclaimed by music critics in the US and UK. The influential British music critic Derek Jewell of the UK Sunday Times described the album as being \\"the Sgt. Pepper of folk.\\" Of Ackles' four albums, it was the only one recorded in England rather than in the United States. Taupin and Ackles had become acquainted when Ackles was selected to be the co-headlining act for Elton John's 1970 American debut at the Troubadour in Los Angeles. Taupin was mentioned specifically as being one of the reasons American Gothic was selected by the writers and editors for inclusion in the book, 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die. He also collaborated on the book Burning Cold with photographer Gary Bernstein.[11] In the late 1980s and early 1990s Taupin also collaborated with French American musician, Josquin Des Pres (Producer and Bassist) on at least 13 songs in his collection that have been performed and recorded by artists worldwide.[12]\\r\\nIn 2002, Willie Nelson and Kid Rock recorded \\"Last Stand in Open Country\\" for Nelson's album The Great Divide. The song was the title track of the first album from Taupin's band Farm Dogs (see below). Nelson's album included two other Taupin songs, \\"This Face\\" and \\"Mendocino County Line\\". The latter song, a duet between Nelson and Lee Ann Womack, was made into a video and released as the album's first single. The song won the 2003 Grammy for best vocal collaboration in country music. In 2004, he co-wrote Courtney Love's song \\"Uncool\\", from her 2004 debut solo album America's Sweetheart. In 2005, he co-wrote the title track to What I Really Want For Christmas with Brian Wilson for his first seasonal album. In 2006, he won a Golden Globe Award for his lyrics to the song \\"A Love That Will Never Grow Old\\" from the film Brokeback Mountain. The music of the song was composed by Argentine producer and songwriter Gustavo Santaolalla.\\r\\nIn 1971, Taupin recorded a spoken-word album entitled Taupin, in which he recites some of his early poems against a background of impromptu, sitar-heavy music created by some members of Elton's band, including Davey Johnstone and Caleb Quaye. Side One is entitled \\"Child\\" and contains poems about his early childhood in southern Lincolnshire. The first poem, \\"The Greatest Discovery,\\" which looks at his birth from the perspective of his older brother Tony, was also set to music by Elton John and included on Elton's eponymous second album, Elton John. There are poems about Taupin's first two childhood homes, Flatters and Rowston Manor, and others about his relationship with his brother and grandfather. Side Two includes a variety of poems of varying obscurity, from a marionette telling her own story to a rat catcher who falls victim to his prey.[13] Taupin stated in interviews that he wasn't pleased with the album.[14]\\r\\nIn 1980, Taupin recorded his first album as a singer, He Who Rides the Tiger. The album failed to make a dent in the charts. Taupin later suggested in interviews that he didn't have the creative control he would have liked over the album. In 1987, he recorded another album entitled Tribe. The songs were co-written with Martin Page. \\"Citizen Jane\\" and \\"Friend of the Flag\\" were released as singles. Videos of both singles featured Rene Russo, the sister of Toni, his wife at that time.\\r\\nIn 1996, Taupin formed a band called Farm Dogs,[15] whose two albums were conscious (and successful) throwbacks to the grittier, earthier sound of Tumbleweed Connection. While Taupin wrote the lyrics, the music was a collaborative effort among the band members. Their first album, 1996's Last Stand in Open Country, received critical praise but little airplay. The title track was later recorded by Willie Nelson and Kid Rock for Nelson's 2002 album The Great Divide. In 1998, Farm Dogs released its second and final album, Immigrant Sons. The album was unsuccessful despite a tour of small clubs across America.\\r\\nIn 1973, Taupin collected all his lyrics up through the Goodbye Yellow Brick Road album into a book entitled Bernie Taupin: The One Who Writes the Words for Elton John. In addition to the lyrics from the albums, this book contained the lyrics to all the single B-sides, various rarities, and Taupin's 1970 spoken-word album. The songs are illustrated by various artists, friends, and celebrity guests such as John Lennon and Joni Mitchell. The book is in black & white except for the cover.\\r\\nIn 1977, Taupin collaborated with rock photographer David Nutter on \\"It's A Little Bit Funny\\", adding text and helping chronicle Elton John's year-long, \\"Louder Than Concorde, But Not Quite As Pretty\\" world concert tour. The now-collectible book was published in hard and soft cover editions by Penguin Books. It collects the better part of one year's worth of personal adventures and memories of Elton and the band, aboard his private plane, on the beaches of Barbados, at backstage gatherings and in some quieter off-stage moments with friends (including some famous faces that Elton and Bernie met and palled around with in their travels).\\r\\nIn 1978, Taupin also appeared in an episode of The Hardy Boys/Nancy Drew Mysteries, \\"The Hardy Boys & Nancy Drew Meet Dracula,\\" singing backup to Shaun Cassidy. In 1988, Taupin published an autobiography of his childhood entitled A Cradle of Haloes: Sketches of a Childhood.[6] The book was released only in the UK. It tells the tale of a childhood fuelled by fantasy in rural Lincolnshire in the 1950s and 1960s, ending in 1969 as Taupin gets on the train to seek his fortune in London.\\r\\nIn 1991, Taupin self-published a book of poems called The Devil at High Noon. In 1994, Taupin's lyrics up through the Made in England album were collected into a hardcover book entitled Elton John & Bernie Taupin: The Complete Lyrics, published by Hyperion. However, it doesn't appear that Taupin was intimately involved in this project, as it contains multiple misspellings and outright misrenderings of the lyrics. It is also missing some of the rarities and B-sides found in the earlier collection. As with the 1973 collection, the songs are illustrated by various artists, this time in full colour throughout.[citation needed]\\r\\nIn 1992, Taupin was asked to produce a benefit for AIDS Project Los Angeles. The event featured no songs written by the writer, instead opening with an acoustic set of performances of material chosen by the performers followed by selections from the musical West Side Story, chosen for its \\"timeless message of tolerance that is relevant to every decade.\\"[16]\\r\\nIn addition to his music, much of his time is spent creating his visual art,[20] Taupin began displaying and selling his original artwork in 2010. Consisting of large, mixed media, contemporary works, the art has been shown in select galleries and art fairs across the United States.[21]\\r\\nTaupin has been married four times and divorced three: Maxine Feibelman (1971ÿ76);[22] Toni Lynn Russo (1979ÿ91), sister of actress Rene Russo; Stephanie Haymes (1993ÿ98), daughter of entertainers Dick Haymes and Fran Jeffries; and Heather Kidd (March 2004ÿpresent), with whom he has two daughters, Charley Indiana and Georgey Devon.\\r\\nTaupin moved to Southern California from England in the mid-1970s. Since the 1980s, he has been living on a ranch north of Los Angeles near Santa Ynez, California.[23]","input":"Who wrote all of elton john's songs?"},{"output":"February","context":"LeBron Raymone James (/l??br?n/; born December 30, 1984) is an American professional basketball player for the Cleveland Cavaliers of the National Basketball Association (NBA). James has won three NBA championships, four NBA Most Valuable Player Awards, three NBA Finals MVP Awards, two Olympic gold medals, an NBA scoring title, and the NBA Rookie of the Year Award. He has also been selected to 13 NBA All-Star teams, 13 All-NBA teams, and six All-Defensive teams, is the Cavaliers' all-time leading scorer, and is the NBA career playoff scoring leader.\\r\\nJames played high school basketball at St. VincentÿSt. Mary High School in his hometown of Akron, Ohio, where he was highly promoted in the national media as a future NBA superstar. After graduating, he was selected by his home team, the Cleveland Cavaliers, as the first overall pick of the 2003 NBA draft. James led Cleveland to the franchise's first Finals appearance in 2007, ultimately losing to the San Antonio Spurs. In 2010, he left the Cavaliers for the Miami Heat in a highly publicized ESPN special titled The Decision. James spent four seasons with the Heat, reaching the Finals all four years and winning back-to-back championships in 2012 and 2013. In 2013, he led Miami on a 27-game winning streak, the third longest in league history. Following his final season with the Heat, James opted out of his contract and returned to the Cavaliers. He led the Cavaliers to three consecutive Finals series between 2015 and 2017, winning his third championship in 2016 to end Cleveland's 52-year professional sports title drought.\\r\\nOff the court, James has accumulated considerable wealth and fame from numerous endorsement contracts. His public life has been the subject of much scrutiny, and he has been ranked as one of America's most influential and popular athletes. He has been featured in books, documentaries, and television commercials. He also hosted the ESPY Awards, Saturday Night Live, and appeared in the 2015 film Trainwreck.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nJames was born on December 30, 1984 in Akron, Ohio to a 16-year-old mother, Gloria Marie James, who raised James on her own.[1][2]:22 When James was growing up, life was often a struggle for the family, as they moved from apartment to apartment in the seedier neighborhoods of Akron while Gloria struggled to find steady work.[3] Realizing that he would be better off in a more stable family environment, Gloria allowed James to move in with the family of Frank Walker, a local youth football coach, who introduced James to basketball when he was nine years old.[2]:23\\r\\nAs a youth, James played Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) basketball for the Northeast Ohio Shooting Stars.[3] The team enjoyed success on a local and national level, led by James and his friends Sian Cotton, Dru Joyce III, and Willie McGee.[2]:24 The players were inseparable and dubbed themselves the \\"Fab Four\\", promising each other that they would attend high school together.[2]:27 In a move that stirred local controversy, they chose to attend St. VincentÿSt. Mary High School, a predominately white private Catholic school.[4][5]\\r\\nAs a freshman, James averaged 21 points and 6 rebounds per game for the St. Vincent-St. Mary varsity basketball team.[6] The Fighting Irish finished the year 27ÿ0, winning the Division III state title.[6] As a sophomore, James averaged 25.2 points and 7.2 rebounds with 5.8 assists and 3.8 steals per game.[7] For some home games during the season, St. Vincent-St. Mary played at the University of Akron's 5,492-seat Rhodes Arena to satisfy ticket demand from alumni, fans, and college and NBA scouts who wanted to see James play.[2]:51[8] The Fighting Irish finished the season 26ÿ1 and repeated as state champions.[6] For his outstanding play, James was named Ohio Mr. Basketball and selected to the USA Today All-USA First Team, becoming the first sophomore to do either.[9]\\r\\nPrior to the start of James' junior year, he appeared in SLAM Magazine and was lauded as possibly \\"the best high school basketball player in America right now\\" by writer Ryan Jones.[10] During the season, he appeared on the cover of Sports Illustrated, becoming the first high school basketball underclassman to do so.[2]:104 With averages of 29 points, 8.3 rebounds, 5.7 assists, and 3.3 steals per game,[6] he was again named Ohio Mr. Basketball and selected to the USA Today All-USA First Team,[6] and became the first junior to be named boys' basketball Gatorade National Player of the Year.[2]:117 St. Vincent-St. Mary finished the year with a 23ÿ4 record, ending their season with a loss in the Division II championship game.[2]:114 Following the loss, James seriously considered declaring for the 2002 NBA draft, unsuccessfully petitioning for an adjustment to the NBA's draft eligibility rules that required prospective players to have at least graduated from high school.[11] During this time, he used marijuana to help cope with the stress that resulted from the constant media attention he was receiving.[12][13][14]\\r\\nThroughout his senior year, James and the Fighting Irish traveled around the country to play a number of nationally ranked teams, including a game against Oak Hill Academy that was nationally televised on ESPN2.[2]:142 Time Warner Cable, looking to capitalize on James' popularity, offered St. Vincent-St. Mary's games to subscribers on a pay-per-view basis throughout the season.[2]:143 For the year, James averaged 31.6 points, 9.6 rebounds, 4.6 assists, and 3.4 steals per game,[9] was named Ohio Mr. Basketball and selected to the USA Today All-USA First Team for an unprecedented third consecutive year,[2]:178[6] and was named Gatorade National Player of the Year for the second consecutive year.[6] He participated in three year-end high school basketball all-star gamesthe EA Sports Roundball Classic, the Jordan Capital Classic, and the McDonald's All-American Gamelosing his National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) eligibility and making it official that he would enter the 2003 NBA draft.[15] Many basketball analysts, scouts, and writers have noted that James left high school as one of the best and most hyped prospects of all-time.[2]:142[16][17][18][19]\\r\\nAlso during his senior year, James was the centerpiece of several controversies. For his 18th birthday, he skirted state amateur bylaws by accepting a Hummer H2 from his mother, who had secured a loan for the vehicle by utilizing LeBron's future earning power as a professional athlete.[20] This prompted an investigation by the Ohio High School Athletic Association (OHSAA) because its guidelines stated that no amateur may accept any gift valued over $100 as a reward for athletic performance. James was cleared of any wrongdoing because he had accepted the gift from a family member and not from an agent or any outside source.[15] Later in the season, James accepted two throwback jerseys worth $845 from an urban clothing store in exchange for posing for pictures, officially violating OHSAA rules and resulting in him being stripped of his high school sports eligibility.[15] James appealed the ruling and his penalty was eventually dropped to a two-game suspension, allowing him to play the remainder of the year. The Irish were also forced to forfeit one of their wins, their only official loss that season.[21] In his first game back after the suspension, James scored a career-high 52 points.[22]\\r\\nJames played wide receiver for St. Vincent-St. Mary's football team in high school and was recruited by some Division I programs, including Notre Dame.[2]:51[23] As a sophomore, he was named first team all-state, and as a junior, he led the Fighting Irish to the state semifinals.[7] He decided to stop playing high school football before his senior year, after he broke his wrist during an AAU basketball game.[24] Many sports analysts, football critics, high school coaches, and former and current players have speculated on whether he could have played in the National Football League.[2]:91[25][26][27][28]\\r\\nJames was selected by his home team, the Cleveland Cavaliers, as the first overall pick of the 2003 NBA draft.[29] In his first regular season game, he scored 25 points against the Sacramento Kings, setting an NBA record for most points scored by a prep-to-pro player in his debut performance.[30] At the conclusion of the season, he was named the NBA Rookie of the Year, finishing with averages of 20.9 points, 5.5 rebounds, and 5.9 assists per game.[31] He became the first Cavalier to receive the honor and just the third player in NBA history to average at least 20 points, 5 rebounds, and 5 assists per game as a rookie.[32] The Cavaliers finished the season 35ÿ47, failing to make the playoffs despite an 18-game improvement over the previous year.[33]\\r\\nJames earned his first NBA All-Star Game selection in 2004ÿ05, contributing 13 points, 8 rebounds, and 6 assists in a winning effort for the Eastern Conference.[34] Around the league, teams took note of his rapid development, with Denver Nuggets coach George Karl telling Sports Illustrated, \\"It's weird talking about a 20-year-old kid being a great player, but he is a great player ... He's the exception to almost every rule.\\"[35] On March 20, James scored 56 points against the Toronto Raptors, setting Cleveland's new single-game points record.[36] With final averages of 27.2 points, 7.4 rebounds, 7.2 assists, and 2.2 steals per game, he was named to his first All-NBA Team.[7] Despite a 30ÿ20 record to start the year,[36] the Cavaliers again failed to make the playoffs, finishing the season at 42ÿ40.[37]\\r\\nAt the 2006 All-Star Game, James led the East to victory with 29 points and was named the NBA All-Star Game Most Valuable Player.[38] Behind final season averages of 31.4 points, 7 rebounds, and 6.6 assists per game,[39] he finished second in overall NBA Most Valuable Player Award voting to Steve Nash.[40] Under James' leadership, the Cavaliers qualified for the playoffs for the first time since 1998.[41] In his postseason debut, he recorded a triple-double in a winning effort versus the Washington Wizards.[42] In Game 3 of the series, he made the first game-winning shot of his career, making another in Game 5.[43] Cleveland would go on to defeat the Wizards before being ousted by the Detroit Pistons in the second round.[44][45]\\r\\nIn 2006ÿ07, James' averages declined to 27.3 points, 6.7 rebounds, 6 assists, and 1.6 steals per game.[7] Some analysts attributed the fall to a regression in his passing skills and shot selection, stemming from a lack of effort and focus.[48] The Cavaliers finished the season with 50 wins for the second consecutive year and entered the playoffs as the East's second seed.[49][50] In Game 5 of the Conference Finals, James notched 48 points with 9 rebounds and 7 assists, scoring 29 of Cleveland's last 30 points, including the game-winning layup with two seconds left, against the Pistons.[51] After the game, play-by-play announcer Marv Albert called the performance \\"one of the greatest moments in postseason history\\" and color commentator Steve Kerr described it as \\"Jordan-esque\\".[52] In 2012, ESPN ranked the performance the fourth greatest in modern NBA playoff history.[53] The Cavaliers went on to win Game 6 and claim their first-ever Eastern Conference championship,[54] earning them a matchup with the San Antonio Spurs in the NBA Finals.[55] During the championship round, James struggled, averaging 22 points, 7 rebounds, and 6.8 assists per game on just 35.6 percent shooting,[56] and Cleveland was eliminated in a sweep.[55]\\r\\nIn February of the 2007ÿ08 season, James was named All-Star Game MVP for the second time behind a 27-point, 8-rebound, and 9-assist performance.[57][58] On March 21, he moved past Brad Daugherty as the Cavaliers' all-time leading scorer in a game against the Raptors, doing so in over 100 less games than Daugherty.[59] His 30 points per game were also the highest in the league, representing his first scoring title.[60] Despite his individual accomplishments, Cleveland's record fell from the year before to 45ÿ37.[61] Seeded fourth in the East entering the playoffs, the Cavaliers defeated the Wizards in the first round for the third consecutive season before being eliminated in seven games by the eventual-champion Boston Celtics in the next round.[62] During the decisive seventh game in Boston, James scored 45 points and Paul Pierce scored 41 in a game the Associated Press described as a \\"shootout\\".[63]\\r\\nAt the conclusion of the 2008ÿ09 season, James finished second in NBA Defensive Player of the Year voting and made his first NBA All-Defensive Team, posting 23 chase-down blocks and a career-high 93 total blocks.[65][66] He also became only the fourth postmerger player to lead his team in points, rebounds, assists, steals, and blocks in a single season.[67] Behind his play and the acquisition of All-Star guard Mo Williams, Cleveland went a franchise record 66ÿ16 and fell one game short of matching the best home record in league history.[68] With averages of 28.4 points, 7.6 rebounds, 7.2 assists, 1.7 steals, and 1.2 blocks per game, James became the first Cavalier to win the MVP Award.[69]\\r\\nIn the playoffs, Cleveland swept the Pistons and the Atlanta Hawks to earn a matchup with the Orlando Magic in the Conference Finals.[70] In Game 1 of the series, James scored 49 points on 66 percent shooting in a losing effort for the Cavaliers.[53] In Game 2, he hit a game-winner to tie the series at 1ÿ1.[71] Cleveland would lose the series in six games, and following the loss in Game 6, James immediately left the floor without shaking hands with his opponents, an act many media members viewed as unsportsmanlike.[72][73] For the series, he averaged 38.5 points, 8.3 rebounds, and 8 assists per game,[74] finishing the postseason with a career playoff-high 35.3 points per game.[39]\\r\\nMidway through the 2009ÿ10 season, the Cavaliers' guards experienced significant injuries, forcing James into a temporary point guard role.[75] With increased minutes as the team's primary ball handler, he averaged 8.6 assists in addition to 29.7 points, 7.3 rebounds, 1.6 steals, and 1 block per game on 50 percent shooting, culminating in a second consecutive MVP Award.[76] Cleveland also finished the season with the league's best record for the second straight year.[77] In the playoffs, the Cavaliers defeated the Bulls in the first round but lost to the Celtics in the second round.[78] James was heavily criticized for not playing well in Game 5 of the series, shooting only 20 percent on 14 shots and scoring 15 points.[79] At the conclusion of the game, he walked off the court to a smattering of boos from Cleveland's home crowd, the team having just suffered their worst home playoff loss ever.[80] The Cavaliers were officially eliminated from the postseason in Game 6, with James recording 27 points, 19 rebounds, 10 assists, and nine turnovers in a losing effort.[78]\\r\\nJames became an unrestricted free agent at 12:01?am EDT on July 1, 2010.[82] During his free agency, he was contacted by several teams, including the Bulls, Los Angeles Clippers, Miami Heat, New York Knicks, New Jersey Nets, and Cavaliers.[83] On July 8, he announced that he would sign with the Heat on a live ESPN special titled The Decision.[84] The telecast, broadcast from the Boys & Girls Club of Greenwich, Connecticut, raised $2.5 million for the charity and an additional $3.5 million from advertisement revenue that was donated to other charities.[85][86] The day before the special, fellow free agents Chris Bosh and Dwyane Wade had also announced that they would sign with Miami;[87][88] reports later arose that the trio had discussed their 2010 free agencies together in 2006.[89] James decided to join with Bosh and Wade in part so that he could shoulder less of the load offensively, thinking that his improved teammates would give him a better chance of winning a championship than had he stayed in Cleveland.[90][91] Heat president Pat Riley played a major role in selling James on the idea of playing with Bosh and Wade.[92] Relieved of the burden of scoring, James thought he could be the first player to average a triple-double in a season since Oscar Robertson.[90]\\r\\nJames drew intense criticism from sports analysts, executives, fans, and current and former players for leaving the Cavaliers. The Decision itself was also scrutinized and viewed as unnecessary. Many thought the prolonged wait for James' choice was unprofessional as not even the teams courting him were aware of his decision until moments before the show.[93] Upon learning that James would not be returning to Cleveland, Cavaliers owner Dan Gilbert published an open letter to fans in which he aggressively denounced James' actions.[94] Some angry fans of the team recorded videos of themselves burning his jersey.[95] Former NBA players, including Michael Jordan and Magic Johnson, were also critical of James, condemning him for joining with Bosh and Wade in Miami and not trying to win a championship as \\"the guy\\".[96][97][98] James drew further criticism in a September interview with CNN when he claimed that race might have been a factor in the fallout from The Decision.[99][100] As a result of his actions during the 2010 free agency period, he quickly gained a reputation as one of America's most disliked athletes, a radical change from years prior.[101][102] The phrase \\"taking my talents to South Beach\\" became a punch line for critics.[103][104]\\r\\nImmediately following The Decision, James claimed that there was nothing he would change about the handling of his free agency despite all the criticism.[105] During the 2010ÿ11 season, he expressed some regret, admitting, \\"[I] probably would do it a little bit different ... But I'm happy with my decision.\\"[106] Before the 2011ÿ12 season, he relented, \\"... if the shoe was on the other foot and I was a fan, and I was very passionate about one player, and he decided to leave, I would be upset too about the way he handled it.\\"[102]\\r\\nJames officially became a member of the Heat on July 10, 2010.[107] With the move, he became only the third reigning MVP to change teams and the first since Moses Malone in 1982.[108] That evening, the Heat threw a welcome party for their new \\"big three\\" at the American Airlines Arena, an event that took on a rock concert atmosphere.[109] During the gathering, James predicted a dynasty for the Heat and alluded to multiple championships.[110][111] Outside of Miami, the spectacle was not well-received, furthering the negative public perception of James.[112][113]\\r\\nThroughout the 2010ÿ11 season, James embraced the villain role that was bestowed upon him by the media, playing with an angry demeanor and less joy than in years past; he later admitted that he regretted this approach.[114] On December 2, he faced the Cavaliers in Cleveland for the first time since departing as a free agent, scoring 38 points and leading Miami to a win while being booed every time he touched the ball.[115][116] He finished the season with averages of 26.7 points, 7.5 rebounds, and 7 assists per game on 51 percent shooting.[39] Entering the playoffs as the East's second seed, Miami advanced to the Finals before stumbling against the Dallas Mavericks, losing in six games despite holding a 2ÿ1 series lead going into Game 4.[117] James received the brunt of the criticism for the loss, averaging only three points in fourth quarters in the series.[118] His Finals scoring average of 17.8 points per game signified an 8.9-point drop from the regular season, the largest point drop-off in league history.[119]\\r\\nHumbled by the Heat's loss to the Mavericks, James spent the offseason working with Hakeem Olajuwon on his post game.[120] His work with Olajuwon paid off, fueling what Grantland's Kirk Goldsberry called \\"one of the greatest and most important transformations in recent sports history\\".[121] Behind James' more post-oriented play,[121] Miami matched their best start to a season in franchise history,[122] and at the conclusion of the lockout-shortened 2011ÿ12 season, he was named MVP for the third time, finishing with averages of 27.1 points, 7.9 rebounds, 6.2 assists, and 1.9 steals per game on 53 percent shooting.[123]\\r\\nIn Game 4 of the second round of the playoffs, James registered 40 points, 18 rebounds, and 9 assists to help even the series against the Indiana Pacers.[125] Miami eventually defeated the Pacers in six games.[126] Facing elimination in Game 6 of the Conference Finals against the Celtics, James scored 45 points to lead the Heat to victory in what The New York Times called a \\"career-defining performance\\".[127] Miami won Game 7 to advance to the Finals, earning them a matchup with the Oklahoma City Thunder.[126] Late in Game 4 of the series, James hit a three-pointer to give the Heat a lead, helping them win the game despite missing time with leg cramps.[128] In Game 5, he registered a triple-double as Miami defeated Oklahoma City for their second-ever championship and James' first championship.[129] James was unanimously voted the Bill Russell NBA Finals Most Valuable Player with averages of 28.6 points, 10.2 rebounds, and 7.4 assists per game.[130] His full postseason run, in which he averaged 30.3 points, 9.7 rebounds and 5.6 assists per game, was later ranked the second best in modern NBA history by ESPN.[131]\\r\\nIn February of the 2012ÿ13 season, James' performance was described by Sports Illustrated as a \\"month for the ages\\",[132] averaging 29.7 points and 7.8 assists per game while setting multiple shooting efficiency records.[133][134][135] During this period, the Heat began a 27-game winning streak, the third longest in NBA history.[136] Behind his play, Miami finished the year with a franchise and league best 66ÿ16 record,[137] and James was named MVP for the fourth time, falling just one vote shy of becoming the first player in NBA history to win the award unanimously.[138] His final season averages were 26.8 points, 8 rebounds, 7.3 assists, and 1.7 steals per game on 56.5 percent shooting.[39]\\r\\nIn Game 1 of the Conference Finals, James scored a buzzer-beating layup to give Miami a one-point victory against the Pacers.[139] Throughout the series, his supporting cast struggled significantly, and his added scoring load prompted him to compare his responsibilities to those of his \\"Cleveland days\\".[140] Despite these struggles, the Heat advanced to the Finals for a meeting with the Spurs,[141] signifying a rematch for James from his first Finals six years earlier.[142] At the beginning of the series, he was criticized for his lack of aggressiveness and poor shot selection as Miami fell behind 2ÿ3.[74][141][143] In Game 6, he recorded his second triple-double of the series, including 16 fourth quarter points, to lead the Heat to a comeback victory.[144] In Game 7, he tied the Finals record for most points scored in a Game 7 victory, leading Miami over San Antonio with 37 points.[145] He was named Finals MVP for the second straight season, averaging 25.3 points, 10.9 rebounds, 7 assists, and 2.3 steals per game for the championship round.[146]\\r\\nOn March 3 of the 2013ÿ14 season, James scored a career-high and franchise-record 61 points in a game against the Charlotte Bobcats.[147] Throughout the year, he was one of the few staples for a Heat roster that used 20 different starting lineups due to injuries,[148] finishing with averages of 27.1 points, 6.9 rebounds, and 6.4 assists per game on 56.7 percent shooting.[39] In the second round of the playoffs, he tied a career postseason-high by scoring 49 points in Game 4 against the Brooklyn Nets.[149] In the next round, Miami defeated the Pacers to earn their fourth consecutive Finals berth, becoming one of only four teams in NBA history to do so.[150] In Game 1 of the Finals, James missed most of the fourth quarter because of leg cramps, helping the Spurs take an early series lead.[151] In Game 2, he led the Heat to a series-tying victory with 35 points on a 64 percent shooting rate.[152] San Antonio eventually eliminated the Heat in five games, ending Miami's quest for a three-peat.[153] For the Finals, James averaged 28.2 points, 7.8 rebounds, and 2 steals per game.[154]\\r\\nOn June 25, 2014, James opted out of his contract with the Heat, officially becoming an unrestricted free agent on July 1.[157] On July 11, he revealed via a first-person essay in Sports Illustrated that he intended to return to the Cavaliers.[158] In contrast to The Decision, his announcement to return to Cleveland was well received.[159][160][161] On July 12, he officially signed with the team,[162] who had compiled a league-worst 97ÿ215 record in the four seasons following his departure.[163] A month after James' signing, the Cavaliers acquired Kevin Love from the Minnesota Timberwolves, forming a new star trio along with Kyrie Irving.[164]\\r\\nIn January of the 2014ÿ15 season, James missed two weeks due to left knee and lower back strains, the longest stretch of missed games in his career.[165] In total, he played a career-low 69 games and his final averages were 25.3 points, 6 rebounds, and 7.4 assists per game.[39] In the second round of the playoffs, he hit a baseline jumper at the buzzer to give Cleveland a 2ÿ2 series tie with the Bulls.[166] In the Conference Finals, the Cavaliers defeated the Hawks to advance to the Finals, making James the first player since the 1960s to play in five consecutive Finals.[167] For most of the Finals against the Golden State Warriors, Irving and Love were sidelined due to injury, giving James more offensive responsibilities.[167] Behind his leadership, the Cavaliers opened the series with a 2ÿ1 lead before being eliminated in six games.[168] Despite the loss, he received serious consideration for the Finals MVP Award,[169] averaging 35.8 points, 13.3 rebounds, and 8.8 assists per game for the championship round.[168]\\r\\nDuring the 2015ÿ16 season, James was criticized for his role in several off-court controversies, including the midseason firing of Cavaliers' head coach David Blatt.[170][171] Despite these distractions, Cleveland finished the year with 57 wins and the best record in the East.[172] James' final averages were 25.3 points, 7.4 rebounds, and 6.8 assists per game on 52 percent shooting.[39] In the playoffs, the Cavaliers advanced comfortably to the Finals, losing only two games en route to a rematch with the Warriors,[172] who were coming off a record-setting 73 win season.[173] To begin the series, Cleveland fell behind 3ÿ1, including two blowout losses.[174] James responded by registering back-to-back 41 point games in Games 5 and 6, leading the Cavaliers to two consecutive wins to stave off elimination.[175] In Game 7, he posted a triple-double and made a number of key plays, including a memorable chase-down block on Andre Iguodala in the final two minutes,[176][177][178] as Cleveland emerged victorious, winning the city's first professional sports title in 52 years and becoming the first team in NBA history to come back from a 3ÿ1 series deficit in the Finals.[179] James became just the third player to record a triple-double in an NBA Finals Game 7,[180] and behind series averages of 29.7 points, 11.3 rebounds, 8.9 assists, 2.3 blocks, and 2.6 steals per game,[174] he also became the first player in league history to lead both teams in all five statistical categories for a playoff round, culminating in a unanimous Finals MVP selection.[181]\\r\\nThe 2016ÿ17 season was marred by injuries and unexpected losses for the Cavaliers;[182] James later described it as one of the \\"strangest\\" years of his career.[183] Following a January defeat to the New Orleans Pelicans, he publicly criticized Cleveland's front office for constructing a team that he felt was too \\"top heavy\\", for which he received criticism.[184] The Cavaliers finished the season as the East's second seed, with James averaging 26.4 points and career highs in rebounds (8.6), assists (8.7), and turnovers (4.1) per game.[39] In Game 3 of the first round of the postseason, he registered 41 points, 13 rebounds, and 12 assists against the Pacers, leading Cleveland to a comeback victory after trailing by 25 points at halftime, representing the largest halftime deficit overcome in NBA playoff history.[185] In Game 5 of the Conference Finals against the Celtics, James scored 35 points and surpassed Michael Jordan as the league's all-time postseason scoring leader.[186] The Cavaliers won the game and the series, advancing to their third consecutive Finals against the Warriors.[187] Behind averages of 33.6 points, 12 rebounds, and 10 assists per game, James became the first player to average a triple-double in the Finals, but Cleveland was defeated in five games.[188]\\r\\nJames made his debut for the United States national team at the 2004 Olympics in Athens, Greece.[189] He spent the Games mostly on the bench,[190][191] averaging 14.6 minutes per game with 5.8 points and 2.6 rebounds per game in eight games.[189] Team USA finished the competition with a bronze medal, becoming the first U.S. basketball team to return home without a gold medal since adding professionals to their line-up.[189][192] James felt his limited playing time was a \\"lowlight\\" and believed he was not given \\"a fair opportunity to play\\".[193] His attitude during the Olympics was described as \\"disrespectful\\" and \\"distasteful\\" by columnists Adrian Wojnarowski and Peter Vecsey, respectively.[194][195]\\r\\nAt the 2006 FIBA World Championship in Japan, James took on a greater role for Team USA, averaging 13.9 points, 4.8 rebounds, and 4.1 assists per game as co-captain.[196][197] The team finished the tournament with an 8ÿ1 record, winning another bronze medal.[196] James' behavior was again questioned, this time by teammate Bruce Bowen, who confronted James during tryouts regarding his treatment of staff members.[194][198]\\r\\nBefore naming James to the 2008 Olympic team, Team USA managing director Jerry Colangelo and coach Mike Krzyzewski gave James an ultimatum to improve his attitude, and he heeded their advice.[194][199] At the FIBA Americas Championship 2007, he averaged 18.1 points, 3.6 rebounds, and 4.7 assists per game, including a 31-point performance against Argentina in the championship game, the most ever by an American in an Olympic qualifier.[200][201] Team USA went 10ÿ0, winning the gold medal and qualifying for the 2008 Olympics in Beijing, China.[189] James credited the team's attitude and experience for their improvement, saying: \\"I don't think we understood what it meant to put on a USA uniform and all the people that we were representing in 2004. We definitely know that now.\\"[191] At the Olympics, Team USA went unbeaten, winning their first gold medal since 2000.[202] In the final game, James turned in 14 points, 6 rebounds, and 3 assists against Spain.[202]\\r\\nJames did not play at the 2010 FIBA World Championship but rejoined Team USA for the 2012 Olympics in London, England.[203] He became the leader of the team with Kobe Bryant, who would soon be 34, stepping back.[204][205][206] James facilitated the offense from the post and perimeter, called the defensive sets, and provided scoring when needed.[207][208][209][210] During a game against Australia, he recorded the first triple-double in U.S. Olympic basketball history with 11 points, 14 rebounds and 12 assists.[a][210] Team USA went on to win their second straight gold medal, again defeating Spain in the final game.[212] James contributed 19 points in the win, becoming the all-time leading scorer in U.S. men's basketball history.[189][212] He also joined Michael Jordan as the only players to win an NBA MVP award, NBA championship, NBA Finals MVP, and Olympic gold medal in the same year.[213] Afterwards, Krzyzewski said James \\"is the best player, he is the best leader and he is as smart as anybody playing the game right now.\\"[214]\\r\\nStanding 6?feet 8?inches (2.03?m) and weighing 250 pounds (113.4?kg), James has started at small forward and power forward, but he can also play the other three positions.[215] With career averages of 27.1 points, 7.3 rebounds, 7.0 assists, and 1.6 steals per game,[39] he is considered one of the most athletic and versatile players in the NBA,[121][216][217] and has been compared to Hall of Famers Oscar Robertson, Magic Johnson, and Michael Jordan.[31][218] Since 2011, he has been ranked the best player in the NBA by ESPN and Sports Illustrated.[b][c]\\r\\nMany basketball analysts, coaches, fans, and current and former players consider James to be one of the greatest players of all-time, often ranking him as the best small forward and in the top five overall.[d] He has earned All-NBA honors every season since his sophomore year, All-Defensive honors every season from 2009 to 2014, and was named Rookie of the Year in his debut season.[39] With four MVP awards, he is part of a select group of players who have won the award four times, including Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Jordan, Wilt Chamberlain, and Bill Russell; James and Russell are the only two players who have won four MVP awards in a five-year span.[237] While James has never won the Defensive Player of the Year Award, he has finished second in the voting twice and lists it as one of his main goals.[66][238] James has appeared in the Finals eight times and won three championships. Some analysts have criticized him for not having a better Finals record, while others have defended him, arguing that his supporting casts were usually poor and, despite the fact that James had played well, his team was defeated by superior competition.[239][240][241]\\r\\nUpon entering the NBA, James made an immediate offensive impact, leading the Cavaliers in scoring as a 19-year-old rookie.[243][244] He holds numerous \\"youngest to\\" distinctions, including being the youngest player to score 28,000 career points.[e] During his first stint in Cleveland, he was primarily used as an on-ball point forward, and although his shooting tendencies were perimeter-oriented,[121] he established himself as one of the best slashers and finishers in basketball, leading the NBA in three-point plays in 2006.[249] His combination of speed, quickness, and size often created matchup problems for opposing teams as he was capable of blowing by larger defenders and overpowering smaller ones.[250] These qualities became more apparent in transition, where he developed a reputation for grabbing defensive rebounds and then beating the defense downcourt for highlight-quality baskets.[251] Around this time, James was frequently criticized for not having developed a reliable jump shot or post game.[252] Teams would try to exploit these weaknesses by giving him space in the half court and forcing him to settle for three-pointers and long two-pointers, a strategy famously utilized by Spurs coach Greg Popovich in the 2007 Finals, where James converted on only 36 percent of his field goals in four games.[253]\\r\\nIn Miami, Heat coach Erik Spoelstra changed James' role to a more unconventional one.[121] James began spending more time in the post and shooting fewer three-pointers, attempting a career-low 149 in 2012.[39][121] He improved his shot selection and accuracy on jump shots, finishing second in the league in catch-and-shoot field goal percentage in 2013.[254] He also learned how to work as an off-ball cutter in the Heat's \\"pass-happy\\" offense.[255] Behind these improvements, James' overall scoring efficiency rose to historically-great levels,[256] peaking in 2014 when he registered a 64.9 true shooting percentage.[39] During this period, ESPN's Tom Haberstroh called James' free throw shooting his biggest weakness, describing it as \\"average\\".[257] Upon returning to the Cavaliers, James began to experience subtle age-related declines in productivity,[258] posting his lowest scoring averages since his rookie season in 2015 and 2016.[39][259] His shooting also temporarily regressed, and he briefly ranked as the worst high-volume outside shooter from outside the paint in the NBA.[260] Despite these changes, he has remained an elite offensive player who is capable of beating defenses with body control, strength, and varying attacking speeds.[250]\\r\\nJames' playmaking ability is generally considered to be one of his premier skills, with some analysts ranking him among the greatest passers in NBA history.[261] He is the only frontcourt player in league history to register over 7,000 career assists.[262] Using his size, vision, and the attention he garners from opposing defenses to his advantage,[263] James is able to create easy points for his teammates with accurate assists, manufacturing a league leading 2.6 three-pointers per game by way of his passing alone in 2013.[264] He will often execute passes that would normally be considered unconventional, including passes after leaving his feet and passes through defensive traffic.[265] His uncanny tendency to find the open man played a significant role in the evolution of modern NBA defenses, forcing teams to incorporate some elements of zone into their schemes to better cover the weak side of the court and prevent James from passing to open shooters.[250]\\r\\nEarly in James' career, he was criticized by the media for his play in pressure situations; specifically, for passing instead of shooting in the waning seconds of close games.[266][267] In a 2011 interview, teammate Chris Bosh stated that he would rather have Dwyane Wade take a last-second shot than James.[268] Later in James' career, his clutch play was viewed more favorably; for example, a 2011 article by Henry Abbott revealed that James had a better shooting percentage with the game on the line than such notables as Ray Allen and Kobe Bryant.[269] In 2015, FiveThirtyEight wrote that he might be \\"the most clutch playoff shooter of his generation\\".[270]\\r\\nAt the beginning of James' career, he was considered a poor defensive player,[271] but he improved steadily through the years. Near the end of his first tenure in Cleveland, he became proficient at the chase-down block; coming in from behind the opposition in transition to block their shot.[65] In Miami, he developed into a more versatile defender, and the Heat relied on him to guard all five positions.[272] Paired with teammates Shane Battier and Dwyane Wade, Miami used James in an ultra-aggressive defensive scheme,[273] with James cheating off the ball to help out inside or get into rebounding position.[274] Beginning in 2014, some analysts noted a regression in his defensive impact, stemming from a lack of effort and expected age-related declines.[275][276] James himself admitted to taking plays off at times, referring to this approach as \\"chill mode\\".[277] Writing for ESPN in 2016, Nate Duncan observed that while James tended to take off more plays than in his younger days, he was able to raise his level in that year's Finals and temporarily recapture his Miami form.[278]\\r\\nJames proposed to Savannah Brinson, his high school sweetheart, on December 31, 2011 at a party celebrating New Year's Eve and his 27th birthday.[279] The two were married on September 14, 2013 in San Diego.[280] Together, they have three children: LeBron James Jr. (b. 2004),[281] Bryce Maximus James (b. 2007),[282] and Zhuri James (b. 2014).[283] During his tenure with the Heat, James resided in Coconut Grove, an affluent Miami neighborhood, where he bought a three-story mansion overlooking Biscayne Bay for $9?million.[284] In November 2015, James bought a 9,350 square-feet East Coastÿstyle mansion in Brentwood, Los Angeles for about $21?million.[285]\\r\\nJames is an active supporter of the Boys & Girls Club of America, Children's Defense Fund, and ONEXONE.[286] He also has his own charity foundation, the LeBron James Family Foundation, which is based in Akron.[287] Since 2005, the foundation has held an annual bike-a-thon in Akron to raise money for various causes.[288] In 2015, James announced a partnership with the University of Akron to provide scholarships for as many as 2,300 children beginning in 2021.[289] In 2016, he donated $2.5 million to the Smithsonian National Museum of African American History and Culture to support an exhibit about Muhammad Ali.[290] In 2017, he received the J. Walter Kennedy Citizenship Award from the NBA for his \\"outstanding service and dedication to the community\\".[291]\\r\\nJames is represented by agent Rich Paul of Klutch Sports.[292] His first agent was Aaron Goodwin, whom he left in 2005 for Leon Rose. Rose joined Creative Artists Agency (CAA) in 2007, and he worked with fellow CAA agent Henry Thomas, who represented Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh, to bring James to Miami in 2010. James left CAA for Paul in 2012.[293] James, Paul, Maverick Carter, and Randy Mimsall childhood friendsformed agent and sports-marketing company LRMR after James left Goodwin. LRMR handles James' marketing, including the marketing of The Decision, for which it was criticized.[294][295]\\r\\nThroughout his career, James has taken a unique approach to his playing contracts, usually opting to sign shorter term deals in order to maximize his earnings potential and flexibility;[296][107][297] for example, in 2006, he and the Cavaliers negotiated a three-year, $60?million contract extension instead of the four-year maximum as it allotted him the option of seeking a new contract worth more money as an unrestricted free agent following the 2010 season.[298] This move ultimately allowed James, Dwyane Wade, and Chris Bosh to sign with the Heat together.[299] During his second stint in Cleveland, he began opting out and re-signing on new contracts after each season in order to take advantage of higher salaries resulting from the NBA's rising salary cap.[162][300][301][302] In 2016, he signed with the Cavaliers on a three-year deal,[303] becoming the highest-paid player in the league for the first time in his career.[304]\\r\\nJames has numerous endorsement contracts; some of the companies he does business with are Audemars Piguet,[305] Coca-Cola,[306] Dunkin' Brands,[307] McDonald's,[308] Nike,[306] State Farm,[309] and Samsung.[306] Coming out of high school, he was the target of a three-way bidding war among Nike, Reebok, and Adidas,[310] eventually signing with Nike for approximately $90 million.[311] His signature shoes have performed well for Nike.[312] In 2011, Fenway Sports Group became the sole global marketer of his rights, and as part of the deal, he was granted a minority stake in the English Premier League football club Liverpool FC,[313] who he has claimed his support for.[314] As a result of James' endorsement money and NBA salary, he has been listed as one of the world's highest-paid athletes.[315] In 2013, he surpassed Kobe Bryant as the highest paid basketball player in the world, with earnings of $56.5 million.[316] In 2014, James realized a profit of more than $30 million as part of Apple's acquisition of Beats Electronics; he had originally struck a deal to get a small stake in the company at its inception in exchange for promoting its headphones.[317] In 2015, he was ranked the sixth highest earning sportsperson,[318] and third highest in 2016 (after Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi).[319] James has stated that we would like to own an NBA team in the future, albeit in a hands-off capacity.[320]\\r\\nJames, with comedian Jimmy Kimmel, co-hosted the 2007 ESPY Awards.[321] In other comedic pursuits, he hosted the 33rd-season premiere of Saturday Night Live.[322] He has also tried his hand at acting, appearing in a cameo role on the HBO series Entourage.[323] In 2015, he played himself in the Judd Apatow film Trainwreck,[324] receiving positive reviews for his performance.[325] That same year, James' digital video company, Uninterrupted, raised $15.8 million from Warner Bros.

It is hosted on Bleacher Report and is used by several other athletes including New England Patriots tight end Rob Gronkowski and Seattle Seahawks cornerback Richard Sherman.[326]\\r\\nAlong with business partner Maverick Carter, James owns production company SpringHill Entertainment,[327] whose first work was the Lions Gate documentary More Than a Game, released in 2009 and chronicling James' high school years.[328] Series produced by SpringHill include the Disney XD sports documentaries Becoming,[329] Starz sitcom Survivor's Remorse,[330] and animated web series The LeBrons.[331] In 2016, CNBC aired an unscripted series hosted by James called Cleveland Hustles, where four up-and-coming Northern Ohio entrepreneurs will be financed on the condition of revitalizing a neighborhood in Cleveland.[332] In the 2017 Toronto International Film Festival, a 60-minute Vince Carter documentary entitled The Carter Effect was executive produced by James and Maverick Carter along with rapper Drake and Future the Prince.[333][334]\\r\\nJames is considered by many, including his fellow players, to be the \\"face of the NBA\\".[335] His opinions have yielded significant influence on important league decisions; for example, in 2014 he asked commissioner Adam Silver to increase the duration of the All-Star break, and the request was granted the following season.[336] On February 13, 2015, James was elected the first Vice President of the National Basketball Players Association (NBPA).[337]\\r\\nThroughout his career, James has been ranked by Forbes as one of the world's most influential athletes,[338][339] and in 2017, he was listed as one of the 100 most influential people in the world by Time.[340] During his first stint with the Cavaliers, he was adored by local fans, with Sherwin-Williams displaying a giant Nike-produced banner of James on its world headquarters.[341] Despite their affection for James, Cleveland fans and critics were frequently annoyed when he attended Cleveland Indians games against the New York Yankees sporting a Yankees hat.[342] Following his actions during the 2010 free agency period and, more specifically, The Decision, he was listed as one of the world's most disliked athletes.[343] By 2013, his image had mostly recovered and he was reported by ESPN as the most popular player in the NBA for the second time in his career.[344] In 2014, he was named the most popular male athlete in America by the Harris Poll.[345] He has led the league in jersey sales six times.[346]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn March 2008, James became the first black manand third man overall after Richard Gere and George Clooneyto appear on the cover of Vogue, posing with Gisele Bndchen.[349] Some sports bloggers and columnists considered the cover offensive, describing the demeanor of James and his holding Bndchen as a reference to classic imagery of the movie monster King Kong, a dark savage capturing his light-skinned love interest.[347][348]\\r\\nJames has taken stances on controversial issues throughout his career, mentioning on several occasions a feeling of obligation to effect change using his status.[350] Those include the War in Darfur,[351][352][353][354] the Trayvon Martin case,[355] the now-former NBA owner Donald Sterling's racist comments in 2014,[350] the Michael Brown verdict,[356] and the death of Eric Garner.[357] Following a racist incident at his Los Angeles home in 2017, James stated, \\"being black in America is tough. We got a long way to go for us as a society and for us as African Americans until we feel equal in America.\\"[358] Later on that same year, in the aftermath of the 2017 Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, James questioned President Donald Trump's Make America Great Again slogan by stating \\"It's sad what's going on in Charlottesville. Is this the direction our country is heading? Make America Great Again huh? He said that\\" and \\"Our youth deserve better!!\\"[359]\\r\\nIn June 2008, James donated $20,000 to a committee to elect Democratic presidential nominee Barack Obama.[360] Later that year, James gathered almost 20,000 people at the Quicken Loans Arena for a viewing of Obama's 30-minute American Stories, American Solutions television advertisement.[361] It was shown on a large screen above the stage, where Jay-Z later held a free concert.[361] James later publicly endorsed Hillary Clinton in the 2016 Presidential election.[362]","input":"What year did lebron win his first title?"},{"output":"Hydrogen","context":"The abundance of the chemical elements is a measure of the occurrence of the chemical elements relative to all other elements in a given environment. Abundance is measured in one of three ways: by the mass-fraction (the same as weight fraction); by the mole-fraction (fraction of atoms by numerical count, or sometimes fraction of molecules in gases); or by the volume-fraction. Volume-fraction is a common abundance measure in mixed gases such as planetary atmospheres, and is similar in value to molecular mole-fraction for gas mixtures at relatively low densities and pressures, and ideal gas mixtures. Most abundance values in this article are given as mass-fractions.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor example, the abundance of oxygen in pure water can be measured in two ways: the mass fraction is about 89%, because that is the fraction of water's mass which is oxygen. However, the mole-fraction is 33.3333...%  because only 1 atom of 3 in water, H2O, is oxygen. As another example, looking at the mass-fraction abundance of hydrogen and helium in both the Universe as a whole and in the atmospheres of gas-giant planets such as Jupiter, it is 74% for hydrogen and 23ÿ25% for helium; while the (atomic) mole-fraction for hydrogen is 92%, and for helium is 8%, in these environments. Changing the given environment to  Jupiter's outer atmosphere, where hydrogen is diatomic while helium is not, changes the molecular mole-fraction (fraction of total gas molecules), as well as the fraction of atmosphere by volume, of hydrogen to about 86%, and of helium to 13%.[Note 1]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe abundance of chemical elements in the universe is dominated by the large amounts of  hydrogen and helium which were produced in the Big Bang. Remaining elements, making up only about 2% of the universe, were largely produced by supernovae and certain red giant stars. Lithium, beryllium and boron are rare because although they are produced by nuclear fusion, they are then destroyed by other reactions in the stars.[1][2] The elements from carbon to iron are relatively more common in the universe because of the ease of making them in supernova nucleosynthesis. Elements of higher atomic number than iron (element 26) become progressively more rare in the universe, because they increasingly absorb stellar energy in being produced. Elements with even atomic numbers are generally more common than their neighbors in the periodic table, also due to favorable energetics of formation.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe abundance of elements in the Sun and outer planets is similar to that in the universe. Due to solar heating, the elements of Earth and the inner rocky planets of the Solar System have undergone an additional depletion of volatile hydrogen, helium, neon, nitrogen, and carbon (which volatilizes as methane). The crust, mantle, and core of the Earth show evidence of chemical segregation plus some sequestration by density. Lighter silicates of aluminum are found in the crust, with more magnesium silicate in the mantle, while metallic iron and nickel compose the core. The abundance of elements in specialized environments, such as atmospheres, or oceans, or the human body, are primarily a product of chemical interactions with the medium in which they reside.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe elements ÿ that is, ordinary (baryonic) matter made of protons, neutrons, and electrons, are only a small part of the content of the Universe. Cosmological observations suggest that only 4.6% of the universe's energy (including the mass contributed by energy, E = mc2 ? m = E / c2) comprises the visible baryonic matter that constitutes stars, planets, and living beings. The rest is thought to be made up of dark energy (68%) and dark matter (27%).[4] These are forms of matter and energy believed to exist on the basis of scientific theory and observational deductions, but they have not been directly observed and their nature is not well understood.\\r\\n\\r\\nMost standard (baryonic) matter is found in intergalactic gas, stars, and interstellar clouds, in the form of atoms or ions (plasma), although it can be found in degenerate forms in extreme astrophysical settings, such as the high densities inside white dwarfs and neutron stars.\\r\\n\\r\\nHydrogen is the most abundant element in the Universe; helium is second.  However, after this, the rank of abundance does not continue to correspond to the atomic number; oxygen has abundance rank 3, but atomic number 8. All others are substantially less common.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe abundance of the lightest elements is well predicted by the standard cosmological model, since they were mostly produced shortly (i.e., within a few hundred seconds) after the Big Bang, in a process known as Big Bang nucleosynthesis. Heavier elements were mostly produced much later, inside of stars.\\r\\n\\r\\nHydrogen and helium are estimated to make up roughly 74% and 24% of all baryonic matter in the universe respectively. Despite comprising only a very small fraction of the universe, the remaining \\"heavy elements\\" can greatly influence astronomical phenomena. Only about 2% (by mass) of the Milky Way galaxy's disk is composed of heavy elements.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese other elements are generated by stellar processes.[5][6][7] In astronomy, a \\"metal\\" is any element other than hydrogen or helium. This distinction is significant because hydrogen and helium are the only elements that were produced in significant quantities in the Big Bang.  Thus, the metallicity of a galaxy or other object is an indication of stellar activity, after the Big Bang.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn general, elements up to iron are made in large stars in the process of becoming supernovae. Iron-56 is particularly common, since it is the most stable element that can easily be made from alpha particles (being a product of decay of radioactive nickel-56, ultimately made from 14 helium nuclei). Elements heavier than iron are made in energy-absorbing processes in large stars, and their abundance in the universe (and on Earth) generally decreases with increasing atomic number.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe following graph (note log scale) shows abundance of elements in the Solar System. The table shows the twelve most common elements in our galaxy (estimated spectroscopically), as measured in parts per million, by mass.[3]\\r\\nNearby galaxies that have evolved along similar lines have a corresponding enrichment of elements heavier than hydrogen and helium. The more distant galaxies are being viewed as they appeared in the past, so their abundances of elements appear closer to the primordial mixture. Since physical laws and processes are uniform throughout the universe, however, it is expected that these galaxies will likewise have evolved similar abundances of elements.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe abundance of elements is in keeping with their origin from the Big Bang and nucleosynthesis in a number of progenitor supernova stars. Very abundant hydrogen and helium are products of the Big Bang, while the next three elements are rare since they had little time to form in the Big Bang and are not made in stars (they are, however, produced in small quantities by breakup of heavier elements in interstellar dust, as a result of impact by cosmic rays).\\r\\n\\r\\nBeginning with carbon, elements have been produced in stars by buildup from alpha particles (helium nuclei), resulting in an alternatingly larger abundance of elements with even atomic numbers (these are also more stable). The effect of odd-numbered chemical elements generally being more rare in the universe was empirically noticed in 1914, and is known as the Oddo-Harkins rule.\\r\\n\\r\\nLoose correlations have been observed between estimated elemental abundances in the universe and the nuclear binding energy curve.  Roughly speaking, the relative stability of various atomic nuclides has exerted a strong influence on the relative abundance of elements formed in the Big Bang, and during the development of the universe thereafter.\\r\\n[9]\\r\\nSee the article about nucleosynthesis for the explanation on how certain nuclear fusion processes in stars (such as carbon burning, etc.) create the elements heavier than hydrogen and helium.\\r\\n\\r\\nA further observed peculiarity is the jagged alternation between relative abundance and scarcity of adjacent atomic numbers in the elemental abundance curve, and a similar pattern of energy levels in the nuclear binding energy curve. This alternation is caused by the higher relative binding energy (corresponding to relative stability) of even atomic numbers compared with odd atomic numbers and is explained by the Pauli Exclusion Principle.[10]\\r\\nThe semi-empirical mass formula (SEMF), also called Weizs?cker's formula or the Bethe-Weizs?cker mass formula, gives a theoretical explanation of the overall shape of the curve of nuclear binding energy.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Earth formed from the same cloud of matter that formed the Sun, but the planets acquired different compositions during the formation and evolution of the solar system. In turn, the natural history of the Earth caused parts of this planet to have differing concentrations of the elements.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe mass of the Earth is approximately 5.98G1024?kg. In bulk, by mass, it is composed mostly of iron (32.1%), oxygen (30.1%), silicon (15.1%), magnesium (13.9%), sulfur (2.9%), nickel (1.8%), calcium (1.5%), and aluminium (1.4%); with the remaining 1.2% consisting of trace amounts of other elements.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe bulk composition of the Earth by elemental-mass is roughly similar to the gross composition of the solar system, with the major differences being that Earth is missing a great deal of the volatile elements hydrogen, helium, neon, and nitrogen, as well as carbon which has been lost as volatile hydrocarbons. The remaining elemental composition is roughly typical of the \\"rocky\\" inner planets, which formed in the thermal zone where solar heat drove volatile compounds into space. The Earth retains oxygen as the second-largest component of its mass (and largest atomic-fraction), mainly from this element being retained in silicate minerals which have a very high melting point and low vapor pressure.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe mass-abundance of the nine most abundant elements in the Earth's crust is approximately: oxygen 46%, silicon 28%, aluminum 8.2%, iron 5.6%, calcium 4.2%, sodium 2.5%, magnesium 2.4%, potassium 2.0%, and titanium 0.61%. Other elements occur at less than 0.15%. For a complete list, see abundance of elements in Earth's crust.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe graph at right illustrates the relative atomic-abundance of the chemical elements in Earth's upper continental crust the part that is relatively accessible for measurements and estimation.\\r\\n\\r\\nMany of the elements shown in the graph are classified into (partially overlapping) categories:\\r\\n\\r\\nNote that there are two breaks where the unstable (radioactive) elements technetium (atomic number: 43) and promethium (atomic number: 61) would be. These elements are surrounded by stable elements, yet both have relatively short half lives (~ 4 million years and ~ 18 years respectively). These are thus extremely rare, since any primordial initial fractions of these in pre-Solar System materials have long since decayed and disappeared. These two elements are now only produced naturally through the spontaneous fission of very heavy radioactive elements (for example, uranium, thorium, or the trace amounts of plutonium that exist in uranium ores), or by the interaction of certain other elements with cosmic rays. Both technetium and promethium have been identified spectroscopically in the atmospheres of stars, where they are produced by ongoing nucleosynthetic processes.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are also breaks in the abundance graph where the six noble gases would be, since they are not chemically bound in the Earth's crust, and they are only generated by decay chains from radioactive elements in the crust, and are therefore extremely rare there.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe eight naturally occurring very rare, highly radioactive elements (polonium, astatine, francium, radium, actinium, protactinium, neptunium, and plutonium) are not included, since any of these elements that were present at the formation of the Earth have decayed away eons ago, and their quantity today is negligible and is only produced from the radioactive decay of uranium and thorium.\\r\\n\\r\\nOxygen and silicon are notably the most common elements in the crust. On Earth and in rocky planets in general, silicon and oxygen are far more common than their cosmic abundance. The reason is that they combine with each other to form silicate minerals. In this way, they are the lightest of all of the two-percent \\"astronomical metals\\" (i.e., non-hydrogen and helium elements) to form a solid that is refractory to the Sun's heat, and thus cannot boil away into space. All elements lighter than oxygen have been removed from the crust in this way.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\"Rare\\" earth elements is a historical misnomer. The persistence of the term reflects unfamiliarity rather than true rarity. The more abundant rare earth elements are similarly concentrated in the crust compared to commonplace industrial metals such as chromium, nickel, copper, zinc, molybdenum, tin, tungsten, or lead. The two least abundant rare earth elements (thulium and lutetium) are nearly 200 times more common than gold. However, in contrast to the ordinary base and precious metals, rare earth elements have very little tendency to become concentrated in exploitable ore deposits. Consequently, most of the world's supply of rare earth elements comes from only a handful of sources. Furthermore, the rare earth metals are all quite chemically similar to each other, and they are thus quite difficult to separate into quantities of the pure elements.\\r\\n\\r\\nDifferences in abundances of individual rare earth elements in the upper continental crust of the Earth represent the superposition of two effects, one nuclear and one geochemical. First, the rare earth elements with even atomic numbers (58Ce, 60Nd, ...) have greater cosmic and terrestrial abundances than the adjacent rare earth elements with odd atomic numbers (57La, 59Pr, ...). Second, the lighter rare earth elements are more incompatible (because they have larger ionic radii) and therefore more strongly concentrated in the continental crust than the heavier rare earth elements. In most rare earth ore deposits, the first four rare earth elements ÿ lanthanum, cerium, praseodymium, and neodymium ÿ constitute 80% to 99% of the total amount of rare earth metal that can be found in the ore.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe mass-abundance of the eight most abundant elements in the Earth's mantle (see main article above) is approximately: oxygen 45%, magnesium 23%, silicon 22%, iron 5.8%, calcium 2.3%, aluminum 2.2%, sodium 0.3%, potassium 0.3%.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe mantle differs in elemental composition from the crust in having a great deal more magnesium and significantly more iron, while having much less aluminum and sodium.\\r\\n\\r\\nDue to mass segregation, the core of the Earth is believed to be primarily composed of iron (88.8%), with smaller amounts of nickel (5.8%), sulfur (4.5%), and less than 1% trace elements.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe most abundant elements in the ocean by proportion of mass in percent are oxygen (85.84), hydrogen (10.82), chlorine (1.94), sodium (1.08), magnesium (0.1292), sulfur (0.091), calcium (0.04), potassium (0.04), bromine (0.0067), carbon (0.0028), and boron  (0.00043).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe order of elements by volume-fraction (which is approximately molecular mole-fraction) in the atmosphere is nitrogen (78.1%), oxygen (20.9%),[14] argon (0.96%), followed by (in uncertain order) carbon and hydrogen because water vapor and carbon dioxide, which represent most of these two elements in the air, are variable components.   Sulfur, phosphorus, and all other elements are present in significantly lower proportions.\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to the abundance curve graph (above right), argon, a significant if not major component of the atmosphere, does not appear in the crust at all. This is because the atmosphere has a far smaller mass than the crust, so argon remaining in the crust contributes little to mass-fraction there, while at the same time buildup of argon in the atmosphere has become large enough to be significant. \\r\\n\\r\\nFor a complete list of the abundance of elements in urban soils, see Abundances of the elements (data page)#Urban soils.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy mass, human cells consist of 65ÿ90% water (H2O), and a significant portion of the remainder is composed of carbon-containing organic molecules. Oxygen therefore contributes a majority of a human body's mass, followed by carbon. Almost 99% of the mass of the human body is made up of six elements: oxygen, carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, calcium, and phosphorus. The next 0.75% is made up of the next five elements: potassium, sulfur, chlorine, sodium, and magnesium. Only 17 elements are known for certain to be necessary to human life, with one additional element (fluorine) thought to be helpful for tooth enamel strength. A few more trace elements may play some role in the health of mammals. Boron and silicon are notably necessary for plants but have uncertain roles in animals. The elements aluminium and silicon, although very common in the earth's crust, are conspicuously rare in the human body.[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nBelow is a periodic table highlighting nutritional elements.[16]","input":"What are the 2 most common elements in the universe?"},{"output":"1767 and 1774","context":"The Royal Crescent is a row of 30 terraced houses laid out in a sweeping crescent in the city of Bath, England. Designed by the architect John Wood, the Younger and built between 1767 and 1774, it is among the greatest examples of Georgian architecture to be found in the United Kingdom and is a Grade I listed building. Although some changes have been made to the various interiors over the years, the Georgian stone fa?ade remains much as it was when it was first built.\\r\\nThe 500-foot-long (150?m) crescent has 114 Ionic columns on the first floor with an entablature in a Palladian style above. It was the first crescent of terraced houses to be built and an example of \\"rus in urbe\\" (the country in the city) with its views over the parkland opposite.\\r\\nMany notable people have either lived or stayed in the Royal Crescent since it was first built over 240 years ago, and some are commemorated on special plaques attached to the relevant buildings. Of the Royal Crescent's 30 townhouses, 10 are still full-size townhouses; 18 have been split into flats of various sizes; 1 is the No. 1 Royal Crescent museum and the large central house at number 16 is the Royal Crescent Hotel.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe street that is known today as \\"The Royal Crescent\\" was originally named \\"The Crescent.\\" It is claimed that the adjective \\"Royal\\" was added at the end of the 18th century after Prince Frederick, Duke of York and Albany had stayed there.[4][5] He initially rented number one and later bought number 16.[6] The Royal Crescent is close to Victoria Park and linked via Brock Street to The Circus which had been designed by John Wood, the Elder.[7]\\r\\nThe land on which the Royal Crescent stands was bought from Sir Benet Garrard of the Garrard baronets, who were the landlords, in December 1766.[8] Between 1767 and 1775 John Wood designed the great curved fa?ade with Ionic columns on a rusticated ground floor.[9] Each original purchaser bought a length of the fa?ade, and then employed their own architect to build a house behind the fa?ade to their own specifications; hence what can appear to be two houses is occasionally just one. This system of town planning is betrayed at the rear and can be seen from the road behind the Crescent: while the front is uniform and symmetrical, the rear is a mixture of differing roof heights, juxtapositions and fenestration. This architecture, described as \\"Queen Anne fronts and Mary-Anne backs\\", occurs repeatedly in Bath.[10] It was the first crescent of terraced houses to be built and an example of \\"rus in urbe\\" (the country in the city) with its views over the parkland opposite.[1][11][12]\\r\\nIn front of the Royal Crescent is a ha-ha, a ditch on which the inner side is vertical and faced with stone, with the outer face sloped and turfed, making an effective but invisible partition between the lower and upper lawns. The ha-ha is designed so as not to interrupt the view from Royal Victoria Park, and to be invisible until seen from close by. It is not known whether it was contemporary with the building of the Royal Crescent, however it is known that when it was first created it was deeper than it is at present.[13] The railings between the crescent and the lawn were included in the Heritage at Risk Register produced by English Heritage but have been restored and removed from the register.[14]\\r\\nIn 2003, the archaeological television programme Time Team dug the Royal Crescent in search of a Roman cemetery and the Fosse Way. The remains of a Roman wall were found behind the crescent and evidence of possible Iron and Bronze Age settlement on the lawn in front.[15]\\r\\nIn the late 19th century five cast iron lamp columns with decorative scrollwork were added.[2] In 1921, architect Robert Tor Russell used the Crescent as a source of inspiration to design the central business district of Connaught Place, New Delhi, India.[16][17]\\r\\nDuring the Bath Blitz of World War II, known as the Baedecker Raids or Baedeker Blitz, some bomb damage occurred, the most serious being the gutting of numbers 2 and 17 by incendiaries.[18] After World War II, during a period of redevelopment which is described as the Sack of Bath, the City Council considered plans that would have seen the Crescent transformed into Council offices. These were unsuccessful.[19]\\r\\nDuring the 20th century many of the houses which had formerly been the residences of single families with maids or other staff were divided into flats and offices. However, the tradition of distinguished gentlefolk retiring to the crescent continued. The whole crescent was designated as a Grade I listed building in 1950.[20] Number 16 became a guest house in 1950. In 1971 it was combined with number 15 to become the Royal Crescent Hotel occupying the central properties of the Crescent, which were renovated and additional rooms in pavilions and coach houses within the gardens included in the accommodation.[21][22] It was sold in 1978 to John Tham, the chairman of the London Sloane Club, and restored.[23] It was later purchased by Von Essen Hotels, which became insolvent in 2011. In September 2011 it was expected that London & Regional Properties would purchase the hotel,[24] but negotiations ended in January 2012 without a deal.[25] On 2 April 2012, investment company the Topland Group announced that it had purchased the Royal Crescent Hotel.[26]\\r\\nIn the 1970s the resident of No 22, Miss Amabel Wellesley-Colley, painted her front door yellow instead of the traditional white. Bath City Council issued a notice insisting it should be repainted. A court case ensued which resulted in the Secretary of State for the Environment declaring that the door could remain yellow. Other proposals for alteration and development including floodlighting and a swimming pool have been defeated.[27]\\r\\nThe first resident of Number 1 was Thomas Brock who acted as trustee for John Wood his son-in-law,[28] although he was rarely lived there as he was the town clerk of Chester.[29] His tenant was Henry Sandford, a retired Irish MP who rented the house from 1776 until his death in Bath in 1796. He was described as a 'gentleman of the most benevolent disposition'. William Wilberforce stayed at Number 2 in 1798.[1] Christopher Anstey, a well-known writer of the time, was resident in number 4 from 1770 until 1805, although the plaque to him is placed on number 5.[30] Jean Baptiste, Vicomte du Barre took over number 8 in 1778 and hosted parties and gambling. He died in a duel on Claverton Down and is buried in the churchyard at the Church of St Nicholas in Bathampton.[31] From 1768 to 1774 number 9 was home to Philip Thicknesse, a soldier of fortune.[32] Number 11 was home to the family of Thomas Linley, a singing-master and conductor of the concerts from 1771. His second daughter Elizabeth Ann Linley, a singer in her own right, eloped with the playwright and poet Richard Brinsley Sheridan.[33] The centre house of the crescent (#16) was used as a residence and to host blue stocking events by Elizabeth Montagu.[34]\\r\\nIn the nineteenth century the popularity of the Crescent and 'taking the waters' at the Roman Baths diminished somewhat. Amongst the residents of Royal Crescent during this time were the electoral reformer Francis Burdett who lived at number 16 from 1814 to 1822 and his daughter Angela Burdett-Coutts, 1st Baroness Burdett-Coutts.[35] The retired Admiral William Hargood lived at number 9 from 1834 until 1839 and in 1866 the same house was home to Edward Bulwer-Lytton.[36] The jurist and explorer Thomas Falconer briefly lived at number 18 before his death in 1882. A few years later the house next door at number 17 became home to Isaac Pitman who developed the most widely used system of shorthand, now known as Pitman shorthand.[6][37] English professor George Saintsbury took up residence at number 1A in 1916.[38]\\r\\nThe houses and flats in the Crescent are a mixture of tenures. After World War II when there was a shortage of housing and the city council bought up older properties, including some in Royal Crescent, as public housing to rent out.[39] The Housing Act 1985 changed the succession of Council Houses and facilitated the transfer of council housing to not-for-profit housing associations.[40] Several were subsequently sold into private ownership,[41] however one remains in council ownership.[42]\\r\\nNo. 1 Royal Crescent is a historic house museum, owned and maintained by the Bath Preservation Trust through its membership to illustrate how wealthy owners of the late 18th century might have furnished and occupied such a house.[43] It was purchased in 1967 by Major Bernard Cayzer, a member of the family that made its fortune through the Clan shipping line. He donated it to the Trust with an amount of money for its restoration and furnishing.[44] The restoration was led by Philip Jebb.[45] The Bath Preservation Trust was working during 2012ÿ13 to re-unite Number One with its original servants' wing at Number 1A Royal Crescent, which has been in use as a separate dwelling for many years. No. 1 serves as the Trust's headquarters.[46] Number 15 and 16 are still used as a hotel.[47]\\r\\nBath and North East Somerset council made an order banning coaches and buses from the crescent, after many years of complaints by residents that the tours given to tourists were disruptive, particularly because of the amplified commentary given by tour guides on open top buses.[48][49][50]\\r\\nThe crescent is 500 feet (150?m) long and each building is almost 50 feet (15?m) high, including small rooms with dormer windows in the attic.[1][51] The ground floor is plain emphasising the columns and windows of the first floor. The 114 columns are 30 inches (76?cm) in diameter reaching 47 feet (14.3?m), each with an entablature 5 feet (1.5?m) deep in a Palladian style.[52][20] The central house (now the Royal Crescent Hotel) boasts two sets of coupled columns with a single window between them which is the middle of the crescent.[20][53][1]\\r\\nThey are built of Bath stone. They have slate roofs but were originally stone tiled.[1] The appearance of each house is very similar with only minor variations between them for example some have small balconettes on the first floor. Many of the windows have been restored to their original style with glazing bars rather than the horned plate glass sash windows which had been installed in the 19th or early 20th centuries.[1] Some of the window sills had also been lowered. This has been reversed at Number 1 but policy has since changed with a decision to keep the alterations which were made in the 19th century.[54] In front of the houses are cast iron railings which are mirrored by those on the opposite side of the road at the top of Victoria Park.

The 1965 film Catch Us If You Can also had a sequence filmed outside the crescent and in one of its houses.[55]\\r\\nIn 2007, a TV edition of Jane Austen's Persuasion, included many scenes shot at the Royal Crescent, where the Elliot family was supposedly living while in Bath.[56] The Royal Crescent featured in the 2008 film The Duchess starring Keira Knightley.[57]\\r\\nThe fictional heroine of BBC1 archaeology thriller Bonekickers was depicted as living in the Crescent.[58]","input":"When was the royal crescent in bath built?"},{"output":"January 1788","context":"","input":"When did the british first arrive in australia?"},{"output":"three","context":"The government of Florida is established and operated according to the Constitution of Florida and is composed of three branches of government: the executive branch consisting of the Governor of Florida and the other elected and appointed constitutional officers; the legislative branch, the Florida Legislature, consisting of the Senate and House; and the judicial branch consisting of the Supreme Court of Florida and lower courts. The state also allows direct participation of the electorate by initiative, referendum, and ratification.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe executive branch of the government of Florida consists of the Governor, Lieutenant Governor, Florida Cabinet (which includes the Attorney General, Commissioner of Agriculture and Chief Financial Officer), and several executive departments.[1] Each office term is limited for two four-year terms.[2]\\r\\nThe Governor of Florida is the chief executive of the government of Florida and the chief administrative officer of the state responsible for the planning and budgeting for the state, and serves as chair when the Governor and the Florida Cabinet sit as a decision-making body in various constitutional roles.[3] The Governor has the power to execute Florida's laws and to call out the state militia to preserve the public peace, being Commander-in-Chief of the state's military forces that are not in active service of the United States. At least once every legislative session, the Governor is required to deliver the \\"State of the State Address\\" to the Florida Legislature regarding the condition and operation of the state government and to suggest new legislation.\\r\\nFlorida is unique among U.S. states in having a strong cabinet-style government. Members of the Florida Cabinet are independently elected, and have equal footing with the Governor on issues under the Cabinet's jurisdiction. The Cabinet consists of the Attorney General, the Commissioner of Agriculture and the Chief Financial Officer. Along with the Governor, each member carries one vote in the decision making process. In the event of a tie, the side of the Governor is the prevailing side. Cabinet elections are held every four years, on even numbered years not divisible by four (such as 2010, 2014, etc.).\\r\\nThe Florida Attorney General is the state's chief legal officer. As defined in the Florida Constitution,[4] the Attorney General appoints a statewide prosecutor who may prosecute violations of criminal law occurring in or affecting two or more judicial circuits. The Attorney General is responsible for the Department of Legal Affairs.[5] The Attorney General is head of the Florida Department of Legal Affairs.[6][7]\\r\\nThe Florida Chief Financial Officer's duties include monitoring the states finances and fiscal well being, auditing and assuring that state programs are properly spending money and overseeing the proper management of the revenue and spending of the state.[8] The Chief Financial Officer is the head of the Florida Department of Financial Services (FDFS).[6]\\r\\nThe Florida Commissioner of Agriculture is the head of the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services (FDACS).\\r\\nThe purpose of agencies is to promulgate rules to implement legislation. In April 2014, there were 25,362 administrative rules, and eight agencies have over 1,000 rules each, of which the most heavily regulated agencies are the Department of Financial Services and Department of Health.[9] The Florida Administrative Register (FAR) is the daily publication containing proposed rules and notices of state agencies.[10] The regulations are codified in the Florida Administrative Code (FAC).[11] There are also numerous decisions, opinions and rulings of state agencies.[12]\\r\\nThe state had about 122,000 employees in 2010.[13][14]\\r\\nThe Florida Constitution mandates a bicameral state legislature, consisting of a Florida Senate of 40 members and a Florida House of Representatives of 120 members.[15] The two bodies meet in the Florida State Capitol. The Florida House of Representative members serve for two-year terms, while Florida Senate members serve staggered four-year terms, with 20 Senators up for election every two years.[16] Members of both houses are term limited to serve a maximum of eight years.[17] There are also state auditors led by the Florida Auditor General who is appointed by the Joint Legislative Auditing Committee,[18][19][20] the utility-regulating Florida Public Service Commission (FPSC),[21][6] and the Florida Office of Program Policy Analysis and Government Accountability (OPPAGA).[6]\\r\\nThe legislature's session is part-time, meeting for 60-day regular sessions annually. The regular session of the Florida Legislature commences on the first Tuesday after the first Monday in March with the Governor's State of the State speech before a joint session and ends on the last Friday in April or the first Friday in May. The Florida Legislature often meets in special sessions, sometimes as many as a half dozen in a year, that are called for particular purposes, such as budget reduction or reforming property insurance. A special session may be called by the governor,[22] by joint proclamation of the Speaker of the House and Senate President or by three-fifths vote of the members of both houses.[23] Outside of these regular and special sessions, the members of both houses participate in county delegation meetings and interim committee meetings throughout the year, mostly from November to February in advance of the regular session.\\r\\nIts session laws are compiled into the Laws of Florida,[24] and the Florida Statutes are the codified statutory laws of the state which have general applicability.[24]\\r\\nThe Florida State Courts System is the unified state court system. The Florida State Courts System consists of the:\\r\\nThe Supreme Court of Florida is the highest court of Florida and consists of seven judges: the Chief Justice and six justices. The Court is the final arbiter of Florida law, and its decisions are binding authority for all other state courts. The five Florida District Courts of Appeal are the intermediate appellate courts.\\r\\nThe 20 Florida circuit courts are trial courts of original jurisdiction for most controversies.[25] The circuit courts primarily handle civil cases where the amount in controversy is greater than $15,000, and felony criminal cases, as well as appeals from county courts. Circuit courts also have jurisdiction over domestic relations, juvenile dependency, juvenile delinquency, and probate matters. The 67 Florida county courts have original jurisdiction over misdemeanor criminal cases, including violations of county and municipal ordinances, and in civil cases whose value in controversy does not exceed $15,000.\\r\\nEach civil entity has its own budget: state, county, and municipal.\\r\\nIn June 2015, the state's debt was $25.7 billion.[26]\\r\\nThe commissioners charged by the government of the unified Florida to select a permanent capital selected Tallahassee, then between the two major cities of Florida, Pensacola and Saint Augustine, as the state capital, in 1823.[27] The White people expelled the Native Americans, who were opposed to leaving their land, before settling Tallahassee.[28] The commissioners were Dr. W.H. Simmons, from St. Augustine, and John Lee Williams, from Pensacola. Richard Keith Call and a founder of Jacksonville, John Bellamy, wanted the capital in what is now Lake County but their efforts failed.[27]\\r\\nFrom the beginning of Tallahassee's history there were multiple attempts to move the state capital. A July 1957 Florida Historical Quarterly article stated that this was because of Tallahassee's distance from other settlements.[29]\\r\\nAs Florida's size and population grew and spread south, the center of the state's population and the geographic center of the state changed. Using data from the 2010 U.S. Census, according to the Florida Bureau of Economic and Business Research, the state's center of population was southern Polk County. The geographic center of the state is Brooksville. Because Tallahassee became increasingly far from many Floridians, there were additional proposals to move the capital to Orlando, a more centrally-located city, in the late 1960s.[30] The City of Orlando, in 1967, passed a referendum stating that it would accept becoming the capital.[29] These proposals stopped after the new Florida Capitol opened in Tallahassee in 1977. Politicians from North Florida had opposed the idea of moving the state capital. Adam C. Smith of the Tampa Bay Times argued in 2016 that Tallahassee is no longer an appropriate location for the capital, and he cited an American Economic Review article which stated that state capitals far from their populations are more prone to corruption than those that are not.[30]\\r\\nThere are four types of local governments in Florida: counties, municipalities, school districts, and special districts.[2]\\r\\nFlorida consists of 67 counties. Each county has officers considered \\"state\\" officers: these officials are elected locally, and their salaries and office expenses are also paid locally, but they cannot be removed from office or replaced locally, but only by the governor. The state officers subject to this requirement are the sheriff, state's attorney, public defender, tax collector, supervisor of elections, clerk of the circuit court (though styled as such, each circuit having multiple counties within its jurisdiction has a separate elected clerk within each county, and the office also handles official county records not pertaining to judicial matters), property appraiser, and judges.\\r\\nThere is one school district for each county; the Florida Constitution allows adjoining counties to merge their districts upon voter approval.[31] The superintendent is by default an elected official; however, the Florida Constitution allows county voters to make the position an appointed one.[32]\\r\\nMunicipalities in Florida may be called towns, cities, or villages, but there is no legal distinction between the different terms. Municipalities often have police departments, fire departments, and provide essential services such as water, waste collection, etc. In unincorporated areas of a county, the county itself can provide some of these services. Municipalities may also enter agreements with the county to have the county provide certain services. Each county has a sheriff who also tends to have concurrent jurisdiction with municipal police departments.[2]\\r\\nBoth counties and cities may have a legislative branch (commissions or councils) and executive branch (mayor or manager) and local police, but violations are brought before a county court. Counties and municipalities are authorized to pass laws (ordinances), levy taxes, and provide public services within their jurisdictions. All areas of Florida are located within a county, but only some areas have been incorporated into municipalities. All municipalities are located within a county and the county jurisdiction overlays the municipal jurisdiction. Usually, if there is a conflict between a county ordinance and a municipal ordinance, the municipal ordinance has precedence within the municipality's borders; however, the overlaying county's ordinances have precedence if the overlaying county has been designated a charter county by the Florida Legislature.[2]\\r\\nIn some cases, the municipal and county governments have merged into a consolidated government. However, smaller municipal governments can be created inside of a consolidated municipality/county. In Jacksonville, the municipal government has taken over the responsibilities normally given to the county government, Duval County, and smaller municipalities exist within it.\\r\\nAmong special districts are \\"community development districts\\" which have virtually all the power of a city or county (except, notably, they do not have police power). Chapter 190 of the Florida Statutes governs these districts. Notable CDD's include the Reedy Creek Improvement District (the location of Walt Disney World) and substantially all of The Villages (the giant Central Florida retirement community).","input":"How many branches of government does florida have?"},{"output":"as nest parasites in bee colonies","context":"\\r\\nWaxworms are the caterpillar larvae of wax moths, which belong to the family Pyralidae (snout moths). Two closely related species are commercially bred ÿ the lesser wax moth (Achroia grisella) and the greater wax moth (Galleria mellonella). They belong to the tribe Galleriini in the snout moth subfamily Galleriinae. Another species whose larvae share that name is the Indian mealmoth (Plodia interpunctella), though this species is not available commercially.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe adult moths are sometimes called \\"bee moths\\", but, particularly in apiculture, this can also refer to Aphomia sociella, another Galleriinae moth which also produces waxworms, but is not commercially bred.\\r\\n\\r\\nWaxworms are medium-white caterpillars with black-tipped feet and small, black or brown heads.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the wild, they live as nest parasites in bee colonies and eat cocoons, pollen, and shed skins of bees, and chew through beeswax, thus the name. Beekeepers consider waxworms to be pests.[1] Galleria mellonella (the greater wax moths) will not attack the bees directly, but feed on the wax used by the bees to build their honeycomb. Their full development to adults requires access to used brood comb or brood cell cleaningsthese contain protein essential for the larvae's development, in the form of brood cocoons. The destruction of the comb will spill or contaminate stored honey and may kill bee larvae or be the cause of the spreading of honey bee diseases.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen kept in captivity, they can go a long time without eating, particularly if kept at a cool temperature. Captive waxworms are generally raised on a mixture of cereal grain, bran, and honey.\\r\\n\\r\\nWaxworms are an ideal food for many insectivorous animals and plants.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese larvae are grown extensively for use as food for humans, as well as live food for terrarium pets and some pet birds, mostly due to their high fat content, their ease of breeding, and their ability to survive for weeks at low temperatures. Most commonly, they are used to feed reptiles such as bearded dragons (species in the genus Pogona), the neon tree dragon (Japalura splendida), geckos, brown anole (Anolis sagrei), turtles such as the three-toed box turtle (Terrapene carolina triunguis), and chameleons. They can also be fed to amphibians such as Ceratophrys frogs, newts such as the Strauch's spotted newt (Neurergus strauchii), and salamanders such as axolotls. Small mammals such as the domesticated hedgehog can also be fed with waxworms, while birds such as the greater honeyguide can also appreciate the food. They can also be used as food for captive predatory insects reared in terrarium, such as assassin bugs in the genus Platymeris, and are also occasionally used to feed certain kinds of fish in the wild, such as bluegills (Lepomis macrochirus).\\r\\n\\r\\nWaxworms may be store-bought or raised by anglers.[2] Anglers and fishing bait shops often refer to the larvae as \\"waxies\\". They are used for catching some varieties of panfish, members of the sunfish family (Centrarchidae), Green sunfish (Lepomis cyanellus) and can be used for shallow water fishing with the use of a lighter weight. They are also used for fishing some members of the Salmonidae family, Masu salmon (Oncorhynchus masou), white-spotted char (Salvelinus leucomaenis), and rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss).\\r\\n\\r\\nWaxworms can replace mammals in certain types of scientific experiments with animal testing, especially in studies examining the virulence mechanisms of bacterial and fungal pathogens.[3] Waxworms prove valuable in such studies because the innate immune system of insects is strikingly similar to that of mammals.[4] Waxworms survive well at human body temperature and are large enough in size to allow straightforward handling and accurate dosing. Additionally, the considerable cost savings when using waxworms instead of small mammals (usually mice, hamsters, or guinea pigs) allows testing throughout that is otherwise impossible. Using waxworms, it is now possible to screen large numbers of bacterial and fungal strains to identify genes involved in pathogenesis or large chemical libraries with the hope of identifying promising therapeutic compounds. The later studies have proved especially useful in identifying chemical compounds with favorable bioavailability.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nTwo species of waxworm, Galleria mellonella and Plodia interpunctella have both been observed eating and digesting polyethylene plastic. The waxworms metabolize polyethylene plastic films into ethylene glycol, a compound which biodegrades rapidly.[6] This unusual ability to digest matter classically thought of as non-edible may originate with the waxworm's ability to digest beeswax. Two strains of bacteria, Enterobacter asburiae and Bacillus sp, isolated from the guts of Plodia interpunctella waxworms, have been shown to decompose polyethylene in laboratory testing.[7][8] In a test with a 28-day incubation period of these two strains of bacteria on polyethylene films, the films' hydrophobicity decreased. In addition, damage to the films' surface with pits and cavities (0.3-0.4 m in depth) was observed using scanning electron microscopy and atomic-force microscopy.\\r\\n\\r\\nPlaced in a polyethylene shopping bag, approximately 100 Galleria mellonella waxworms consumed almost 0.1 gram (0.0032 ounces) of the plastic over the course of 12 hours in laboratory conditions.[9]","input":"Where do wax worms live in the wild?"},{"output":"premiered on NBC on September 20, 1999","context":"Law & Order: Special Victims Unit (often abbreviated to Law & Order: SVU or just SVU) is an American police procedural, legal, crime drama television series set in New York City, where it is also primarily produced. In the style of the original Law & Order, episodes are often \\"ripped from the headlines\\" or loosely based on real crimes that have received media attention. Created by Dick Wolf, the series premiered on NBC on September 20, 1999, as the second series in Wolf's successful Law & Order franchise. Law & Order: Special Victims Unit has been nominated for and won numerous awards, including the 2006 Emmy for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series for Mariska Hargitay, the first, and to date only, Emmy to be received by a regular on any Law & Order series. It is the current longest running scripted non-animated U.S. primetime TV series since the cancellation of the original Law & Order on May 24, 2010 and is the fourth-longest running scripted U.S. primetime TV series on a major broadcast network.\\r\\nLaw & Order: Special Victims Unit originally centered almost exclusively on the detectives of the Special Victims Unit in a fictional version of the 16th Precinct of the New York City Police Department. As the series progressed, additional supporting characters were added as allies of the detectives in the New York County Manhattan District Attorney's office (known as advisers from the Sex Crimes Bureau) and the Medical Examiner's office. Certain episodes will go into detail about detectives' personal lives and how they may or may not tie into the crimes dealt with during the show. Typical episodes follow the detectives and their colleagues as they investigate and prosecute sexually based offenses, child abuse, and crimes against the elderly.[2] The show starred Christopher Meloni as Detective Elliot Stabler and Mariska Hargitay as Detective Olivia Benson for its first twelve seasons until the former left the cast, unable to come to an agreement on his contract.[3][4][5]\\r\\nOn May 12, 2017, the series was renewed for a nineteenth season, which premiered on September 27, 2017.[6][7] As of April 18, 2018, Law & Order: Special Victims Unit has aired 429 original episodes.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe idea for Law & Order: Special. Victims Unit originated with the 1986 \\"preppie murder\\" case of Robert Chambers, who strangled Jennifer Levin, a woman he dated whom he later killed during what he claimed was consensual \\"rough sex\\" in Manhattan's Central Park. The crime inspired Dick Wolf to write the story for the season one episode of Law & Order titled \\"Kiss the Girls and Make Them Die\\". Even after writing the episode, however, the case continued to haunt Wolf, who wanted to go deeper into the psychology of crimes to examine the role of human sexuality.[8]\\r\\nThe original title of the show was Sex Crimes, reflecting the sexual nature of the crimes depicted on the show. Initially there was concern among the producers that, should Sex Crimes fail, identifying the new show with the Law & Order franchise could hurt the original show. Additionally, Ted Kotcheff wanted to create a new series that was not dependent upon the original series for success. Wolf felt, however, that it was important and commercially desirable to have \\"Law & Order\\" in the title, and he initially proposed the title of the show be Law & Order: Sex Crimes. Barry Diller, then head of Studios USA, was concerned about the title, however, and it was changed to Law & Order: Special Victims Unit to reflect the actual unit of the New York City Police Department (NYPD) that handles sexually based offenses that are especially heinous.[9] The first episode, \\"Payback\\", premiered on NBC on September 20, 1999.[10]\\r\\nExecutive producer Neal Baer left Law & Order: SVU as showrunner at the end of season twelve, after eleven years (seasons 2ÿ12) on the show, in order to sign a three-year deal with CBS Studios.[11] Baer was replaced by former Law & Order: Criminal Intent showrunner Warren Leight.[12] In March 2015, it was announced that Warren Leight signed a three-year deal with Sony Pictures Television, that will allow him to work on SVU one more season, its seventeenth. Leight joined the show in season thirteen.[13] It was announced on March 10, 2016 that original Law & Order veteran producer Rick Eid would take Leight's place as showrunner starting in season 18. Creator Dick Wolf commented to The Hollywood Reporter, \\"I'm extremely pleased that Rick had decided to rejoin the family and hope that he will be here for years to come.\\"[14] During post-production of season 18, following the announcement that SVU was renewed for a nineteenth season, it was revealed that Rick Eid departed the series. He will be taking over another Dick Wolf/NBC series. Chicago P.D.[15]\\r\\nIt was announced on May 25, 2017 that original Law & Order and Law & Order: Criminal Intent showrunner Michael S. Chernuchin would be reprising his role starting on season nineteen. Chernuchin was also co-creator and executive producing showrunner of Chicago Justice, another Wolf-related show that was canceled by NBC at the end of the 2016ÿ17 TV season.[16]\\r\\nMany exterior scenes of Law & Order: Special Victims Unit are filmed on location in New York City, Wolf's hometown, throughout all five of New York City's boroughs. As the NYPD encounters varied law enforcement challenges on a daily basis, the backdrop provides the writers a supply of ideal locations from which to choose.[17] Fort Lee, New Jersey served as the filming location for Detective Elliot Stabler's residence in Queens, New York.[18]\\r\\nWhen searching for a place to film the interiors of the show, the producers found that there were no suitable studio spaces available in New York City. As a result, a space was chosen at NBC's Central Archives building in nearby North Bergen, New Jersey, which had sat empty for some time, and featured air-conditioning, adequate parking, and 53,000 square feet (4,900?m2) of stage area.[19] The Archives building was used for police station and courtroom scenes,[18] with various other locations in Hudson County used for other scenes, such as a scene shot at the Meadowlands Parkway in Secaucus in 2010. The production left New Jersey for New York in 2010, however, when New Jersey Governor Chris Christie suspended the tax credits for film and television production for the Fiscal Year 2011 to close budget gaps.[20] The show moved into the studio space at Chelsea Piers that had been occupied by the original Law & Order series until its cancellation in May 2010.[21][22]\\r\\nThe show originally aired on Monday nights at 9:00?p.m. ET for the first nine episodes, from September 20 through November 29, 1999.[citation needed] It was then shifted to Friday nights at 10?p.m. ET on January 7, 2000, and remained in that time slot through the end of season four on May 16, 2003.[citation needed] Beginning with the season five premiere on September 23, 2003, SVU moved to Tuesday nights at 10:00?p.m. ET.[citation needed] NBC airs repeats on Saturday nights at varying times and previous episodes are shown on the USA Network on varying days in marathon blocks[citation needed]\\r\\nWith the season eleven premiere on September 23, 2009, the series vacated its Tuesday 10?p.m. ET slot because NBC began a prime-time weeknight Jay Leno series. The new time slot became Wednesday nights at 9:00?p.m. ET on NBC, with CTV still airing SVU on Tuesdays at 10:00 in Canada.[23] After the 2010 Winter Olympics on March 3, 2010, the time slot for SVU changed again to Wednesdays at 10?p.m. ET, where it stayed until the twelfth season.[24] In the 12th season, SVU moved back to 9:00?p.m. to lead in the newest Law & Order spinoff, Law & Order: LA,[25] until it was pulled from the network in January 2011 to be retooled.[26] SVU moved back to 10:00?p.m. on January 12, 2011, until the end of the 13th season.[27] With season 14, SVU moved back to 9:00?p.m. after a two-hour season premiere event on September 26, 2012, a position the show has held since.[28]\\r\\nIn 2007, the Russian production company Studio 2B purchased the rights to create an adaptation of Law & Order: Special Victims Unit for Russian television. Titled y  Ť: ҳ춶 Ť־ 󶶿־ҳ (Law & Order: Division of Field Investigation), the series stars Alisa Bogart as Major Olga Bobrova. The series follows a unit of investigators in Moscow whose job is to investigate crimes of a sexual nature. The series airs on NTV and is produced by Pavel Korchagin, Felix Kleiman, and Edward Verzbovski and directed by Dmitry Brusnikin. The screenplays are written by Sergei Kuznvetsov, Elena Karavaeshnikova, and Maya Shapovalova.[29]\\r\\nCasting for the lead characters of Law & Order: Special Victims Unit occurred in the spring of 1999. Dick Wolf, along with officials from NBC and Studios USA were at the final auditions for the two leads at Rockefeller Center. The last round had been narrowed down to seven finalists. For the female lead, Detective Olivia Benson, actresses Samantha Mathis, Reiko Aylesworth, and Mariska Hargitay were being considered. For the male role, Detective Elliot Stabler, the finalists were Tim Matheson, John Slattery, Nick Chinlund, and Christopher Meloni. Hargitay and Meloni had auditioned in the final round together and, after the actors left, there was a moment of dead silence, after which Wolf blurted out, \\"Oh well. There's no doubt who we should chooseHargitay and Meloni.\\" Wolf believed the duo had the perfect chemistry together from the first time he saw them together, and they ended up being his first choice. Garth Ancier, then head of NBC Entertainment, agreed, and the rest of the panel assembled began voicing their assent.[30]\\r\\nThe first actor to be cast for the show was Dann Florek. Florek had originated the character of Captain Don Cragen in the 1988 pilot for Law & Order and played the character for the first three seasons of the show until he was fired on the orders of network executives, who wanted to add female characters to the all-male primary cast. He maintained a friendly relationship with Wolf, however, and went on to direct three episodes of the original series as well as to occasionally guest star on the show. Shortly after Florek reprised his role for Exiled: A Law & Order Movie, he received a call to be on Sex Crimes.[31] Initially reluctant, he eventually agreed to star on the show as Cragen on the assurance that he would not be asked to audition for the role.[32]\\r\\nShortly after the cancellation of Homicide: Life on the Street, Richard Belzer heard that Benjamin Bratt had left Law & Order. Belzer requested his manager to call Wolf and pitch the idea for Belzer's character from Homicide, Detective John Munch, to become the new partner of Jerry Orbach's character, Detective Lennie Briscoe, since they had previously teamed in three Homicide crossovers. Wolf loved the idea, but had already cast Jesse L. Martin as Briscoe's new partner, Detective Ed Green. The idea was reconfigured, however, to have Munch on Law & Order: Special Victims Unit instead.[32] Since the character of Munch was inspired by David Simon's depiction of Detective Sergeant Jay Landsman and developed for Homicide by Tom Fontana and Barry Levinson, the addition of Munch to the cast required the consent of all three. The appropriate agreements were reached and, while Fontana and Levinson agreed to waive their royalty rights, contracts with Simon required that he be paid royalties for any new show in which Munch is a main character; as a result, Simon receives royalties every time Munch appears in an episode of the show.[33]\\r\\nDean Winters was cast as Munch's partner, Brian Cassidy, at the insistence of Belzer. Belzer looked at Winters as a sort of little brother, and told Wolf, \\"Well, I'll do this new show of yours, SVU, only if you make Dean Winters my partner.\\"[32] Wolf did make Winters Belzer's partner, but he was contractually obligated to his other show at the time, the HBO drama Oz. Since the role on Law & Order: Special Victims Unit was only initially meant to be a few episodes, Winters was forced to leave when it was time to film Oz again. Winters returned for the Season 13 finale, \\"Rhodium Nights,\\" reprising his role as Cassidy. He also appeared (as Cassidy) on the two-part Season 14 premiere \\"Lost Reputation\\"/\\"Above Suspicion\\".[34] He subsequently became a recurring character into season 15. The void left by Winters's departure was filled for the remainder of the season by Michelle Hurd as Detective Monique Jeffries, a character who Wolf promised that, despite starting out as a minor character with one scene in the pilot, would eventually develop. Hurd left the show at the beginning of season two to join the cast of Leap Years.[35] Munch's permanent partner came in the form of rapper-turned-actor Ice-T, who had previously worked with Wolf on New York Undercover and Exiled. Ice-T originally agreed to do only four episodes of Law & Order: Special Victims Unit, but he quickly gained affection for the ensemble nature of the cast. He relocated to New York City before his four-episode contract was up and remained with the show as Munch's permanent partner, Detective Odafin \\"Fin\\" Tutuola.[36]\\r\\nInitially, the show focused exclusively on the policework of the detectives in the Special Victims Unit of the 16th precinct, with members of the District Attorney's office occasionally appearing as guest roles crossing over from the original Law & Order. From season two onwards, the format was changed to be more faithful to the original Law & Order concept by including court cases. Stephanie March had little television experience before being cast on Law & Order: Special Victims Unit, nor did she watch much TV. Nevertheless, March was cast as Assistant District Attorney Alexandra Cabot at the beginning of season two but still believed that, due to the grim nature of the series, it would be short-lived. She stayed with the series for three seasons, however, and left when she believed she had reached the natural conclusion of the character's development. She would later reprise the character as a guest appearance in season six and as a regular character on the short-lived Wolf series, Conviction, where she was promised more to do. Diane Neal had previously guest starred on Law & Order: Special Victims Unit in season three before being cast as Cabot's replacement, Casey Novak, in season five. Neal remained with the show through the end of season nine,[37] after which she was replaced by Michaela McManus. March returned to the show in the tenth season (after McManus' departure from the cast) when Neal Baer proposed Cabot receive a character arc to revitalize the second part of the season, which would continue through season eleven.[38][39]\\r\\nTamara Tunie was cast as medical examiner Melinda Warner in season two after working with Wolf previously on New York Undercover, Feds, and Law & Order. Warner was initially a recurring character but became a regular character in season seven, and Tunie was added to the opening credits at that time.[40] When initially cast as Warner, Tunie was appearing as attorney Jessica Griffin on the CBS daytime soap opera As the World Turns. From 2000 to 2007 (and again briefly in 2009), she appeared on both series simultaneously. In 2002, she also appeared on the Fox espionage-themed drama series 24, in the recurring role of CTU Acting Director Alberta Green. B. D. Wong was asked to film four episodes as Dr. George Huang, a Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) forensic psychiatrist and criminal profiler on loan to the Special Victims Unit. After his four episodes, he was asked to stay on with the show.[41]\\r\\nAfter he starred in Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee and guest starred as Detective Chester Lake in the eighth season, Wolf felt that Adam Beach would be a good addition to the cast and asked him to be a permanent member beginning with the ninth season. Although Beach felt the role was a \\"dream role\\", the character proved unpopular with fans who felt that he was designed to gradually write out either Richard Belzer or Ice-T. Feeling there were too many police characters on the show, Beach left the show after only one season.[42] Michaela McManus was originally felt to be too young for the role of an Assistant District Attorney (ADA) before being cast as ADA Kim Greylek in the tenth season. McManus, months removed from a recurring role on One Tree Hill, remained with the series only half a season, however, before departing for unspecified reasons.[43]\\r\\nPaula Patton joined the cast as ADA Mikka Von. She replaced Stephanie March.[44] However, Patton dropped out after one episode to film Mission: Impossible ÿ Ghost Protocol, and was replaced by Melissa Sagemiller in the recurring role of ADA Gillian Hardwicke.[45][46]\\r\\nBefore the end of season twelve, Mariska Hargitay asked for a lighter workload. As a way of writing her out of certain episodes, a plan to have her character promoted to a supervisory role was discussed.[47] At the end of season twelve, Christopher Meloni departed the cast, unable to come to terms with his contract. Warren Leight became the new showrunner during this same year and signed on before he knew that Meloni would be leaving the cast.[48] The second major departure to be announced in 2011 was that of B.?D. Wong. On July 17, Wong announced on Twitter that, \\"I actually do not return for season 13, I am jumping to Awake! Its awesome!\\" Wong added, \\"I dont know if or when Ill be back on SVU! It was amazing to have such a cool job for 11 years and to be a real NY Actor.\\" Wong reprised his role as Dr. Huang in season 13's episode \\"Father Dearest\\".[49] In response to these departures, two new main actors were hired, and several changes were made to the recurring cast.\\r\\nIn June 2011, it was announced that Kelli Giddish and Danny Pino would join the cast as new series regulars.[5] Weeks later, it was announced that Stephanie March and Diane Neal would be reprising their roles as ADA Alexandra Cabot and ADA Casey Novak, respectively.[50] The launch of season 13 was marked with a retooling of the show that Warren Leight referred to as \\"SVU 2.0\\".[51] Changes that accompanied this included Tamara Tunie's being bumped from the main cast to a guest starring role and recurring actor Joel de la Fuente's not appearing for the first time since 2002. Of the latter change, Warren Leight said, \\"those scenes [which featured Fuente] can be dry\\" and hired Gilbert Gottfried as a more comedic replacement.[52] In addition to these changes, Linus Roache became a recurring cast member in his role of Michael Cutter, whom he played on Law & Order; on SVU former Executive ADA Cutter serves as the Bureau Chief for ADAs attached to the Special Victims Unit.\\r\\nIn season 14, Ra~l Esparza joined the cast in a recurring capacity as ADA Rafael Barba and prior to the season 15 premiere, Esparza was promoted to a series regular. Also in season 15, Belzer departed the cast in the fifth episode, \\"Wonderland Story\\", in which Sgt. Munch retired from the NYPD and took a job in the DA's office as an investigator. Later in the season, Captain Cragen announced his departure from the NYPD, which made newly promoted Sgt. Benson the temporary squad commander. In leaving the cast, Florek ended a 400-episode run as Captain Cragen. In season 16, Peter Scanavino joined the series, first in a recurring role for episodes 1ÿ3 and then was promoted to the main cast in episode 5, with Kelli Giddish, Danny Pino, Ice-T and Ra~l Esparza no longer appearing in every episode. On May 20, 2015, it was revealed that Danny Pino would be leaving the cast after the season 16 finale \\"Surrendering Noah\\".\\r\\nIn August 2017, it was announced that Philip Winchester will recur in season 19 as ADA Peter Stone, his character from Chicago P.D. and Chicago Justice, who is the son of Benjamin Stone, the ADA on the original Law & Order show.[53] It was later also announced that Brooke Shields was enlisted to assume a major recurring role starting in Season 19 of the long-running dramatic series.[54] On February 7, 2018, Ra~l Esparza left the series after six seasons.[55]\\r\\nBy season twelve, both Mariska Hargitay and Christopher Meloni had become among the highest-paid lead actors on a drama, with each earning nearly $400,000 per episode, a salary that TV Guide said was exceeded only by House's Hugh Laurie.[56] During season sixteen, Hargitay was reported to be earning $450,000 per episode, or $10,350,000 per season,[57] In season seventeen, her salary increased to $500,000 per episode.[58]\\r\\n??????????ÿ Opening narration spoken by Steven Zirnkilton[60]\\r\\nBased out of the New York City Police Department's 16th precinct in Manhattan, Law & Order: Special Victims Unit delves into the dark side of the New York underworld as the detectives of a new elite force, the Special Victims Unit (SVU for short), investigate and prosecute various sexually-oriented crimes including rape, pedophilia, and domestic violence. They also investigate the abuses of children, the disabled and elderly victims of non-sexual crimes who require specialist handling. All the while trying to balance the effects of the investigation on their own lives. Its stories also touch on the political and societal issues associated with gender identity, sexual preferences, and equality rights. While the victim is often murdered, this is not always the case, and victims frequently play prominent roles in episodes. The unit also works with the Manhattan District Attorney's office as they prosecute cases and seek justice for SVU's victims and survivors with precision and a passion to win and bring closure to the intense investigations. The series often uses stories that are \\"ripped from the headlines\\" or based on real crimes. Such episodes take a real crime and fictionalize it by changing some details.[61]\\r\\nOriginally the show focused around the detective pairings of Elliot Stabler & Olivia Benson and John Munch & Brian Cassidy. Stabler is a seasoned veteran of the unit who has seen it all and tries his best to protect his family from the horrors he sees every day. His partner Benson's difficult past as the child of a rape victim is the reason she joined the unit. Backing them up is John Munch, and his first partner Brian Cassidy. Munch is a transfer from Baltimore's homicide unit, who brings his acerbic wit, conspiracy theories, and street-honed investigative skills. Whilst Cassidy is young and eager to learn from his fellow detectives. These two detective teams received support from Detectives Monique Jeffries and Ken Briscoe.[60] When Cassidy transferred to Narcotics after thirteen episodes, Jeffries was partnered with Munch for the remaining of Season One and Briscoe was phased out. In the beginning of season two, Munch was then permanently partnered with Detective Odafin \\"Fin\\" Tutuola, whose unique yet sometimes vulgar sense of humor and investigative experience make him a formidable match for Munch.[62] These detectives were supervised by veteran Captain Donald Cragen who oversaw the team from seasons 1ÿ15. Cragen's tough-but-supportive approach to the team's complex cases guides the squad through the challenges they face every day. Also on the team's payroll is FBI Special Agent Dr. George Huang and Medical Examiner Dr. Melinda Warner. As the resident psychiatrist for the Special Victims Unit, Huang helps keep the officers sane in a field that could drive ordinary people mad. He has also served as the squad's resident criminal profiler, and his insights into the criminal mind have often helped the officers to crack the toughest perps, whilst Warner has become an integral part of the Manhattan Special Victims Unit, and her personal skills have contributed to the unit's high success rate in closing cases.\\r\\nThe Unit did not receive a full-time assistant district attorney until season two, when Alexandra Cabot was assigned to work with the detectives.[63] After Cabot's departure in season five, she was replaced by Casey Novak, who remained as the ADA until the end of season nine. Kim Greylek became the permanent ADA in the season ten premiere, until Cabot made a return midway through that season when Greylek departed. Cabot remained the ADA through the second half of season eleven. After Cabot's departure, the ADA void was filled by Sonya Paxton (Christine Lahti) and Jo Marlowe (Sharon Stone) until the conclusion of season eleven. Gillian Hardwicke served as the SVU ADA during season twelve. In season thirteen, both Cabot and Novak returned as ADAs. From the beginning of season fourteen, ADA Rafael Barba had been SVU's prosecutor, until leaving halfway through season nineteen. Chicago Justices Peter Stone became SVUs ADA after Chicago Justice was cancelled after only one season.\\r\\nIn season 13 other big changes happened when Stabler left in the season twelve finale. Detectives Nick Amaro and Amanda Rollins joined the team filling the void left by Stabler. Amaro brings empathy to his cases while dealing with a stressful home life, whilst Rollins' dogged persistence and instincts help her close cases, but her secrets could derail her career. In the current seasons the Manhattan SVU is now run by Lieutenant Olivia Benson.\\r\\nLaw & Order: Special Victims Unit has concluded its eighteenth season and has started its nineteenth season. Each season has aired on NBC and consists of 19 to 25 episodes, each lasting approximately forty minutes (sixty minutes including commercials).\\r\\nLaw & Order: Special Victims Unit premiered on Monday, September 20, 1999. After nine episodes, the show was moved to Friday nights, where it found its audience and following its first and second seasons became a Top 20-overall show, overcoming the \\"Friday night death slot\\" phenomenon. Beginning with the season five, the show aired on Tuesdays to compete with CBS' Judging Amy and ABC's NYPD Blue. In its later years, Law & Order: Special Victims Unit consistently outperformed Law & Order in the Nielsen ratings for first run episodes until the latter's cancellation in 2010.\\r\\nIn 2016, a New York Times study of the 50 TV shows with the most Facebook Likes found that SVU's popularity was \\"atypical: generally slightly more popular in rural areas and the Black Belt, but largely restricted to the eastern half of the country. It's most popular in Albany, N.Y.; least in Colorado and Utah\\".[68]\\r\\nNote: Each U.S. network television season starts in late September and ends in late May (with the exception of the second and tenth season), which coincides with the completion of May sweeps.\\r\\nLaw & Order: Special Victims Unit has received many awards and award nominations. Mariska Hargitay has twice been nominated for a Golden Globe Award and won once in 2005.[126]\\r\\nThe show has been nominated numerous times for the Emmy Award. Mariska Hargitay has been nominated for the Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series category 8 years in a row beginning in 2004 and won the Emmy in 2006. Christopher Meloni was nominated for the Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series category in 2006. Robin Williams was nominated in the Outstanding Guest Actor in a Drama Series in 2008. The series was nominated in the category Outstanding Guest Actress in a Drama Series for Jane Alexander and Tracy Pollan in 2000, Martha Plimpton in 2002, Barbara Barrie in 2003, Mare Winningham and Marlee Matlin in 2004, Amanda Plummer and Angela Lansbury in 2005, Marcia Gay Harden and Leslie Caron in 2007, Cynthia Nixon in 2008, Ellen Burstyn, Brenda Blethyn, and Carol Burnett in 2009, and Ann-Margret in 2010. The series won the award for Plummer in 2005, Caron in 2007, Nixon in 2008, Burstyn in 2009, and Margret in 2010.[127]\\r\\nLaw and Order SVU airs on NBC in the United States. All seasons, including the season that is currently on the air, are available to stream on Hulu (with a subscription). The latest 5 episodes can be watched for free on NBC.com[128] and the NBC app.[129] Outside of SVOD and NBC platforms, all episodes can be found on electronic sell-through platforms such as iTunes[130] and Amazon Video.[131] The show airs every Thursday night, on Network Ten in Australia, with a new episode usually followed by a repeat and occasionally shows repeats on other nights. Ten's digital channel One sometimes shows Seasons One-Three on Friday or Saturday nights, but is not currently airing these seasons at the moment. From the 29th of August 2017, Channel Nine started airing the first season at a late night slot, which it has also done with the original Law & Order but stopped after the first episode. The first season later moved to Nines sister channel Gem on Sunday nights as of February 25, 2018 at 9:10pm with double episodes, and later reairing them in the early hours of Monday morning. Season 19 premiered on Network Ten on October 5, 2017 at 9:40pm.\\r\\nAs of September 2017, the show is currently rerun on fellow NBCUniversal network USA Network, as well as Ion Television and local stations. The show also briefly ran on Syfy in 2006.\\r\\nIn Australia, Law & Order: SVU airs on Network Ten and Australia's cable channel Universal Channel (formerly aired on TV1 which ceased to broadcast in December 2013).

Roosevelt","context":"Hoover Dam is a concrete arch-gravity dam in the Black Canyon of the Colorado River, on the border between the U.S. states of Nevada and Arizona. It was constructed between 1931 and 1936 during the Great Depression and was dedicated on September 30, 1935, by President Franklin D. Roosevelt. Originally known as Boulder Dam from 1933, it was officially renamed Hoover Dam by a joint resolution of Congress in 1947. Its construction was the result of a massive effort involving thousands of workers, and cost over one hundred lives. The dam was named after President Herbert Hoover.\\r\\nSince about 1900, the Black Canyon and nearby Boulder Canyon had been investigated for their potential to support a dam that would control floods, provide irrigation water and produce hydroelectric power. In 1928, Congress authorized the project. The winning bid to build the dam was submitted by a consortium called Six Companies, Inc., which began construction on the dam in early 1931. Such a large concrete structure had never been built before, and some of the techniques were unproven. The torrid summer weather and lack of facilities near the site also presented difficulties. Nevertheless, Six Companies turned over the dam to the federal government on March 1, 1936, more than two years ahead of schedule.\\r\\nHoover Dam impounds Lake Mead, the largest reservoir in the United States by volume (when it is full).[6] The dam is located near Boulder City, Nevada, a municipality originally constructed for workers on the construction project, about 30?mi (48?km) southeast of Las Vegas, Nevada. The dam's generators provide power for public and private utilities in Nevada, Arizona, and California. Hoover Dam is a major tourist attraction; nearly a million people tour the dam each year. The heavily traveled U.S. Route 93 (US?93) ran along the dam's crest until October 2010, when the Hoover Dam Bypass opened.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the United States developed the Southwest, the Colorado River was seen as a potential source of irrigation water. An initial attempt at diverting the river for irrigation purposes occurred in the late 1890s, when land speculator William Beatty built the Alamo Canal just north of the Mexican border; the canal dipped into Mexico before running to a desolate area Beatty named the Imperial Valley.[7] Though water from the Imperial Canal allowed for the widespread settlement of the valley, the canal proved expensive to maintain. After a catastrophic breach that caused the Colorado River to fill the Salton Sea,[8] the Southern Pacific Railroad spent $3?million in 1906ÿ07 to stabilize the waterway, an amount it hoped vainly would be reimbursed by the Federal Government. Even after the waterway was stabilized, it proved unsatisfactory because of constant disputes with landowners on the Mexican side of the border.[9]\\r\\nAs the technology of electric power transmission improved, the Lower Colorado was considered for its hydroelectric-power potential. In 1902, the Edison Electric Company of Los Angeles surveyed the river in the hope of building a 40-foot (12?m) rock dam which could generate 10,000 horsepower (7,500?kW). However, at the time, the limit of transmission of electric power was 80 miles (130?km), and there were few customers (mostly mines) within that limit. Edison allowed land options it held on the river to lapseincluding an option for what became the site of Hoover Dam.[10]\\r\\nIn the following years, the Bureau of Reclamation (BOR), known as the Reclamation Service at the time, also considered the Lower Colorado as the site for a dam. Service chief Arthur Powell Davis proposed using dynamite to collapse the walls of Boulder Canyon,[11] 20 miles (32?km) north of the eventual dam site, into the river.[12] The river would carry off the smaller pieces of debris, and a dam would be built incorporating the remaining rubble. In 1922, after considering it for several years, the Reclamation Service finally rejected the proposal, citing doubts about the unproven technique and questions as to whether it would in fact save money.[11]\\r\\nIn 1922, the Reclamation Service presented a report calling for the development of a dam on the Colorado River for flood control and electric power generation. The report was principally authored by Davis, and was called the Fall-Davis report after Interior Secretary Albert Fall. The Fall-Davis report cited use of the Colorado River as a federal concern, because the river's basin covered several states, and the river eventually entered Mexico.[13] Though the Fall-Davis report called for a dam \\"at or near Boulder Canyon\\", the Reclamation Service (which was renamed the Bureau of Reclamation the following year) found that canyon unsuitable.[14] One potential site at Boulder Canyon was bisected by a geologic fault; two others were so narrow there was no space for a construction camp at the bottom of the canyon[14] or for a spillway. The Service investigated Black Canyon and found it ideal; a railway could be laid from the railhead in Las Vegas to the top of the dam site.[15] Despite the site change, the dam project was referred to as the \\"Boulder Canyon Project\\".[16]\\r\\nWith little guidance on water allocation from the Supreme Court, proponents of the dam feared endless litigation. A Colorado attorney proposed that the seven states which fell within the river's basin (California, Nevada, Arizona, Utah, New Mexico, Colorado and Wyoming) form an interstate compact, with the approval of Congress. Such compacts were authorized by Article I of the United States Constitution but had never been concluded among more than two states. In 1922, representatives of seven states met with then-Secretary of Commerce Herbert Hoover.[17] Initial talks produced no result, but when the Supreme Court handed down the Wyoming v. Colorado decision undermining the claims of the upstream states, they became anxious to reach an agreement. The resulting Colorado River Compact was signed on November 24, 1922.[18]\\r\\nLegislation to authorize the dam was introduced repeatedly by two California Republicans, Representative Phil Swing and Senator Hiram Johnson, but representatives from other parts of the country considered the project as hugely expensive and one that would mostly benefit California. The 1927 Mississippi flood made Midwestern and Southern congressmen and senators more sympathetic toward the dam project. On March 12, 1928, the failure of the St. Francis Dam, constructed by the city of Los Angeles, caused a disastrous flood that killed up to 600 people. As that dam was a curved-gravity type,[19] similar in design to the arch-gravity as was proposed for the Black Canyon dam, opponents claimed that the Black Canyon dam's safety could not be guaranteed. Congress authorized a board of engineers to review plans for the proposed dam. The Colorado River Board found the project feasible, but warned that should the dam fail, every downstream Colorado River community would be destroyed, and that the river might change course and empty into the Salton Sea. The Board cautioned: \\"To avoid such possibilities, the proposed dam should be constructed on conservative if not ultra-conservative lines.\\"[20]\\r\\nOn December 21, 1928 President Coolidge signed the bill authorizing the dam.[21] The Boulder Canyon Project Act appropriated $165?million for the Hoover Dam along with the downstream Imperial Dam and All-American Canal, a replacement for Beatty's canal entirely on the U.S. side of the border.[22] It also permitted the compact to go into effect when at least six of the seven states approved it. This occurred on March 6, 1929 with Utah's ratification; Arizona did not approve it until 1944.[23]\\r\\nEven before Congress approved the Boulder Canyon Project, the Bureau of Reclamation was considering what kind of dam should be used. Officials eventually decided on a massive concrete arch-gravity dam, the design of which was overseen by the Bureau's chief design engineer John L. Savage. The monolithic dam would be thick at the bottom and thin near the top, and would present a convex face towards the water above the dam. The curving arch of the dam would transmit the water's force into the abutments, in this case the rock walls of the canyon. The wedge-shaped dam would be 660?ft (200?m) thick at the bottom, narrowing to 45?ft (14?m) at the top, leaving room for a highway connecting Nevada and Arizona.[24]\\r\\nOn January 10, 1931, the Bureau made the bid documents available to interested parties, at five dollars a copy. The government was to provide the materials; but the contractor was to prepare the site and build the dam. The dam was described in minute detail, covering 100?pages of text and 76?drawings. A $2?million bid bond was to accompany each bid; the winner would have to post a $5?million performance bond. The contractor had seven years to build the dam, or penalties would ensue.[25]\\r\\nThe Wattis Brothers, heads of the Utah Construction Company, were interested in bidding on the project, but lacked the money for the performance bond. They lacked sufficient resources even in combination with their longtime partners, Morrison-Knudsen, which employed the nation's leading dam builder, Frank Crowe. They formed a joint venture to bid for the project with Pacific Bridge Company of Portland, Oregon; Henry J. Kaiser & W. A. Bechtel Company of San Francisco; MacDonald & Kahn Ltd. of Los Angeles; and the J.F. Shea Company of Portland, Oregon.[26] The joint venture was called Six Companies, Inc. as Bechtel and Kaiser were considered one company for purposes of 6 in the name. The name was descriptive and was an inside joke among the San Franciscans in the bid, where \\"Six Companies\\" was also a Chinese benevolent association in the city.[27] There were three valid bids, and Six Companies' bid of $48,890,955 was the lowest, within $24,000 of the confidential government estimate of what the dam would cost to build, and five million dollars less than the next-lowest bid.[28]\\r\\nThe city of Las Vegas had lobbied hard to be the headquarters for the dam construction, closing its many speakeasies when the decision maker, Secretary of the Interior Ray Wilbur came to town. Instead, Wilbur announced in early 1930 that a model city was to be built in the desert near the dam site. This town became known as Boulder City, Nevada. Construction of a rail line joining Las Vegas and the dam site began in September 1930.[29]\\r\\nSoon after the dam was authorized, increasing numbers of unemployed people converged on southern Nevada. Las Vegas, then a small city of some 5,000, saw between 10,000 and 20,000 unemployed descend on it.[30] A government camp was established for surveyors and other personnel near the dam site; this soon became surrounded by a squatters' camp. Known as McKeeversville, the camp was home to men hoping for work on the project, together with their families.[31] Another camp, on the flats along the Colorado River, was officially called Williamsville, but was known to its inhabitants as \\"Ragtown\\".[32] When construction began, Six Companies hired large numbers of workers, with more than 3,000 on the payroll by 1932[33] and with employment peaking at 5,251 in July 1934.[34] \\"Mongolian\\" (Chinese) labor was prevented by the construction contract,[34] while the number of blacks employed by Six Companies never exceeded thirty, mostly lowest-pay-scale laborers in a segregated crew, who were issued separate water buckets.[35]\\r\\nAs part of the contract, Six Companies, Inc. was to build Boulder City to house the workers. The original timetable called for Boulder City to be built before the dam project began, but President Hoover ordered work on the dam to begin in March 1931 rather than in October.[36] The company built bunkhouses, attached to the canyon wall, to house 480?single men at what became known as River Camp. Workers with families were left to provide their own accommodations until Boulder City could be completed,[37] and many lived in Ragtown.[38] The site of Hoover Dam endures extremely hot weather, and the summer of 1931 was especially torrid, with the daytime high averaging 119.9?F (48.8?C).[39] Sixteen workers and other riverbank residents died of heat prostration between June 25 and July 26, 1931.[40]\\r\\nThe Industrial Workers of the World (IWW or \\"Wobblies\\"), though much-reduced from their heyday as militant labor organizers in the early years of the century, hoped to unionize the Six Companies workers by capitalizing on their discontent. They sent eleven organizers,[41] several of whom were arrested by Las Vegas police.[42] On August 7, 1931, the company cut wages for all tunnel workers. Although the workers sent away the organizers, not wanting to be associated with the \\"Wobblies\\", they formed a committee to represent them with the company. The committee drew up a list of demands that evening and presented them to Crowe the following morning. He was noncommittal. The workers hoped that Crowe, the general superintendent of the job, would be sympathetic; instead he gave a scathing interview to a newspaper, describing the workers as \\"malcontents\\".[43]\\r\\nOn the morning of the 9th, Crowe met with the committee and told them that management refused their demands, was stopping all work, and was laying off the entire work force, except for a few office workers and carpenters. The workers were given until 5?p.m. to vacate the premises. Concerned that a violent confrontation was imminent, most workers took their paychecks and left for Las Vegas to await developments.[44] Two days later, the remainder were talked into leaving by law enforcement. On August 13, the company began hiring workers again, and two days later, the strike was called off.[45] While the workers received none of their demands, the company guaranteed there would be no further reductions in wages. Living conditions began to improve as the first residents moved into Boulder City in late 1931.[46]\\r\\nA second labor action took place in July 1935, as construction on the dam wound down. When a Six Companies manager altered working times to force workers to take lunch on their own time, workers responded with a strike. Emboldened by Crowe's reversal of the lunch decree, workers raised their demands to include a $1-per-day raise. The company agreed to ask the Federal government to supplement the pay, but no money was forthcoming from Washington. The strike ended.[47]\\r\\nBefore the dam could be built, the Colorado River needed to be diverted away from the construction site. To accomplish this, four diversion tunnels were driven through the canyon walls, two on the Nevada side and two on the Arizona side. These tunnels were 56?ft (17?m) in diameter.[48] Their combined length was nearly 16,000?ft, or more than 3 miles (5?km).[49] The contract required these tunnels to be completed by October 1, 1933, with a $3,000-per-day fine to be assessed for any delay. To meet the deadline, Six Companies had to complete work by early 1933, since only in late fall and winter was the water level in the river low enough to safely divert.[50]\\r\\nTunneling began at the lower portals of the Nevada tunnels in May 1931. Shortly afterward, work began on two similar tunnels in the Arizona canyon wall. In March 1932, work began on lining the tunnels with concrete. First the base, or invert, was poured. Gantry cranes, running on rails through the entire length of each tunnel were used to place the concrete. The sidewalls were poured next. Movable sections of steel forms were used for the sidewalls. Finally, using pneumatic guns, the overheads were filled in. The concrete lining is 3 feet (1?m) thick, reducing the finished tunnel diameter to 50?ft (15?m).[49] The river was diverted into the two Arizona tunnels on November 13, 1932; the Nevada tunnels were kept in reserve for high water. This was done by exploding a temporary cofferdam protecting the Arizona tunnels while at the same time dumping rubble into the river until its natural course was blocked.[51]\\r\\nFollowing the completion of the dam, the entrances to the two outer diversion tunnels were sealed at the opening and halfway through the tunnels with large concrete plugs. The downstream halves of the tunnels following the inner plugs are now the main bodies of the spillway tunnels.[49] The inner diversion tunnels were plugged at approximately one-third of their length, beyond which they now carry steel pipes connecting the intake towers to the power plant and outlet works.[48] The inner tunnels' outlets are equipped with gates that can be closed to drain the tunnels for maintenance.[48]\\r\\nTo protect the construction site from the Colorado River and to facilitate the river's diversion, two cofferdams were constructed. Work on the upper cofferdam began in September 1932, even though the river had not yet been diverted.[52] The cofferdams were designed to protect against the possibility of the river flooding a site at which two thousand men might be at work, and their specifications were covered in the bid documents in nearly as much detail as the dam itself. The upper cofferdam was 96?ft (29?m) high, and 750 feet (230?m) thick at its base, thicker than the dam itself. It contained 650,000 cubic yards (500,000?m3) of material.[53]\\r\\nWhen the cofferdams were in place and the construction site was drained of water, excavation for the dam foundation began. For the dam to rest on solid rock, it was necessary to remove accumulated erosion soils and other loose materials in the riverbed until sound bedrock was reached. Work on the foundation excavations was completed in June 1933. During this excavation, approximately 1,500,000?cu?yd (1,100,000?m3) of material was removed. Since the dam was an arch-gravity type, the side-walls of the canyon would bear the force of the impounded lake. Therefore, the side-walls were excavated too, to reach virgin rock as weathered rock might provide pathways for water seepage.[52]\\r\\nThe men who removed this rock were called \\"high scalers\\". While suspended from the top of the canyon with ropes, the high-scalers climbed down the canyon walls and removed the loose rock with jackhammers and dynamite. Falling objects were the most common cause of death on the dam site; the high scalers' work thus helped ensure worker safety.[54] One high scaler was able to save life in a more direct manner: when a government inspector lost his grip on a safety line and began tumbling down a slope towards almost certain death, a high scaler was able to intercept him and pull him into the air. The construction site had, even then, become a magnet for tourists; the high scalers were prime attractions and showed off for the watchers. The high scalers received considerable media attention, with one worker dubbed the \\"Human Pendulum\\" for swinging co-workers (and, at other times, cases of dynamite) across the canyon.[55] To protect themselves against falling objects, some high scalers took cloth hats and dipped them in tar, allowing them to harden. When workers wearing such headgear were struck hard enough to inflict broken jaws, they sustained no skull damage, Six Companies ordered thousands of what initially were called \\"hard boiled hats\\" (later \\"hard hats\\") and strongly encouraged their use.[56]\\r\\nThe cleared, underlying rock foundation of the dam site was reinforced with grout, called a grout curtain. Holes were driven into the walls and base of the canyon, as deep as 150 feet (46?m) into the rock, and any cavities encountered were to be filled with grout. This was done to stabilize the rock, to prevent water from seeping past the dam through the canyon rock, and to limit \\"uplift\\"upward pressure from water seeping under the dam. The workers were under severe time constraints due to the beginning of the concrete pour, and when they encountered hot springs or cavities too large to readily fill, they moved on without resolving the problem. A total of 58 of the 393 holes were incompletely filled.[57] After the dam was completed and the lake began to fill, large numbers of significant leaks into the dam caused the Bureau of Reclamation to look into the situation. It found that the work had been incompletely done, and was based on less than a full understanding of the canyon's geology. New holes were drilled from inspection galleries inside the dam into the surrounding bedrock.[58] It took nine years (1938ÿ47) under relative secrecy to complete the supplemental grout curtain.[59]\\r\\nThe first concrete was poured into the dam on June 6, 1933, 18?months ahead of schedule.[60] Since concrete heats and contracts as it cures, the potential for uneven cooling and contraction of the concrete posed a serious problem. Bureau of Reclamation engineers calculated that if the dam was built in a single continuous pour, the concrete would take 125 years to cool, and the resulting stresses would cause the dam to crack and crumble. Instead, the ground where the dam would rise was marked with rectangles, and concrete blocks in columns were poured, some as large as 50?ft square (15?m) and 5 feet (1.5?m) high.[61] Each five-foot form contained a series of 1-inch (25?mm) steel pipes; cool riverwater would be poured through the pipes, followed by ice-cold water from a refrigeration plant. When an individual block had cured and had stopped contracting, the pipes were filled with grout. Grout was also used to fill the hairline spaces between columns, which were grooved to increase the strength of the joins.[62]\\r\\nThe concrete was delivered in huge steel buckets 7 feet high (2.1?m) and almost 7?feet in diameter; Crowe was awarded two patents for their design. These buckets, which weighed 20 short tons (18?t) when full, were filled at two massive concrete plants on the Nevada side, and were delivered to the site in special railcars. The buckets were then suspended from aerial cableways, which were used to deliver the bucket to a specific column. As the required grade of aggregate in the concrete differed depending on placement in the dam (from pea-sized gravel to 9-inch or 23?cm stones), it was vital that the bucket be maneuvered to the proper column. When the bottom of the bucket opened up, disgorging 8?cu?yd (6.1?m3) of concrete, a team of men worked it throughout the form. Although there are myths that men were caught in the pour and are entombed in the dam to this day, each bucket only deepened the concrete in a form by an inch, and Six Companies engineers would not have permitted a flaw caused by the presence of a human body.[63]\\r\\nA total of 3,250,000 cubic yards (2,480,000 cubic metres) of concrete was used in the dam before concrete pouring ceased on May 29, 1935. In addition, 1,110,000?cu?yd (850,000?m3) were used in the power plant and other works. More than 582 miles (937?km) of cooling pipes were placed within the concrete. Overall, there is enough concrete in the dam to pave a two-lane highway from San Francisco to New York.[48] Concrete cores were removed from the dam for testing in 1995; they showed that \\"Hoover Dam's concrete has continued to slowly gain strength\\" and the dam is composed of a \\"durable concrete having a compressive strength exceeding the range typically found in normal mass concrete\\".[64] Hoover Dam concrete is not subject to alkaliÿsilica reaction (ASR) as the Hoover Dam builders happened to use nonreactive aggregate, unlike that at downstream Parker Dam, where ASR has caused measurable deterioration.[64]\\r\\nWith most work finished on the dam itself (the powerhouse remained uncompleted), a formal dedication ceremony was arranged for September 30, 1935, to coincide with a western tour being made by President Franklin D. Roosevelt. The morning of the dedication, it was moved forward three hours from 2?p.m. Pacific time to 11?a.m.; this was done because Secretary of the Interior Harold L. Ickes had reserved a radio slot for the President for 2?p.m. but officials did not realize until the day of the ceremony that the slot was for 2?p.m. Eastern Time.[65] Despite the change in the ceremony time, and temperatures of 102?F (39?C), 10,000?people were present for the President's speech, in which he avoided mentioning the name of former President Hoover,[66] who was not invited to the ceremony.[67] To mark the occasion, a three-cent stamp was issued by the United States Post Office Departmentbearing the name \\"Boulder Dam\\", the official name of the dam between 1933 and 1947.[68] After the ceremony, Roosevelt made the first visit by any American president to Las Vegas.[66]\\r\\nMost work had been completed by the dedication, and Six Companies negotiated with the government through late 1935, and early 1936, to settle all claims and arrange for the formal transfer of the dam to the Federal Government. The parties came to an agreement and on March 1, 1936, Secretary Ickes formally accepted the dam on behalf of the government. Six Companies was not required to complete work on one item, a concrete plug for one of the bypass tunnels, as the tunnel had to be used to take in irrigation water until the powerhouse went into operation.[69]\\r\\nThere were 112?deaths associated with the construction of the dam.[71] The first was J. G. Tierney, a surveyor who drowned on December 20, 1922, while looking for an ideal spot for the dam.[71] The last death on the project's official fatality list occurred on December 20, 1935, when an \\"electrician's helper\\", Patrick Tierney, the son of J. G. Tierney, fell from an intake tower. Included in the fatality list are three workers, one in 1932 and two in 1933, who committed suicide onsite.[72][73][74] Ninety-six of the deaths occurred during construction at the site.[71] Of the 112?fatalities, 91 were Six Companies employees, three were BOR employees, and one was a visitor to the site, with the remainder employees of various contractors not part of Six Companies.[75]\\r\\nNot included in the official number of fatalities were deaths that were recorded as pneumonia. Workers alleged that this diagnosis was a cover for death from carbon monoxide poisoning (brought on by the use of gasoline-fueled vehicles in the diversion tunnels), and a classification used by Six Companies to avoid paying compensation claims.[76] The site's diversion tunnels frequently reached 140?F (60?C), enveloped in thick plumes of vehicle exhaust gases.[77] A total of 42?workers were recorded as having died from pneumonia; none were listed as having died from carbon monoxide poisoning. No deaths of non-workers from pneumonia were recorded in Boulder City during the construction period.[76]\\r\\nThe initial plans for the facade of the dam, the power plant, the outlet tunnels and ornaments clashed with the modern look of an arch dam. The Bureau of Reclamation, more concerned with the dam's functionality, adorned it with a Gothic-inspired balustrade and eagle statues. This initial design was criticized by many as being too plain and unremarkable for a project of such immense scale, so Los Angeles-based architect Gordon B. Kaufmann, then the supervising architect to the Bureau of Reclamation, was brought in to redesign the exteriors.[78] Kaufmann greatly streamlined the design, and applied an elegant Art Deco style to the entire project. He designed sculptured turrets rising seamlessly from the dam face and clock faces on the intake towers set for the time in Nevada and Arizona? both states are in different time zones, but since Arizona does not observe Daylight Saving Time, the clocks display the same time for more than half the year.[79]\\r\\nAt Kaufmann's request, Denver artist Allen Tupper True[78] was hired to handle the design and decoration of the walls and floors of the new dam. True's design scheme incorporated motifs of the Navajo and Pueblo tribes of the region.[80] Although some initially were opposed to these designs, True was given the go-ahead and was officially appointed consulting artist.[81] With the assistance of the National Laboratory of Anthropology, True researched authentic decorative motifs from Indian sand paintings, textiles, baskets and ceramics.[82] The images and colors are based on Native American visions of rain, lightning, water, clouds, and local animals? lizards, serpents, birds? and on the Southwestern landscape of stepped mesas.[80] In these works, which are integrated into the walkways and interior halls of the dam, True also reflected on the machinery of the operation, making the symbolic patterns appear both ancient and modern.[83]\\r\\nWith the agreement of Kaufmann and the engineers, True also devised an innovative color-coding for the pipes and machinery, which was implemented throughout all BOR projects.[84] True's consulting artist job lasted through 1942; it was extended so he could complete design work for the Parker, Shasta and Grand Coulee dams and power plants. True's work on the Hoover Dam was humorously referred to in a poem published in The New Yorker, part of which read, \\"lose the spark, and justify the dream; but also worthy of remark will be the color scheme\\".[85]\\r\\nComplementing Kaufmann and True's work, the Norwegian-born, naturalized American sculptor Oskar J.W. Hansen designed many of the sculptures on and around the dam. His works include the monument of dedication plaza, a plaque to memorialize the workers killed and the bas-reliefs on the elevator towers. In his words, Hansen wanted his work to express \\"the immutable calm of intellectual resolution, and the enormous power of trained physical strength, equally enthroned in placid triumph of scientific accomplishment\\", because \\"[t]he building of Hoover Dam belongs to the sagas of the daring.\\"[70] Hansen's dedication plaza, on the Nevada abutment, contains a sculpture of two winged figures flanking a flagpole.\\r\\nSurrounding the base of the monument is a terrazzo floor embedded with a \\"star map\\". The map depicts the Northern Hemisphere sky at the moment of President Roosevelt's dedication of the dam. This is intended to help future astronomers, if necessary, calculate the exact date of dedication.[70][86] The 30-foot-high (9.1?m) bronze figures, dubbed \\"Winged Figures of the Republic\\", were each formed in a continuous pour. To put such large bronzes into place without marring the highly polished bronze surface, they were placed on ice and guided into position as the ice melted.[87] Hansen's bas-relief on the Nevada elevator tower depicts the benefits of the dam: flood control, navigation, irrigation, water storage, and power. The bas-relief on the Arizona elevator depicts, in his words, \\"the visages of those Indian tribes who have inhabited mountains and plains from ages distant.\\"[70]\\r\\nExcavation for the powerhouse was carried out simultaneously with the excavation for the dam foundation and abutments. A U-shaped structure located at the downstream toe of the dam, its excavation was completed in late 1933 with the first concrete placed in November 1933. Filling of Lake Mead began February 1, 1935, even before the last of the concrete was poured that May.[88] The powerhouse was one of the projects uncompleted at the time of the formal dedication on September 30, 1935a crew of 500?men remained to finish it and other structures.[89] To make the powerhouse roof bombproof, it was constructed of layers of concrete, rock, and steel with a total thickness of about 3.5 feet (1.1?m), topped with layers of sand and tar.[90]\\r\\nIn the latter half of 1936, water levels in Lake Mead were high enough to permit power generation, and the first three Allis Chalmers built Francis turbine-generators, all on the Nevada side, began operating. In March 1937, one more Nevada generator went online and the first Arizona generator by August. By September 1939, four more generators were operating, and the dam's power plant became the largest hydroelectricity facility in the world. The final generator was not placed in service until 1961, bringing the maximum generating capacity to 1,345 megawatts at the time.[88][91] Original plans called for 16?large generators, eight on each side of the river, but two smaller generators were installed instead of one large one on the Arizona side for a total of 17. The smaller generators were used to serve smaller communities at a time when the output of each generator was dedicated to a single municipality, before the dam's total power output was placed on the grid and made arbitrarily distributable.[3] The present contracts for the sale of electricity expire in 2017.[92]\\r\\nBefore water from Lake Mead reaches the turbines, it enters the intake towers and then four gradually narrowing penstocks which funnel the water down towards the powerhouse. The intakes provide a maximum hydraulic head (water pressure) of 590?ft (180?m) as the water reaches a speed of about 85?mph (140?km/h). The entire flow of the Colorado River passes through the turbines. The spillways and outlet works (jet-flow gates) are rarely used.[3] The jet-flow gates, located in concrete structures 180 feet (55?m) above the river, and also at the outlets of the inner diversion tunnels at river level, may be used to divert water around the dam in emergency or flood conditions, but have never done so, and in practice are only used to drain water from the penstocks for maintenance.[93] Following an uprating project from 1986 to 1993, the total gross power rating for the plant, including two 2.4 megawatt Pelton turbine-generators that power Hoover Dam's own operations is a maximum capacity of 2080 megawatts.[3] The annual generation of Hoover Dam varies. The maximum net generation was 10.348 TWh in 1984, and the minimum since 1940 was 2.648 TWh in 1956.[3] The average power generated was 4.2 TWh/year for 1947ÿ2008.[3] In 2015, the dam generated 3.6 TWh.[94]\\r\\nThe amount of electricity generated by Hoover Dam has been decreasing along with the falling water level in Lake Mead due to the prolonged drought in the 2010s and high demand for the Colorado River's water. Lake Mead fell to a new record low elevation of 1,071.61 feet (326.63?m) on July 1, 2016 before beginning to rebound slowly.[95] Under its original design, the dam will no longer be able to generate power once the water level falls below 1,050 feet (320?m), which could occur as early as 2017. To lower the minimum power pool elevation from 1,050 to 950 feet (320 to 290?m), five wide-head turbines, designed to work efficiently with less flow, are being installed and will be fully online by 2017.[96] Due to the low water levels, by 2014 it was providing power only during periods of peak demand.[97]\\r\\nControl of water was the primary concern in the building of the dam. Power generation has allowed the dam project to be self-sustaining: proceeds from the sale of power repaid the 50-year construction loan, and those revenues also finance the multimillion-dollar yearly maintenance budget. Power is generated in step with and only with the release of water in response to downstream water demands.[92]\\r\\nLake Mead and downstream releases from the dam also provide water for both municipal and irrigation uses. Water released from the Hoover Dam eventually reaches several canals. The Colorado River Aqueduct and Central Arizona Project branch off Lake Havasu while the All-American Canal is supplied by the Imperial Dam. In total, water from the Lake Mead serves 18 million people in Arizona, Nevada and California and supplies the irrigation of over 1,000,000 acres (400,000?ha) of land.[92][98]\\r\\nElectricity from the dam's powerhouse was originally sold pursuant to a fifty-year contract, authorized by Congress in 1934, which ran from 1937 to 1987. In 1984, Congress passed a new statute which set power allocations from the dam from 1987 to 2017.[99] The powerhouse was run under the original authorization by the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power and Southern California Edison; in 1987, the Bureau of Reclamation assumed control.[100] In 2011, Congress enacted legislation extending the current contracts until 2067, after setting aside 5% of Hoover Dam's power for sale to Native American tribes, electric cooperatives, and other entities. The new arrangement began on October 1, 2017.[99]\\r\\nThe Bureau of Reclamation reports that the energy generated under the contracts ending in 2017 was allocated as follows:[3]\\r\\nTourists gather around one of the generators in the Nevada wing of the powerhouse to hear its operation explained, September 1940\\r\\nA worker stands by the 30?ft (9.1?m) diameter Nevada penstock before its junction with another penstock that delivers water to a turbine\\r\\nThe dam is protected against over-topping by two spillways. The spillway entrances are located behind each dam abutment, running roughly parallel to the canyon walls. The spillway entrance arrangement forms a classic side-flow weir with each spillway containing four 100-foot-long (30?m) and 16-foot-wide (4.9?m) steel-drum gates. Each gate weighs 5,000,000 pounds (2,300,000 kilograms) and can be operated manually or automatically. Gates are raised and lowered depending on water levels in the reservoir and flood conditions. The gates could not entirely prevent water from entering the spillways but could maintain an extra 16?ft (4.9?m) of lake level.[101] Water flowing over the spillways falls dramatically into 600-foot-long (180?m), 50-foot-wide (15?m) spillway tunnels before connecting to the outer diversion tunnels, and reentering the main river channel below the dam. This complex spillway entrance arrangement combined with the approximate 700-foot (210?m) elevation drop from the top of the reservoir to the river below was a difficult engineering problem and posed numerous design challenges. Each spillway's capacity of 200,000?cu?ft/s (5,700?m3/s) was empirically verified in post-construction tests in 1941.[101]\\r\\nThe large spillway tunnels have only been used twice, for testing in 1941 and because of flooding in 1983. During both times, when inspecting the tunnels after the spillways were used, engineers found major damage to the concrete linings and underlying rock.[102] The 1941 damage was attributed to a slight misalignment of the tunnel invert (or base), which caused cavitation, a phenomenon in fast-flowing liquids in which vapor bubbles collapse with explosive force. In response to this finding, the tunnels were patched with special heavy-duty concrete and the surface of the concrete was polished mirror-smooth.[103] The spillways were modified in 1947 by adding flip buckets, which both slow the water and decrease the spillway's effective capacity, in an attempt to eliminate conditions thought to have contributed to the 1941 damage. The 1983 damage, also due to cavitation, led to the installation of aerators in the spillways.[102] Tests at Grand Coulee Dam showed that the technique worked, in principle.[103]\\r\\nThere are two lanes for automobile traffic across the top of the dam, which formerly served as the Colorado River crossing for U.S. Route 93.[104] In the wake of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, authorities expressed security concerns and the Hoover Dam Bypass project was expedited. Pending the completion of the bypass, restricted traffic was permitted over Hoover Dam. Some types of vehicles were inspected prior to crossing the dam while semi-trailer trucks, buses carrying luggage, and enclosed-box trucks over 40?ft (12?m) long were not allowed on the dam at all, and were diverted to U.S. Route 95 or Nevada State Routes 163/68.[105] The four-lane Hoover Dam Bypass opened on October 19, 2010.[106] It includes a composite steel and concrete arch bridge, the Mike O'CallaghanÿPat Tillman Memorial Bridge, 1,500?ft (460?m) downstream from the dam. With the opening of the bypass, through traffic is no longer allowed across Hoover Dam; dam visitors are allowed to use the existing roadway to approach from the Nevada side and cross to parking lots and other facilities on the Arizona side.[107]\\r\\nHoover Dam opened for tours in 1937 after its completion, but following Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, it was closed to the public when the United States entered World War II, during which only authorized traffic, in convoys, was permitted. After the war, it reopened September 2, 1945, and by 1953, annual attendance had risen to 448,081. The dam closed on November 25, 1963 and March 31, 1969, days of mourning in remembrance of Presidents Kennedy and Eisenhower. In 1995, a new visitors' center was built, and the following year, visits exceeded one million for the first time. The dam closed again to the public on September 11, 2001; modified tours were resumed in December and a new \\"Discovery Tour\\" was added the following year.[100] Today, nearly a million people per year take the tours of the dam offered by the Bureau of Reclamation.[108] Increased security concerns by the government have led to most of the interior structure being inaccessible to tourists. As a result, few of True's decorations can now be seen by visitors.[109]\\r\\nThe changes in water flow and use caused by Hoover Dam's construction and operation have had a large impact on the Colorado River Delta.[110] The construction of the dam has been implicated in causing the decline of this estuarine ecosystem.[110] For six years after the construction of the dam, while Lake Mead filled, virtually no water reached the mouth of the river.[111] The delta's estuary, which once had a freshwater-saltwater mixing zone stretching 40 miles (64?km) south of the river's mouth, was turned into an inverse estuary where the level of salinity was higher close to the river's mouth.[112]\\r\\nThe Colorado River had experienced natural flooding before the construction of the Hoover Dam. The dam eliminated the natural flooding, which threatened many species adapted to the flooding, including both plants and animals.[113] The construction of the dam devastated the populations of native fish in the river downstream from the dam.[114] Four species of fish native to the Colorado River, the Bonytail chub, Colorado pikeminnow, Humpback chub, and Razorback sucker, are listed as endangered.[115][116]\\r\\nDuring the years of lobbying leading up to the passage of legislation authorizing the dam in 1928, the press generally referred to the dam as \\"Boulder Dam\\" or as \\"Boulder Canyon Dam\\", even though the proposed site had shifted to Black Canyon.[16] The Boulder Canyon Project Act of 1928 (BCPA) never mentioned a proposed name or title for the dam. The BCPA merely allows the government to \\"construct, operate, and maintain a dam and incidental works in the main stream of the Colorado River at Black Canyon or Boulder Canyon\\".[117]\\r\\nWhen Secretary Wilbur spoke at the ceremony starting the building of the railway between Las Vegas and the dam site on September 17, 1930, he named the dam \\"Hoover Dam\\", citing a tradition of naming dams after Presidents, though none had been so honored during their terms of office. Wilbur justified his choice on the ground that Hoover was \\"the great engineer whose vision and persistence?... has done so much to make [the dam] possible\\".[118] One writer complained in response that \\"the Great Engineer had quickly drained, ditched, and dammed the country.\\"[118]\\r\\nAfter Hoover's election defeat in 1932 and the accession of the Roosevelt administration, Secretary Ickes ordered on May 13, 1933, that the dam be referred to as \\"Boulder Dam\\". Ickes stated that Wilbur had been imprudent in naming the dam after a sitting president, that Congress had never ratified his choice, and that it had long been referred to as Boulder Dam.[118] Unknown to the general public, Attorney General Homer Cummings informed Ickes that Congress had indeed used the name \\"Hoover Dam\\" in five different bills appropriating money for construction of the dam.[119] The official status this conferred to the name \\"Hoover Dam\\" had been noted on the floor of the House of Representatives by Congressman Edward T. Taylor of Colorado on December 12, 1930,[120] but was likewise ignored by Ickes.\\r\\nWhen Ickes spoke at the dedication ceremony on September 30, 1935, he was determined, as he recorded in his diary, \\"to try to nail down for good and all the name Boulder Dam.\\"[68] At one point in the speech, he spoke the words \\"Boulder Dam\\" five times within thirty seconds.[121] Further, he suggested that if the dam were to be named after any one person, it should be for California Senator Hiram Johnson, a lead sponsor of the authorizing legislation.[68] Roosevelt also referred to the dam as Boulder Dam,[89] and the Republican-leaning Los Angeles Times, which at the time of Ickes' name change had run an editorial cartoon showing Ickes ineffectively chipping away at an enormous sign \\"HOOVER DAM,\\" reran it showing Roosevelt reinforcing Ickes, but having no greater success.[122]\\r\\nIn the following years, the name \\"Boulder Dam\\" failed to fully take hold, with many Americans using both names interchangeably and mapmakers divided as to which name should be printed. Memories of the Great Depression faded, and Hoover to some extent rehabilitated himself through good works during and after World War II. In 1947, a bill passed both Houses of Congress unanimously restoring the name \\"Hoover Dam.\\" Ickes, who was by then a private citizen, opposed the change, stating, \\"I didn't know Hoover was that small a man to take credit for something he had nothing to do with.\\"[123]\\r\\nHoover Dam was recognized as a National Civil Engineering Landmark in 1984.[124] It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1981, and was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1985, cited for its engineering innovations.[5]\\r\\nOther sources","input":"Who was president when the hoover dam was built?"},{"output":"Daniel Coulter  Reynolds","context":"Daniel Coulter  Reynolds (born July 14, 1987)[4] is an American singer, songwriter, multi-instrumentalist, and record producer. He is the lead vocalist and only remaining original member of the alt-rock band Imagine Dragons.

When he was 19 years old, he volunteered full-time as a missionary in Nebraska for two years.[13][14][15][16] Reynolds wrote the song \\"I Bet My Life\\" celebrating and reflecting on his enduring relationship with his parents.[17]  Following his graduation from Bonanza High School, he attended University of Nevada, Las Vegas (after losing his ecclesiastical endorsement for Brigham Young University) and then transferred to BYU after serving an LDS mission, where he studied communications, marketing, and music and excelled academically.[18][19] While at BYU, he formed Imagine Dragons and won the school's battle of the bands competition before leaving to pursue music full-time.[20]\\r\\n\\r\\nReynolds was initially reluctant to become a professional musician, partially because future bandmate Wayne Sermon had once told him: \\"Don't do music because you want to do music - do music if you have to do music\\".[21] After he began attending Brigham Young University, Reynolds found that he could not \\"do anything else\\" and committed fully to a professional music career. In Utah, Reynolds met and recruited drummer Andrew Tolman to form Imagine Dragons.[22] With Reynolds as lead vocalist, Imagine Dragons won BYU's \\"Battle of the Bands\\" and other local competitions.[23] Bassist Ben McKee joined the band in Las Vegas and after Tolman's departure 2011 invited Daniel Platzman, also a friend of Wayne's from Berklee College of Music, to play drums, thus completing the group's current lineup. The band relocated to Las Vegas, where they began performing almost nightly as a lounge act.[13][24][25] It was there in 2010 that they caught their first big break when Train's frontman fell sick just prior to the Bite of Las Vegas Festival. Imagine Dragons were called to fill in for them and performed in front of a crowd of more than 26,000 people.[26] In November 2011, they signed with Interscope Records and began working with Grammy award-winning producer Alex da Kid.[27]\\r\\n\\r\\nImagine Dragons released their debut studio album Night Visions on September 4, 2012.

A chronic sleep-restricted state can cause fatigue, daytime sleepiness, clumsiness and weight loss or weight gain.[1] It adversely affects the brain and cognitive function.[2] However, in a subset of cases sleep deprivation can, paradoxically, lead to increased energy and alertness and enhanced mood; it has even been used as a treatment for depression (see below).[3][4]\\r\\nFew studies have compared the effects of acute total sleep deprivation and chronic partial sleep restriction.[2] Complete absence of sleep over long periods has not been seen in humans (unless they suffer from fatal familial insomnia); it appears that brief microsleeps cannot be avoided.[5] Long-term total sleep deprivation has caused death in lab animals.[6]\\r\\nGenerally, sleep deprivation may result in:[7][8]\\r\\nIt has been suggested that people experiencing short-term sleep restrictions process glucose more slowly than individuals receiving a full 8 hours of sleep, increasing the likelihood of developing type 2 diabetes.[20] In 2005, a study of over 1400 participants showed that participants who habitually slept few hours were more likely to have associations with type 2 diabetes.[21] However, because this study was merely correlational, the direction of cause and effect between little sleep and diabetes is uncertain. The authors point to an earlier study which showed that experimental rather than habitual restriction of sleep resulted in impaired glucose tolerance (IGT).[22] Sleep deprivation can cause insulin resistance in the body, triggering the onset of early diabetes.[23]\\r\\nSleep deprivation can adversely affect the brain and cognitive function.[24] A 2000 study, by the UCSD School of Medicine and the Veterans Affairs Healthcare System in San Diego, used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) technology to monitor activity in the brains of sleep-deprived subjects performing simple verbal learning tasks.[25] The study showed that regions of the brain's prefrontal cortex, an area that supports mental faculties such as working memory and logical and practical (\\"means-ends\\") reasoning, displayed more activity in sleepier subjects. Researchers interpreted this result as indicating that the brain of the average sleep-deprived subject had to work harder than that of the average non-sleep-deprived subject to accomplish a given task. They therefore concluded that the brains of sleep-deprived subjects were attempting to compensate for adverse effects caused by sleep deprivation.\\r\\nThe temporal lobe, a brain region involved in language processing, was activated during verbal learning in rested subjects but not in sleep-deprived subjects. The parietal lobe, not activated in rested subjects during the verbal exercise, was more active when the subjects were deprived of sleep. Getting less than the required number of hours needed to function leads to a decline in memory and judgement, this change in brain chemicals Often leads to depression.[26]Although memory performance was less efficient with sleep deprivation, greater activity in the parietal region was associated with better short term memory.[27]\\r\\nA 2001 study at the Chicago Medical Institute suggested that sleep deprivation may be linked to serious diseases, such as heart disease and mental illness including psychosis and bipolar disorder.[28] The link between sleep deprivation and psychosis was further documented in 2007 through a study at Harvard Medical School and the University of California at Berkeley. The study revealed, using MRI scans, that sleep deprivation causes the brain to become incapable of putting an emotional event into the proper perspective and incapable of making a controlled, suitable response to the event.[29]\\r\\nThe negative effects of sleep deprivation on alertness and cognitive performance suggest decreases in brain activity and function, primarily in the thalamus, a structure involved in alertness and attention, and in the prefrontal cortex, a region sub-serving alertness, attention, and higher-order cognitive processes.[30] This was the finding of an American study in 2000. Seventeen men in their 20s were tested. Sleep deprivation was progressive with measurements of glucose (absolute regional CMRglu), cognitive performance, alertness, mood, and subjective experiences collected after 0, 24, 48, and 72 h of sleep deprivation. Additional measures of alertness, cognitive performance, and mood were collected at fixed intervals. PET scans were used and attention was paid to the circadian rhythm of cognitive performance.[30]\\r\\nA noted 2002 University of California animal study indicated that non-rapid eye movement sleep (NREM) is necessary for turning off neurotransmitters and allowing their receptors to \\"rest\\" and regain sensitivity which allows monoamines (norepinephrine, serotonin and histamine) to be effective at naturally produced levels. This leads to improved regulation of mood and increased learning ability. The study also found that rapid eye movement sleep (REM) deprivation may alleviate clinical depression because it mimics selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). This is because the natural decrease in monoamines during REM is not allowed to occur, which causes the concentration of neurotransmitters in the brain, that are depleted in clinically depressed persons, to increase. Sleep outside of the REM phase may allow enzymes to repair brain cell damage caused by free radicals. High metabolic activity while awake damages the enzymes themselves preventing efficient repair. This study observed the first evidence of brain damage in rats as a direct result of sleep deprivation.[31]\\r\\nAnimal studies suggest that sleep deprivation increases stress hormones, which may reduce new cell production in adult brains.[32]\\r\\nA 1999 study[33] found that sleep deprivation resulted in reduced cortisol secretion the next day, driven by increased subsequent slow-wave sleep. Sleep deprivation was found to enhance activity on the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (which controls reactions to stress and regulates body functions such as digestion, the immune system, mood, sex, or energy usage) while suppressing growth hormones. The results supported previous studies, which observed adrenal insufficiency in idiopathic hypersomnia.\\r\\nA study conducted in 2005 showed that a group of rats, which were deprived of REM sleep for five days, experienced no significant changes in their ability to heal wounds, compared to a group of rats not deprived of \\"dream\\" sleep.[34] The rats were allowed deep (NREM) sleep. However, another study conducted by Gumustekin et al.[35] in 2004 showed sleep deprivation hindering the healing of burns on rats.\\r\\nAmong the possible physical consequences of sleep deprivation, deficits in attention and working memory are perhaps the most important;[2] such lapses in mundane routines can lead to unfortunate results, from forgetting ingredients while cooking to missing a sentence while taking notes. Performing tasks that require attention appears to be correlated with number of hours of sleep received each night, declining as function of hours of sleep deprivation.[36] Working memory is tested by such methods as choice-reaction time tasks.[2]\\r\\nThe attentional lapses also extend into more critical domains in which the consequences can be life-or-death; car crashes and industrial disasters can result from inattentiveness attributable to sleep deprivation. To empirically measure the magnitude of attention deficits, researchers typically employ the psychomotor vigilance task (PVT) which requires the subject to press a button in response to a light at random intervals. Failure to press the button in response to the stimulus (light) is recorded as an error, attributable to the microsleeps that occur as a product of sleep deprivation.\\r\\nCrucially, individuals' subjective evaluations of their fatigue often do not predict actual performance on the PVT. While totally sleep-deprived individuals are usually aware of the degree of their impairment, lapses from chronic (lesser) sleep deprivation can build up over time so that they are equal in number and severity to the lapses occurring from total (acute) sleep deprivation. Chronically sleep-deprived people, however, continue to rate themselves considerably less impaired than totally sleep-deprived participants.[37] Since people usually evaluate their capability on tasks like driving subjectively, their evaluations may lead them to the false conclusion that they can perform tasks that require constant attention when their abilities are in fact impaired.\\r\\nThe dangers of sleep deprivation are apparent on the road; the American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) reports that one in every five serious motor vehicle injuries is related to driver fatigue, with 80,000 drivers falling asleep behind the wheel every day and 250,000 accidents every year related to sleep,[38] though the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration suggests the figure for traffic accidents may be closer to 100,000.[39] The AASM recommends pulling off the road and taking a 15- or 20-minute nap to alleviate drowsiness.[38]\\r\\nAccording to a 2000 study published in the British Medical Journal, researchers in Australia and New Zealand reported that sleep deprivation can have some of the same hazardous effects as being drunk.[40] People who drove after being awake for 17ÿ19 hours performed worse than those with a blood alcohol level of 0.05 percent, which is the legal limit for drunk driving in most western European countries and Australia. Another study suggested that performance begins to degrade after 16 hours awake, and 21 hours awake was equivalent to a blood alcohol content of 0.08 percent, which is the blood alcohol limit for drunk driving in Canada, the U.S., and the U.K.[41]\\r\\nFatigue of drivers of goods trucks and passenger vehicles have come to the attention of authorities in many countries, where specific laws have been introduced with the aim of reducing the risk of traffic accidents due to driver fatigue. Rules concerning minimum break lengths, maximum shift lengths and minimum time between shifts are common in the driving regulations used in different countries and regions, such as the drivers' working hours regulations in the European Union and hours of service regulations in the United States.\\r\\nIn addition, as a result of continuous muscular activity without proper rest time, effects such as cramping are much more frequent in sleep-deprived individuals. Extreme cases of sleep deprivation have been reported to be associated with hernias, muscle fascia tears, and other such problems commonly associated with physical overexertion.\\r\\nA 2006 study has shown that while total sleep deprivation for one night caused many errors, the errors were not significant until after the second night of total sleep deprivation.[42] However, combining alcohol with acute sleep deprivation results in a trebled rate of driving off the road when using a simulator.[43]\\r\\nThe National Sleep Foundation identifies several warning signs that a driver is dangerously fatigued, including rolling down the window, turning up the radio, trouble keeping eyes open, head-nodding, drifting out of their lane, and daydreaming. At particular risk are lone drivers between midnight and 6:00am.[44]\\r\\nSleep deprivation can negatively impact performance in professional fields as well, potentially jeopardizing lives. Due largely to the February 2009 crash of Colgan Air Flight 3407, which killed 50 people and was partially attributed to pilot fatigue, the FAA reviewed its procedures to ensure that pilots are sufficiently rested. Air traffic controllers were under scrutiny when in 2010 there were 10 incidents of controllers falling asleep while on shift. The common practice of turn-around shifts caused sleep deprivation and was a contributing factor to all air traffic control incidents. The FAA reviewed its practices of shift changes and the findings saw that controllers were not well rested.[45] A 2004 study also found medical residents with less than four hours of sleep a night made more than twice as many errors as the 11% of surveyed residents who slept for more than seven hours a night.[46]\\r\\n\\r\\nTwenty-four hours of continuous sleep deprivation results in the choice of less difficult math tasks without decreases in subjective reports of effort applied to the task. Naturally caused sleep loss affects the choice of everyday tasks such that low effort tasks are mostly commonly selected. Adolescents who experience less sleep show a decreased willingness to engage in sports activities that require effort through fine motor coordination and attention to detail.[47][48]\\r\\nGreat sleep deprivation mimics psychosis: distorted perceptions can lead to inappropriate emotional and behavioral responses.[49]\\r\\nAstronauts have reported performance errors and decreased cognitive ability during periods of extended working hours and wakefulness as well as due to sleep loss caused by circadian rhythm disruption and environmental factors.[50]\\r\\nMicrosleeps occur when a person has a significant sleep deprivation. Microsleeps usually last for a few seconds and happen most frequently when a person is trying to stay awake when they are feeling sleepy.[51] The person usually falls into microsleep while doing a monotonous task like driving, reading a book, or staring at a computer.[52] Microsleeps are similar to blackouts and a person experiencing them is not consciously aware that they are occurring.\\r\\nAn even lighter type of sleep has been seen in rats that have been kept awake for long periods of time. In a process known as local sleep, specific localized brain regions went into periods of short (~80 ms) but frequent (~40/min) NREM-like states. Despite the on and off periods where neurons shut off, the rats appeared to be awake, although they performed poorly at tests.[53]\\r\\nIn rats, prolonged, complete sleep deprivation increased both food intake and energy expenditure with a net effect of weight loss and ultimately death.[54] This study hypothesizes that the moderate chronic sleep debt associated with habitual short sleep is associated with increased appetite and energy expenditure with the equation tipped towards food intake rather than expenditure in societies where high-calorie food is freely available.[1]\\r\\nSeveral large studies using nationally representative samples suggest that one of the causes of high obesity rates in the United States might be a corresponding decrease in the average number of hours that people are sleeping.[55][56][57] The findings suggest that this might be happening because sleep deprivation could be disrupting hormones that regulate glucose metabolism and appetite.[58]\\r\\nThe association between sleep deprivation and obesity appears to be strongest in young and middle-age adults. Other scientists hold that the physical discomfort of obesity and related problems, such as sleep apnea, reduce an individual's chances of getting a good night's sleep.\\r\\nSleep loss is currently[timeframe?] proposed[by whom?] to disturb endocrine regulation of energy homeostasis leading to weight gain and obesity. For instance, laboratory sleep deprivation studies in young men have demonstrated that one night of wakefulness (typically found in shift workers) exerts significant effects on the energy balance the next morning, including reduced energy expenditure,[59] enhanced hedonic stimulus processing in the brain underlying the drive to consume food,[60] and overeating that goes beyond satiety.[61] Further recent studies have shown that a reduction of sleep duration to four hours for two consecutive nights has been shown to decrease circulating leptin levels and to increase ghrelin levels, as well as self-reported hunger. Similar endocrine alterations have been shown to occur even after a single night of sleep restriction.\\r\\nIn a balanced order, nine healthy normal-weight men spent three nights in a sleep laboratory separated by at least two weeks: one night with a total sleep time of seven hours, one night with a total sleep time of 4.5 hours, and one night with total sleep deprivation (SD). On a standard symptom-rating scale, subjects rated markedly stronger feelings of hunger after total SD than after seven hours of sleep (3.9 I 0.7 versus 1.7 I 0.3; P = 0.020) or 4.5 hours sleep (2.2 I 0.5; P = 0.041). Plasma ghrelin levels were 22 I 10% higher after total SD than after seven hours of sleep (0.85 I 0.06 versus 0.72 I 0.04?ng mL(?1); P = 0.048) with intermediate levels of the hormone after 4.5 hours sleep (0.77 I 0.04?ng mL(?1)). Feelings of hunger as well as plasma ghrelin levels are already elevated after one night of SD, whereas morning serum leptin concentrations remain unaffected. Thus, the results provide further evidence for a disturbing influence of sleep loss on endocrine regulation of energy homeostasis, which in the long run may result in weight gain and obesity.[62]\\r\\nIn science, sleep deprivation (of rodents, e.g.) is used in order to study the function(s) of sleep and the biological mechanisms underlying the effects of sleep deprivation.\\r\\nSome sleep deprivation techniques are:\\r\\nSleep deprivation can be used as a means of interrogation, which has resulted in court trials over whether or not the technique is a form of torture.[69]\\r\\nUnder one interrogation technique, a subject might be kept awake for several days and when finally allowed to fall asleep, suddenly awakened and questioned. Menachem Begin, the Prime Minister of Israel from 1977 to 1983, described his experience of sleep deprivation as a prisoner of the NKVD in Russia as follows:\\r\\nIn the head of the interrogated prisoner, a haze begins to form. His spirit is wearied to death, his legs are unsteady, and he has one sole desire: to sleep... Anyone who has experienced this desire knows that not even hunger and thirst are comparable with it.[70]\\r\\nSleep deprivation was one of the five techniques used by the British government in the 1970s. The European Court of Human Rights ruled that the five techniques \\"did not occasion suffering of the particular intensity and cruelty implied by the word torture ... [but] amounted to a practice of inhuman and degrading treatment\\", in breach of the European Convention on Human Rights.[71]\\r\\nThe United States Justice Department released four memos in August 2002 describing interrogation techniques used by the Central Intelligence Agency. They first described 10 techniques used in the interrogations of Abu Zubaydah, described as a terrorist logistics specialist, including sleep deprivation. Memos from May 2005 introduced four more techniques and claimed that the combination of interrogation methods did not constitute torture under United States law.[72]\\r\\nThe question of extreme use of sleep deprivation as torture has advocates on both sides of the issue. In 2006, Australian Federal Attorney-General Philip Ruddock argued that sleep deprivation does not constitute torture.[73] Nicole Bieske, a spokeswoman for Amnesty International Australia, has stated the opinion of her organization thus: \\"At the very least, sleep deprivation is cruel, inhumane and degrading. If used for prolonged periods of time it is torture.\\"[74]\\r\\nStudies show that sleep restriction has some potential in the treatment of depression.[4] Those who suffer from depression tend to have earlier occurrences of REM sleep with an increased number of rapid eye movements; therefore, monitoring patients' EEG and awakening them during occurrences of REM sleep appears to have a therapeutic effect, alleviating depressive symptoms.[75] As many as 60% of patients, when sleep-deprived, show immediate recovery, although most relapse the following night. The effect has been shown to be linked to increases in the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF).[76] It has been shown that chronotype is related to the effect of sleep deprivation on mood in normal people: those with morningness preference become more depressed following sleep deprivation while those with eveningness preference show an improvement in mood.[77] A comprehensive evaluation of the human metabolome in sleep deprivation in 2014 found that 27 metabolites are increased after 24 waking hours and suggested serotonin, tryptophan, and taurine may contribute to the antidepressive effect.[78]\\r\\nThe incidence of relapse can be decreased by combining sleep deprivation with medication.[79] Many tricyclic antidepressants suppress REM sleep, providing additional evidence for a link between mood and sleep.[80] Similarly, tranylcypromine has been shown to completely suppress REM sleep at adequate doses.\\r\\nSome common sleep disorders have been shown to respond to cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia. This involves a controlled regime of \\"sleep restriction\\" in order to restore the homeostatic drive to sleep and encourage normal \\"sleep efficiency\\".[81]\\r\\nInsomnia, one of the six types of dyssomnia, affects 21%-37% of the adult population.[82][83] Many of its symptoms are easily recognizable, including excessive daytime sleepiness; frustration or worry about sleep; problems with attention, concentration, or memory; extreme mood changes or irritability; lack of energy or motivation; poor performance at school or work; and tension headaches or stomach aches.\\r\\nInsomnia can be grouped into primary and secondary, or comorbid, insomnia.[84][85][86]\\r\\nPrimary insomnia is a sleep disorder not attributable to a medical, psychiatric, or environmental cause.[87] There are three main types of primary insomnia. These include: psychophysiological, idiopathic insomnia, and sleep state misperception (paradoxical insomnia).[84] Psychophysiological insomnia is anxiety-induced. Idiopathic insomnia generally begins in childhood and lasts the rest of a persons life. Its suggested that idiopathic insomnia is a neurochemical problem in a part of the brain that controls the sleep-wake cycle, resulting in either under-active sleep signals or over-active wake signals.[88] Sleep state misperception is diagnosed when people get enough sleep but inaccurately perceive that their sleep is insufficient.\\r\\nSecondary insomnia, or comorbid insomnia, occurs concurrently with other medical, neurological, psychological and psychiatric conditions. Causation is not necessarily implied.[89]\\r\\nSleep deprivation can sometimes be self-imposed due to a lack of desire to sleep or the habitual use of stimulant drugs. Sleep deprivation is also self-imposed to achieve personal fame in the context of record-breaking stunts.\\r\\nSleep apnea (obstructive sleep apnea, OSA) is a collapse of the upper airway during sleep, which reduces airflow to the lungs. It has many serious health outcomes if untreated, but can very often be effectively treated with positive air pressure therapy. Nasal problems such as a deviated septum will shut down the airway and increase swelling in the mucus lining and nasal turbinates. Corrective surgery (septoplasty) will maximise the airflow and correct the feedback loop to the brain which keeps awakening the sufferer so as not to asphyxiate.\\r\\nCentral sleep apnea is repeated stops in breathing during sleep when the brain temporarily stops sending signals to the muscles that control breathing.\\r\\nThe specific causal relationships between sleep loss and effects on psychiatric disorders have been most extensively studied in patients with mood disorders. Shifts into mania in bipolar patients are often preceded by periods of insomnia, and sleep deprivation has been shown to induce a manic state in susceptible individuals. Sleep deprivation may represent a final common pathway in the genesis of mania,[90] and sleep loss is both a precipitating and reinforcing factor for the manic state.\\r\\nThe National Sleep Foundation cites a 1996 paper showing that college/university-aged students got an average of less than 6 hours of sleep each night.[91]\\r\\nIn the study, 70.6% of students reported obtaining less than 8 hours of sleep, and up to 27% of students may be at risk for at least one sleep disorder.[92] Sleep deprivation is common in first year college students as they adjust to the stress and social activities of college life.\\r\\nA study performed by the Department of Psychology at the National Chung Cheng University in Taiwan concluded that freshmen received the least amount of sleep during the week.[93]\\r\\nIn 1997, University of Minnesota research compared students who started school at 7:15?am with those who started at 8:40?am. They found that students who started at 8:40 got higher grades and more sleep on weekday nights than those who started earlier.[39] One in four U.S. high school students admits to falling asleep in class at least once a week.[94]\\r\\nIt is known that during human adolescence, circadian rhythms and therefore sleep patterns typically undergo marked changes. Electroencephalogram (EEG) studies indicate a 50% reduction of deep (stage 4) sleep and a 75% reduction in the peak amplitude of delta waves during NREM sleep in adolescence. School schedules are often incompatible with a corresponding delay in sleep offset, leading to a less than optimal amount of sleep for the majority of adolescents.[95]\\r\\nSeveral strategies are common in attempting to increase alertness and counteract the effects of sleep deprivation. Caffeine is often used over short periods to boost wakefulness when acute sleep deprivation is experienced; however, caffeine is less effective if taken routinely.[96] Other strategies recommended by the American Academy of Sleep Medicine include prophylactic sleep before deprivation, naps, other stimulants, and combinations thereof. However, the only sure and safe way to combat sleep deprivation is to increase nightly sleep time.[97]\\r\\nRecovery of cognitive function is accomplished more rapidly after acute total sleep deprivation than after chronic partial sleep restriction.[2] Chronic deprivation is the more common in everyday life. Just one night of recovery sleep can reverse adverse effects of total sleep deprivation. Recovery sleep is more efficient than normal sleep with shorter sleep latency and increased amounts of deep and REM sleep.\\r\\nRandy Gardner holds the scientifically documented record for the longest period of time a human being has intentionally gone without sleep not using stimulants of any kind. Gardner stayed awake for 264 hours (11 days), breaking the previous record of 260 hours held by Tom Rounds of Honolulu.[49] LCDR John J. Ross of the U.S. Navy Medical Neuropsychiatric Research Unit later published an account of this event, which became well-known among sleep-deprivation researchers.[49][98][99]\\r\\nThe Guinness World Record stands at 449 hours (18 days, 17 hours), held by Maureen Weston, of Peterborough, Cambridgeshire in April 1977, in a rocking-chair marathon.[98]\\r\\nClaims of total sleep deprivation lasting years have been made several times,[100][101][102] but none are scientifically verified.[103] Claims of partial sleep deprivation are better documented. For example, Rhett Lamb of St. Petersburg, Florida, was initially reported to not sleep at all, but actually had a rare condition permitting him to sleep only one to two hours per day in the first three years of his life. He had a rare abnormality called an Arnold-Chiari malformation where brain tissue protrudes into the spinal canal and the skull puts pressure on the protruding part of the brain. The boy was operated on at All Children's Hospital in St. Petersburg in May 2008. Two days after surgery he slept through the night.[104][105]\\r\\nFrench sleep expert Michel Jouvet and his team reported the case of a patient who was quasi-sleep-deprived for four months, as confirmed by repeated polygraphic recordings showing less than 30 minutes (of stage-1 sleep) per night, a condition they named \\"agrypnia\\". The 27-year-old man was suffering from Morvan's fibrillary chorea, a rare disease that leads to involuntary movements, and in this particular case, extreme insomnia. The researchers found that treatment with 5-HTP restored almost normal sleep stages, however some months after this recovery the patient died during a relapse which was unresponsive to 5-HTP. Despite the extreme insomnia, psychological investigation showed no sign of cognitive deficits, except for some hallucinations.[106]\\r\\nFatal familial insomnia is a neurodegenerative disease eventually resulting in a complete inability to go past stage 1 of NREM sleep. In addition to insomnia, patients may experience panic attacks, paranoia, phobias, hallucinations, rapid weight loss, and dementia. Death usually occurs between 7 and 36 months from onset.","input":"What are the effects of extreme sleep deprivation?"},{"output":"November 25, 2002","context":"The United States Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is a cabinet department of the United States federal government with responsibilities in public security, roughly comparable to the interior or home ministries of other countries.

Its stated goal is to prepare for, prevent, and respond to domestic emergencies, particularly terrorism.[7] On March 1, 2003, DHS absorbed the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) and assumed its duties. In doing so, it divided the enforcement and services functions into two separate and new agencies: Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Citizenship and Immigration Services. The investigative divisions and intelligence gathering units of the INS and Customs Service were merged forming Homeland Security Investigations. Additionally, the border enforcement functions of the INS, including the U.S. Border Patrol, the U.S. Customs Service, and the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service were consolidated into a new agency under DHS: U.S. Customs and Border Protection.

NTAS Bulletins permit the Secretary to communicate critical terrorism information that, while not necessarily indicative of a specific threat against the United States, can reach homeland security partners or the public quickly, thereby allowing recipients to implement necessary protective measures. Alerts are issued when there is specific and credible information of a terrorist threat against the United States. Alerts themselves have two levels: Elevated and Imminent. An Elevated Alert is issued when there is credible information about an attack but only general information about timing or a target. An Imminent Alert is issued when the threat is very specific and impending in the very near term.\\r\\nOn March 12, 2002, the Homeland Security Advisory System, a color-coded terrorism risk advisory scale, was created as the result of a Presidential Directive to provide a \\"comprehensive and effective means to disseminate information regarding the risk of terrorist acts to Federal, State, and local authorities and to the American people.\\" Many procedures at government facilities are tied into the alert level; for example a facility may search all entering vehicles when the alert is above a certain level. Since January 2003, it has been administered in coordination with DHS; it has also been the target of frequent jokes and ridicule on the part of the administration's detractors about its ineffectiveness. After resigning, Tom Ridge stated that he did not always agree with the threat level adjustments pushed by other government agencies.[18]\\r\\nIn January 2003, the office[clarification needed] was merged into the Department of Homeland Security and the White House Homeland Security Council, both of which were created by the Homeland Security Act of 2002. The Homeland Security Council, similar in nature to the National Security Council, retains a policy coordination and advisory role and is led by the Assistant to the President for Homeland Security.[19]\\r\\nAs of January 13, 2011, the DHS advised the American public of an 'elevated national threat' level, recommending that all Americans 'should establish an emergency preparedness kit and emergency plan for themselves and their family, and stay informed about what to do during an emergency'.[20]\\r\\nIn response to the September 11 attacks, President George W. Bush announced the establishment of the Office of Homeland Security (OHS) to coordinate \\"homeland security\\" efforts. The office was headed by former Pennsylvania Governor Tom Ridge, who assumed the title of Assistant to the President for Homeland Security. The official announcement stated:\\r\\nRidge began his duties as OHS director on October 8, 2001.\\r\\nAccording to Peter Andreas, a border theorist, the creation of DHS constituted the most significant government reorganization since the Cold War,[21] and the most substantial reorganization of federal agencies since the National Security Act of 1947, which placed the different military departments under a secretary of defense and created the National Security Council and Central Intelligence Agency. DHS also constitutes the most diverse merger of federal functions and responsibilities, incorporating 22 government agencies into a single organization.[22]\\r\\nThe Department of Homeland Security was established on November 25, 2002, by the Homeland Security Act of 2002. It was intended to consolidate U.S. executive branch organizations related to \\"homeland security\\" into a single Cabinet agency. The following 22 agencies were incorporated into the new department:[23]\\r\\n\\r\\nPrior to the signing of the bill, controversy about its adoption centered on whether the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Central Intelligence Agency should be incorporated in part or in whole (neither were included). The bill was also controversial for the presence of unrelated \\"riders\\", as well as for eliminating certain union-friendly civil service and labor protections for department employees. Without these protections, employees could be expeditiously reassigned or dismissed on grounds of security, incompetence or insubordination, and DHS would not be required to notify their union representatives.\\r\\nThe plan stripped 180,000 government employees of their union rights.[24] In 2002, Bush officials argued that the September 11 attacks made the proposed elimination of employee protections imperative.[25]\\r\\nCongress ultimately passed the Homeland Security Act of 2002 without the union-friendly measures, and President Bush signed the bill into law on November 25, 2002. It was the largest U.S. government reorganization in the 50 years since the United States Department of Defense was created.\\r\\nTom Ridge was named secretary on January 24, 2003 and began naming his chief deputies. DHS officially began operations on January 24, 2003, but most of the department's component agencies were not transferred into the new Department until March 1.[19]\\r\\nAfter establishing the basic structure of DHS and working to integrate its components and get the department functioning, Ridge announced his resignation on November 30, 2004, following the re-election of President Bush. Bush initially nominated former New York City Police Department commissioner Bernard Kerik as his successor, but on December 10, Kerik withdrew his nomination, citing personal reasons and saying it \\"would not be in the best interests\\" of the country for him to pursue the post.\\r\\nOn January 11, 2005, President Bush nominated federal judge Michael Chertoff to succeed Ridge. Chertoff was confirmed on February 15, 2005, by a vote of 98ÿ0 in the U.S. Senate. He was sworn in the same day.[19]\\r\\nIn February 2005, DHS and the Office of Personnel Management issued rules relating to employee pay and discipline for a new personnel system named MaxHR. The Washington Post said that the rules would allow DHS \\"to override any provision in a union contract by issuing a department-wide directive\\" and would make it \\"difficult, if not impossible, for unions to negotiate over arrangements for staffing, deployments, technology and other workplace matters.\\"[25]\\r\\nIn August 2005, U.S. District Judge Rosemary M. Collyer blocked the plan on the grounds that it did not ensure collective-bargaining rights for DHS employees.[25]\\r\\nA federal appeals court ruled against DHS in 2006; pending a final resolution to the litigation, Congress's fiscal year 2008 appropriations bill for DHS provided no funding for the proposed new personnel system.[25] DHS announced in early 2007 that it was retooling its pay and performance system and retiring the name \\"MaxHR\\".[19]\\r\\nIn a February 2008 court filing, DHS said that it would no longer pursue the new rules, and that it would abide by the existing civil service labor-management procedures. A federal court issued an order closing the case.[25]\\r\\nA DHS press release dated June 6, 2003[26] explains the seal as follows:\\r\\nThe seal is symbolic of the Department's mission ÿ to prevent attacks and protect Americans ÿ on the land, in the sea and in the air. In the center of the seal, a graphically styled white American eagle appears in a circular blue field. The eagle's outstretched wings break through an inner red ring into an outer white ring that contains the words \\"U.S. DEPARTMENT OF\\" in the top half and \\"HOMELAND SECURITY\\" in the bottom half in a circular placement. The eagle's wings break through the inner circle into the outer ring to suggest that the Department of Homeland Security will break through traditional bureaucracy and perform government functions differently. In the tradition of the Great Seal of the United States, the eagle's talon on the left holds an olive branch with 13 leaves and 13 seeds while the eagle's talon on the right grasps 13 arrows.\\r\\nCentered on the eagle's breast is a shield divided into three sections containing elements that represent the American homeland ÿ air, land, and sea. The top element, a dark blue sky, contains 22 stars representing the original 22 entities that have come together to form the department. The left shield element contains white mountains behind a green plain underneath a light blue sky. The right shield element contains four wave shapes representing the oceans alternating light and dark blue separated by white lines.\\r\\nThe seal was developed with input from senior DHS leadership, employees, and the U.S. Commission on Fine Arts. The Ad Council ÿ which partners with DHS on its Ready.gov campaign ÿ and the consulting company Landor Associates were responsible for graphic design and maintaining heraldic integrity.\\r\\nSince its inception, the department has had its temporary headquarters in Washington, D.C.'s Nebraska Avenue Complex, a former naval facility. The 38-acre (15?ha) site, across from American University, has 32 buildings comprising 566,000 square feet (52,600?m2) of administrative space.[27] In early 2007, the Department submitted a $4.1 billion plan to Congress to consolidate its 60-plus Washington-area offices into a single headquarters complex at the St. Elizabeths Hospital campus in Anacostia, Southeast Washington, D.C. The earliest DHS would begin moving to St. Elizabeths is 2012.[28]\\r\\nThe move is being championed by District of Columbia officials because of the positive economic impact it will have on historically depressed Anacostia. The move has been criticized by historic preservationists, who claim the revitalization plans will destroy dozens of historic buildings on the campus.[29] Community activists have criticized the plans because the facility will remain walled off and have little interaction with the surrounding area.[30] On January 8, 2009, the National Capital Planning Commission approved the Department of Homeland Security's plans to move into the campus of St. Elizabeths Hospital.[31] In February 2015 the General Services Administration said that the site would open in 2021.[32]\\r\\nDuring a Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee hearing on the reauthorization of DHS, Elaine Duke, deputy secretary of DHS, said there is a weariness and anxiety within DHS about the repeated congressional efforts to agree to a long-term spending plan, which has resulted in several threats to shutdown the federal government. \\"Shutdowns are disruptive,\\" Duke said. She said the \\"repeated failure on a longtime spending plan resulting in short-term continuing resolutions (CRs) has caused angst among the departments 240,000 employees in the weeks leading up to the CRs.\\"[33] The uncertainty about funding hampers DHSs ability to pursue major projects and it takes away attention and manpower from important priorities. Seventy percent of DHS employees are considered essential and are not furloughed during government shutdowns.[33]\\r\\nSoon after the formation of Department of Homeland Security, the department worked with the Ad Council to launch the Ready Campaign, a national public service advertising (PSA) campaign to educate and empower Americans to prepare for and respond to emergencies including natural and man-made disasters. With pro bono creative support from the Martin Agency of Richmond, Virginia, the campaign website \\"Ready.gov\\" and materials were conceived in March 2002 and launched in February 2003, just before the launch of the Iraq War.[34][35][36] One of the first announcements that garnered widespread public attention to this campaign was one by Tom Ridge in which he stated that in the case of a chemical attack, citizens should use duct tape and plastic sheeting to build a homemade bunker, or \\"sheltering in place\\" to protect themselves.[37][38] As a result, the sales of duct tape skyrocketed and DHS was criticized for being too alarmist.[39]\\r\\nOn March 1, 2003, the Federal Emergency Management Agency was absorbed into the DHS, and in fall of 2008, took over coordination of the campaign. The Ready Campaign and its Spanish language version Listo.gov asks individuals to do three things: build an emergency supply kit,[40] make a family emergency plan[41] and be informed about the different types of emergencies that can occur and how to respond.[42] The campaign messages have been promoted through television, radio, print, outdoor and web PSAs,[43] as well as brochures, toll-free phone lines and the English and Spanish language websites Ready.gov and Listo.gov.\\r\\nThe general campaign aims to reach all Americans, but targeted resources are also available via \\"Ready Business\\" for small- to medium-sized business and \\"Ready Kids\\" for parents and teachers of children ages 8ÿ12. In 2015, the campaign also launched a series of PSAs to help the whole community,[44] people with disabilities and others with access and functional needs prepare for emergencies, which included open captioning, a certified deaf interpreter and audio descriptions for viewers who are blind or have low vision.[45]\\r\\nOn March 1, 2004, the National Incident Management System (NIMS) was created. The stated purpose was to provide a consistent incident management approach for federal, state, local, and tribal governments. Under Homeland Security Presidential Directive-5, all federal departments were required to adopt the NIMS and to use it in their individual domestic incident management and emergency prevention, preparedness, response, recovery, and mitigation program and activities.\\r\\nIn December 2004, the National Response Plan (NRP) was created, in an attempt to align federal coordination structures, capabilities, and resources into a unified, all-discipline, and all-hazards approach to domestic incident management. The NRP was built on the template of the NIMS.\\r\\nOn January 22, 2008, the National Response Framework was published in the Federal Register as an updated replacement of the NRP, effective March 22, 2008.\\r\\nThe Post-Katrina Emergency Management Reform Act directs the DHS Secretary to designate employees from throughout the Department to staff a Surge Capacity Force (SCF). During a declared disaster, the DHS Secretary will determine if SCF support is necessary. The Secretary will then authorize FEMA to task and deploy designated personnel from DHS components and other Federal Executive Agencies to respond to extraordinary disasters.[46]\\r\\nThe DHS National Cyber Security Division (NCSD) is responsible for the response system, risk management program, and requirements for cyber-security in the U.S. The division is home to US-CERT operations and the National Cyber Alert System.[47][48] The DHS Science and Technology Directorate helps government and private end-users transition to new cyber-security capabilities. This directorate also funds the Cyber Security Research and Development Center, which identifies and prioritizes research and development for NCSD.[48] The center works on the Internet's routing infrastructure (the SPRI program) and Domain Name System (DNSSEC), identity theft and other online criminal activity (ITTC), Internet traffic and networks research (PREDICT datasets and the DETER testbed), Department of Defense and HSARPA exercises (Livewire and Determined Promise), and wireless security in cooperation with Canada.[49]\\r\\nOn October 30, 2009, DHS opened the National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center. The center brings together government organizations responsible for protecting computer networks and networked infrastructure.[50]\\r\\nIn January 2017, DHS officially designated state-run election systems as critical infrastructure. The designation made it easier for state and local election officials to get cybersecurity help from the federal government. In October 2017, DHS convened a Government Coordinating Council (GCC) for the Election Infrastructure Subsection with representatives from various state and federal agencies such as the Election Assistance Commission and National Association of Secretaries of State.[51]\\r\\nIn the United States Federal Budget for 2010, entitled 'A New Era of Responsibility', the DHS was allocated a discretionary budget of $42.7 billion (financial year 2009: $40.1 billion).[52] The end-of-year DHS Annual Financial Report for financial year 2010 showed a net cost of operations of $56.4 billion (FY 2009, restated: $49.9 billion), out of total budgetary resources of $83.2 billion (FY 2009, restated: $85.2 billion).[53] The components with the highest net cost were US Coast Guard ($12.1 billion), U.S. Customs and Border Protection ($11.6 billion), and Federal Emergency Management Agency ($10.5 billion).[53] Revenues of $10.4 billion were generated in the year (FY 2009, restated: $9.8 billion).[53]\\r\\nAccording to the Washington Post, \\"DHS has given $31 billion in grants since 2003 to state and local governments for homeland security and to improve their ability to find and protect against terrorists, including $3.8 billion in 2010.\\"[54]\\r\\nThe DHS independent auditor is KPMG, one of the Big Four audit firms.[55] Due to the level of material weaknesses identified, KPMG was unable to audit the DHS financial statements for FY 2010.[55] KPMG was unable to express an audit opinion on the FY 2009,[56] FY 2008,[57] FY 2007,[58] FY 2005,[59] and FY 2003[60] financial statements. Attempts to access the reports for FY 2006 and FY 2004 within the 'information for citizens' portal met with a 404 error.[61] The Message from the DHS Chief Financial Officer in the FY 2010 report states 'This Annual Financial Report (AFR) is our principal financial statement of accountability to the President, Congress and the American public. The AFR gives a comprehensive view of the Department's financial activities and demonstrates the Department's stewardship of taxpayer dollars.'[62] The Message from the DHS Chief Financial Officer concludes 'I am extremely proud of the Department's accomplishments ... we will continue to build upon our successes.'[62] The Secretary of Homeland Security endorsed this message saying that the DHS is 'continuing to be responsible stewards of taxpayer resources. The scope of our mission is broad, challenging, and vital to the security of the Nation ... Thank you for your partnership and collaboration. Yours very truly, Janet Napolitano.'[63]\\r\\nThe Department of Homeland Security has received substantial criticism over excessive bureaucracy, waste, fraud, ineffectiveness and lack of transparency. Its information sharing centers have been accused of violating American civil liberties and targeting American citizens as potential threats to national security.\\r\\nThe Department of Homeland Security has been dogged by persistent criticism over excessive bureaucracy, waste, ineffectiveness and lack of transparency. Congress estimates that the department has wasted roughly $15 billion in failed contracts (as of September?2008[update]).[64] In 2003, the department came under fire after the media revealed that Laura Callahan, Deputy Chief Information Officer at DHS with responsibilities for sensitive national security databases, had obtained her bachelor, masters, and doctorate computer science degrees through Hamilton University, a diploma mill in a small town in Wyoming.[65] The department was blamed for up to $2 billion of waste and fraud after audits by the Government Accountability Office revealed widespread misuse of government credit cards by DHS employees, with purchases including beer brewing kits, $70,000 of plastic dog booties that were later deemed unusable, boats purchased at double the retail price (many of which later could not be found), and iPods ostensibly for use in \\"data storage\\".[66][67][68][69]\\r\\nA 2015 inspection of IT infrastructure found that the department was running over a hundred computer systems whose owners were unknown, including Secret and Top Secret databases, many with out of date security or weak passwords. Basic security reviews were absent, and the department had apparently made deliberate attempts to delay publication of information about the flaws.[70]\\r\\nThe Associated Press reported on September 5, 2007, that DHS had scrapped an anti-terrorism data mining tool called ADVISE (Analysis, Dissemination, Visualization, Insight and Semantic Enhancement) after the agency's internal Inspector General found that pilot testing of the system had been performed using data on real people without required privacy safeguards in place.[71][72] The system, in development at Lawrence Livermore and Pacific Northwest National Laboratory since 2003, has cost the agency $42 million to date. Controversy over the program is not new; in March 2007, the Government Accountability Office stated that \\"the ADVISE tool could misidentify or erroneously associate an individual with undesirable activity such as fraud, crime or terrorism.\\" Homeland Security's Inspector General later said that ADVISE was poorly planned, time-consuming for analysts to use, and lacked adequate justifications.[73]\\r\\nFusion centers are terrorism prevention and response centers, many of which were created under a joint project between the Department of Homeland Security and the US Department of Justice's Office of Justice Programs between 2003 and 2007. The fusion centers gather information not only from government sources, but also from their partners in the private sector.[74][75]\\r\\nThey are designed to promote information sharing at the federal level between agencies such as the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), Department of Justice, US Military and state and local level government. As of July?2009[update], the Department of Homeland Security recognized at least seventy-two fusion centers.[76] Fusion centers may also be affiliated with an Emergency Operations Center that responds in the event of a disaster.\\r\\nThere are a number of documented criticisms of fusion centers, including relative ineffectiveness at counterterrorism activities, the potential to be used for secondary purposes unrelated to counterterrorism, and their links to violations of civil liberties of American citizens and others.[77]\\r\\nDavid Rittgers of the Cato Institute has noted:\\r\\na long line of fusion center and DHS reports labeling broad swaths of the public as a threat to national security. The North Texas Fusion System labeled Muslim lobbyists as a potential threat; a DHS analyst in Wisconsin thought both pro- and anti-abortion activists were worrisome; a Pennsylvania homeland security contractor watched environmental activists, Tea Party groups, and a Second Amendment rally; the Maryland State Police put anti-death penalty and anti-war activists in a federal terrorism database; a fusion center in Missouri thought that all third-party voters and Ron Paul supporters were a threat....[78]\\r\\nThe Missouri Information Analysis Center (MIAC) made news in 2009 for targeting supporters of third party candidates (such as Ron Paul), pro-life activists, and conspiracy theorists as potential militia members.[79] Anti-war activists and Islamic lobby groups were targeted in Texas, drawing criticism from the American Civil Liberties Union.[80]\\r\\nAccording to the Department of Homeland Security:[81]\\r\\nThe Privacy Office has identified a number of risks to privacy presented by the fusion center program:\\r\\nIn 2009, the Virginia Fusion Center came under criticism for publishing a terrorism threat assessment which stated that certain universities are potential hubs for terror related activity.[82] The report targeted historically black colleges and identified hacktivism as a form of terrorism.[83]\\r\\nIn 2006, MSNBC reported that Grant Goodman, \\"an 81-year-old retired University of Kansas history professor, received a letter from his friend in the Philippines that had been opened and resealed with a strip of dark green tape bearing the words \\"by Border Protection\\" and carrying the official Homeland Security seal.\\"[84] The letter was sent by a devout Catholic Filipino woman with no history of supporting Islamic terrorism.[84] A spokesman for U.S. Customs and Border Protection \\"acknowledged that the agency can, will and does open mail coming to U.S. citizens that originates from a foreign country whenever it's deemed necessary\\":\\r\\n\\"All mail originating outside the United States Customs territory that is to be delivered inside the U.S. Customs territory is subject to Customs examination,\\" says the CBP Web site. That includes personal correspondence. \\"All mail means 'all mail,'\\" said John Mohan, a CBP spokesman, emphasizing the point.[84]\\r\\nThe Department declined to outline what criteria are used to determine when a piece of personal correspondence should be opened or to say how often or in what volume Customs might be opening mail.[84]\\r\\nGoodman's story provoked outrage in the blogosphere,[85] as well as in the more established media. Reacting to the incident, Mother Jones remarked that \\"[u]nlike other prying government agencies, Homeland Security wants you to know it is watching you.\\"[86] CNN observed that \\"[o]n the heels of the NSA wiretapping controversy, Goodman's letter raises more concern over the balance between privacy and security.\\"[87]\\r\\nIn July 2006, the Office of Personnel Management conducted a survey of federal employees in all 36 federal agencies on job satisfaction and how they felt their respective agency was headed. DHS was last or near to last in every category including;\\r\\nThe low scores were attributed to major concerns about basic supervision, management and leadership within the agency. Examples from the survey reveal most concerns are about promotion and pay increase based on merit, dealing with poor performance, rewarding creativity and innovation, leadership generating high levels of motivation in the workforce, recognition for doing a good job, lack of satisfaction with various component policies and procedures and lack of information about what is going on with the organization.[88][89]\\r\\nDHS is the only large federal agency to score below 50% in overall survey rankings. It was last of large federal agencies in 2014 with 44.0% and fell even lower in 2015 at 43.1%, again last place.[90]\\r\\nIn the Center for Effective Government analysis of 15 federal agencies which receive the most Freedom of Information Act FOIA requests, published in 2015 (using 2012 and 2013 data), the Department of Homeland Security earned a D by scoring 69 out of a possible 100 points, i.e. did not earn a satisfactory overall grade. It also had not updated its FOIA policies since the 2007 FOIA amendments.[91]","input":"When was the department of homeland security established?"},{"output":"late 1890s","context":"A horror film is a movie that seeks to elicit a physiological reaction, such as an elevated heartbeat, through the use of fear and shocking ones audiences. Initially often inspired by literature from authors like Edgar Allan Poe, Bram Stoker, and Mary Shelley, horror has existed as a film genre for more than one century. The macabre and the supernatural are frequent themes. Horror may also overlap with the fantasy, supernatural fiction, and thriller genres.\\r\\nHorror films often aim to evoke viewers' nightmares, fears, revulsions and terror of the unknown. Plots within the horror genre often involve the intrusion of an evil force, event, or personage into the everyday world. Prevalent elements include ghosts, extraterrestrials, vampires, werewolves, demons, satanism, evil clowns, gore, torture, vicious animals, evil witches, monsters, zombies, cannibalism, psychopaths, natural or man-made disasters, and serial killers.[1]\\r\\nSome subgenres of horror film include action horror, comedy horror, body horror, disaster horror, holiday horror, horror drama, psychological horror, science fiction horror, slasher horror, supernatural horror, gothic horror, natural horror, zombie horror, first-person horror, and teen horror.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first depictions of supernatural events appear in several of the silent shorts created by the film pioneer Georges Mlis in the late 1890s, the best known being Le Manoir du Diable, which is sometimes credited as being the first horror film.[2] Another of his horror projects was La Caverne maudite (1898) (a.k.a. The Cave of the Demons, literally \\"the accursed cave\\").[2] Japan made early forays into the horror genre with Bake Jizo (Jizo the Spook) and Shinin no Sosei (Resurrection of a Corpse), both made in 1898.[3] The era featured a slew of literary adaptations, adapting the works of Poe and Dante, among others. In 1908, Selig Polyscope Company produced Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.\\r\\nIn 1910, Edison Studios produced the first filmed version of Frankenstein.[4] The macabre nature of the source materials used made the films synonymous with the horror film genre.[5]\\r\\nThough the word \\"horror\\" to describe the film genre would not be used until the 1930s (when Universal Pictures released their initial monster films), earlier American productions often relied on horror themes. Some notable examples include The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1923), The Phantom of the Opera (1925), The Cat and the Canary (1927), The Unknown (1927), and The Man Who Laughs (1928). Many of these early films were considered dark melodramas because of their stock characters and emotion-heavy plots that focused on romance, violence, suspense, and sentimentality.[6]\\r\\nThe trend of inserting an element of macabre into American pre-horror melodramas continued into the 1920s. Directors known for relying on macabre in their films during the 1920s were Maurice Tourneur, Rex Ingram, and Tod Browning. Ingram's The Magician (1926) contains one of the first examples of a \\"mad doctor\\" and is said to have had a large influence on James Whale's version of Frankenstein.[7] The Unholy Three (1925) is an example of Browning's use of macabre and unique style of morbidity; he remade the film in 1930 as a talkie, though The Terror (1928) was the first horror film with sound.\\r\\nBefore and during the Weimar Republic era, German Expressionist filmmakers would significantly influence later productions. Paul Wegener's The Student of Prague (1913) and The Golem trilogy (1915ÿ20), as well as Robert Wiene's The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari (1920), Arthur Robison's Warning Shadows (1923), and Paul Leni's Waxworks (1924), were influential films at the time. The first vampire-themed movie, Nosferatu (1922), was made during this period; it was an unauthorized adaptation of Bram Stoker's Dracula.\\r\\nOther European countries also, contributed to the genre during this period. Victor Sj?str?m's The Phantom Carriage (Sweden, 1920) is a cautionary tale about a supernatural legend, Benjamin Christensen's H?xan (Denmark/Sweden, 1922) is a documentary-style, horror film, about witchcraft and superstition, and in 1928, Frenchman, Jean Epstein produced an influential film, The Fall of the House of Usher, based on the Poe tale.\\r\\nDuring the early period of talking pictures, Universal Pictures began a successful Gothic horror film series. Tod Browning's Dracula (1931) was quickly followed by James Whale's Frankenstein (1931) and The Old Dark House (1932), both featuring monstrous mute antagonists. Some of these films blended science fiction with Gothic horror, such as Whale's The Invisible Man (1933) and featured a mad scientist, mirroring earlier German films. Frankenstein was the first in a series of remakes which lasted for years. The Mummy (1932) introduced Egyptology as a theme; Make-up artist Jack Pierce was responsible for the iconic image of the monster, and others in the series. Universal's horror cycle continued into the 1940s with B movies including The Wolf Man (1941), as well as a number of films uniting several of the most common monsters.[8]\\r\\nOther studios followed Universal's lead. The once controversial Freaks (1932), based on the short story \\"Spurs\\", was made by MGM, though the studio disowned the completed film, and it remained banned, in the United Kingdom, for thirty years.[9] Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (Paramount, 1931) is remembered for its innovative use of photographic filters to create Jekyll's transformation before the camera.[10] With the progression of the genre, actors like Boris Karloff and Bela Lugosi were beginning to build entire careers in horror. Both appeared in three of Val Lewton's atmospheric B movies for RKO in the mid-1940s, including The Body Snatcher (1945).\\r\\nWith advances in technology, the tone of horror films shifted from the Gothic towards contemporary concerns. Two subgenres began to emerge: the Doomsday film and the Demonic film.[13] Low-budget productions featured humanity overcoming threats such as alien invasions and deadly mutations to people, plants and insects. Japan's experience with Hiroshima and Nagasaki bore the well-known Godzilla (1954) and its sequels, featuring mutation from the effects of nuclear radiation.\\r\\nHollywood directors and producers found ample opportunity for audience exploitation through gimmicks. House of Wax (1953) used the advent of 3-D film to draw audiences, while The Tingler used electric seat buzzers in 1959. Filmmakers continued to merge elements of science fiction and horror over the following decades. Considered a \\"pulp masterpiece\\"[14] of the era was The Incredible Shrinking Man (1957), based on Richard Matheson's existentialist novel. The film conveyed the fears of living in the Atomic Age and the terror of social alienation.\\r\\nDuring the later 1950s, the United Kingdom emerged as a major producer of horror films.[15] The Hammer company focused on the genre for the first time, enjoying huge international success from films involving classic horror characters which were shown in color for the first time.[16] Drawing on Universal's precedent, many films produced were Frankenstein and Dracula remakes, followed by many sequels. Christopher Lee starred in a number of Hammer Horror films, including The Curse of Frankenstein (1957), which Professor Patricia MacCormac called the \\"first really gory horror film, showing blood and guts in colour\\".[17] Other British companies contributed to a boom in horror film production in the United Kingdom during the 1960s and 1970s.\\r\\nReleased in May 1960, the British psychological thriller Peeping Tom (1960) by Michael Powell is a progenitor of the contemporary \\"slasher film\\".[18] Alfred Hitchcock cemented the subgenre with Psycho released later that year. France continued the mad scientist theme, while Italian horror films became internationally notable. American International Pictures (AIP) made a series of Edgar Allan Poeÿthemed films.\\r\\nFilms in the era used the supernatural premise to express the horror of the demonic. The Innocents (1961) based on the Henry James novel The Turn of the Screw. Meanwhile, ghosts were a dominant theme in Japanese horror, in such films as Kwaidan, Onibaba (both 1964) and Kuroneko (1968).\\r\\nRosemary's Baby (1968) is an American psychological horror film written and directed by Roman Polanski, based on the bestselling 1967 novel of the same name by Ira Levin. Another influential American horror film of this period was George A. Romero's Night of the Living Dead (1968). Produced and directed by Romero on a budget of $114,000, it grossed $30 million internationally. An Armageddon film about zombies, it began to combine psychological insights with gore. Distancing the era from earlier gothic trends, late 1960s films brought horror into everyday life. Low-budget splatter films from the likes of Herschell Gordon Lewis also gained prominence.[19]\\r\\nThe financial successes of the low-budget gore films of the ensuing years, and the critical and popular success of Rosemary's Baby, led to the release of more films with occult themes during the 1970s. The Exorcist (1973), the first of these movies, was a significant commercial success and was followed by scores of horror films in which a demon entity is represented as the supernatural evil, often by impregnating women or possessing children.\\r\\n\\"Evil children\\" and reincarnation became popular subjects. Robert Wise's film Audrey Rose (1977) for example, deals with a man who claims that his daughter is the reincarnation of another dead person. Alice, Sweet Alice (1977), is another Catholic-themed horror slasher about a little girl's murder and her sister being the prime suspect. Another popular occult horror movie was The Omen (1976), where a man realizes that his five-year-old adopted son is the Antichrist. Invincible to human intervention, Demons became villains in many horror films with a postmodern style and a dystopian worldview. Another example is The Sentinel (1977), in which a fashion model discovers that her new brownstone residence may actually be a portal to Hell.\\r\\nDuring the 1970s, Italian filmmakers Mario Bava, Riccardo Freda, Antonio Margheriti and Dario Argento developed giallo horror films that became classics and influenced the genre in other countries. Representative films include: Twitch of the Death Nerve, The Bird with the Crystal Plumage, Deep Red and Suspiria.\\r\\nDon't Look Now (1973), a independent British-Italian film directed by Nicolas Roeg, was also notable. Its focus on the psychology of grief was unusually strong for a film featuring a supernatural horror plot. Another notable film is The Wicker Man (1973), a British mystery horror film dealing with the practice of ancient pagan rituals in the modern era. It was written by Anthony Shaffer and directed by Robin Hardy.\\r\\nThe ideas of the 1960s began to influence horror films, as the youth involved in the counterculture began exploring the medium. Wes Craven's The Hills Have Eyes (1977) and The Last House on the Left (1972) along with Tobe Hooper's The Texas Chain Saw Massacre (1974)[20] (based on the Ed Gein case) recalled the Vietnam War; while George A. Romero satirized the consumer society in his zombie sequel, Dawn of the Dead (1978). Meanwhile, the subgenre of comedy horror re-emerged in the cinema with The Abominable Dr. Phibes (1971), Young Frankenstein (1974), The Rocky Horror Picture Show (1975), and An American Werewolf in London (1981) among others.\\r\\nAlso in the 1970s, the works of the horror author Stephen King began to be adapted for the screen, beginning with Brian De Palma's adaptation of Carrie (1976), King's first published novel, for which the two female leads (Sissy Spacek and Piper Laurie) gained Oscar nominations. Next, was his third published novel, The Shining (1980), directed by Stanley Kubrick, which was a sleeper at the box office. At first, many critics and viewers had negative feedback toward The Shining. However, the film is now known as one of Hollywood's most classic horror films.\\r\\nThis psychological horror film has a variety of themes; \\"evil children\\", alcoholism, telepathy and insanity. This type of film is an example of how Hollywood's idea of horror started to evolve. Murder and violence were no longer the main themes of horror films. During the 1970s and 1980s, psychological and supernatural horror started to take over cinema. Another classic Hollywood horror film is Tobe Hooper's Poltergeist (1982). Poltergeist is ranked the 20th scariest movie ever made by the Chicago Film Critics Association. Both The Shining and Poltergeist involve horror being based on real-estate values. The evil and horror throughout the films come from where the movies are taking place.[21][22]\\r\\nThe Amityville Horror is a 1979 supernatural horror film directed by Stuart Rosenberg, based on Jay Anson's 1977 book of the same name. It stars James Brolin and Margot Kidder as a young couple who purchase a home they come to find haunted by combative supernatural forces. The Changeling is a 1980 Canadian psychological horror film directed by Peter Medak.\\r\\nA cycle of slasher films was made during the 1970s and 1980s. John Carpenter created Halloween (1978), Sean S. Cunningham made Friday the 13th (1980), Wes Craven directed A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984), and Clive Barker made Hellraiser (1987). This subgenre would be mined by dozens of increasingly violent movies throughout the subsequent decades, and Halloween became a successful independent film. Another notable 1970s slasher film is Bob Clark's Black Christmas (1974). Sleepaway Camp (1983) is known for its twist ending, which is considered by some to be one of the most shocking endings among horror films. My Bloody Valentine (1981) is a slasher film dealing with Valentine's Day fiction. The boom in slasher films provided enough material for numerous comedic spoofs of the genre including Saturday the 14th (1981), Student Bodies (1981), National Lampoon's Class Reunion (1983), and Hysterical (1983).\\r\\nSome films explored urban legends such as \\"The babysitter and the man upstairs\\". A notable example is When a Stranger Calls (1979), an American psychological horror film directed by Fred Walton starring Carol Kane and Charles Durning.\\r\\nSteven Spielberg's Jaws (1975) began a new wave of killer animal stories, such as Orca (1977) and Up from the Depths (1979). Jaws is often credited as being one of the first films to use traditionally B movie elements such as horror and mild gore in a big-budget Hollywood film. In 1979, Don Coscarelli's Phantasm was the first of the Phantasm franchise.\\r\\nAlien (1979), a British-American science-fiction horror film directed by Ridley Scott was very successful, receiving both critical acclaim and being a box office success. John Carpenter's movie The Thing (1982) was also a mix of horror and sci-fi, but it was neither a box-office nor critical hit, but soon became a cult classic. However, nearly 20 years after its release, it was praised for using ahead-of-its-time special effects and paranoia.\\r\\nThe 1980s saw a wave of gory \\"B movie\\" horror films ÿ although most of them were poorly reviewed by critics, many became cult classics and later saw success with critics. A significant example is Sam Raimi's Evil Dead movies, which were low-budget gorefests but had a very original plotline which was later praised by critics.\\r\\nVampire horror was also popular in the 1980s, including cult vampire classics such as Fright Night (1985), The Lost Boys (1987), and Near Dark (also 1987). In 1984, Joe Dante's seminal monster comedy Gremlins became a box office hit with critics and audiences, and inspired a trend of \\"little monster\\" films such as Critters and Ghoulies.[citation needed]\\r\\nDavid Cronenberg's films such as Shivers (1975), Rabid (1977), The Brood (1979), The Dead Zone (1983), The Fly (1986) dealt with \\"body horror\\" and \\"mad scientist\\" themes.[23]\\r\\nSeveral science fiction action horror movies were released in the 1980s, notably Aliens (1986) and Predator (1987). Notable comedy horror films of the 1980s include Re-Animator (1985) and Night of the Creeps (1986).\\r\\nDay of the Dead is a 1985 horror film written and directed by George A. Romero and the third film in Romero's Night of the Living Dead series.\\r\\nHenry: Portrait of a Serial Killer is a 1986 psychological horror crime film directed and co-written by John McNaughton about the random crime spree of a serial killer who seemingly operates with impunity. Pumpkinhead (1988) is a dark fantasy horror film, which is the directorial debut of special effects artist Stan Winston.\\r\\nChild's Play (1988), Night of the Demons (1988) and Pet Sematary (1989) are notable supernatural horror films of the late 1980s.\\r\\nIn the first half of the 1990s, the genre still contained many of the themes from the 1980s. The slasher films A Nightmare on Elm Street, Friday the 13th, Halloween and Child's Play all saw sequels in the 1990s, most of which met with varied amounts of success at the box office, but all were panned by critics, with the exception of Wes Craven's New Nightmare (1994) and the hugely successful Silence of the Lambs (1991). The latter, which stars Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins, is considered a major horror movie of all times.[24] Misery (1990) also deals with a psychopath, and the film received critical acclaim for Kathy Bates's performance as the psychopathic Annie Wilkes.\\r\\nNew Nightmare, with In the Mouth of Madness (1995), The Dark Half (1993), and Candyman (1992), were part of a mini-movement of self-reflexive or metafictional horror films. Each film touched upon the relationship between fictional horror and real-world horror. Candyman, for example, examined the link between an invented urban legend and the realistic horror of the racism that produced its villain. In the Mouth of Madness took a more literal approach, as its protagonist actually hopped from the real world into a novel created by the madman he was hired to track down. This reflective style became more overt and ironic with the arrival of Scream (1996).\\r\\nIn Interview with the Vampire (1994), the \\"Theatre de Vampires\\" (and the film itself, to some degree) invoked the Grand Guignol style, perhaps to further remove the undead performers from humanity, morality and class. The horror movie soon continued its search for new and effective frights. In the 1985 novel The Vampire Lestat by the author Anne Rice (who penned Interview...'s screenplay and the 1976 novel of the same name) suggests that its antihero Lestat inspired and nurtured the Grand Guignol style and theatre.\\r\\nTwo main problems pushed horror backward during this period: firstly, the horror genre wore itself out with the proliferation of nonstop slasher and gore films in the eighties. Secondly, the adolescent audience which feasted on the blood and morbidity of the previous decade grew up, and the replacement audience for films of an imaginative nature were being captured instead by the explosion of science-fiction and fantasy films, courtesy of the special effects possibilities with advances made in computer-generated imagery.[25] Examples of these CGI include movies like Species (1995), Anaconda (1997), Mimic (1997), Blade (1998), Deep Rising (1998), House on Haunted Hill (1999), Sleepy Hollow (1999), and The Haunting (1999).\\r\\nTo re-connect with its audience, horror became more self-mockingly ironic and outright parodic, especially in the latter half of the 1990s. Peter Jackson's Braindead (1992) (known as Dead Alive in the United States) took the splatter film to ridiculous excesses for comic effect. Wes Craven's Scream (written by Kevin Williamson) movies, starting in 1996, featured teenagers who were fully aware of, and often made reference to, the history of horror movies, and mixed ironic humour with the shocks (despite Scream 2 and Scream 3 utilising less use of the humour of the original, until Scream 4 in 2011, and rather more references to horror film conventions). Along with I Know What You Did Last Summer (1997) (also written by Williamson) and Urban Legend (1998), they re-ignited the dormant slasher film genre.\\r\\nEvent Horizon (1997) is a British-American science fiction horror film directed by Paul W. S. Anderson. The Sixth Sense (1999) is a supernatural horror film written and directed by M. Night Shyamalan, which tells the story of Cole Sear (Haley Joel Osment), a troubled, isolated boy who is able to see and talk to the dead, and an equally troubled child psychologist named Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis) who tries to help him.\\r\\nHouse on Haunted Hill is a 1999 horror film directed by William Malone which follows a group of strangers who are invited to a party at an abandoned asylum, where they are offered $1 million each by an amusement park mogul if they are able to survive the night. It is a remake of the 1959 film of the same title. Other horror films of the late 1990s include Cube (1997), The Faculty (1998), Disturbing Behavior (1998), Stir of Echoes (1999), Stigmata (1999), Existenz (1999).\\r\\nMonster horror was quite popular in the 1990s. Tremors (1990) is the first installment of the Tremors franchise. Lake Placid (1999) is another monster horror film, written by David E. Kelley and directed by Steve Miner.\\r\\nAnother successful horror film is Audition, a 1999 Japanese film based on the novel of the same name, directed by Takashi Miike. Around this period, Japanese horror started becoming popular in English speaking countries.\\r\\nThe film The Last Broadcast (1998) served as inspiration for the highly successful The Blair Witch Project (1999), which popularized the found footage horror subgenre. The theme of witchcraft was also addressed in The Witches (1990), starring Anjelica Huston and The Craft (1996), a supernatural horror film directed by Andrew Fleming. Wolf is a 1994 romantic horror film following the transformation of a man (Jack Nicholson) into a werewolf.\\r\\nThe decade started, with, among other films, Scary Movie (2000), a comedy horror directed by Keenen Ivory Wayans, which is a parody of the horror, slasher and mystery genres. The film received mixed reviews from critics. By contrast, Valentine (2001) was a conventional horror film. It had some success at the box office, but was derided by critics for being formulaic and relying on foregone horror film conventions. The Others (2001) was hugely successful, winning and being further nominated for many awards. It is a 2001 Spanish-American supernatural gothic horror film with elements of psychological horror. It was written, directed, and scored by Alejandro Amenbar. It stars Nicole Kidman and Fionnula Flanagan.\\r\\nFranchise films such as Jason X (2001) and Freddy vs. Jason (2003) also made a stand in theaters. Final Destination (2000) marked a successful revival of teen-centered horror and spawned five installments. Jeepers Creepers series was also successful. Films such as Hollow Man (2000), Cabin Fever (2002), House of 1000 Corpses (2003) (the latter an exploitation horror film written, co-scored and directed by Rob Zombie in his directorial debut) and the previous mentions helped bring the genre back to Restricted ratings in theaters. Van Helsing (2004) and Underworld series had huge box office success, despite mostly negative reviews by critics. Ginger Snaps (2000) is a Canadian film dealing with the tragic transformation of a teenage girl who is bitten by a werewolf. Signs (2002) revived the science fiction alien theme. The Descent, a 2005 British adventure horror film written and directed by Neil Marshall was also successful. Another notable film is Drag Me to Hell, a 2009 American supernatural horror film co-written and directed by Sam Raimi. The Strangers (2008) deals with unprovoked stranger-on-stranger violence. The House of the Devil (2009) is inspired by the \\"satanic panic\\" of the 1980s. Trick 'r Treat is a 2007 anthology horror film written and directed by Michael Dougherty and produced by Bryan Singer. Black Water (2007) is British-Australian natural horror film.\\r\\nSeveral horror film adaptations from comic books and video games were produced. 30 Days of Night (2007) is based on the comic book miniseries of the same name. The story focuses on an Alaskan town beset by vampires as it enters into a thirty-day long polar night. Comic book adaptations like the Blade series, Constantine (2005), and Hellboy (2004) also became box office successes. The Resident Evil video game franchise was adapted into a film released in March 2002, and several sequels followed. Other video game adaptations like Doom (2005) and Silent Hill (2006) also had moderate box office success.\\r\\nSome pronounced trends have marked horror films. Films from non-English language countries have become successful. The Devil's Backbone (2001) is such an example. It is a 2001 Spanish-Mexican gothic horror film directed by Guillermo del Toro, and written by del Toro, David Mu?oz, and Antonio Trashorras. A French horror film Brotherhood of the Wolf (2001) became the second-highest-grossing French language film in the United States in the last two decades. The Swedish film Let the Right One In (2008) was also successful. REC is a 2007 Spanish zombie horror film, co-written and directed by Jaume Balaguer܇ and Paco Plaza. Martyrs (2008), a French-Canadian horror film, was controversial upon its release, receiving polarizing reviews. Another notable film is The Orphanage (2007), a Spanish horror film and the debut feature of Spanish filmmaker J. A. Bayona. A Tale of Two Sisters is a 2003 South Korean psychological drama horror film written and directed by Kim Jee-woon.\\r\\nAnother trend is the emergence of psychology to scare audiences, rather than gore. The Others (2001) proved to be a successful example of a psychological horror film. A minimalist approach which was equal parts Val Lewton's theory of \\"less is more\\", usually employing the low-budget techniques utilized on The Blair Witch Project (1999), has been evident, particularly in the emergence of Asian horror movies which have been remade into successful Americanized versions, such as The Ring (2002), The Grudge (2004), Dark Water (2005), and Pulse (2006). In March 2008, China banned the movies from its market.[26] Credo (2008) and Triangle (2009) are two British psychological horror films. What Lies Beneath (2000) is a supernatural horror film directed by Robert Zemeckis, starring Harrison Ford and Michelle Pfeiffer as a couple who experience a strange haunting of their home. Orphan (2009) is a notable psychological horror film.\\r\\nThe films I Am Legend (2007), Quarantine (2008), Zombieland (2009), and 28 Days Later (2002) featured an update of the apocalyptic and aggressive zombie genre. The latter film spawned a sequel: 28 Weeks Later (2007). An updated remake of Dawn of the Dead (2004) soon appeared as well as the zombie comedy Shaun of the Dead (2004) and Spanish -Cuban comedy zombie film Juan of the Dead (2012). This resurgence led George A. Romero to return to his Living Dead series with Land of the Dead (2005), Diary of the Dead (2007) and Survival of the Dead (2009).[27] Cannibals were present in horror films such as Dahmer (2002), Wrong Turn (2003), Tooth and Nail (2007) and Dying Breed (2008).\\r\\nThe Australian film Wolf Creek (2005) written, co-produced, and directed by Greg McLean revolves around three backpackers who find themselves taken captive and after a brief escape, hunted down by Mick Taylor in the Australian outback. The film was ambiguously marketed as being \\"based on true events\\"; the plot bore elements reminiscent of the real-life murders of tourists by Ivan Milat in the 1990s, and Bradley Murdoch in 2001; and contained more extreme violence. An extension of this trend was the emergence of a type of horror with emphasis on depictions of torture, suffering and violent deaths, (variously referred to as \\"horror porn\\", \\"torture porn\\", \\"splatterporn\\" and \\"gore-nography\\") with films such as Ghost Ship (2002), The Collector (2009), Saw (2004), Hostel (2005), and their respective sequels, frequently singled out as examples of emergence of this subgenre.[28] The Saw film series holds the Guinness World Record of the highest-grossing horror franchise in history.[29] Finally, with the arrival of Paranormal Activity (2007), which was well received by critics and an excellent reception at the box office, minimalist horror approach started by The Blair Witch Project was reaffirmed. Cloverfield (2008) is another found footage horror film. The Mist (2007) is a science-fiction horror film based on the 1980 novella of the same name by Stephen King. Antichrist (2009) is an English-language Danish experimental horror film written and directed by Lars von Trier, and starring Willem Dafoe and Charlotte Gainsbourg. The Exorcism of Emily Rose is a 2005 legal drama horror film directed by Scott Derrickson, loosely based on the story of Anneliese Michel. The Children (2008) is British horror film focusing on the mayhem created by several children.\\r\\nRemakes of earlier horror movies became routine in the 2000s. In addition to the remake of Dawn of the Dead (2004), as well as the remake of both Herschell Gordon Lewis' cult classic 2001 Maniacs (2003) and the remake of Tobe Hooper's classic The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (2003), there was also the 2007 Rob Zombie-written and -directed remake of John Carpenter's Halloween.[30] The film focused more on Michael's backstory than the original did, devoting the first half of the film to Michael's childhood. It was critically panned by most,[31][32] but was a success in its theatrical run, spurring its own sequel. This film helped to start a \\"reimagining\\" riot in horror filmmakers. Among the many remakes or \\"reimaginings\\" of other popular horror films and franchises are films such as Thirteen Ghosts (2001), The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (2003), The Hills Have Eyes (2006), Friday the 13th (2009),[33] Children of the Corn (2009),[34] Halloween (2007), Prom Night (2008), The Omen (2006), Carrie (2002), The Wicker Man (2006), Day of the Dead (2008), Night of the Demons (2009), My Bloody Valentine (2009), Willard (2003), Black Christmas (2006), The Amityville Horror (2005), April Fool's Day (2008), The Fog (2005), The Hitcher (2007), It's Alive (2009), When a Stranger Calls (2006), The Last House on the Left (2009).\\r\\nRemakes remain popular, with films such as A Nightmare on Elm Street (2010),[35] The Crazies (2010), I Spit on Your Grave (2010), Don't Be Afraid of the Dark (2010), Fright Night (2011), Maniac (2012), and Poltergeist (2015). The 1976 film Carrie saw its second remake in 2013, which is the third film adaptation of Stephen King's 1974 novel of the same name. Child's Play saw a sequel with Curse of Chucky (2013), while Halloween, Friday the 13th, and Hellraiser all had reboots in the works.[36][37][38] The 2013 Evil Dead is the fourth installment in the Evil Dead franchise, and serves as a soft reboot of the original 1981 film and as a continuation to the original film trilogy.\\r\\nSerialized, found footage style web videos featuring Slender Man became popular on YouTube in the beginning of the decade. Such series included TribeTwelve, EverymanHybrid, and Marble Hornets, the latter of which has been adapted into a feature film. The character as well as the multiple series is credited with reinvigorating interest in found footage as well as urban folklore. Horror has become prominent on television with The Walking Dead, American Horror Story, and The Strain. Also, many popular horror films have had successful television series made: Psycho spawned Bates Motel, The Silence of the Lambs spawned Hannibal, and both Scream and Friday the 13th had TV series in development.[39][40]\\r\\nYou're Next (2011) and The Cabin in the Woods (2012) led to a return to the slasher genre; the latter was intended also as a critical satire of torture porn.[41] The Green Inferno (2015) pays homage to the controversial horror film Cannibal Holocaust (1980). Australian psychological horror The Babadook (2014) was met with critical acclaim. It Follows (2014) subverted traditional horror tropes of sexuality and slasher films and enjoyed commercial and critical success. The Conjuring deal with the paranormal. Sinister (2012) is a British-American supernatural horror film directed by Scott Derrickson and written by Derrickson and C. Robert Cargill. Another notable supernatural horror film is Insidious (2010). The Witch (2015) is a historical period supernatural horror film written and directed by Robert Eggers in his directorial debut, which follows a Puritan family encountering forces of evil in the woods beyond their New England farm. Get Out (2017) received universal acclaim from critics and audiences alike. Its plot follows a black man who uncovers a disturbing secret when he meets the family of his white girlfriend. Adapted from the Stephen King novel, It (2017) set a box office record for horror films by grossing $123.1 million on opening weekend in the United States and nearly $185 million globally.[42] Gerald's Game (2017) is a psychological horror film based on Stephen King's novel of the same name. Other horror films include Frozen (2010), Black Swan (2010), Devil (2010), The Innkeepers (2011), Oculus (2013), Under the Skin (2013), Mama (2013), Green Room (2015), The Invitation (2015), Hush (2016), Lights Out (2016), Don't Breathe (2016), It Comes at Night (2017).\\r\\nA Quiet Place (2018) is a critically acclaimed post-apocalyptic science-fiction horror film with a plot that follows a family who must live life in silence while hiding from extraterrestrial creatures that arrived on earth on fragments from their exploded home planet, and which hunt exclusively by sound. Annihilation (2018) is another successful science-fiction horror film.\\r\\nThe success of non-English language films continued with the Swedish film Marianne (2011), while Let the Right One In (2008) was the subject of a Hollywood remake, Let Me In (2010). South Korean horror produced I Saw the Devil (2010) and Train to Busan (2016). Raw is a 2016 French-Belgian horror drama written and directed by Julia Ducournau, and starring Garance Marillier. Goodnight Mommy (2014) (German: Ich seh, Ich seh) is an Austrian horror film.\\r\\nHorror films' evolution throughout the years has given society a new approach to resourcefully utilize their benefits. The horror film style has changed over time, but, in 1996, Scream set off a \\"chain of copycats\\", leading to a new variety of teenage, horror movies.[48] This new approach to horror films began to gradually earn more and more revenue as seen in the progress of Scream movies; the first movie earned $6 million and the third movie earned $101 million.[48] The importance that horror films have gained in the public and producers eyes is one obvious effect on our society.\\r\\nHorror films' income expansion is only the first sign of the influences of horror flicks. The role of women and how women see themselves in the movie industry has been altered by the horror genre. Early horror films such as My Bloody Valentine (1981), Halloween (1978), and Friday the 13th (1980) were produced mostly for male audiences in order to \\"feed the fantasies of young men\\".[49] This idea is no longer prevalent in horror films, as women have become not only the main audience and fans of horror films but also the main protagonists of contemporary horror films.[50] Movie makers have also begun to integrate topics more broadly associated with other genres into their films in order to grow audience appeal.[49]\\r\\nMany early horror films created high social and legal controversy. In the U.S., the Motion Picture Production Code was in force between 1930 and 1968, although it was strictly enforced only from 1934 to the late 1950s. The Code set guidelines of what was morally acceptable to show in movies, and, as such, it restrained movies containing controversial themes, severe violence, explicit sexuality or nudity. The gradual abandonment of the Code, and eventually its formal repeal in 1968 (when it was replaced by the MPAA film rating system) offered more freedom to the movie industry. Nevertheless, controversy continued to surround horror movies, and many continued to face censorship issues in many countries. An example of such film is the 1978 I Spit on Your Grave, an American rape-and-revenge exploitation horror film written, co-produced, directed, and edited by Meir Zarchi. The film was received negatively by critics, but it attracted a great deal of national and international attention due to its explicit scenes of rape, murder and prolonged nudity which led it to be banned in many countries, including Ireland, Norway, Iceland, and West Germany. Many of these countries have in later years removed the ban, but the film remains prohibited in Ireland.[51]\\r\\nWhile horror is only one genre of film, the influence it presents to the international community is large. Horror movies tend to be a vessel for showing eras of audiences issues across the globe visually and in the most effective manner. Jeanne Hall, a film theorist, agrees with the use of horror films in easing the process of understanding issues by making use of their optical elements.[52] The use of horror films to help audiences understand international prior historical events occurs, for example, to show the horridness of the Vietnam War, the Holocaust and the worldwide AIDS epidemic.[53] However, horror movies do not always present positive endings. In fact, in many occurrences the manipulation of horror presents cultural definitions that are not accurate, yet set an example to which a person relates to that specific cultural from then on in their life.[54]\\r\\nThe visual interpretations of films can be lost in the translation of their elements from one culture to another like in the adaptation of the Japanese film Ju on into the American film The Grudge. The cultural components from Japan were slowly \\"siphoned away\\" to make the film more relatable to a western audience.[55] This deterioration that can occur in an international remake happens by over-presenting negative cultural assumptions that, as time passes, sets a common ideal about that particular culture in each individual.[54] Holm's discussion of The Grudge remakes presents this idea by stating, \\"It is, instead, to note that The Grudge films make use of an un-theorized notion of Japan... that seek to directly represent the country.\\"","input":"When did the first horror movie come out?"},{"output":"the king of Kashi","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the Hindu epic Mahabharata, Amba is the eldest daughter of the king of Kashi, who considers the Kuru prince Bhishma responsible for her misfortune and her sole goal in life becomes his destruction, to fulfill which she is reborn as Shikhandi  (the son of Drupada, the father of Draupadi).\\r\\n\\r\\nAmba was the eldest daughter of the king of Kashi. She had two younger sisters Ambika and Ambalika.[1] Amba is a commonly used word in Sanskrit meaning mother, also with Vedic linkage as the mother of the Vedas.[2][3]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Adi Parva of the Mahabharata narrates about Amba's swayamvara at the Kingdom of Kashi. Amba and Salva, the king of Saubala, were secretly in love and Amba had promised to place the varmala on his neck. Bhishma came to know of the ceremony of the three beautiful princesses, and went to the Swayamvara to win the princesses for his step-brother Vichitravirya. Once arrived, Bhishma announced his intention to abduct the brides, challenging the assembled suitors to stop him. Bhishma forced the princesses into his chariot and rode away. The kings followed and showered Bhishma with arrows; however, Bhishma returned the attack and defeated them. Salva challenged Bhishma for a duel; Bhishma overpowered and wounded Salva, but spared his life. Unaware of Amba's feelings, Bhishma proceeded to Hastinapur and presented them to Satyavati, who made arrangements for their marriage to Vichitravirya. Amba approached Bhishma and the council of Brahmins and revealed that she and Salva were in love with each other and that she was going to choose him as her husband in the Swayamvara. Bhishma conceded that her reasoning was sound and sent her to Salva with honors, while Ambika and Ambalika were married to Vichitravirya.[4][5]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the Ambopakhyanaparvan chapter of the book Udyoga Parva of the Mahabharata, the rest of Amba's tale is narrated by Bhishma when Duryodhana questioned him as to why he did not kill Shikhandi, an ally of the Pandavas, cousins and foes of the Kauravas.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nBhishma ensured that Amba was escorted safely to Salwa Kingdom. Amba informed Salva that she had come for him. Salva retorted that he no longer desired her, as she was to be wed to another man. He declared that she was rightfully won by Bhishma, who defeated and insulted him and other kings and accused her of happily leaving with him. Amba pleaded with Salva, whom she considered her true love, to accept her. But Salva reiterated Kshatriya dharma and refused to accept her. Rejected, the heart broken  Amba left Saubala and went to the forest.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nAmba peeved by this rejection then went to Bhishma and accosted him saying that he was responsible for all her problems. Bhishma refused to marry her to  Vichitravirya, on the plea that she was in love with someone else. She then approached Bhishma to marry her. He also refused due to his vow of celibacy. This further infuriated Amba, as she had now been spurned by three people. She appealed to various kings to defeat Bhishma and do her justice, but all of them refused knowing bhisma's capabilities. Finally, she went to the forest to please the gods so that she can have her revenge on Bhishma .[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nAmba reflected on her condition and considered all the people responsible for it, including herself (as she did not escape Bhishma's chariot when Bhishma was fighting Salva), Bhishma (who abducted her), Salva (who rejected her) and her father (who arranged her swayamvara). She finally arrived at the conclusion that Bhishma was the main culprit and swore to destroy him by austerities or battle. She sought shelter with a group of ascetics that night and narrated her tale to them. There the learned sage Shaikhavatya consoled Amba and promised to guide her in her austerities.[1][8]\\r\\n\\r\\nOther sages discussed amongst themselves Amba's situation and contemplated her alternatives and advised her to return to her father as there are only two true protectors of a woman: a father and a husband. However, Amba declined, deciding to practice austerities. On the next day, the sage Hotravahana (of the Srinjaya race), a former king and Amba's maternal grandfather, passed by the place. Upon listening to the tale of Amba's ordeal, the sage advised her not to return to her father and instead approach the sage Parashurama. Akritavrana, one of Parashurama's disciples, also arrived at the place. Hotravahana introduced Amba to Akritavrana and both of them explain Amba's case to him.[9] Akritavrana gave Amba two options: either Parashurama should approach Salva to marry her or Bhishma should be defeated by Parashurama. Amba asked Akritavrana to decide who was her culprit. Akritavrana agreed with Amba that Bhishma was the root cause of her plight and should be the target of her revenge. Akritavrana and Hotravahana explained Amba's predicament to Parashurama, whom Amba herself prayed to for help. Parashurama ÿ an eternal foe of the Kshatriyas gave his word to Amba that he would slay Bhishma, who was his disciple in the past, and destroy his pride.[10][11]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Parashurama arrived with his retinue at Kurukshetra and sent a message to Bhishma of his arrival, Bhishma came to see his guru, offering him the traditional respects. A pleased Parashurama commanded Bhishma to accept Amba. Bhishma refused, restating that he had taken a vow of celibacy. An infuriated Parashurama threatened Bhishma with death. Bhishma tried to calm the sage, but in vain, and he finally agreed to battle his guru to safeguard his Kshatriya duty. Ganga tried stopping the battle by beseeching her son as well as the great sage, but failed.[12] The great battle lasted for 23 days, without any result. On the 24th day when Bhishma chose to use a deadly weapon, at the behest of the divine sage Narada and the gods, Parashurama ended the conflict and the battle was declared a draw.[1][13] Parashurama narrated the events to Amba and told her to seek Bhishma's protection. However, Amba refused to listen to Parashurama's advice and left angrily declaring that she would achieve her objective by asceticism.[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nAmba gave up food and sleep, and practised asceticism standing still for six months in the Yamuna river valley, surviving only on air. She became emaciated and developed matted locks. After that, she stood in the waters of the Yamuna, without food and practised austerities. After that, she spent time standing on her tip toes, having eaten only one fallen leaf of a tree. Her penance for twelve years started  burning the heavens and the earth. She then went to Vatsa kingdom, in which many renowned sages lived. She roamed the kingdom, bathing in the sacred waters of the Ganges (Ganga) and the Yamuna. Then, she visited the ashrams of many sages like Narada, Uluka, Chyavana, Vishwamitra, Mandavya, Dwilipa, Ramhrada and Garga as well as sacred sites like Prayag, Bhogavati and holy groves. During her journey, she observed difficult vows and performed ablutions in the holy waters.[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe goddess Ganga appeared before Amba and listened to Amba's tale that her austerities were aimed to destroy Bhishma, Ganga's son. The angry goddess Ganga replied that since Amba's mind was crooked, she would be become a crooked and tortuous river, which will remain dry for eight months and flow in the four months of the rainy season. Ganga declared that the bathing places along the river's course would be in difficult terrain, and it will be infested with crocodiles and other fierce creatures.However due to the merits of her severe tapasya, only half her body would flow as a river,the other half would still be a maiden.Amba wandered practising severe vows and forgoing food and water for months. She visited many tirthas in this time and finally returned to Vatsa, where Ganga's curse materialized.[1][14]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe ascetics of Vatsa dissuaded her to refrain from the austerities, but Amba maintained her resolve and told them her desire was to be born a man and slay Bhishma to avenge her misery. The god Shiva appeared to her and blessed her that she would become a man in her next birth and destroy Bhishma. Amba would be born to the king Drupada of Panchala and become a great warrior. Amba would remember her previous birth and hatred of Bhishma. Pleased with the boon, Amba created a funeral pyre of wood on the banks of the Yamuna and jumped in the fire saying \\"for Bhishma's destruction!\\".[1][15][16]\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother variant narrates that Amba performed austerities and pleased Kartikeya, the god of war and Shiva's son. He granted her a garland of ever-fresh lotuses and declared that whoever wore it will destroy Bhishma. With this garland, Amba made one more attempt to seek help of many kings and princes to support her in her just cause. However, there was no response from anyone of them to help her as they did not want to be on the wrong side of Bhishma. In a final effort she approached Drupada but even he declined; in frustration she cast the garland off on a pillar outside Drupada's palace and went for austerities in the forest again. While Amba kills herself, no one dares to touch the garland.[7][17][18]\\r\\n\\r\\nDrupada had no children so he did austerities in the forest seeking the blessings of Shiva for begetting a son. Shiva granted him the boon that a girl would be born to him, but will transform into a boy later. As prophesied, Amba was reborn as Shikhandini, whose true gender was not disclosed and she was brought up as a boy. When Drupada got his daughter in the garb of a son married to the daughter of Hiranyavarna, the king of Dasharna, his true identity was revealed not only to the chagrin of the girl, her father but also to Shikandini himself. The agitated Hiranyavarna declared war on Panchala. Distressed by the turn of events, Shikhandini went into the forest to fast unto death but was saved by a yaksha (a forest deity), Sthunakarna, who helped him by offering his own gender in exchange to Shikandini's female gender. Thus Shikhandini became the male Shikhandi. After Hiranyavarna's death, Shikhandi returned to swap sexes with the yaksha, however the yaksha was cursed by his master the god Kubera to remain female until Shikhandi's death.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the variant where the garland of ever-fresh lotuses is mentioned, Shikhandini wears the garland once and Drupada realizes that she will slay Bhishma.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nMeanwhile, over the course of time, Ambika and Ambalika had grandchildren Kauravas and Pandavas, who became arch enemies. Draupadi, the daughter of Drupada, was married to the Pandavas. When a great Kurukshetra war between Pandavas and Kauravas ensued, Shikhandi sided with his brothers-in-law, while Bhishma was with the Kauravas. Bhishma had vowed to \\"not to shoot at a woman, anyone who used to be a woman or has a womans name or appears to be a woman\\",[19] so he narrated to the Kaurava leader Duryodhana Amba's tale and refused to fight to Shikhandi. When Bhishma led the Kaurava army, Shikhandi rode as the charioteer of Arjuna, the third of the Pandava brothers. On seeing Shikhandi, Bhishma lowered his weapons. Shikhandi and Arjuna pierced Bhishma's body, though all Shikhandi's arrows were not so effective in wounding Bhishma. At this stage, it was also the desire of Bhishma to die. Before collapsing, he cried out that it was Arjunas arrow that killed him and not of Shikhandi. Bhishma lay on a bed of arrows for days and died on the holy day of Uttarayana. Amba's vengeance was fulfilled when Shikhandi became the cause of Bhishma's death.[1][20]\\r\\n\\r\\nShikhandi is killed in a sword fight with Ashwatthama when Ashwatthama, Kripacharya, and Kritaverma attacked the Pandava camp on the night of the final day of battle.[21]\\r\\n\\r\\nFeminist writer Githa Hariharan tells the story of Amba in The Thousand Faces of Night. Her undaunted courage and dedicated approach to do penance seeking revenge against Bhishma got Amba the epithet \\"incarnation of penance\\".[22]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe spiritual guru Ganapathi Sachchidananda says Amba was a \\"great person\\" and praises her love, fearlessness and resolve, but cautions against emulating the princess, who was never happy driven by revenge. He considers her tale giving the moral to avoid haste in love and life.[23]","input":"Who is the father of amba ambika ambalika?"},{"output":"three","context":"\\r\\nThere were many animals aboard the RMS Titanic during her disastrous maiden voyage, which ended with the ship sinking on 15 April 1912 after colliding with an iceberg.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nThey included dogs,[2] cats,[3] chickens,[4] other birds and an unknown number of rats.[5] Twelve dogs were on the Titanic but only three survived,[6][7] and the rest of the animals perished in the disaster.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe ship had her own official cat named Jenny, who was kept aboard Titanic as a mascot and also worked to keep down the ship's population of rats and mice. Transferred over from Titanic's sister ship Olympic, Jenny gave birth in the week before Titanic sailed from Southampton. She normally lived in the galley, where the victualling staff fed her and her kittens on scraps from the kitchens.[8] Stewardess Violet Jessop wrote that the cat \\"laid her family near Jim, the scullion, whose approval she always sought and who always gave her warm devotion\\".[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nA number of dogs were brought aboard by passengers as pets. Most were kept in kennels on the ship's F Deck, though some First Class passengers kept theirs in their cabins?ÿ probably without the knowledge of the crew or with the turning of a blind eye, as they were not supposed to do so. The ship's carpenter, John Hutchison, was responsible for the dogs' welfare. The kennel dogs were exercised daily on the poop deck by a steward or one of the bellboys.[10] As for the lapdogs, the American painter Francis Davis Millet wrote disapprovingly in a letter sent from Titanic's last stop, Queenstown in Ireland, \\"Looking over the [passenger] list I only find three or four people I know but there are ... a number of obnoxious, ostentatious American women, the scourge of any place they infest, and worse on shipboard than anywhere. Many of them carry tiny dogs, and lead husbands around like pet lambs\\".[11] The dog owners had planned to hold a dog show aboard the ship on the morning of 15 April,[12] but the Titanic would sink the preceding night.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe details of several of the dogs aboard Titanic were recorded and included:\\r\\n\\r\\nThere were probably more dogs aboard, but their details (and owners) have not survived. Passenger Charles Moore of Washington, D.C. made a last-minute change to his plans to transport aboard Titanic 100 English foxhounds, which he intended to use to start an English-style fox hunt in the Washington area. They were instead shipped aboard another vessel.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs well as the dogs and cats, there were a number of birds aboard. Ella Holmes White of New York brought four roosters and hens, which were probably kept in or near the F Deck dog kennels. She had imported them from France with the intention of improving her poultry stock at home. Another woman was said to have brought 30 cockerels aboard and Elizabeth Ramel Nye brought her yellow canary. Two dogs and a canary disembarked with the passengers who left the ship at Cherbourg, Titanic's first port of call after Southampton. The animals travelled on their own tickets and even the canary that left at Cherbourg had to be paid for, to the tune of 25 US cents.[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nLike any other ship of the time, Titanic had a substantial population of rats. One was seen running across the Third Class Dining Room on the evening of the sinking, to the shock and amazement of the diners. Some of the women who saw it burst into tears, while men tried unsuccessfully to capture the rat.[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nFew of Titanic's animals survived the ship's sinking. Three of the dogs were taken aboard lifeboats by their owners. Margaret Hays' Pomeranian got away safely in Lifeboat 7 and lived until June of 1917 when it ran away or was stolen, while Elizabeth Rothschild refused to board Lifeboat 6 unless her dog was allowed to come too. Henry and Myra Harper brought their Pekingese aboard Lifeboat 3, but Helen Bishop had to abandon Frou-Frou in her cabin, much to their mutual distress.[8] The dog attempted to stop her leaving by holding on to her dress with his teeth until the seam tore. Afterwards, Bishop spoke of her sorrow: \\"The loss of my little dog hurt me very much. I will never forget how he dragged on my clothes. He so wanted to accompany me\\".[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nNone of the other animals survived. At some point during the sinking, someone decided to free the dogs from their kennels, leading to a pack of excited dogs racing up and down the slanting deck as the ship went down. One female passenger is said to have refused to be parted from her dog and chose to stay aboard. Several days later, as the SS Bremen passed through an area still strewn with debris and bodies floating in the water, a single passenger saw the body of what she thought was a woman tightly holding what could have been a large shaggy dog in her arms.[10] Robert W. Daniel's bulldog Gamin de Pycombe was last seen in the water swimming for his life after the ship went down.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the sinking, several of the surviving animal owners made compensation claims for their lost pets and poultry. Daniel claimed $750 for the loss of his pedigree bulldog, while Carter claimed $300 for the loss of his two dogs. White claimed $207.87 for her lost chickens and Chow-Chow was valued by Anderson at $50. Only three out of twelve dogs survived the sinking.[10]","input":"How many dogs were among the survivors of the titanic?"},{"output":"May 25, 2018","context":"The Noblesville West Middle School shooting occurred on May 25, 2018 in Noblesville, Indiana when a 13-year-old student shot and injured teacher Jason Seaman and student Ella Whistler.

Simultaneously, the Nepalese government agreed to maintain recruitment at a level that would sustain the existing British Gurkha units and allow the establishment of additional ones. The battalions were increased to thirty-three with the addition of 55,000 new recruits and Gurkha units were placed at the disposal of the British high command for service on all fronts. Many volunteers were assigned to non-combat units, such as the Army Bearer Corps and the labour battalions but they also were in combat in France, Turkey, Palestine and Mesopotamia. The Rana prime ministers urged Nepalese males to fight in the war.

It occurs in several fisheries worldwide, such as in the Florida stone crab (Menippe mercenaria) fishery, the north-east Atlantic deep-water red crab (Chaceon affinis) fishery and in southern Iberia, where the major claws of the fiddler crab Uca tangeri are harvested. Around Northern Europe, an extensive fishery exists for claws of the edible crab, Cancer pagurus. The practice is defended because some crabs can naturally autotomise (shed) limbs and then about a year later after a series of moults, regenerate these limbs.[1] It is argued that declawing therefore provides a sustainable fishery. Claw removal is also promoted to assist in handling of animals, and to decrease losses through entanglement in fishing nets and cannibalism.[2][3] Declawing crabs is legal in the UK since revocation in 2000 of the Crab Claws (Prohibition of Landing) Order 1986. One crab that is subject to widespread declawing is the Florida stone crab, for which tourist information is provided.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTo perform declawing, the claws are snapped downward away from the crab. To ensure a clean break along the natural fracture plane, one finger is placed on the basal cheliped joint. With the cheliped fully extended, a quick, firm downward motion normally removes the claw cleanly. The break usually occurs at the basi-ischum between the coxa at the base of the leg and the merus.\\r\\nIn the 1976ÿ77 trapping season, about 50,000?kg of claws were harvested in the Everglades National Park.[5] This was probably less than 5% of the total Floridian harvest, which has averaged more than 1,000,000 kilograms since 1974.[6]\\r\\nIn Florida during the 1995ÿ96 to 2004ÿ05 fishing seasons, fishers declawed approximately 10.5 million crabs during each 7-month fishing season. The weight of crab claws landings varied without trend since 1989ÿ90. Peak landings were 1.6 million kg statewide in the 1997ÿ98 fishing season. Statewide landings for 2004ÿ05 were 1.4 million kg of claws.[7]\\r\\nUnder experimental conditions, but using commercially accepted techniques, 47% of Florida stone crabs that had both claws removed died after declawing, and 28% of single claw amputees died; 76% of the casualties died within 24 hours of declawing. The claws constituted 51% of the total weight of the crabs before declawing.[8] In the wild, where declawed crabs must compete for food, mates, and shelter, and avoid predators, the mortality rate is likely to be higher. Declawed crabs survive by switching from predation to scavenging.[9] The occurrence of regenerated claws in the fishery harvest is low, with studies calculating from less than 10% (1978),[8] 13% (2006),[7] to 20% (2010).[10] Larger, older crabs generally do not survive long enough to regrow their claws, as they are near the end of their lifespan.\\r\\nMost crabs use their claws for capturing and eating prey. A crab with one claw removed would therefore be disadvantaged in subsequent feeding and a crab with both claws removed even more so. In a study on the effects of declawing on feeding, autotomy induced (declawed) crabs consumed significantly fewer mussels and less mussel mass, but ate more mass of fish (a more readily handled food source). This indicates that the effect of autotomy was a reduction of the ability to feed on mussels, rather than a general reduction of feeding motivation.[2] In a second study, there was no discernible difference in the amount of food consumed by crabs surviving declawing and control crabs.[8] It has been argued that should a crab survive declawing it will not be able to feed effectively and may subsequently die of starvation.[3]\\r\\nDeclawed crabs show significantly lower activity levels than negative controls.[8]\\r\\nThere is debate about whether invertebrates can experience pain. Some of the most compelling evidence for pain in invertebrates exists for crustaceans in terms of trade-offs between stimulus avoidance and other motivational requirements. Evidence of the ability for crabs to feel pain is supported by their possessing an opioid receptor system, showing learned avoidance to putatively painful stimuli, and responding appropriately to analagesics and anaesthetics. These all indicate it is likely that crabs can experience pain during declawing.\\r\\nIt has been argued that because crabs can autotomise (self-amputate) their claws, manual declawing along these natural fracture planes will not cause pain. However, a lack or reduction of pain during autotomy remains to be verified. Moreover, declawing results in a physiological stress response in the edible crab, as indicated by increases in haemolymph glucose and lactate and a decrease in glycogen. This stress is evident both in the short term (<?10?min) and the long term (24?h). Further, declawing is more stressful, results in bigger wounds and causes significant mortality compared to induced autotomy.[11]","input":"How long does it take for a stone crab to grow a new claw?"},{"output":"December 1975","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\"The Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald\\" is a song written, composed, and performed by Canadian singer-songwriter Gordon Lightfoot to commemorate the sinking of the bulk carrier SS Edmund Fitzgerald on Lake Superior on November 10, 1975.

She recorded and released it on her album Mother Tongue (subtitled \\"Maternal Madness, Month by Month\\") that year.[23] Ten years later, after she had joined the band Four Bitchin' Babes, she and the band performed the song live, prefacing it with the comment, \\"With apologies to Gordon Lightfoot.\\" It was included on their album of that year, Gabby Road.[24]\\r\\n\\r\\nExecutive producer Paul Gross wanted to use the song for the Due South episode \\"Mountie on the Bounty\\".

Nitromethane is a highly combustible substance that is generally only used in very specifically designed engines found in Top Fuel drag racing and miniature internal combustion engines in radio control, control line and free flight model aircraft.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe term \\"nitro\\" has only come into use in the last few years to describe these engines and has its origins in marketing hype in the model car market. For the fifty or so years prior to this term since the engines were first developed, they were simply referred to as \\"glow engines\\", but the term \\"nitro\\" has more impact in ad copy. These engines are actually fueled by methanol, but the fuel is often doped with nitromethane as a performance additive. The ignition system consists of a glow plug - hence the older term \\"glow\\" engine - which has a coil of platinum-containing wire alloy, usually platinum-Iridium. The glow plug is heated with electric current for starting, after which power is disconnected and the combination of residual heat and catalytic action of the platinum alloy with methanol ignites the fuel mixture.\\r\\n\\r\\nNitro engines for models can turn in excess of 50,000 RPM. Typical operating rpm for sport model aircraft engines is 10,000-14,000 rpm. For radio control (RC) boats and ducted fan aircraft engines, 20,000-25,000 is the usual range, and for cars rpm in the range of 25,000-37,000 is common. With this much movement, a lot of frictional heat is generated and the fuel used for these engines usually contains between 12-20% oil content depending on the nitromethane and methanol percentage, the engine type and application. Most engines in RC cars today are 2 stroke engines, which means that it takes 2 strokes of the piston (one revolution) to complete the engine cycle. On the first stroke as the piston travels upward, a mixture of fuel and air is sucked into the crankcase, from the carburettor. When the piston travels downward the new fuel air mixture travels into the induction port and finally into the combustion chamber. As the piston travels upward the mixture is compressed which causes the fuel/air mixture to ignite, producing hot gas under pressure to force the piston down. As the piston travels downward the spent exhaust gases escape out of the combustion chamber through the exhaust port, and the cycle starts over by the fuel mixture being again pushed into the induction port.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen starting, the glow plug is electrically preheated by electric current. The glow plug is not to be confused with a spark plug - there is no spark in the glow plug. Catalysis from methanol vapor on the heated platinum element keeps it red-hot even after voltage has been removed, which ignites the fuel and keeps the engine running. Whereas spark plugs are constantly used to ignite the fuel/air mix every time the piston comes up, as seen in the petrol engine where the spark plug is used, the fuel cannot be ignited with compression alone. It is the plug's temperature, still red-hot from previous ignition and from catalysis with the new compressed mixture, that ignites the fuel.\\r\\n\\r\\nNitros engines typically use a carburetor to mix the fuel and air together, although for some applications where throttling is not required they have a simple venturi with a spraybar and needle valve. The carburetor can either be sliding or rotary. On a rotary carburetor, the slide is opened as the arm is turned by the servo. On a slide carburetor the slide is opened by sliding the arm out by the servo. Both are held open slightly by an idle screw which allows the engine to receive a very small amount of fuel to keep the engine running when the vehicle is at a stop. The carburetors usually feature 2 needles used to tune the mixture. A high speed needle tunes how much fuel is allowed into the carburetor at mid to high RPM, and a low speed needle determines how much fuel is allowed into the carburetor at low to mid range RPM. Turning either needle in a clockwise motion will thin the fuel mixture. Lean describes the amount of fuel in the fuel / air mixture. To a point this will make the engine run faster with better performance, but once too lean the engine will overheat, and wear out prematurely due to not receiving enough lubrication. Turning either needle counterclockwise will enrich the fuel mixture (unless the low speed needle is an air bleed in which case the opposite is true). Rich is the opposite of lean, it means more oil (fuel mixture) is entering the engine. If the engine is too rich, it will run poorly, and fuel that has not yet been burnt may start to spit out of the exhaust. The engine will run very slowly and seem to have no power and possibly cut out from being flooded with fuel. Although, being too rich is better than being too lean, because being too rich just means the engine is getting too much oil which is perfectly fine, although performance may not be as good as if the engine were lean. An excessively lean mixture can damage an engine in a short time, as it will run above its design temperature. A properly tuned engine will last a long time with good performance throughout its life.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are several different types of R/C engines. There are on-road, off-road, aircraft, marine, and monster truck engines. \\r\\n\\r\\nOn-road engines are designed to come into their power band from mid to high RPM. These engines can be used in off-road vehicles but are normally used in on-road sedans where very high RPM and high speed is required. Off-road engines have a less abrupt power curve compared to on-road engines. Off-road engines have a power band that extends through most of the RPM range. Off-road engines do not rev as high as on-road engines, but they do have more torque that can easily propel the vehicle it is in to impressive speeds. Off-road engines are usually used in 1/8 scale buggies where high speeds and good acceleration are required.\\r\\n\\r\\nMonster truck engines are generally very large compared to on-road and off-road engines. Where an off-road engine may be 0.21 cubic inch (ci) size, a monster truck engine may be as much as 0.46 ci. Monster truck engines generate much of their torque and horsepower at low to mid range RPM. They are usually used in large and heavy trucks where all that power is needed to get good performance out of the vehicle.\\r\\n\\r\\nAircraft engines are manufactured to be able to sustain high RPM. The biggest difference between all other nitro engines and aircraft engines is the ability to sustain RPM. Other nitro engines tend to break if run at full throttle for a full tank of fuel.\\r\\n\\r\\nMarine engines are cooled with water rather than air like other nitro engines.\\r\\n\\r\\nMembers of the full scale drag racing industry use much higher concentrations of nitromethane: they are limited by the rules to 90% (at least in the NHRA, the main sanctioning body). Historically, racers used higher percentages which frequently caused massive explosions. Modern engines are estimated to generate around 8000 horsepower. The cars can accelerate from 0 to 100mph in 0.8 seconds and 0 to 335mph in 4.5 seconds.","input":"What is nitro fuel for remote control cars?"},{"output":"11 May 330","context":"Greek: 鿼ϫ??\\r\\n\\r\\n6?km2 (2.3?sq?mi) enclosed within Constantinian Walls\\r\\n\\r\\nConstantinople (Greek: 鿼ϫ???Knstantino~polis; Latin: Cnstantؐnopolis) was the capital city of the Roman/Byzantine Empire (330ÿ1204 and 1261ÿ1453), and also of the brief Latin (1204ÿ1261), and the later Ottoman (1453ÿ1923) empires. It was reinaugurated in 324 from ancient Byzantium as the new capital of the Roman Empire by Emperor Constantine the Great, after whom it was named, and dedicated on 11 May 330.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom the mid-5th century to the early 13th century, Constantinople was the largest and wealthiest city in Europe.[6] It was instrumental in the advancement of Christianity during Roman and Byzantine times as the home of the Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople and as the guardian of Christendom's holiest relics such as the Crown of Thorns and the True Cross. After the final loss of its provinces in the early 15th century, the Byzantine Empire was reduced to just Constantinople and its environs, along with Morea in Greece, and the city eventually fell to the Ottomans after a 53-day siege on 29 May 1453.\\r\\n\\r\\nConstantinople was famed for its massive and complex defences. Although besieged on numerous occasions by various peoples, the defences of Constantinople proved invulnerable for nearly nine hundred years before the city was taken in 1204 by the Crusader armies of the Fourth Crusade, and after it was liberated in 1261 by the Byzantine Emperor Michael VIII Palaiologos, a second and final time in 1453 when it was conquered by the Ottoman Sultan Mehmed II. The first wall of the city was erected by Constantine I, and surrounded the city on both land and sea fronts. Later, in the 5th century, the Praetorian Prefect Anthemius under the child emperor Theodosius II undertook the construction of the Theodosian Walls, which consisted of a double wall lying about 2 kilometres (1.2?mi) to the west of the first wall and a moat with palisades in front.[7] This formidable complex of defences was one of the most sophisticated of Antiquity. The city was built intentionally to rival Rome, and it was claimed that several elevations within its walls matched the 'seven hills' of Rome. Because it was located between the Golden Horn and the Sea of Marmara the land area that needed defensive walls was reduced, and this helped it to present an impregnable fortress enclosing magnificent palaces, domes, and towers, the result of the prosperity it achieved from being the gateway between two continents (Europe and Asia) and two seas (the Mediterranean and the Black Sea).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe city was also famed for its architectural masterpieces, such as the Greek Orthodox cathedral of Hagia Sophia, which served as the seat of the Ecumenical Patriarchate, the sacred Imperial Palace where the Emperors lived, the Galata Tower, the Hippodrome, the Golden Gate of the Land Walls, and the opulent aristocratic palaces lining the arcaded avenues and squares. The University of Constantinople was founded in the fifth century and contained numerous artistic and literary treasures before it was sacked in 1204 and 1453,[8] including its vast Imperial Library which contained the remnants of the Library of Alexandria and had over 100,000 volumes of ancient texts.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nConstantinople never truly recovered from the devastation of the Fourth Crusade and the decades of misrule by the Latins. Although the city partially recovered in the early years after the restoration under the Palaiologos dynasty, the advent of the Ottomans and the subsequent loss of the Imperial territories until it became an enclave inside the fledgling Ottoman Empire rendered the city severely depopulated when it fell to the Ottoman Turks,[10] whereafter it replaced Edirne (Adrianople) as the new capital of the Ottoman Empire.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to Pliny the Elder in his Natural History, the first known name of a settlement on the site of Constantinople was Lygos,[12] a settlement likely of Thracian origin founded between the 13th and 11th centuries BC.[13] The site, according to the founding myth of the city, was abandoned by the time Greek settlers from the city-state of Megara founded Byzantium (Ancient Greek: ?, Byzntion) in around 657?BC,[14] across from the town of Chalcedon on the Asiatic side of the Bosphorus.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe origins of the name of Byzantion, more commonly known by the later Latin Byzantium, are not entirely clear, though some suggest it is of Thraco-Illyrian origin.[15][16] The founding myth of the city has it told that the settlement was named after the leader of the Megarian colonists, Byzas. The later Byzantines of Constantinople themselves would maintain that the city was named in honour of two men, Byzas and Antes, though this was more likely just a play on the word Byzantion.[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe city was briefly renamed Augusta Antonina in the early 3rd century AD by the Emperor Septimius Severus (193ÿ211), having razed the city to the ground in 196 for supporting a rival contender in the civil war and rebuilt, in honour of his son Antoninus, the later Emperor Caracalla.[18][19] The name appears to have been quickly forgotten and abandoned, and the city reverted to Byzantium/Byzantion after either the assassination of Caracalla in 217 or, at the latest, the fall of the Severan dynasty in 235.\\r\\n\\r\\nByzantium took on the name of Knstantinoupolis (\\"city of Constantine\\", Constantinople) after its refoundation under Roman emperor Constantine I, who transferred the capital of the Roman Empire to Byzantium in 330 and designated his new capital officially as Nova Roma (?ϫ ??׻) 'New Rome'. During this time, the city was also called 'Second Rome', 'Eastern Rome', and Roma Constantinopolitana.[20] As the city became the sole remaining capital of the Roman Empire after the fall of the West, and its wealth, population, and influence grew, the city also came to have a multitude of nicknames.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the largest and wealthiest city in Europe during the 4thÿ13th centuries and a centre of culture and education of the Mediterranean basin, Constantinople came to be known by prestigious titles such as Basileuousa (Queen of Cities) and Megalopolis (the Great City) and was, in colloquial speech, commonly referred to as just Polis (? ??) 'the City' by Constantinopolitans and provincial Byzantines alike.[21]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the language of other peoples, Constantinople was referred to just as reverently. The medieval Vikings, who had contacts with the empire through their expansion in eastern Europe (Varangians) used the Old Norse name Miklagarer (from mikill 'big' and garer 'city'), and later Miklagard and Miklagarth. In Arabic, the city was sometimes called Rmiyyat al-Kubra (Great City of the Romans) and in Persian as Takht-e Rum (Throne of the Romans).\\r\\n\\r\\nIn East and South Slavic languages, including in medieval Russia, Constantinople has been referred to as Tsargrad (ђ^̰) or Carigrad, 'City of the Caesar (Emperor)', from the Slavonic words tsar ('Caesar' or 'King') and grad ('city'). This was presumably a calque on a Greek phrase such as ϫ?? ?? (Vasileos Polis), 'the city of the emperor [king]'.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe modern Turkish name for the city, ?stanbul, derives from the Greek phrase eis tin polin (?? ? ?), meaning \\"(in)to the city\\".[22] This name was used in Turkish alongside Kostantiniyye, the more formal adaptation of the original Constantinople, during the period of Ottoman rule, while western languages mostly continued to refer to the city as Constantinople until the early 20th century. In 1928, the Turkish alphabet was changed from Arabic script to Latin script. After that, as part of the 1920s Turkification movement, Turkey started to urge other countries to use Turkish names for Turkish cities, instead of other transliterations to Latin script that had been used in the Ottoman times.[23][24][25][26] In time the city came to be known as Istanbul and its variations in most world languages.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe name \\"Constantinople\\" is still used by members of the Eastern Orthodox Church in the title of one of their most important leaders, the Orthodox patriarch based in the city, referred to as \\"His Most Divine All-Holiness the Archbishop of Constantinople New Rome and Ecumenical Patriarch.\\" In Greece today, the city is still called Konstantino~poli(s) (鿼ϫ??/鿼ϫ?) or simply just \\"the City\\" ( ?).\\r\\n\\r\\nConstantinople was founded by the Roman Emperor Constantine I (272ÿ337) in 324[5] on the site of an already-existing city, Byzantium, which was settled in the early days of Greek colonial expansion, in around 657 BC, by colonists of the city-state of Megara. This is the first major settlement that would develop on the site of later Constantinople, but the first known settlements was that of Lygos, referred to in Pliny's Natural Histories[27] . Apart from this, little is known about this initial settlement. The site, according to the founding myth of the city, was abandoned by the time Greek settlers from the city-state of Megara founded Byzantium ({{lang|grc|?|Byzntion) in around 657?BC[18] , across from the town of Chalcedon on the Asiatic side of the Bosphorus.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe city maintained independence as a city-state until it was annexed by Darius I in 512?BC into the Persian Empire, who saw the site as the optimal location to construct a pontoon bridge crossing into Europe as Byzantium was situated at the narrowest point in the Bosphorus strait. Persian rule lasted until 478?BC when as part of the Greek counterattack to the Second Persian Invasion of Greece, a Greek army led by the Spartan general Pausanias captured the city which remained an independent, yet subordinate, city under the Athenians, and later to the Spartans after 411?BC.[28] A farsighted treaty with the emergent power of Rome in c.?150 BC which stipulated tribute in exchange for independent status allowed it to enter Roman rule unscathed.[29] This treaty would pay dividends retrospectively as Byzantium would maintain this independent status, and prosper under peace and stability in the Pax Romana, for nearly three centuries until the late 2nd century AD.[30]\\r\\n\\r\\nByzantium was never a major influential city-state like that of Athens, Corinth or Sparta, but the city enjoyed relative peace and steady growth as a prosperous trading city lent by its remarkable position. The site lay astride the land route from Europe to Asia and the seaway from the Black Sea to the Mediterranean, and had in the Golden Horn an excellent and spacious harbour. Already then, in Greek and early Roman times, Byzantium was famous for its strategic geographic position that made it difficult to besiege and capture, and its position at the crossroads of the Asiatic-European trade route over land and as the gateway between the Mediterranean and Black Seas made it too valuable a settlement to abandon, as Emperor Septimius Severus later realized when he razed the city to the ground for supporting Pescennius Niger's claimancy.[31] It was a move greatly criticized by the contemporary consul and historian Cassius Dio who said that Severus had destroyed \\"a strong Roman outpost and a base of operations against the barbarians from Pontus and Asia\\".[32] He would later rebuild Byzantium towards the end of his reign, in which it would be briefly renamed Augusta Antonina, fortifying it with a new city wall in his name, the Severan Wall.\\r\\n\\r\\nConstantine had altogether more colourful plans. Having restored the unity of the Empire, and, being in the course of major governmental reforms as well as of sponsoring the consolidation of the Christian church, he was well aware that Rome was an unsatisfactory capital. Rome was too far from the frontiers, and hence from the armies and the imperial courts, and it offered an undesirable playground for disaffected politicians. Yet it had been the capital of the state for over a thousand years, and it might have seemed unthinkable to suggest that the capital be moved to a different location. Nevertheless, Constantine identified the site of Byzantium as the right place: a place where an emperor could sit, readily defended, with easy access to the Danube or the Euphrates frontiers, his court supplied from the rich gardens and sophisticated workshops of Roman Asia, his treasuries filled by the wealthiest provinces of the Empire.\\r\\n\\r\\nConstantinople was built over six years, and consecrated on 11 May 330.[5][33] Constantine divided the expanded city, like Rome, into 14 regions, and ornamented it with public works worthy of an imperial metropolis.[34] Yet, at first, Constantine's new Rome did not have all the dignities of old Rome. It possessed a proconsul, rather than an urban prefect. It had no praetors, tribunes, or quaestors. Although it did have senators, they held the title clarus, not clarissimus, like those of Rome. It also lacked the panoply of other administrative offices regulating the food supply, police, statues, temples, sewers, aqueducts, or other public works. The new programme of building was carried out in great haste: columns, marbles, doors, and tiles were taken wholesale from the temples of the empire and moved to the new city. In similar fashion, many of the greatest works of Greek and Roman art were soon to be seen in its squares and streets. The emperor stimulated private building by promising householders gifts of land from the imperial estates in Asiana and Pontica and on 18 May 332 he announced that, as in Rome, free distributions of food would be made to the citizens. At the time, the amount is said to have been 80,000 rations a day, doled out from 117 distribution points around the city.[35]\\r\\n\\r\\nConstantine laid out a new square at the centre of old Byzantium, naming it the Augustaeum. The new senate-house (or Curia) was housed in a basilica on the east side. On the south side of the great square was erected the Great Palace of the Emperor with its imposing entrance, the Chalke, and its ceremonial suite known as the Palace of Daphne. Nearby was the vast Hippodrome for chariot-races, seating over 80,000 spectators, and the famed Baths of Zeuxippus. At the western entrance to the Augustaeum was the Milion, a vaulted monument from which distances were measured across the Eastern Roman Empire.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom the Augustaeum led a great street, the Mese (Greek: ? [ѮѴ??]?'\\"Middle [Street]\\"'), lined with colonnades. As it descended the First Hill of the city and climbed the Second Hill, it passed on the left the Praetorium or law-court. Then it passed through the oval Forum of Constantine where there was a second Senate-house and a high column with a statue of Constantine himself in the guise of Helios, crowned with a halo of seven rays and looking toward the rising sun. From there, the Mese passed on and through the Forum Tauri and then the Forum Bovis, and finally up the Seventh Hill (or Xerolophus) and through to the Golden Gate in the Constantinian Wall. After the construction of the Theodosian Walls in the early 5th century, it was extended to the new Golden Gate, reaching a total length of seven Roman miles.[36]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe importance of Constantinople increased, but it was gradual. From the death of Constantine in 337 to the accession of Theodosius I, emperors had been resident only in the years 337ÿ338, 347ÿ351, 358ÿ361, 368ÿ369. Its status as a capital was recognized by the appointment of the first known Urban Prefect of the City Honoratus, who held office from 11 December 359 until 361. The urban prefects had concurrent jurisdiction over three provinces each in the adjacent dioceses of Thrace (in which the city was located), Pontus and Asia comparable to the 100-mile extraordinary jurisdiction of the prefect of Rome. The emperor Valens, who hated the city and spent only one year there, nevertheless built the Palace of Hebdomon on the shore of the Propontis near the Golden Gate, probably for use when reviewing troops. All the emperors up to Zeno and Basiliscus were crowned and acclaimed at the Hebdomon. Theodosius I founded the Church of John the Baptist to house the skull of the saint (today preserved at the Topkap? Palace), put up a memorial pillar to himself in the Forum of Taurus, and turned the ruined temple of Aphrodite into a coach house for the Praetorian Prefect; Arcadius built a new forum named after himself on the Mese, near the walls of Constantine.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the shock of the Battle of Adrianople in 378, in which the emperor Valens with the flower of the Roman armies was destroyed by the Visigoths within a few days' march, the city looked to its defences, and in 413ÿ414 Theodosius II built the 18-metre (60-foot)-tall triple-wall fortifications, which were not to be breached until the coming of gunpowder. Theodosius also founded a University near the Forum of Taurus, on 27 February 425.\\r\\n\\r\\nUldin, a prince of the Huns, appeared on the Danube about this time and advanced into Thrace, but he was deserted by many of his followers, who joined with the Romans in driving their king back north of the river. Subsequent to this, new walls were built to defend the city and the fleet on the Danube improved.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the barbarians overran the Western Roman Empire, Constantinople became the indisputable capital city of the Roman Empire. Emperors were no longer peripatetic between various court capitals and palaces. They remained in their palace in the Great City and sent generals to command their armies. The wealth of the eastern Mediterranean and western Asia flowed into Constantinople.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe emperor Justinian I (527ÿ565) was known for his successes in war, for his legal reforms and for his public works. It was from Constantinople that his expedition for the reconquest of the former Diocese of Africa set sail on or about 21 June 533. Before their departure, the ship of the commander Belisarius was anchored in front of the Imperial palace, and the Patriarch offered prayers for the success of the enterprise. After the victory, in 534, the Temple treasure of Jerusalem, looted by the Romans in AD?70 and taken to Carthage by the Vandals after their sack of Rome in 455, was brought to Constantinople and deposited for a time, perhaps in the Church of St. Polyeuctus, before being returned to Jerusalem in either the Church of the Resurrection or the New Church.[38]\\r\\n\\r\\nChariot-racing had been important in Rome for centuries. In Constantinople, the hippodrome became over time increasingly a place of political significance. It was where (as a shadow of the popular elections of old Rome) the people by acclamation showed their approval of a new emperor, and also where they openly criticized the government, or clamoured for the removal of unpopular ministers. In the time of Justinian, public order in Constantinople became a critical political issue.\\r\\n\\r\\nThroughout the late Roman and early Byzantine periods, Christianity was resolving fundamental questions of identity, and the dispute between the orthodox and the monophysites became the cause of serious disorder, expressed through allegiance to the horse-racing parties of the Blues and the Greens. The partisans of the Blues and the Greens were said[39] to affect untrimmed facial hair, head hair shaved at the front and grown long at the back, and wide-sleeved tunics tight at the wrist; and to form gangs to engage in night-time muggings and street violence. At last these disorders took the form of a major rebellion of 532, known as the \\"Nika\\" riots (from the battle-cry of \\"Conquer!\\" of those involved).[40]\\r\\n\\r\\nFires started by the Nika rioters consumed Constantine's basilica of Hagia Sophia (Holy Wisdom), the city's principal church, which lay to the north of the Augustaeum. Justinian commissioned Anthemius of Tralles and Isidore of Miletus to replace it with a new and incomparable Hagia Sophia. This was the great cathedral of the Orthodox Church, whose dome was said to be held aloft by God alone, and which was directly connected to the palace so that the imperial family could attend services without passing through the streets.[41] The dedication took place on 26 December 537 in the presence of the emperor, who exclaimed, \\"O Solomon, I have outdone thee!\\"[42] Hagia Sophia was served by 600 people including 80 priests, and cost 20,000 pounds of gold to build.[43]\\r\\n\\r\\nJustinian also had Anthemius and Isidore demolish and replace the original Church of the Holy Apostles built by Constantine with a new church under the same dedication. This was designed in the form of an equal-armed cross with five domes, and ornamented with beautiful mosaics. This church was to remain the burial place of the Emperors from Constantine himself until the 11th century. When the city fell to the Turks in 1453, the church was demolished to make room for the tomb of Mehmet II the Conqueror. Justinian was also concerned with other aspects of the city's built environment, legislating against the abuse of laws prohibiting building within 100 feet (30?m) of the sea front, in order to protect the view.[44]\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring Justinian I's reign, the city's population reached about 500,000 people.[45] However, the social fabric of Constantinople was also damaged by the onset of the Plague of Justinian between 541ÿ542 AD. It killed perhaps 40% of the city's inhabitants.[46]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the early 7th century, the Avars and later the Bulgars overwhelmed much of the Balkans, threatening Constantinople with attack from the west. Simultaneously, the Persian Sassanids overwhelmed the Prefecture of the East and penetrated deep into Anatolia. Heraclius, son of the exarch of Africa, set sail for the city and assumed the purple. He found the military situation so dire that he is said to have contemplated withdrawing the imperial capital to Carthage, but relented after the people of Constantinople begged him to stay. The citizens lost their right to free grain in 618 when Heraclius realised that the city could no longer be supplied from Egypt as a result of the Persian wars: the population fell substantially as a result.[47]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile the city withstood a siege by the Sassanids and Avars in 626, Heraclius campaigned deep into Persian territory and briefly restored the status quo in 628, when the Persians surrendered all their conquests. However, further sieges followed the Arab conquests, first from 674 to 678 and then in 717 to 718. The Theodosian Walls kept the city impregnable from the land, while a newly discovered incendiary substance known as Greek Fire allowed the Byzantine navy to destroy the Arab fleets and keep the city supplied. In the second siege, the second ruler of Bulgaria, Khan Tervel, rendered decisive help. He was called Saviour of Europe.[48]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the 730s Leo III carried out extensive repairs of the Theodosian walls, which had been damaged by frequent and violent attacks; this work was financed by a special tax on all the subjects of the Empire.[49]\\r\\n\\r\\nTheodora, widow of the Emperor Theophilus (died 842), acted as regent during the minority of her son Michael III, who was said to have been introduced to dissolute habits by her brother Bardas. When Michael assumed power in 856, he became known for excessive drunkenness, appeared in the hippodrome as a charioteer and burlesqued the religious processions of the clergy. He removed Theodora from the Great Palace to the Carian Palace and later to the monastery of Gastria, but, after the death of Bardas, she was released to live in the palace of St Mamas; she also had a rural residence at the Anthemian Palace, where Michael was assassinated in 867.[50]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 860, an attack was made on the city by a new principality set up a few years earlier at Kiev by Askold and Dir, two Varangian chiefs: Two hundred small vessels passed through the Bosporus and plundered the monasteries and other properties on the suburban Prince's Islands. Oryphas, the admiral of the Byzantine fleet, alerted the emperor Michael, who promptly put the invaders to flight; but the suddenness and savagery of the onslaught made a deep impression on the citizens.[51]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 980, the emperor Basil II received an unusual gift from Prince Vladimir of Kiev: 6,000 Varangian warriors, which Basil formed into a new bodyguard known as the Varangian Guard. They were known for their ferocity, honour, and loyalty. It is said that, in 1038, they were dispersed in winter quarters in the Thracesian theme when one of their number attempted to violate a countrywoman, but in the struggle she seized his sword and killed him; instead of taking revenge, however, his comrades applauded her conduct, compensated her with all his possessions, and exposed his body without burial as if he had committed suicide.[52] However, following the death of an Emperor, they became known also for plunder in the Imperial palaces.[53] Later in the 11th Century the Varangian Guard became dominated by Anglo-Saxons who preferred this way of life to subjugation by the new Norman kings of England.[54]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Book of the Eparch, which dates to the 10th century, gives a detailed picture of the city's commercial life and its organization at that time. The corporations in which the tradesmen of Constantinople were organised were supervised by the Eparch, who regulated such matters as production, prices, import, and export. Each guild had its own monopoly, and tradesmen might not belong to more than one. It is an impressive testament to the strength of tradition how little these arrangements had changed since the office, then known by the Latin version of its title, had been set up in 330 to mirror the urban prefecture of Rome.[55]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the 9th and 10th centuries, Constantinople had a population of between 500,000 and 800,000.[56]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the 8th and 9th centuries, the iconoclast movement caused serious political unrest throughout the Empire. The emperor Leo III issued a decree in 726 against images, and ordered the destruction of a statue of Christ over one of the doors of the Chalke, an act that was fiercely resisted by the citizens.[57] Constantine V convoked a church council in 754, which condemned the worship of images, after which many treasures were broken, burned, or painted over with depictions of trees, birds or animals: One source refers to the church of the Holy Virgin at Blachernae as having been transformed into a \\"fruit store and aviary\\".[58] Following the death of her son Leo IV in 780, the empress Irene restored the veneration of images through the agency of the Second Council of Nicaea in 787.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe iconoclast controversy returned in the early 9th century, only to be resolved once more in 843 during the regency of Empress Theodora, who restored the icons. These controversies contributed to the deterioration of relations between the Western and the Eastern Churches.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the late 11th century catastrophe struck with the unexpected and calamitous defeat of the imperial armies at the Battle of Manzikert in Armenia in 1071. The Emperor Romanus Diogenes was captured. The peace terms demanded by Alp Arslan, sultan of the Seljuk Turks, were not excessive, and Romanus accepted them. On his release, however, Romanus found that enemies had placed their own candidate on the throne in his absence; he surrendered to them and suffered death by torture, and the new ruler, Michael VII Ducas, refused to honour the treaty. In response, the Turks began to move into Anatolia in 1073. The collapse of the old defensive system meant that they met no opposition, and the empire's resources were distracted and squandered in a series of civil wars. Thousands of Turkoman tribesmen crossed the unguarded frontier and moved into Anatolia. By 1080, a huge area had been lost to the Empire, and the Turks were within striking distance of Constantinople.\\r\\n\\r\\nUnder the Comnenian dynasty (1081ÿ1185), Byzantium staged a remarkable recovery. In 1090ÿ91, the nomadic Pechenegs reached the walls of Constantinople, where Emperor Alexius I with the aid of the Kipchaks annihilated their army.[59] In response to a call for aid from Alexius, the First Crusade assembled at Constantinople in 1096, but declining to put itself under Byzantine command set out for Jerusalem on its own account.[60] John II built the monastery of the Pantocrator (Almighty) with a hospital for the poor of 50 beds.[61]\\r\\n\\r\\nWith the restoration of firm central government, the empire became fabulously wealthy. The population was rising (estimates for Constantinople in the 12th century vary from some 100,000 to 500,000), and towns and cities across the realm flourished. Meanwhile, the volume of money in circulation dramatically increased. This was reflected in Constantinople by the construction of the Blachernae palace, the creation of brilliant new works of art, and general prosperity at this time: an increase in trade, made possible by the growth of the Italian city-states, may have helped the growth of the economy. It is certain that the Venetians and others were active traders in Constantinople, making a living out of shipping goods between the Crusader Kingdoms of Outremer and the West, while also trading extensively with Byzantium and Egypt. The Venetians had factories on the north side of the Golden Horn, and large numbers of westerners were present in the city throughout the 12th century. Toward the end of Manuel I Komnenos's reign, the number of foreigners in the city reached about 60,000ÿ80,000 people out of a total population of about 400,000 people.[62] In 1171, Constantinople also contained a small community of 2,500 Jews.[63] In 1182, all Latin (Western European) inhabitants of Constantinople were massacred.[64]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn artistic terms, the 12th century was a very productive period. There was a revival in the mosaic art, for example: Mosaics became more realistic and vivid, with an increased emphasis on depicting three-dimensional forms. There was an increased demand for art, with more people having access to the necessary wealth to commission and pay for such work. According to N.H. Baynes (Byzantium, An Introduction to East Roman Civilization):\\r\\n\\r\\nWith its love of luxury and passion for colour, the art of this age delighted in the production of masterpieces that spread the fame of Byzantium throughout the whole of the Christian world. Beautiful silks from the workshops of Constantinople also portrayed in dazzling colour animals ÿ lions, elephants, eagles, and griffins ÿ confronting each other, or represented Emperors gorgeously arrayed on horseback or engaged in the chase.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom the tenth to the twelfth century Byzantium was the main source of inspiration for the West. By their style, arrangement, and iconography the mosaics of St. Mark's at Venice and of the cathedral at Torcello clearly reveal their Byzantine origin. Similarly those of the Palatine Chapel, the Martorana at Palermo, and the cathedral of Cefal, together with the vast decoration of the cathedral at Monreale, demonstrate the influence of Byzantium on the Norman Court of Sicily in the twelfth century. Hispano-Moorish art was unquestionably derived from the Byzantine. Romanesque art owes much to the East, from which it borrowed not only its decorative forms but the plan of some of its buildings, as is proved, for instance, by the domed churches of south-western France. Princes of Kiev, Venetian doges, abbots of Monte Cassino, merchants of Amalfi, and the kings of Sicily all looked to Byzantium for artists or works of art. Such was the influence of Byzantine art in the twelfth century, that Russia, Venice, southern Italy and Sicily all virtually became provincial centres dedicated to its production.\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 25 July 1197, Constantinople was struck by a severe fire which burned the Latin Quarter and the area around the Gate of the Droungarios (Turkish: Odun Kap?s?) on the Golden Horn.[65][66] Nevertheless, the destruction wrought by the 1197 fire paled in comparison with that brought by the Crusaders. In the course of a plot between Philip of Swabia, Boniface of Montferrat and the Doge of Venice, the Fourth Crusade was, despite papal excommunication, diverted in 1203 against Constantinople, ostensibly promoting the claims of Alexius, son of the deposed emperor Isaac. The reigning emperor Alexius III had made no preparation. The Crusaders occupied Galata, broke the defensive chain protecting the Golden Horn, and entered the harbour, where on 27 July they breached the sea walls: Alexius III fled. But the new Alexius IV found the Treasury inadequate, and was unable to make good the rewards he had promised to his western allies. Tension between the citizens and the Latin soldiers increased. In January 1204, the protovestiarius Alexius Murzuphlus provoked a riot, it is presumed, to intimidate Alexius IV, but whose only result was the destruction of the great statue of Athena, the work of Phidias, which stood in the principal forum facing west.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn February 1198, the people rose again: Alexius IV was imprisoned and executed, and Murzuphlus took the purple as Alexius V. He made some attempt to repair the walls and organise the citizenry, but there had been no opportunity to bring in troops from the provinces and the guards were demoralised by the revolution. An attack by the Crusaders on 6 April failed, but a second from the Golden Horn on 12 April succeeded, and the invaders poured in. Alexius V fled. The Senate met in Hagia Sophia and offered the crown to Theodore Lascaris, who had married into the Angelid family, but it was too late. He came out with the Patriarch to the Golden Milestone before the Great Palace and addressed the Varangian Guard. Then the two of them slipped away with many of the nobility and embarked for Asia. By the next day the Doge and the leading Franks were installed in the Great Palace, and the city was given over to pillage for three days.\\r\\n\\r\\nSir Steven Runciman, historian of the Crusades, wrote that the sack of Constantinople is unparalleled in history.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor nine centuries, he goes on, the great city had been the capital of Christian civilisation. It was filled with works of art that had survived from ancient Greece and with the masterpieces of its own exquisite craftsmen. The Venetians ... seized treasures and carried them off to adorn ... their town. But the Frenchmen and Flemings were filled with a lust for destruction. They rushed in a howling mob down the streets and through the houses, snatching up everything that glittered and destroying whatever they could not carry, pausing only to murder or to rape, or to break open the wine-cellars ... . Neither monasteries nor churches nor libraries were spared. In Hagia Sophia itself, drunken soldiers could be seen tearing down the silken hangings and pulling the great silver iconostasis to pieces, while sacred books and icons were trampled under foot. While they drank merrily from the altar-vessels a prostitute set herself on the Patriarchs throne and began to sing a ribald French song. Nuns were ravished in their convents. Palaces and hovels alike were entered and wrecked. Wounded women and children lay dying in the streets. For three days the ghastly scenes ... continued, till the huge and beautiful city was a shambles. ... When ... order was restored, ... citizens were tortured to make them reveal the goods that they had contrived to hide.[67]\\r\\n\\r\\nFor the next half-century, Constantinople was the seat of the Latin Empire. Under the rulers of the Latin Empire, the city declined, both in population and the condition of its buildings. Alice-Mary Talbot cites an estimated population for Constantinople of 400,000 inhabitants; after the destruction wrought by the Crusaders on the city, about one third were homeless, and numerous courtiers, nobility, and higher clergy, followed various leading personages into exile. \\"As a result Constantinople became seriously depopulated,\\" Talbot concludes.[68]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Latins took over at least 20 churches and 13 monasteries, most prominently the Hagia Sophia, which became the cathedral of the Latin Patriarch of Constantinople. It is to these that E.H. Swift attributed the construction of a series of flying buttresses to shore up the walls of the church, which had been weakened over the centuries by earthquake tremors.[69] However, this act of maintenance is an exception: for the most part, the Latin occupiers were too few to maintain all of the buildings, either secular and sacred, and many became targets for vandalism or dismantling. Bronze and lead were removed from the roofs of abandoned buildings and melted down and sold to provide money to the chronically under-funded Empire for defense and to support the court; Deno John Geanokoplos writes that \\"it may well be that a division is suggested here: Latin laymen stripped secular buildings, ecclesiastics, the churches.\\"[70] Buildings were not the only targets of officials looking to raise funds for the impoverished Latin Empire: the monumental sculptures which adorned the Hippodrome and fora of the city were pulled down and melted for coinage. \\"Among the masterpieces destroyed, writes Talbot, \\"were a Herakles attributed to the fourth-century B.C. sculptor Lysippos, and monumental figures of Hera, Paris, and Helen.\\"[71]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Nicaean emperor John III Vatatzes reportedly saved several churches from being dismantled for their valuable building materials; by sending money to the Latins \\"to buy them off\\" (exonesamenos), he prevented the destruction of several churches.[72] According to Talbot, these included the churches of Blachernae, Rouphinianai, and St. Michael at Anaplous. He also granted funds for the restoration of the Church of the Holy Apostles, which had been seriously damaged in an earthquake.[71]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Byzantine nobility scattered, many going to Nicaea, where Theodore Lascaris set up an imperial court, or to Epirus, where Theodore Angelus did the same; others fled to Trebizond, where one of the Comneni had already with Georgian support established an independent seat of empire.[73] Nicaea and Epirus both vied for the imperial title, and tried to recover Constantinople. In 1261, Constantinople was captured from its last Latin ruler, Baldwin II, by the forces of the Nicaean emperor Michael VIII Palaiologos.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough Constantinople was retaken by Michael VIII Palaiologos, the Empire had lost many of its key economic resources, and struggled to survive. The palace of Blachernae in the north-west of the city became the main Imperial residence, with the old Great Palace on the shores of the Bosporus going into decline. When Michael VIII captured the city, its population was 35,000 people, but, by the end of his reign, he had succeeded in increasing the population to about 70,000 people.[74] The Emperor achieved this by summoning former residents who had fled the city when the crusaders captured it, and by relocating Greeks from the recently reconquered Peloponnese to the capital.[75] In 1347, the Black Death spread to Constantinople.[76] In 1453, when the Ottoman Turks captured the city, it contained approximately 50,000 people.[77]\\r\\n\\r\\nConstantinople was conquered by the Ottoman Empire on 29 May 1453. The Ottomans were commanded by 22-year-old Ottoman Sultan Mehmed II. The conquest of Constantinople followed a seven-week siege which had begun on 6 April 1453.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Christian Orthodox city of Constantinople was now under Ottoman control. When Mehmed II finally entered Constantinople through what is now known as the Topkapi Gate, he immediately rode his horse to the Hagia Sophia, where he ordered his soldiers to stop hacking at the marbles and 'be satisfied with the booty and captives; as for all the buildings, they belonged to him'.[78] He ordered that an imam meet him there in order to chant the adhan thus transforming the Orthodox cathedral into a Muslim mosque,[78][79] solidifying Islamic rule in Constantinople.\\r\\n\\r\\nMehmeds main concern with Constantinople had to do with rebuilding the citys defenses and population. Building projects were commenced immediately after the conquest, which included the repair of the walls, construction of the citadel, and building a new palace.[80] Mehmed issued orders across his empire that Muslims, Christians, and Jews should resettle the city; he demanded that five thousand households needed to be transferred to Constantinople by September.[80] From all over the Islamic empire, prisoners of war and deported people were sent to the city: these people were called \\"Srgn\\" in Turkish (Greek: ?Ѵ?).[10] Two centuries later, Ottoman traveler Evliya ?elebi gave a list of groups introduced into the city with their respective origins. Even today, many quarters of Istanbul, such as Aksaray, ?ar?amba, bear the names of the places of origin of their inhabitants.[10] However, many people escaped again from the city, and there were several outbreaks of plague, so that in 1459 Mehmet allowed the deported Greeks to come back to the city.[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nConstantinople was the largest and richest urban center in the Eastern Mediterranean Sea during the late Eastern Roman Empire, mostly as a result of its strategic position commanding the trade routes between the Aegean Sea and the Black Sea. It would remain the capital of the eastern, Greek-speaking empire for over a thousand years. At its peak, roughly corresponding to the Middle Ages, it was the richest and largest European city, exerting a powerful cultural pull and dominating economic life in the Mediterranean. Visitors and merchants were especially struck by the beautiful monasteries and churches of the city, in particular the Hagia Sophia, or the Church of Holy Wisdom. According to Russian 14th-century traveler Stephen of Novgorod: \\"As for Hagia Sophia, the human mind can neither tell it nor make description of it.\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was especially important for preserving in its libraries manuscripts of Greek and Latin authors throughout a period when instability and disorder caused their mass-destruction in western Europe and north Africa: On the city's fall, thousands of these were brought by refugees to Italy, and played a key part in stimulating the Renaissance, and the transition to the modern world. The cumulative influence of the city on the west, over the many centuries of its existence, is incalculable. In terms of technology, art and culture, as well as sheer size, Constantinople was without parallel anywhere in Europe for a thousand years.\\r\\n\\r\\nArmenians, Syrians, Slavs, and Georgians were part of the Byzantine social hierarchy.[81]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe city provided a defence for the eastern provinces of the old Roman Empire against the barbarian invasions of the 5th century. The 18-meter-tall walls built by Theodosius II were, in essence, impregnable to the barbarians coming from south of the Danube river, who found easier targets to the west rather than the richer provinces to the east in Asia. From the 5th century, the city was also protected by the Anastasian Wall, a 60-kilometer chain of walls across the Thracian peninsula. Many scholars[who?] argue that these sophisticated fortifications allowed the east to develop relatively unmolested while Ancient Rome and the west collapsed.[82]\\r\\n\\r\\nConstantinople's fame was such that it was described even in contemporary Chinese histories, the Old and New Book of Tang, which mentioned its massive walls and gates as well as a purported clepsydra mounted with a golden statue of a man.[83][84][85] The Chinese histories even related how the city had been besieged in the 7th century by Muawiyah I and how he exacted tribute in a peace settlement.[84][86]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Byzantine Empire used Roman and Greek architectural models and styles to create its own unique type of architecture. The influence of Byzantine architecture and art can be seen in the copies taken from it throughout Europe. Particular examples include St Mark's Basilica in Venice, the basilicas of Ravenna, and many churches throughout the Slavic East. Also, alone in Europe until the 13th-century Italian florin, the Empire continued to produce sound gold coinage, the solidus of Diocletian becoming the bezant prized throughout the Middle Ages. Its city walls were much imitated (for example, see Caernarfon Castle) and its urban infrastructure was moreover a marvel throughout the Middle Ages, keeping alive the art, skill and technical expertise of the Roman Empire. In the Ottoman period Islamic architecture and symbolism were used.\\r\\n\\r\\nConstantine's foundation gave prestige to the Bishop of Constantinople, who eventually came to be known as the Ecumenical Patriarch, and made it a prime center of Christianity alongside Rome. This contributed to cultural and theological differences between Eastern and Western Christianity eventually leading to the Great Schism that divided Western Catholicism from Eastern Orthodoxy from 1054 onwards. Constantinople is also of great religious importance to Islam, as the conquest of Constantinople is one of the signs of the End time in Islam.","input":"When it was first established the city of constantinople?"},{"output":"Marnell Corrao Associates","context":"Rio Las Vegas is a hotel and casino near the Las Vegas Strip in Paradise, Nevada, United States.

It traditionally appears fourth, after the Synoptic Gospels of Matthew, Mark, and Luke.\\r\\nAlthough the Gospel of John is anonymous,[1] Christian tradition historically has attributed it to John the Apostle, son of Zebedee and one of Jesus' Twelve Apostles. The gospel is so closely related in style and content to the three surviving Johannine epistles that commentators treat the four books,[2] along with the Book of Revelation, as a single corpus of Johannine literature, albeit not necessarily written by the same author.[Notes 1]\\r\\nC. K. Barrett,[3][Notes 2] and later Raymond E. Brown,[5] suggested that a tradition developed around the \\"Johannine Community\\", and that this tradition gave rise to the gospel.[6] The discovery of a large number of papyrus fragments of manuscripts with Johannine themes has led more scholars to recognize that the texts were among the most influential in the early Church.[7]\\r\\nThe discourses contained in this gospel seem to be concerned with issues of the churchÿsynagogue debate at the time of composition.[8] It is notable that in John, the community appears to define itself primarily in contrast to Judaism, rather than as part of a wider Christian community.[Notes 3] Though Christianity started as a movement within Judaism, it gradually separated from Judaism because of mutual opposition between the two religions.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Gospel of John can be divided into four sections: a prologue (1:1ÿ18), a Book of Signs (1:19ÿ12:50), a Book of Glory (13:1ÿ20:31), and an epilogue (21).[10] The structure is highly schematic: there are seven \\"signs\\" culminating in the raising of Lazarus (foreshadowing the resurrection of Jesus), and seven \\"I am\\" sayings and discourses, culminating in Thomas's proclamation of Jesus as \\"my Lord and my God\\"the same title (dominus et deus) claimed by Roman Emperor Domitian.[11]\\r\\nJesus is placed in his cosmic setting as the Logos made flesh who reveals God and gives salvation to believers; John the Baptist, Andrew, and Nathanael bear witness to him as the Lamb of God, the Son of God, and the Christ.[12]\\r\\nThe narrative of Jesus' public ministry, beginning with the introduction of the first disciples of Jesus. It consists of seven miracles, or \\"signs\\", interspersed with long dialogues, discourses, \\"Amen, amen\\" sayings, and \\"I Am\\" sayings, culminating with the raising of Lazarus from the dead. In John it is this, and not the cleansing of the Temple, that prompts the authorities to have Jesus executed. The seven signs consist of Jesus' miracle at the wedding at Cana, his healing the royal official's son, his healing the paralytic at Bethesda, his feeding the 5,000, his walking on water, his healing the man born blind, and his raising Lazarus from the dead. Other incidents recounted in this segment of the gospel include the cleansing of the Temple; Jesus' conversation with the Pharisee Nicodemus, wherein he explains the importance of spiritual rebirth; his conversation with the Samaritan woman at the well, wherein he gives the Water of Life Discourse; the Bread of Life Discourse, which prompted many of his disciples to leave; the Woman Taken in Adultery; Jesus' claims to be the Light of the World; Jesus' answer to Pilate; the Good Shepherd pericope; Jesus' rejection by the Jews; the Jesus wept; the plot to kill Jesus; the anointing of Jesus; Jesus' triumphal entry into Jerusalem; the prediction of the glorification of the Son of Man; and the prediction of the Last Judgment.\\r\\nThe narrative of Jesus' Passion, Resurrection, and post-Resurrection appearances. The Passion narrative opens with an account of the Last Supper that differs significantly from that found in the Synoptics, with Jesus washing the disciples' feet instead of ushering in a new covenant of his body and blood.[13] This is followed by Jesus' Farewell Discourse, an account of his betrayal, arrest, trial, death, burial, post-Resurrection appearances,[Notes 4] and final commission for his followers. It also includes Peter's denial, the institution of the New Commandment and the New Covenant, the promise of the Paraclete, the allegory of the True Vine, the High Priestly Prayer, the ut omnes unum sint, the What is truth?, Jesus' mocking and crowning with thorns, the Ecce homo, the discovery of the empty tomb, the noli me tangere, the Great Commission, and the incredulity of Thomas. The section ends with a conclusion on the purpose of the gospel: \\"that [the reader] may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that believing you may have life in his name.\\"[12]\\r\\nThe narrative of Jesus' post-Resurrection appearance to his disciples by the lake, the miraculous catch of fish, the prophecy of the crucifixion of Peter, the restoration of Peter, and the fate of the Beloved Disciple.[12] A majority of modern scholars believes this chapter not to be integral to the original gospel.[14]\\r\\nMost scholars consider the Gospel of John to be anonymous. According to a Church tradition dating from the 2nd century, first attested by Irenaeus, the author was \\"the Disciple whom Jesus loved\\" mentioned in John 21:24,[15] who is understood to be John son of Zebedee, one of Jesus' Twelve Apostles.[16] These identifications, however, are rejected by many modern biblical scholars.[1][17][Notes 5] Nevertheless, the author of the fourth Gospel is sometimes called John the Evangelist, often out of convenience since the definitive name of the author is still debated.\\r\\nJohn is usually dated to AD 90ÿ110.[18][Notes 6] It arose in a Jewish Christian community in the process of breaking from the Jewish synagogue.[19] Scholars believe that the text went through two to three redactions, or \\"editions\\", before reaching its current form.[20][21]\\r\\nJohn, which regularly describes Jesus' opponents simply as \\"the Jews\\", is more consistently hostile to \\"the Jews\\" than any other body of New Testament writing.[22][Notes 7] Historian and former Roman Catholic priest James Carroll states: \\"The climax of this movement comes in chapter 8 of John, when Jesus is portrayed as denouncing 'the Jews' who were gathered at the Temple as the offspring of Satan.\\"[23] In John 8:44 Jesus tells the Jews: \\"You are of your father the devil, and the desires of your father you will do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and he stood not in the truth; because truth is not in him.\\" In 8:38 and 11:53, \\"the Jews\\" are depicted as wishing to kill Jesus. However, Carroll cautions that this and similar statements in the Gospel of Matthew and the 1 Thessalonians should be viewed as \\"evidence not of Jew hatred but of sectarian conflicts among Jews\\" in the early years of the Christian church.[24]\\r\\nAs noted by New Testament scholar Obrey M. Hendricks, Jr.: \\"Although its scathing portrayal of the Jews has opened John to charges of anti-Semitism, a careful reading reveals 'the Jews' to be a class designation, not a religious or ethnic grouping; rather than denoting adherents to Judaism in general, the term primarily refers to the hereditary Temple religious authorities.\\"[25] In later centuries, John was used to support anti-Semitic polemics, but the author of the gospel regarded himself as a Jew, championed Jesus and his followers as Jews, and probably wrote for a largely Jewish community.[26][27]\\r\\nRudolf Bultmann, in a seminal work published in 1941, argued that John's sources were a hypothetical \\"Signs Gospel\\" listing Christ's miracles, a revelation discourse, and a passion narrative. Bultmann's work, combined with that of other scholars (the work of Raymond E. Brown was particularly influential in the English-speaking world), led to a scholarly consensus in the second half of the 20th century that the Gospel of John was independent of Matthew, Mark, and Luke, known as the \\"Synoptic Gospels.\\" This agreement broke down in the last decade of the century, and there are now many scholars who believe that John did know the Synoptics, especially Mark, while the hypothesis of a \\"signs\\" source has been increasingly undermined.[28]\\r\\nBut theories of either complete independence or complete dependence on the Synoptics are largely rejected in current scholarship: on the one hand, elements such as distinctive Johannine language, the lengthy discourses, and the prologue on the Logos, are clearly unique to John; on the other, John clearly shares a multitude of episodes with the other three.[29]\\r\\nThe most important sources used by the evangelist were the Jewish scriptures (the Tanakh, more or less identical with the Christian Old Testament), probably in the Greek translation. John quotes from them directly, references important figures from them, and uses narratives from them as the basis for several of the discourses. But the author was also familiar with non-Jewish sources: the Logos of the prologue (the Word that is with God from the beginning of creation) derives from both the Jewish concept of Lady Wisdom and from the Greek philosophers, while John 6 alludes not only to the exodus but also to Greco-Roman mystery cults, while John 4 alludes to Samaritan messianic beliefs.[30]\\r\\nChapters 19 and 21 of John hint that \\"the Disciple whom Jesus loved\\", or \\"the Beloved Disciple\\", was an eyewitness to Jesus' ministry, but the majority of scholars are cautious of accepting this at face value.[31][32] With the exception of the \\"Johannine Thunderbolt\\" passages,[Notes 8] the teachings of Jesus found in the synoptic gospels are very different from those recorded in John, and since the 19th century some scholars have argued that these discourses in Johannine style are less likely to be historical, and more likely to have been written for theological purposes.[34]\\r\\nScholars usually agree that John is not entirely without historical value.[35] It has become generally accepted that certain sayings in John are as old or older than their synoptic counterparts. His representation of the topography around Jerusalem is often superior to that of the Synoptics, his testimony that Jesus was executed before, rather than on, Passover, might well be more accurate, and his presentation of Jesus in the garden and the prior meeting held by the Jewish authorities are possibly more historically plausible than their synoptic parallels.[35]\\r\\nRylands Library Papyrus P52, a Greek papyrus fragment with John 18:31ÿ33 on one side and 18:37ÿ38 on the other, commonly dated to the first half of the 2nd century, is the oldest New Testament manuscript known.[36] A substantially complete text of John exists from the beginning of the 3rd century at the latest, so that the textual evidence for this gospel is commonly accepted as both earlier and more reliable than that for any other. John stands fourth in the standard ordering of the gospels, after Matthew, Mark and Luke.\\r\\nThe Gospel of John presents a \\"high Christology,\\" depicting Jesus as divine, and yet subordinate to the one God.[37] John gives more focus to the relationship of the Son to the Father than the Synoptics, as seen in chapter 17 of the gospel. In the Synoptics, Jesus speaks often about the Kingdom of God while his own divine role is obscured (see Messianic Secret), but in John, Jesus talks openly about his divine role, echoing the Jewish God's own statement of identity \\"I Am that I Am\\" with several \\"I Am\\" declarations that also identify him with symbols of major significance.[38] He says \\"I am\\":\\r\\nIn the prologue, John identifies Jesus as the Logos (Word). In Ancient Greek philosophy, the term logos meant the principle of cosmic reason. In this sense, it was similar to the Hebrew concept of Wisdom, God's companion and intimate helper in creation. The Hellenistic Jewish philosopher Philo merged these two themes when he described the Logos as God's creator of and mediator with the material world. The evangelist adapted Philo's description of the Logos, applying it to Jesus, the incarnation of the Logos.[38]\\r\\nThe opening verse of John is translated as \\"the Word was with God and the Word was God\\" in all \\"orthodox\\" English Bibles.[Notes 9] There are alternative views. The Jehovah's Witnesses' New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures renders the verse as \\"The Word was with God, and the Word was a god.\\" The Scholars Version of the gospel, developed by the Jesus Seminar, loosely translates the phrase as \\"The Logos was what God was,\\" offered as a better representation of the original meaning of the evangelist.[39]\\r\\nThe portrayal of Jesus' death in John is unique among the four Gospels. It does not appear to rely on the kinds of atonement theology indicative of vicarious sacrifice (cf. Mk 10:45, Rom 3:25) but rather presents the death of Jesus as his glorification and return to the father. Likewise, the three \\"passion predictions\\" of the Synoptic Gospels (Mk 8:31, 9:31, 10:33ÿ34 and pars.) are replaced instead in John with three instances of Jesus explaining how he will be exalted or \\"lifted up\\"(Jn 3:14, 8:28, 12:32). The verb for \\"lifted up\\" reflects the double entendre at work in John's theology of the cross, for Jesus is both physically elevated from the earth at the crucifixion but also, at the same time, exalted and glorified.[40]\\r\\nAmong the most controversial areas of interpretation of John is its sacramental theology. Scholars' views have fallen along a wide spectrum ranging from anti-sacramental and non-sacramental, to sacramental, to ultra-sacramental and hyper-sacramental. Scholars disagree both on whether and how frequently John refers to the sacraments at all, and on the degree of importance he places upon them. Individual scholars' answers to one of these questions do not always correspond to their answer to the other.[41]\\r\\nAccording to Rudolf Bultmann, there are three sacramental allusions: one to baptism (3:5), one to the Eucharist (6:51ÿ58), and one to both (19:34). He believed these passages to be later interpolations, though most scholars now reject this assessment. Some scholars on the weaker-sacramental side of the spectrum deny that there are any sacramental allusions in these passages or in the gospel as a whole, while others see sacramental symbolism applied to other subjects in these and other passages. Oscar Cullmann and Bruce Vawter, a Protestant and a Catholic respectively, and both on the stronger-sacramental end of the spectrum, have found sacramental allusions in most chapters. Cullmann found references to baptism and the Eucharist throughout the gospel, and Vawter found additional references to matrimony in 2:1ÿ11, anointing of the sick in 12:1ÿ11, and penance in 20:22ÿ23. Towards the center of the spectrum, Raymond Brown is more cautious than Cullmann and Vawter but more lenient than Bultmann and his school, identifying several passages as containing sacramental allusions and rating them according to his assessment of their degree of certainty.[41]\\r\\nMost scholars on the stronger-sacramental end of the spectrum assess the sacraments as being of great importance to the evangelist. However, perhaps counterintuitively, some scholars who find fewer sacramental references, such as Udo Schnelle, view the references that they find as highly important as well. Schnelle in particular views John's sacramentalism as a counter to Docetist anti-sacramentalism. On the other hand, though he agrees that there are anti-Docetic passages, James Dunn views the absence of a Eucharistic institution narrative as evidence for an anti-sacramentalism in John, meant to warn against a conception of eternal life as dependent on physical ritual.[41]\\r\\nIn comparison to the synoptic gospels, the Fourth Gospel is markedly individualistic, in the sense that it places emphasis more on the individual's relation to Jesus than on the corporate nature of the Church.[41][42] This is largely accomplished through the consistently singular grammatical structure of various aphoristic sayings of Jesus throughout the gospel.[41][Notes 10] According to Richard Bauckham, emphasis on believers coming into a new group upon their conversion is conspicuously absent from John.[41] There is also a theme of \\"personal coinherence\\", that is, the intimate personal relationship between the believer and Jesus in which the believer \\"abides\\" in Jesus and Jesus in the believer.[42][41][Notes 11] According to C. F. D. Moule, the individualistic tendencies of the Fourth Gospel could potentially give rise to a realized eschatology achieved on the level of the individual believer; this realized eschatology is not, however, to replace \\"orthodox\\", futurist eschatological expectations, but is to be \\"only [their] correlative.\\"[43] Some have argued that the Beloved Disciple is meant to be all followers of Jesus, inviting all into such a personal relationship with Christ. Beyond this, the emphasis on the individual's relationship with Jesus in the Gospel has suggested its usefulness for contemplation on the life of Christ.[44]\\r\\nJohn's account of the Baptist is different from that of the synoptic gospels. In this gospel, John is not called \\"the Baptist.\\"[45] The Baptist's ministry overlaps with that of Jesus; his baptism of Jesus is not explicitly mentioned, but his witness to Jesus is unambiguous.[45] The evangelist almost certainly knew the story of John's baptism of Jesus and he makes a vital theological use of it.[46] He subordinates the Baptist to Jesus, perhaps in response to members of the Baptist's sect who regarded the Jesus movement as an offshoot of their movement.[13]\\r\\nIn John's gospel, Jesus and his disciples go to Judea early in Jesus' ministry before John the Baptist was imprisoned and executed by Herod. He leads a ministry of baptism larger than John's own. The Jesus Seminar rated this account as black, containing no historically accurate information.[39] According to the biblical historians at the Jesus Seminar, John likely had a larger presence in the public mind than Jesus.[47]\\r\\nAlthough not commonly understood as Gnostic, many scholars, including Bultmann, have forcefully argued that the Gospel of John has elements in common with Gnosticism.[13] Christian Gnosticism did not fully develop until the mid-2nd century, and so 2nd-century Proto-Orthodox Christians concentrated much effort in examining and refuting it.[48] To say John's gospel contained elements of Gnosticism is to assume that Gnosticism had developed to a level that required the author to respond to it.[49] Bultmann, for example, argued that the opening theme of the Gospel of John, the pre-existing Logos, was actually a Gnostic theme. Other scholars, e.g. Raymond E. Brown have argued that the pre-existing Logos theme arises from the more ancient Jewish writings in the eighth chapter of the Book of Proverbs, and was fully developed as a theme in Hellenistic Judaism by Philo Judaeus.[50]\\r\\nComparisons to Gnosticism are based not in what the author says, but in the language he uses to say it, notably, use of the concepts of Logos and Light.[51] Other scholars, e.g. Raymond E. Brown, have argued that the ancient Jewish Qumran community also used the concept of Light versus Darkness. The arguments of Bultmann and his school were seriously compromised by the mid-20th-century discoveries of the Nag Hammadi library of genuine Gnostic writings (which are dissimilar to the Gospel of John) as well as the Qumran library of Jewish writings (which are often similar to the Gospel of John).[52]\\r\\nGnostics read John but interpreted it differently from the way non-Gnostics did.[53] Gnosticism taught that salvation came from gnosis, secret knowledge, and Gnostics did not see Jesus as a savior but a revealer of knowledge.[54] Barnabas Lindars asserts that the gospel teaches that salvation can only be achieved through revealed wisdom, specifically belief in (literally belief into) Jesus.[55]\\r\\nRaymond Brown contends that \\"The Johannine picture of a savior who came from an alien world above, who said that neither he nor those who accepted him were of this world,[56] and who promised to return to take them to a heavenly dwelling[57] could be fitted into the gnostic world picture (even if God's love for the world in 3:16 could not).\\"[58] It has been suggested that similarities between John's gospel and Gnosticism may spring from common roots in Jewish Apocalyptic literature.[59]\\r\\nThe Gospel of John is significantly different from the synoptic gospels, with major variations in material, theological emphasis, chronology, and literary style.[60] There are also some discrepancies between John and the Synoptics, some amounting to contradictions.[60]\\r\\nJohn lacks scenes from the Synoptics such as Jesus' baptism,[61] the calling of the Twelve, exorcisms, parables, the Transfiguration, and the Last Supper. Conversely, it includes scenes not found in the Synoptics, including Jesus turning water into wine at the wedding at Cana, the resurrection of Lazarus, Jesus washing the feet of his disciples, and multiple visits to Jerusalem.[60]\\r\\nIn the fourth gospel, Jesus' mother Mary, while frequently mentioned, is never identified by name.[62][63] John does assert that Jesus was known as the \\"son of Joseph\\" in 6:42. For John, Jesus' town of origin is irrelevant, for he comes from beyond this world, from God the Father.[64]\\r\\nWhile John makes no direct mention of Jesus' baptism,[61][60] he does quote John the Baptist's description of the descent of the Holy Spirit as a dove, as happens at Jesus' baptism in the Synoptics. Major synoptic speeches of Jesus are absent, including the Sermon on the Mount and the Olivet Discourse,[65] and the exorcisms of demons are never mentioned as in the Synoptics.[61][66] John never lists all of the Twelve Disciples and names at least one disciple, Nathanael, whose name is not found in the Synoptics. Thomas is given a personality beyond a mere name, described as \\"Doubting Thomas\\".[67]\\r\\nJesus is identified with the Word (\\"Logos\\"), and the Word is identified with theos (\\"god\\" in Greek);[68] no such identification is made in the Synoptics.[69] In Mark, Jesus urges his disciples to keep his divinity secret, but in John he is very open in discussing it, even referring to himself as \\"I AM\\", the title God gives himself in Exodus at his self-revelation to Moses. In the Synoptics, the chief theme is the Kingdom of God and the Kingdom of Heaven (the latter specifically in Matthew), while John's theme is Jesus as the source of eternal life and the Kingdom is only mentioned twice.[60][66] In contrast to the synoptic expectation of the Kingdom (using the term parousia, meaning \\"coming\\"), John presents a more individualistic, realized eschatology.[70][71][Notes 12]\\r\\nIn the Synoptics, the ministry of Jesus takes a single year[citation needed], but in John it takes three, as evidenced by references to three Passovers. Events are not all in the same order: the date of the crucifixion is different, as is the time of Jesus' anointing in Bethany and the cleansing of the temple occurs in the beginning of Jesus' ministry rather than near its end.[60]\\r\\nIn the Synoptics, quotations from Jesus are usually in the form of short, pithy sayings; in John, longer quotations are often given. The vocabulary is also different, and filled with theological import: in John, Jesus does not work \\"miracles\\" (Greek: Ѵ??ך?, translit.?dynmeis, sing. Ѵ????, dynamis), but \\"signs\\" (Greek: ך??, translit.?smeia, sing. ך?, smeion) which unveil his divine identity.[60] Most scholars consider John not to contain any parables.[73] Rather it contains metaphorical stories or allegories, such as those of the Good Shepherd and of the True Vine, in which each individual element corresponds to a specific person, group, or thing. Some scholars, however, find some such parables as the short story of the childbearing woman (16:21) or the dying grain (12:24).[Notes 13]\\r\\nAccording to the Synoptics, the arrest of Jesus was a reaction to the cleansing of the temple, while according to John it was triggered by the raising of Lazarus.[60] The Pharisees, portrayed as more uniformly legalistic and opposed to Jesus in the synoptic gospels, are instead portrayed as sharply divided; they debate frequently in John's accounts. Some, such as Nicodemus, even go so far as to be at least partially sympathetic to Jesus. This is believed to be a more accurate historical depiction of the Pharisees, who made debate one of the tenets of their system of belief.[74]\\r\\nThe gospel has been depicted in live narrations and dramatized in productions, skits, plays, and Passion Plays, as well as in film. The most recent such portrayal is the 2014 film 'The Gospel of John', directed by David Batty and narrated by David Harewood and Brian Cox, with Selva Rasalingam as Jesus. The 2003 film The Gospel of John, was directed by Philip Saville, narrated by Christopher Plummer, with Henry Ian Cusick as Jesus.\\r\\nParts of the gospel have been set to music. One such setting is Steve Warner's power anthem \\"Come and See\\", written for the 20th anniversary of the Alliance for Catholic Education and including lyrical fragments taken from the Book of Signs. Additionally, some composers have made settings of the Passion as portrayed in the gospel, most notably the one composed by Johann Sebastian Bach, although some verses are borrowed from Matthew.[75]\\r\\nOnline translations of the Gospel of John:","input":"When was the bible book of john written?"},{"output":"January 1995","context":"The LS based GM small-block engine is the primary V-8 used in General Motors' line of rear-wheel-drive cars and trucks. Introduced in January 1995, it is a \\"clean sheet\\" design with only rod bearings and bore spacing in common with the longstanding Chevrolet small block V8 that preceded it as the basis for GM small-block V8s. The basic LS variations use cast iron blocks, while performance editions are all aluminium with cast iron cylinder liners.\\r\\nThe LS small-block has been manufactured in three Generations ÿ III, IV, and V ÿ with preceding Generations I and II of modular GM small-block engines having been based on the Chevrolet small-block V8 originally designed in 1955. GM recycled the \\"LT\\" designation beginning with the LS Generation V \\"LT1\\" in 2014.\\r\\nSeveral versions of the LS were used in the Chevrolet Corvette, beginning with the LS1 in 1997 through the LS9 and others in 2013. Variants of the LT version of the GM small-block have been used since.\\r\\nThe GM Generation I and Generation II (LT) engine families both derived from the longstanding Chevrolet small block V8. The Generation III small-block V8 was a \\"clean sheet\\" design, which replaced the Gen I and Gen II engine families in 2003 and 1996 respectively.\\r\\nLike the previous two generations, the Buick and Oldsmobile small blocks, the gen III/IV can be found in many different brands. The engine blocks were cast in aluminium for car applications, and iron for most truck applications (notable exceptions include the Chevrolet TrailBlazer SS, Chevrolet SSR and a limited run of Chevrolet/GMC Extended Cab Standard Box Trucks).\\r\\nThe architecture of the LS series makes for an extremely strong engine block with the aluminium engines being nearly as strong as the iron generation I and II engines. The LS engine also used coil-near-plug style ignition to replace the distributor setup of all previous small-block based engines.\\r\\nThe traditional five-bolt pentagonal cylinder head pattern was replaced with a square four-bolt design (much like the 64-90 Oldsmobile V8 ), and the pistons are of the flat-topped variety (in the LS1, LS2, LS3, LS6, LS7, LQ9 and L33), while all other variants, including the new LS9 and LQ4 truck engine received a dished version of the GM hypereutectic piston.\\r\\nThe cylinder firing order was changed to 1-8-7-2-6-5-4-3, so that the LS series now corresponds to the firing pattern of other modern V8 engines (for example the Ford Modular V8).\\r\\nThe first of the Generation IIIs, the LS1 was the progenitor of the new architecture design that would transform the entire V8 line and influence the last of the Big Blocks.\\r\\nThe Generation III 5.7 L shares little other than similar displacement, external dimensions, and rod bearings, with its predecessor (LT1). It is an all-aluminium 5,665?cc (5.665?L; 345.7?cu?in) pushrod engine with a bore of 3.898?in (99.0?mm) and a stroke of 3.62?in (92?mm).[1]\\r\\n LS1\\r\\nWhen introduced in the 1997 Corvette the LS1 was rated at 345?hp (257?kW) at 5,600 rpm and 350?lbf?ft (470?N?m) at 4,400 rpm. After improvements to the intake and exhaust manifolds in 2001 the rating improved to 350?hp (260?kW) and 365?lbf?ft (495?N?m).[2] The LS1 was used in the Corvette from 97-04. It was also used in 98-02 GM F-Body (Camaro & Trans Am) cars with a rating of 305ÿ325+?HP, which was rumored to be conservative. The extra horsepower was claimed to come from the intake ram-air effect available in the SS and WS6 models. In Australia, continuous modifications were made to the LS1 engine throughout its lifetime, reaching 380?hp/365?ft-lb[citation needed] in the HSV's YII series, and a Callaway modified version named \\"C4B\\" was fitted to HSV GTS models producing 400?hp and 405?ft-lb, which was always considered over rated due to never being able to keep up with the Ford XR6 turbo of that same era which had a lower but more modest power output.\\r\\nApplications:\\r\\nLS6\\r\\nThe LS6 is a higher-output version of GM's LS1 engine and retains the same capacity. The initial 2001 LS6 produced 385?bhp (287?kW) and 385?lbf?ft (522?N?m), but the engine was modified for 2002 through 2004 to produce 405?bhp (302?kW) and 400?lbf?ft (540?N?m) of torque. The LS6 was originally only used in the high-performance C5 Corvette Z06 model, with the Cadillac CTS V-Series getting the 400?bhp (300?kW) engine later. The V-Series used the LS6 for two years before being replaced by the LS2 in 2006. For 2006, the Z06 replaced the LS6 with the new LS7. The LS6 shares its basic block architecture with the GM LS1 engine, but other changes were made to the design such as windows cast into the block between cylinders, improved main web strength and bay to bay breathing, an intake manifold and MAF-sensor with higher flow, a camshaft with higher lift and more duration, a higher compression ratio of 10.5:1, sodium-filled valves, and a revised oiling system better suited to high lateral acceleration.[3] LS6 intake manifolds were also used on all 2001+ LS1/6 engines. The casting number, located on the top rear edge of the block, is 12561168. Applications:\\r\\nThe 4.8 L and the 5.3 L are smaller truck versions of the LS1 and were designed to replace the 305 and the 350 in trucks. Both the 4.8 L and the 5.3 L share the same engine block, heads (upper end) and as they share architecture, some parts interchange freely between these engines and other variants in the LS family.\\r\\nThe Vortec 4800 LR4 (VIN code \\"V\\") is a Generation III small block V8 truck engine. Displacement is 4.8 L (293 cu in) with a 96.01?mm (3.78 inch) bore and 83?mm (3.267 inch) stroke. It is the smallest of the Generation III Vortec truck engines and was the replacement for the 5.0?L 5000 L30. The LR4 engines in 1999 produced 255?hp (190?kW) while the 2000 and above models made 270ÿ285?hp (201ÿ213?kW) and all have a torque rating between 285ÿ295?lb?ft (386ÿ400?N?m), depending on the model year and application. The 2005-2006 models made 285?hp (213?kW) and 295?lb?ft (400?N?m), LR4s are manufactured at St. Catharines, Ontario and Romulus, Michigan. It uses flat top pistons.\\r\\nLR4 applications:\\r\\nThe Vortec 5300, or LM7/L59/LM4, is a V8 truck engine. It is a longer-stroked (by 9?mm (0.35?in)) version of the Vortec 4800 and replaced the L31. L59 denoted a flexible fuel version of the standard fuel LM7 engine. Displacement is 5.3?L (5,328?cc (325.1?cu?in)) from 3.78-inch (96?mm) bore and 3.622-inch (92.0?mm) stroke. Vortec 5300s are built in St. Catharines, Ontario and Romulus, Michigan. Another engine variant, the L33, shares the same displacement, but has an aluminum block with cast in cylinder liners, much like the LS1.\\r\\nThe Vortec 5300 LM7 (VIN code 8th digit \\"T\\") was introduced in 1999. It has a cast iron block and aluminum heads, and can be considered the \\"garden variety\\" version of the Generation III V8s.\\r\\nThe 1999 LM7 engine produced 270?hp (201?kW) and 315?lb{ft of torque (427 N{m).\\r\\nThe 2000-2003 engines made 285?hp (213?kW) and 325?lb{ft (441 N{m).\\r\\nThe 2004-2007 engines made 295?hp and 335?lb{ft of torque.\\r\\nThe stock cam specs @ .050 duration are: 190/191 duration, .466/.457 lift, 114 LSA, 112/116 Timing\\r\\nLM7 applications:\\r\\nThe Vortec 5300 L59 (VIN code \\"Z\\") is a flexible fuel version of the LM7. The 2002-2003 made 285?hp (213?kW) and 320?lb?ft (434?N?m), while the 2004-2007 L59s made 295?hp (220?kW) and 335?lb?ft (454?N?m).\\r\\nL59 applications:\\r\\nThe Vortec 5300 LM4 (VIN code \\"P\\") is an aluminum block version of the LM7, and had a short production life. The LM4s made 290?hp (216?kW) and 325?lb?ft (441?N?m), It should not be confused with the L33 described below.\\r\\nLM4 applications:\\r\\nThe Vortec 5300 L33 (VIN code \\"B\\") is an aluminum block version of the LM7, and was referred to as the Vortec 5300 HO in marketing materials. However it should be noted that the L33 uses a flat top piston from the 4.8L instead of the standard dish piston found in the LM7. It also uses 799 cylinder heads, which are identical to the 243 casting found on the LS6 and LS2 with the exception to the Corvette spec valve springs, and hollow stem exhaust valves on the 2002-2004 LS6. This combination increased the compression from 9.5:1 to 10.0:1. The L33 also had a specific camshaft not shared with any other engine, The cam specs @ .050 duration are: 193 duration, .482 lift, 116 LSA. As a result, power increased by 15?hp (11?kW), to 310?hp (230?kW) and 335?lb{ft (441 N{m). It was only available on extended cab 4WD pickup trucks. Only 25% of trucks made in 2005 had the L33 engine.\\r\\nL33 applications:\\r\\nThe 6.0 L is a larger truck version of the LS motor, with the exception that the blocks were cast of iron, and was designed to bridge the gap between the new small blocks and big blocks in truck applications. There were two version of this engine: the LQ4 and the LQ9, the latter being more performance oriented. Although the block of the 6.0L looks similar to the LS1, they are iron instead of aluminum.\\r\\nThe Vortec 6000 is a V8 truck engine. Displacement is 5.97?L (364?cu?in) from 101.6?mm (4.00\\") bore and 92?mm (3.622\\") stroke. It is an iron/aluminum (1999 & 2000 model year engines had cast iron heads) design and produces 300 horsepower (220?kW) to 345 horsepower (257?kW) and 360?lbf?ft (490?N?m) to 380?lbf?ft (520?N?m).\\r\\nThe Vortec 6000 LQ4, is a V8 truck engine. Displacement is 5.97?L (364?cu?in) from a 4.0-inch (101.6?mm) bore and 3.622-inch (92.0?mm) stroke . It is an iron/aluminum (1999 & 2000 model year engines had cast iron heads) design and produces 300?hp (224?kW) to 325?hp and 360?lb?ft (488?N?m) to 370?lb?ft (502?N?m). LQ4s are built in Romulus, Michigan and Silao, Mexico.\\r\\n(VIN U) Applications:\\r\\nThe Vortec HO 6000 or VortecMAX is a special high-output version of the Vortec 6000 V8 truck engine originally designed for Cadillac. This engine was renamed as the VortecMAX for 2006. It features high-compression (10:1) flat-top pistons for an extra 10?hp (7?kW) and 10?lb?ft (14?N?m), bringing output to 345?hp (257?kW) and 380?lb?ft (515?N?m). LQ9s are built only in Romulus, Michigan.\\r\\nLQ9 (VIN N) Applications:\\r\\nIn 2005, the Generation III was superseded by the Generation IV. This category of engines has provisions for high-displacement ranges up to 7,011?cc (7.011?L; 427.8?cu?in) and power output to 638?bhp (476?kW). Based on the Generation III design, Generation IV was designed with displacement on demand in mind, a technology that allows every other cylinder in the firing order to be deactivated. It can also accommodate variable valve timing.\\r\\nA 3-valve per cylinder design was originally slated for the LS7, which would have been a first for a GM pushrod engine; but the idea was shelved owing to design complexities and when the same two-valve configuration as the other Generation III and IV engines proved to be sufficient to meet the goals for the LS7.\\r\\nThis family of blocks were the first of the generation IV small block with the LS2 being the progenitor of this family and generation. This family of blocks has seen a wide range of applications from performance vehicles to truck usage.\\r\\nThe Generation IV 6000 is a V8 engine that displaces 5,967?cc (364.1?cu?in) from 101.6?mm (4.000?in) bore and 92?mm (3.622?in) stroke. It features either a cast iron or aluminum engine block with cast aluminum heads. Certain versions feature variable cam phasing, Active Fuel Management, and Flex-fuel capability.\\r\\nLS2\\r\\nThe LS2 was introduced as the Corvette's new base engine for the 2005 model year. It also appeared as the standard powerplant for the 2005ÿ2006 GTO. It produces 400?bhp (300?kW) at 6000?rpm and 400?lb?ft (542?N?m) at 4400?rpm from a slightly larger displacement of 5,967?cc (5.967?L; 364.1?cu?in). It is similar to the high-performance LS6, but with improved torque throughout the rpm range. The LS2 uses the \\"243\\" casting heads used on the LS6 (although without the sodium-filled valves), a smaller camshaft, and an additional 18 cubic inches. The compression of the LS2 was also raised to 10.9:1 compared to the LS1s' 10.25:1 and the LS6s' 10.5:1. The LS2 in the E-series HSVs are modified in Australia to produce 412?bhp (307?kW) and 412 lbft . The LS2 in the Chevrolet Trailblazer SS and the Saab 9-7X Aero are rated at 395?bhp (295?kW) (2006ÿ2007) or 390?bhp (290?kW) (2008ÿ2009) and 400?lb?ft (542?N?m) of torque due to a different (sometimes referred to as a \\"truck\\") intake manifold that produces more torque at lower RPMs.\\r\\nThe LS2 is also used as the basis of the NASCAR Specification Engine that is used as an optional engine in NASCAR's Camping World Series East and West divisions starting in 2006, and starting in 2010 may also be used on tracks shorter than two kilometers (1.25 miles) in the Camping World Truck Series.[4]\\r\\nA version of NASCAR V8 cylinder block cast in Compacted Graphite Iron by Grainger & Worrall won the UK's Casting of the Year Award 2010.[5]\\r\\nApplications:\\r\\nL76\\r\\nThe L76 is derived from the LS2. And like the LS2 it features an aluminum engine block. However, the L76 does feature Active fuel management (AFM). While the displacement on demand technology was disabled on Holdens, this feature is enabled on the 2008 Pontiac G8 GT and subsequently refitted in the 2009 model Holdens with AFM enabled, but only on models fitted with the 6L80 Automatic Transmission. The engine also meets Euro III emissions requirements. Output is 348?bhp (260?kW) at 5600?rpm and 376?lb?ft (510?N?m) at 4400?rpm for the Holden variant, and 361?bhp (269?kW) and 385?lb?ft (522?N?m) for the G8 GT.[6] The Vortec 6000 or new VortecMax version is based on the Holden L76 engine, and features variable cam phasing, along with Active Fuel Management. It can be considered the replacement for the Generation III LQ9 engine. It produces 367?hp (274?kW) at 5400?rpm and 375?lb?ft (508?N?m) at 4400?rpm. Production of the Vortec 6000 started in late 2006, and is only available with the new body style Silverado and Sierra. The final year for the option of the VortecMax engine was 2009 in the Silverado and Sierra.\\r\\nApplications:\\r\\nL98\\r\\nThe L98 is a slightly modified version of the L76. Since Holden did not use the displacement on demand technology of the L76, some redundant hardware was removed to form the L98. Power increased to 362?bhp (270?kW) at 5700?rpm and 391?lb?ft (530?N?m) at 4400?rpm.\\r\\nApplications:\\r\\nL77\\r\\nL77 engines were released in the Holden Commodore Series II VE range in both manual and automatic transmissions, along with the Chevrolet Caprice police car. The L77 differs from the L76 with its inclusion of Flex-fuel capability, allowing it to run on E85 ethanol. The L77 is rated at 362?hp (270?kW) and 391lbft (530Nm) of torque in the manual Commodore SS and SS-V, in automatic Commodores it is rated at 348?hp (260?kW) and 382lbft (517Nm) of torque.\\r\\nApplications:\\r\\nLY6\\r\\nThe LY6 is a Generation IV small block V8 truck engine with a cast iron block. It shares the same bore and stroke as its LQ4 predecessor. Like other Gen IV engines, it features variable valve timing. It generated 361 horsepower at 5,600 rpm and 385?lb-ft of torque at 4,400 rpm using \\"regular\\" gas, or ~87 octane. Redline is 6,000 rpm and compression ratio is 9.6:1. This engine uses L92 / LS3 style rectangle port cylinder heads, though without the sodium-filled exhaust valves of the LS3.\\r\\nApplications:\\r\\nL96\\r\\nThe L96 is essentially identical to its predecessor, the LY6. The primary difference is that the former is Flex Fuel capable, while the latter was not.\\r\\nApplications:\\r\\nLFA\\r\\nThe LFA is a Generation IV small block V8 truck engine. The LFA variant is used in the GM's \\"two mode\\" hybrid GMT900 trucks and SUVs, and is an all-aluminum design. It has a 10.8:1 compression ratio and produces 332?hp (248?kW) at 5100 rpm and 367?lb?ft (498?N?m) at 4100 rpm. Engine VIN code of 5.\\r\\nIn 2008 this engine was selected by Wards as one of the 10 best engines in any regular production vehicle.\\r\\nApplications:\\r\\nLZ1\\r\\nThe LZ1 is almost entirely based on its predecessor, the LFA, but with some revisions, such as including up-integrated electronic throttle control, long-life spark plugs, GMs Oil Life System, Active Fuel Management and variable valve timing.[7] It has the same compression ratio, power and torque ratings as its predecessor, the LFA.\\r\\nApplications:\\r\\nThis family of blocks is just an updated version of its Generation III predecessor with Generation IV updates and capabilities. Applications of this family were mainly for trucks but did see some mild usage (with some modifications) in front-wheel-drive cars.\\r\\nThe Vortec 4800 LY2 (VIN code \\"C\\") is a Generation IV small block V8 truck engine. Like its LR4 predecessor, it gets its displacement from a 96.01?mm (3.780?in) bore and 83?mm (3.268?in) stroke. The smallest member of the Generation IV engine family, it is unique in that it is the only member of that family that is used in trucks that does not feature variable valve timing.It has a cast iron block. Power output is 260ÿ295?hp (194ÿ220?kW) and torque is 295ÿ305?lb?ft (400ÿ414?N?m).\\r\\nLY2 applications:\\r\\nThe Vortec 4800 L20 makes more power and features variable valve timing. The system adjusts both intake and exhaust timing, but does not come with Active Fuel Management. The L20 has a cast iron block and power output is 260ÿ302?hp (194ÿ225?kW) while torque is 295ÿ305?lb?ft (400ÿ414?N?m). The Vortec 4800 base engines were dropped from the Chevrolet Tahoe and GMC Yukon in favor of the 5300 with Active Fuel Management.\\r\\nL20 applications:\\r\\nThe Generation IV 5.3L engines share all the improvements and refinements found in other Generation IV engines. 8 versions of the Gen IV 5.3L engine were produced: 3 iron blocks (LY5, LMG, and LMF) and 5 aluminum blocks (LH6, LH8, LH9, LC9, and LS4). All versions featured Active Fuel Management except for the LH8, LH9 and LMF.\\r\\nIntroduced in 2010, the LMF is a lower tech version used in the lower volume half ton vehicles cargo vans with AWD that still used the 4 speed automatic, and do not use Active Fuel Management. 2014 was the last year for the GM full size 1/2 ton cargo vans. 3/4 and 1 ton are still in production.\\r\\nLMF applications:\\r\\nThe Vortec 5300 LH6 (VIN code \\"M\\") with Active Fuel Management replaced the LM4 for 2005, and was the first of the Generation IV small block V8 truck engines to go into production. The LH6 produced 300?hp (220?kW) to 315?hp (235?kW) and 330?lb?ft (447?N?m) to 338?lb?ft (458?N?m). It is the aluminum block counterpart to the LY5.\\r\\nLH6 applications:\\r\\nIntroduced in 2007, the Vortec 5300 LY5 (VIN code \\"J\\") is the replacement for the LM7 Generation III engine. For SUV applications, it is rated at 320?hp (239?kW) and 340?lb?ft (461?N?m) of torque; for pickup truck applications, it is rated at 315ÿ320?hp (235ÿ239?kW) at 5200 rpm and 335ÿ340?lb?ft (454ÿ461?N?m) at 4000 rpm\\r\\nLY5 applications:\\r\\nThe Vortec 5300 LMG (VIN code \\"0\\") is the flexible-fuel version of the LY5. Power and torque ratings for SUV and pickup truck applications are the same as each application's LY5 rating. Variable valve timing was added for the 2010 model year.\\r\\nLMG applications:\\r\\nThe Vortec 5300 LC9 (VIN code \\"3\\") is the aluminum block Flex-Fuel version of the LH6, and is found in 4WD models. SUV applications are rated at 320?hp (239?kW) @ 5400 rpm and 335?lb?ft (454?N?m) @ 4000 rpm of torque.[8] Pickup truck applications are rated at 315?hp (235?kW) @ 5300 rpm and 335?lb?ft (454?N?m) @ 4000 rpm of torque.[8] Variable valve timing was added for the 2010 model year.\\r\\nLC9 applications:\\r\\nThe Vortec 5300 LH8 is a variant of the 5.3 L Gen IV small block V8 modified to fit in the engine bay of the GMT 345 SUV and GMT 355 trucks. It produces 300?hp (220?kW) at 5200 rpm and 320?lb?ft (434?N?m) at 4000 rpm. It has a displacement of 5,328?cc (325.1?cu?in).[9]\\r\\nLH8 applications:\\r\\nThe Vortec 5300 LH9 is a variant of the 5.3 L Gen IV small block V8 modified to fit in the engine bay of the GMT 355 trucks. It has Variable Valve Timing (VVT) and produces 300?hp (220?kW) at 5200 rpm and 320?lb?ft (434?N?m) at 4000 rpm. It has a displacement of 5,328?cc (325.1?cu?in).[9]\\r\\nLH9 applications:\\r\\nThe LS4 is a 5,328?cc (5.328?L; 325.1?cu?in) version of the Generation IV block. Though it has the same displacement as the Vortec 5300 LY5, it features an aluminum block instead of iron, and it uses the same cylinder head casting as the Generation III LS6 engine. The bellhousing bolt pattern differs from the rear-wheel drive blocks.\\r\\nThis engine is adapted for transverse front-wheel drive applications. According to GM, \\"The crankshaft is shortened 13 mm ÿ 3 mm at the flywheel end and 10 mm at the accessory drive end ÿ to reduce the length of the engine compared to the 6.0L. All accessories are driven by a single serpentine belt to save space. The water pump is mounted remotely with an elongated pump manifold that connects it to the coolant passages. Revised oil pan baffles, or windage trays, are incorporated into the LS4 to ensure that the oil sump stays loaded during high-g cornering.\\"[10] Active Fuel Management is also used. Output of this version is 303?hp (226?kW)/300?hp on LaCrosse Super and 323?lb?ft (438?N?m).\\r\\nApplications:\\r\\nInspired by the LS1.R in size and performance goals, this family of blocks was designed for race oriented performance. The only engine with this bore size that was used in a production vehicle is the LS7 with the LSX being only for aftermarket use. One unique feature of this family is that the cylinders are siamesed, no water passages between neighboring cylinders.[11] This was done to increase both bore size and block strength.\\r\\nLS7\\r\\nThe LS7 is a 7,011?cc (7.011?L; 427.8?cu?in) engine, based on the Gen IV architecture. The block is changed, with sleeved cylinders in an aluminum block and a larger 4.125in (104.775mm) bore and longer 4.00in (101.6mm) stroke than the LS2. The small-block's 4.4?in (110?mm) bore spacing is retained, requiring pressed-in cylinder liners. The crankshaft and main bearing caps are forged steel for durability, the connecting rods are forged titanium, and the pistons are hypereutectic. The two-valve arrangement is retained, though the titanium intake valves by Del West have grown to 2.20?in (56?mm) and sodium-filled exhaust valves are up to 1.61?in (41?mm).\\r\\nPeak output is 505?hp (377?kW) at 6300?rpm and 470?lb?ft (640?N?m) at 4800?rpm with a 7100?rpm redline[citation needed] During GM's reliability testing of this engine in its prototype phase, the LS7 was remarked to have been repeatedly tested to be 8000?rpm capable, although power was not recorded at that rpm level, due to the constraints of the camshaft's hydraulic lifters and the intake manifold ability to flow required air at that engine speed.\\r\\nThe LS7 is hand-built by the General Motors Performance Build Center in Wixom, Michigan. Most of these engines are installed in the Z06, some are also sold to individuals by GM as a crate engine. While it has the same displacement the Hennessey Venom GT utilizes an iron block LSX, not an LS7.\\r\\nAfter an extensive engineering process over several years, Holden Special Vehicles fitted the LS7 to a special edition model, the W427. The HSV-tuned engine produced 375?kW (503?hp) and 640?N?m (470?lb?ft). The W427 was unveiled at the Melbourne International Motor Show on February 29, 2008[12] and went on sale in August 2008. The first Australian car to be fitted with this engine, however, was the CSV GTS of 2007, which was claimed to have a power output of 400?kW (536?hp) and 600?N?m (440?lb?ft).[13]\\r\\nApplications:\\r\\nThis family was designed as a replacement for the LS2 but enlarged to better accommodate variable valve timing and Active Fuel Management while still generating good performance. This family of engines has mainly seen duty in performance cars and high-end SUVs.\\r\\nL92\\r\\nThe 2007 Cadillac Escalade has a 6.2?l (380?cu?in) Vortec 6200 (RPO L92) engine. It is an all-aluminum design which, while still a pushrod engine, boasts variable valve timing. The system adjusts both intake and exhaust timing between two settings. This engine produces 403?hp (301?kW) and 417?lb?ft (565?N?m) in the GMC Yukon Denali/XL Denali, GMC Sierra Denali, Hummer H2, and briefly in the Chevrolet Tahoe LTZ (midway through MY 2008 through MY 2009) and rated at 403?hp (301?kW) and 415?lb?ft (563?N?m). It was also available in the Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra starting in MY 2009 (as the L9H) with power ratings of 403?hp (301?kW) and 417?lb?ft (565?N?m) .The L92 was modified with Flex Fuel capability for MY 2009 and became the L9H, and was further modified with Active Fuel Management for MY 2010 (and becoming the L94) in the Cadillac Escalade and GMC Yukon Denali's (Active Fuel Management hardware was present in 2007 engines, but the software was not present in the PCM).\\r\\nApplications:\\r\\nLS3\\r\\nThe LS3 was introduced as the Corvette's new base engine for the 2008 model year. It produces 430?bhp (321?kW; 436?PS) at 5900?rpm and 424?lb?ft (575?N?m) at 4600?rpm without the optional Corvette exhaust and is SAE certified. The block is an updated version of the LS2 casting featuring a larger bore of 4.06?in (103?mm) creating a displacement of 6,162?cc (6.162?L; 376.0?cu?in). It also features higher flowing cylinder heads sourced from the L92, a more aggressive camshaft with 0.551-inch (14.0?mm) lift, a 10.7:1 compression ratio, a revised valvetrain with 6?mm (0.24?in) offset intake rocker arms, a high-flow intake manifold and 47?lb/hr fuel injectors from the LS7 engine.\\r\\nThe L76/L92/LS3 cylinder heads use 2.165?in (55.0?mm) intake valves, and 1.59?in (40?mm) exhaust valves. Improved manufacturing efficiency makes these heads cheaper than the outgoing LS6 heads, and severely undercuts aftermarket heads. The large valves, however, limit maximum rpm - 6000 in the L76 (with AFM), and 6600 in the LS3 (with hollow stem valves).\\r\\nIn addition to the above, a dual-mode exhaust package with a bypass on acceleration was available on C6 Corvettes. The dual-mode exhaust uses vacuum-actuated outlet valves, which control engine noise during low-load operation, but open for maximum performance during high-load operation. The system is similar to the C6 Z06, but uses a 2.5?in (64?mm) diameter exhaust compared to the Z06's 3?in (76?mm). Power is boosted to 436?hp (325?kW) and 428?lb?ft (580?N?m) with this option. A similar system was optional on later model 5th generation Chevrolet Camaros and standard on the 2016-2017 Chevrolet SS, but no horsepower or torque increases were advertised on those vehicles.\\r\\nFrom April 2008, Australian performance car manufacturer, HSV, adopted the LS3 as its standard V8 throughout the range, replacing the LS2. The LS3 received modifications for its application to HSV E Series models, producing 425?bhp (317?kW). The LS3 engine in the E Series II GTS (released September 2009) was upgraded to produce 436?bhp (325?kW). All HSV MY12.5 excluding the base Maloo and Clubsport variants have been upgraded to produce 436?bhp (325?kW).\\r\\nFrom September 2015 Holden introduced the LS3 in all V8 models of the VF II Commodore and WN II Caprice-V, replacing the 6.0L L77.\\r\\nApplications:\\r\\nL99\\r\\nThe L99 is derived from the LS3 with reduced output but adds Active Fuel Management (formerly called Displacement on Demand) and variable valve timing, which allows it to run on only four cylinders during light load conditions.\\r\\nApplications:\\r\\nLS9\\r\\nThe Gen IV LS9 is a supercharged 6,162?cc (6.162?L; 376.0?cu?in) engine, based on the LS3; the LS7 block was not used due to the higher cylinder pressures created by the supercharger requiring the thicker cylinder walls of the LS3. Cylinder dimensions are now 4.06?in (103?mm) bore and 3.62?in (92?mm) stroke. It is equipped with an Eaton four-lobe Roots type supercharger and has a compression ratio of 9.1:1. Power output is rated 638?bhp (476?kW) at 6500?rpm and 604?lb?ft (819?N?m) at 3800?rpm. Note: GM previously used the LS9 RPO code on 1969 and later Chevrolet trucks (both 2WD and 4WD) including Blazers, Jimmys, Suburbans, as well as car carriers. The original LS9 was a 350 cu in V8, developing 160?hp and 245 Ft/lbs of torque.\\r\\nApplications:\\r\\nLSA\\r\\nThe supercharged 6.2L LSA is similar to the LS9 and debuted in the 2009 CTS-V. The LSA has been SAE certified at 556?bhp (415?kW) at 6100?rpm and 551?lb?ft (747?N?m) at 3800?rpm. GM labeled it \\"the most powerful ever offered in Cadillacs nearly 106-year history\\". The LSA features a smaller 1.9L capacity supercharger rather than the 2.3 L variant of the LS9. Other differences include a slightly lower 9.0:1 compression ratio, single unit heat exchanger and cast pistons.\\r\\nA 580?bhp (430?kW) and 556?lb?ft (754?N?m) version of the LSA engine is used in the 2012 Camaro ZL1. On May 15, 2013, Holden Special Vehicles announced that this version of the LSA engine will also be used in the GEN-F GTS.\\r\\nApplications:\\r\\nIn 2007, wardsauto.com reported that the LS3 (used by 2008 Chevrolet Corvette) and Vortec 6000 LFA (used by 2008 Chevrolet Tahoe Hybrid) engines would be the final two designs in the Generation IV small-block engine family, and the future designs would be part of the Generation V engine family. An experimental engine was built based on L92 engine from Cadillac Escalade, GMC Yukon Denali and Hummer H2, and reported to generate 450?bhp (340?kW) on gasoline via direct fuel injection, increased compression ratio to 11.5:1, and a modified engine controller.[15] The first Gen V LT engine was the LT1, announced in 2012 as the initial powerplant for the redesigned C7 Corvette, succeeding the LS engine family. The new logo formally adopts the Small Block name for the engines.\\r\\nThe fifth generation of the iconic GM small block engine family features the same cam-in-block architecture and 4.400-inch bore centers (the distance between the centers of each cylinder) that were born with the original small block in 1955. Structurally, the Gen-V small-block is similar to the Gen III/IV engines, including a deep-skirt cylinder block. Refinements and new or revised components are used throughout, including a revised cooling system and all-new cylinder heads.\\r\\nAll Gen V engine are aluminum blocks with aluminum cylinder heads and include features such as direct injection, piston cooling jets, active fuel management, variable displacement oil pump, continuously variable valve timing and aluminum cylinder heads and block. However, it does retain its ancestors' two-valve pushrod valvetrain.\\r\\nThis family of blocks were the first of the generation V small block with the LT1 being the progenitor of this family and generation. This family of blocks has seen a wide range of applications from performance vehicles to truck usage.\\r\\nLT1\\r\\nThe 6.2?l (380?cu?in) LT1 engine debuted in the 2014 Chevrolet Corvette Stingray and is the first Generation V small block engine. Like its LS3 predecessor, it gets its displacement from 103.25?mm (4.060?in) bore and 92?mm (3.62?in) stroke with a compression ratio of 11.5 to 1.\\r\\nApplications:\\r\\nL86\\r\\nThe 6.2?l (380?cu?in) EcoTec3 is a Generation V small block V8 truck engine. (VIN Code \\"J\\") The L86 is an LT1 engine modified for truck use with a compression ratio of 11.5 to 1.\\r\\nApplications:\\r\\nLT4\\r\\nThe 6.2?l (380?cu?in) LT4 engine builds on the design strengths of the previous LS9 supercharged engine used in the sixth-generation Corvette ZR1 and leverages the technologies introduced on the seventh-generation Corvette Stingray, including direct injection, cylinder deactivation and continuously variable valve timing, to take Corvette performance to an all-new level. The LT4 engine is based on the same Gen 5 small block foundation as the Corvette Stingrays LT1 6.2L naturally aspirated engine, incorporating several unique features designed to support its higher output and the greater cylinder pressures created by forced induction, including: Rotocast A356T6 aluminum cylinder heads that are stronger and handle heat better than conventional aluminum heads, lightweight titanium intake valves, forged powder metal steel connecting rods which are highly machined to an optimized geometry for increased strength while eliminating unnecessary reciprocating mass, 10.0:1 compression ratio, high for a forced-induction engine, enhances performance and efficiency and is enabled by direct injection, forged aluminum pistons with unique, stronger structure to ensure strength under high cylinder pressures, stainless steel exhaust manifolds for structure at higher temperatures, aluminum balancer for reduced mass, and standard dry-sump oiling system with a dual-pressure-control oil pump.[16] The engine uses a 1.7L Eaton TVS supercharger. Although smaller than the previous 2.3l supercharger used on the sixth-gen ZR1, it spins 5000 RPM faster thus generating boost quicker while making only slightly less total boost than the LS9 engine.[17]\\r\\nApplications:\\r\\nLT5\\r\\nThe 6.2L (376 cu in) LT5 engine debuted in the seventh-generatiion Corvette ZR1 at the 2017 Dubai Motor Show. It draws its inspiration from the already venerable LT4 small block V8 but improves with a 2.6L Eaton TVS Supercharger and an improved cooling and fuel injection system. Power output is 755 hp (563 kW) @ 6400 rpm and 715 lb-ft (969 NM) @3600 rpm.\\r\\nApplications:\\r\\nUnlike the previous Generation III/IV 3.78 in bore block families, there is no 4.8L displacement variant (having been 'replaced' by GM's 5th Generation LT V8-based V6, the 4.3L /262 Cu In LV3).\\r\\nL83\\r\\nDubbed EcoTec3 5.3 L is a Generation V small block V8 truck engine.(VIN Code \\"C\\") Like its Vortec 5300 Generation IV predecessor, it gets its displacement from 96.01?mm (3.78?in) bore and 92?mm ( 3.62 in) stroke with a compression ratio of 11.0 to 1.\\r\\nApplications:\\r\\nL8B\\r\\nThe L8B is an eAssist mild hybrid version of the L83 featuring a .45-KWH lithium ion battery pack. This setup can improve fuel efficiency by about 13%. This adds about 100?lb (45?kg) to the total weight of the truck but provides an additional 13?hp (10?kW) and 44?lb?ft (60?N?m).[18][19]\\r\\nApplications:\\r\\nThese V6 engines are based on the V8 version of the Gen-V family, but with two fewer cylinders - a design lineage that dates back to the previous 4.3L V6, which was itself a Gen-I small block with a pair of cylinders removed. Of special note, there were no V6 engines based on Generation II/III/IV small blocks.\\r\\nLV3\\r\\nDubbed EcoTec3 4.3 L is a Generation V small block V6 truck engine. It gets its displacement from 99.6?mm (3.921?in) bore and 92?mm ( 3.62 in) stroke with a compression ratio of 11.0 to 1. Firing order is 1-6-5-4-3-2. This engine replaces the unrelated 4.3 L V6 that have a lineage that dates back to 1978.\\r\\nApplications:\\r\\nNote 1: depending upon vehicle application; horsepower, torque, and fuel requirements will vary. vin code indicating engine RPO may also not be consistent between vehicle types (cars or trucks) or years. with few exceptions, RPM redline is generally 6000 or higher\\r\\nNote 2: block features are generally dependent upon the Generation but not always built-in. typical features are AFM (Advanced Fuel Management), VVT (Variable Valve Train), Front Wheel Drive (FWD) and other improvements. features marked with an * indicate that only certain model years have that feature\\r\\nIn the early production run of the LS-series engine, some engines encountered 'piston slap' during the first couple minutes after a cold engine start - this sound is caused by the pistons rocking slightly in the cylinder until they reach operating temperature/size. 'Piston slap' sometimes sounds more like a knock or the sound of a diesel engine running. It is typically only present when the engine is cold and disappears as the engine reaches operating temperature. The noise of 'piston slap' often is louder when listening for it below the oil pan.\\r\\nAnother common problem with the 2001-2006 5.3L engines was cracking cylinder heads. This is commonly called the 'Castech Head' failure on the internet. GM issued a TSB on this failure to help service techs identify the problem. The head casting (which can be viewed from the passenger side of the vehicle just in front of the valve cover) was 706. Some heads with this casting number would fail (but not all of them) as GM had different suppliers for the same head. The failure was due to undetected porosity around the oil drains in the head.[24]\\r\\nIn 2011, Chevrolet Performance began to offer the build your own engine program for LS7 (part number 19259944) or LS9 (part number 19259945) crate engines. It also provides customers the experience of visiting GM's unique Performance Build Center in Wixom, Mich., where they will join a specially trained engine builder to assist in the start-to-finish assembly of the engine they purchased ÿ from installing the crankshaft in the cylinder block to topping off the engine with its intake system. In the case of the LS9, it also means installing the supercharger assembly. Upon completion, a personalized nameplate is added to the engine.[25]\\r\\nThe build-your-own engine program associated with the V8 engines, available for buyers of Chevrolet Corvette, Cadillac XLR and certain top-spec Chevrolet Camaro models, were temporarily halted after the closure of GM Performance Build Center in Wixom, Michigan. The program's venue was reported to be relocated to the Corvette assembly plant in Bowling Green, Kentucky.[26]\\r\\nLS7.R\\r\\nThe LS7.R engine is a variation of the LS7 used in the highly successful C6.R American Le Mans Series racecar. It was crowned as Global Motorsport Engine of the Year by a jury of 50 race engine engineers on the Professional Motorsport World Expo 2006 in Cologne, Germany.\\r\\nLSX\\r\\nLSx is also used to denote any LS engine.\\r\\nAt the 2006 SEMA show, GM Performance Parts introduced the LSX engine, an all-new cast-iron racing block based on the LS7 engine. It was designed with help from drag racing legend Warren Johnson. It offers displacements ranging from 364?cu?in (5,965?cc) to 511?cu?in (8,374?cc) (4.25?in (108?mm) Bore x 4.5?in (110?mm) Stroke) and is capable of withstanding 2,500?bhp (1,900?kW). This block incorporates two extra rows of head-bolt holes per bank for increased clamping capacity. The six bolt steel main caps are the same ones used on the LS7 engine. The engine debuted at the auto show in a customized 1969 Camaro owned by Reggie Jackson. The LSX will be available starting the second quarter of 2007, set to be available in authorized dealerships and retailers on March 31, 2007.Hennessey Venom GT uses LSX engine based on LS7.[27]\\r\\nChevrolet Performance LSX Bowtie block includes LSX specific six-bolts-per-cylinder head bolt pattern, billet-steel six-bolt dowel-located main bearing caps, extra-thick deck for maximum clamping force, extra-thick cylinder walls allow increased bore capacity (maximum 4.200-inch bore still allows 0.200-inch minimum wall thickness), true priority main oiling system, main web bay-to-bay breathing holes reduce crank windage,orange powder coat finish, machined bore at 3.880 is ready for final boring/honing.\\r\\nLSX376\\r\\nChevrolet Performance LSX376 crate engines are updated versions of LSX crate engine family designed to support up to 1,000 horsepower. All models use Chevrolet Performance LSX Bowtie block.\\r\\nLSX376-B15 (part number 19299306) includes forged steel crankshaft, forged H-beam rods and forged aluminum pistons (9.0:1 compression), high-flow rectangular-port six-bolt LSX-LS3 heads for supercharged and turbocharged combinations producing up to 15 pounds of boost and up to about 1,000 horsepower.\\r\\nLSX376-B8 (part number 19171049) is a more economical version that is capable of approximately 8 pounds of boost, for engine producing approximately 600 horsepower. It is designed for production-style supercharger and turbo systems used without enhancements or modifications.[28]","input":"What year did the ls engines come into production?"},{"output":"Atlantic Ocean","context":"The geography of New York City is characterized by its coastal position at the meeting of the Hudson River and the Atlantic Ocean in a naturally sheltered harbor. The city's geography, with its scarce availability of land, is a contributing factor in making it one of the most densely populated cities in the United States. Environmental issues are chiefly concerned with managing this density, which also explains why New York is among the most energy efficient and least automobile-dependent cities in the United States. The city's climate is temperate.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNew York City is located on the coast of the Northeastern United States at the mouth of the Hudson River in southeastern New York state. It is located in the New YorkÿNew Jersey Harbor Estuary, the centerpiece of which is the New York Harbor, whose deep waters and sheltered bays helped the city grow in significance as a trading city. Much of New York is built on the three islands of Manhattan, Staten Island, and western Long Island, making land scarce and encouraging a high population density.\\r\\nThe Hudson River flows from the Hudson Valley into New York Bay, becoming a tidal estuary that separates the Bronx and Manhattan from Northern New Jersey. The Harlem River, another tidal strait between the East and Hudson Rivers, separates Manhattan from the Bronx.\\r\\nThe boroughs of New York City straddle the border between two geologic provinces of eastern North America. Brooklyn and Queens, located on Long Island, are part of the eastern coastal plain. Long Island is a massive moraine which formed at the southern fringe of the Laurentide Ice Sheet during the last Ice Age. The Bronx and Manhattan lie on the eastern edge of the Newark Basin, a block of the Earth's crust which sank downward during the disintegration of the supercontinent Pangaea during the Triassic period. The Palisades Sill on the New Jersey shore of the Hudson River exposes ancient, once-molten rock that filled the basin. Tough metamorphic rocks underlie much of Manhattan, providing solid support for its many skyscrapers.\\r\\nThe city's land has been altered considerably by human intervention, with substantial land reclamation along the waterfronts since Dutch colonial times. Reclamation is most notable in Lower Manhattan with modern developments like Battery Park City. Much of the natural variations in topography have been evened out, particularly in Manhattan.[1] The West Side of Manhattan retains some hilliness, especially in Upper Manhattan, while the East Side has been considerably flattened. Duffy's Hill in East Harlem is one notable exception to the East Side's relatively level grade.\\r\\nThe city's land area is estimated to be 321 square miles (830?km2).[2] However, a more recent estimate calculates a total land area of 304.8 square miles (789.4 square kilometres).[3] The highest natural point in the city is Todt Hill on Staten Island, which at 409.8?ft (124.9?m) above sea level is the highest hill on the Eastern Seaboard south of Maine. The summit of the ridge is largely covered in woodlands as part of the Staten Island Greenbelt.\\r\\nNew York\\r\\nNew Jersey\\r\\nNew York City comprises five boroughs, an unusual form of government used to administer the five constituent counties that make up the city. Throughout the boroughs there are hundreds of distinct neighborhoods, many with a definable history and character all their own. If the boroughs were each independent cities, four of the boroughs (Brooklyn, Queens, Manhattan, and the Bronx) would be among the ten most populous cities in the United States.\\r\\nAlthough it is not in the subtropics and its winters are cold, New York has a humid subtropical climate according to the K?ppen climate classification because the coldest months' average temperatures are not low enough for persistent snow cover, between 32.5 and 33.0?F (0.3 and 0.6?C) at all three major reporting stations within the city. The region's climate is vastly affected by its proximity to the Atlantic Ocean. New York City's climate patterns are affected by the Atlantic multidecadal oscillation, a 70-year-long warming and cooling cycle in the Atlantic that influences the frequency and severity of hurricanes and coastal storms.[9] Unless otherwise stated, all figures below are cited from the Central Park station.\\r\\nSee Geography of New York City for additional climate information from the outer boroughs.\\r\\nNew York City plays an important role in the green policy agenda because of its size. Environmental groups make large efforts to help shape legislation in New York because they see the strategy as an efficient way to influence national programs. New York City's economy is larger than Switzerland's, a size that means the city has potential to set new de facto standards. Manufacturers are also attuned to the latest trends and needs in the city because the market is simply too big to ignore.\\r\\nAlthough cities like San Francisco or Portland, Oregon are most commonly associated with urban environmentalism in the United States, New York City's unique urban footprint and extensive transportation systems make it more sustainable than most American cities.\\r\\nNew Amsterdam in 1660\\r\\nOne of the 1770 Ratzer Maps\\r\\nNew York City and the city of Brooklyn, in 1885\\r\\nNew York City area in 1906\\r\\nDowntown New York City in 1910\\r\\nFalse-color satellite image\\r\\nThermal image (blue is warm, yellow is hot)\\r\\nVegetation is beige (sparse) and deep green (dense)\\r\\nSatellite photograph of southern Manhattan taken in 2002\\r\\nNotes\\r\\nSources\\r\\nFurther reading","input":"What is the closest ocean to new york?"},{"output":"March 2, 1861","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe U.S. state of Texas declared its secession from the United States of America on February 1, 1861, and joined the Confederate States on March 2, 1861, after it replaced its governor, Sam Houston, when he refused to take an oath of allegiance to the Confederacy. As with those of other States, the Declaration was not recognized by the United States government at Washington. Some Texan military units fought in the Civil War east of the Mississippi River, but Texas was most useful for supplying soldiers and horses for Confederate forces. Texas' supply role lasted until mid-1863, after which time Union gunboats controlled the Mississippi River, making large transfers of men, horses or cattle impossible. Some cotton was sold in Mexico, but most of the crop became useless because of the Union naval blockade of Galveston, Houston, and other ports.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the late winter of 1860, Texan counties sent delegates to a special convention to debate the merits of secession. The convention adopted an \\"Ordinance of Secession\\" by a vote of 166 to 8, which was ratified by a popular referendum on February 23.[1][2]\\r\\n\\r\\nSeparately from the Ordinance of Secession, which was considered a legal document, Texas also issued a declaration of causes spelling out the rationale for declaring secession.[3] The document specifies several reasons for secession, including its solidarity with its \\"sister slave-holding States,\\" the U.S. government's inability to prevent Indian attacks, slave-stealing raids, and other border-crossing acts of banditry. It accuses northern politicians and abolitionists of committing a variety of outrages upon Texans. The bulk of the document offers justifications for slavery saying that remaining a part of the United States would jeopardize the security of the two. The declaration includes this extract praising slavery, in which the Union itself is referred to as the \\"confederacy\\":\\r\\n\\r\\nWe hold as undeniable truths that the governments of the various States, and of the confederacy itself, were established exclusively by the white race, for themselves and their posterity; that the African race had no agency in their establishment; that they were rightfully held and regarded as an inferior and dependent race, and in that condition only could their existence in this country be rendered beneficial or tolerable.\\r\\nAt this time, African Americans comprised 30 percent of the state's population, and they were overwhelmingly enslaved.[4] According to one Texan, keeping them enslaved was the primary goal of the state in joining the Confederacy:\\r\\n\\r\\nIndependence without slavery, would be valueless... The South without slavery would not be worth a mess of pottage.\\r\\nFollowing the election of Abraham Lincoln in 1860, public opinion in the cotton states of the Lower South (South Carolina through Texas) swung in favor of secession. By February 1861, the other six states of the sub-region had separately passed ordinances of secession. However, events in Texas were delayed, largely due to the resistance of Southern Unionist governor, Sam Houston. Unlike the other \\"cotton states\\"' chief executives, who took the initiative in secessionist efforts, Houston refused to call the Texas Legislature into special session to consider the question, relenting only when it became apparent citizens were prepared to act without him.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn early December 1860, before South Carolina even seceded, a group of State officials published via newspaper a call for a statewide election of convention delegates on January 8, 1861. This election was highly irregular, even for the standards of the day. It often relied on voice vote at public meetings, although \\"viva voce\\" (voice) voting for popular elections had been used since at least March 1846, less than three months after statehood.[6] Unionists were often discouraged from attending or chose not to participate. This resulted in lopsided representation of secessionists delegates.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe election call had stipulated for the delegates to assemble in convention on January 28. Houston called the Legislature into session, hoping that the elected body would declare the unauthorized convention illegal.[1] Though he expressed reservations about the election of Abraham Lincoln, he urged the State of Texas to reject secession, citing the horrors of war and a probable defeat of the South. The convention removed Houston from the governorship, then promoted the Lieutenant Governor, Edward Clark.[7] However, the Texas Legislature voted the delegates' expense money and supplies andover Houston's vetomade a pledge to uphold the legality of the Convention's actions. The only stipulation was that the people of Texas have the final say in referendum.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nWith gubernatorial forces routed, the Secession Convention convened on January 28 and, in the first order of business, voted to back the legislature 140ÿ28 in that an ordinance of secession, if adopted, be submitted for statewide consideration. The following day, convention president Oran Roberts introduced a resolution suggesting Texas leave the Union. The ordinance was read on the floor the next day, citing the failures of the federal government to protect the lives and property of Texas citizens and accusing the Northern states of using the same as a weapon to \\"strike down the interests and prosperity\\"[2] of the Southern people.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the grievances were listed, the ordinance repealed the one of July 4, 1845, in which Texas approved annexation by the United States and the Constitution of the United States, and revoked all powers of, obligations to, and allegiance to, the U.S. federal government and the U.S. Constitution.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the interests of historical significance and posterity, the ordinance was written to take effect on March 2, the date of Texas Declaration of Independence (and, coincidentally, Houston's birthday).\\r\\n\\r\\nOn February 1, members of the Legislature, and a huge crowd of private citizens, packed the House galleries and balcony to watch the final vote on the question of secession. Seventy \\"yea\\" votes were recorded before there was a single \\"nay.\\" One of the negative votes is enshrined in Texas history books. James Webb Throckmorton, from Collin County in North Texas, in response to the roar of hisses and boos and catcalls which greeted his decision, retorted, \\"When the rabble hiss, well may patriots tremble.\\" Appreciating his style, the crowd afforded him a grudging round of applause (like many Texans who initially opposed secession, Throckmorton accepted the result and served his state, rising to the rank of brigadier-general in the Confederate army).[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe final tally for secession was 166ÿ7, a vote whose legality was upheld by the Texas Legislature on February 7[citation needed]. Other than in South Carolina, where the vote was unanimous, this was the highest percentage of any other state of the Lower South. On February 7, the Legislature ordered a referendum to be held on the ordinance under the direction of the convention.[9] The decision was further affirmed on February 23 when a statewide referendum resulted in Texas voters approving the measure, 46,129 to 14,697.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe last order of business was to appoint a delegation to represent Texas in Montgomery, Alabama, where their counterparts from the other six seceding states were meeting to form a new Confederacy. On March 4, the convention assembled again to formally declare Texas out of the Union and to approve the \\"Constitution of the Confederate States of America\\", which had been drawn up by its \\"Provisional Congress\\" (as it turned out, Texas had already been admitted into the fold on March 1).\\r\\n\\r\\nIn March, George Williamson, the Louisianan state commissioner, addressed the Texan secession convention, where he called upon Texas and the slave states of the U.S. to declare secession from the Union in order to continue the institution of slavery:\\r\\n\\r\\nWith the social balance wheel of slavery to regulate its machinery, we may fondly indulge the hope that our Southern government will be perpetual... Louisiana looks to the formation of a Southern confederacy to preserve the blessings of African slavery...\\r\\nGovernor Sam Houston accepted secession but asserted that the Convention had no power to link the state with the new Southern Confederacy. Instead, he urged that Texas revert to its former status as an independent republic and stay neutral. Houston took his seat on March 16, the date state officials were scheduled to take an oath of allegiance to the Confederacy. He remained silent as his name was called out three times and, after failing to respond, the office of governor was declared vacant and Houston was deposed from office.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter Texas passed its Ordinance of Secession, the state government appointed four men as \\"Commissioners of Public Safety\\" to negotiate with the federal government for the safe transfer of military installations and bases in Texas to the Confederates. Along with land baron Samuel A. Maverick and Thomas J. Devine, Dr. Philip N. Luckett met with U.S. Army General David E. Twiggs on February 8, 1861, to arrange the surrender of the federal property in San Antonio, including the military stores being housed in the old Alamo mission.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs a result of the negotiations, Twiggs delivered his entire command and its associated Army property (10,000 rifled muskets) to the Confederacy, an act that brought cries of treason from Unionists throughout the state.[11] Almost immediately, Twiggs was dismissed from the U.S. Army by President Buchanan for \\"treachery to the flag of his country.\\" Shortly afterwards, he accepted a commission as general in the Confederate Army but was so upset by being branded a traitor that he wrote a letter to Buchanan stating the intention to call upon him for a \\"personal interview\\" (then a common euphemism to fight a duel).[12] Future Confederate general Robert E. Lee, then still a colonel in the U.S. Army, was in San Antonio at the time and when he heard the news of the surrender to Texas authorities, responded, \\"Has it come so soon as this?\\"[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nDespite the prevailing view of the vast majority of the state's politicians and the delegates to the Secession Convention, there were a significant number of Texans who opposed secession. The referendum on the issue indicated that some 25% favored remaining in the Union at the time the question was originally considered.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe largest concentration of anti-secession sentiment was among the German Texan population in the Texas Hill Country, and in some of the counties of North Texas. In the latter region, most of the residents were originally from states of the Upper South. Some of the leaders initially opposed to secession accepted the Confederate cause once the matter was decided, some withdrew from public life, others left the state, and a few even joined the Union army.[14] Confederate conscription laws forced most men of military age into the Confederate army, regardless of their sentiment. However, at least 2000 Texans joined the Union ranks.[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nMany Unionists were executed.[14][16] Conscription into the Confederate Army was unacceptable to many Unionists and some attempted to flee from Texas. Capt. James Duff, Confederate provost marshal for the Hill Country, executed two Unionists, prompting flight.[17] In August 1862, Confederate soldiers under Lt. Colin D. McRae tracked down a band of German Texans headed out of state and attacked their camp in a bend of the Nueces River. After a pitched battle that resulted in the deaths of two Confederates and the wounding of McRae and eighteen of his men, the Unionists were routed. Approximately 19 Unionists were killed in the fighting.[18] After the battle 9 to 11 of the wounded Unionists were murdered with shots to the head in what became known as the Nueces massacre. Another nine Unionists were pursued and executed in the following weeks.[19] Future Republican congressman Edward Degener was the father of two men who were murdered in the massacre.[20] The German population around Austin County, led by Paul Machemehl, was successful in reaching Mexico.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn October 1862, approximately 150 settlers in and around Cooke County on the Red River were arrested by the 11th Texas Cavalry led by Colonel William C. Young on the orders of Colonel James Bourland, Confederate Provost Marshal for northern Texas. A court was convened in Gainesville to try them for allegedly plotting to seize the arsenals at Sherman and Gainesville and to kill their Confederate neighbors, seize their property, and to cooperate with Union army forces poised to invade northern Texas from Arkansas and/or Indian Territory. Several of the settlers were hanged in what is now downtown Gainesville during the first week of October. Nineteen additional men were found guilty and hanged before the end of the month. A total of about forty Unionists were hanged in Gainesville, two were shot while trying to escape, and two more were hanged elsewhere after being turned over to a military tribunal. Under the primitive conditions on the Texas frontier during the Civil War, evidence against the accused was questionable, and the legal proceedings were highly imperfect. A granite monument in a small park marks the spot where the hangings took place.[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Confederacy's conscription act proved controversial, not only in Texas but all across the South. Despite the referendum result, some opponents argued that the war was being fought by poor people on behalf of a few wealthy slave owners. The Act exempted from the draft men who owned fifteen or more slaves.[21] Draft resistance was widespread especially among Texans of German or Mexican descent; many of the latter went to Mexico. Potential draftees went into hiding, Confederate officials hunted them down, and many were shot or captured and forced into the army.[22]\\r\\n\\r\\nSam Houston was the premier Southern Unionist in Texas. While he argued for slave property rights and deplored the election of the Lincoln Administration, he considered secession unconstitutional and thought secession at that moment in time was a \\"rash action\\" that was certain to lead to a conflict favoring the industrial and populated North. He predicted: \\"Let me tell you what is coming. After the sacrifice of countless millions of treasure and hundreds of thousands of lives, you may win Southern independence if God be not against you, but I doubt it. I tell you that, while I believe with you in the doctrine of states rights, the North is determined to preserve this Union. They are not a fiery, impulsive people as you are, for they live in colder climates. But when they begin to move in a given direction, they move with the steady momentum and perseverance of a mighty avalanche; and what I fear is, they will overwhelm the South.\\"[23][24]\\r\\n\\r\\nHouston rejected the actions of the Texas Secession Convention, believing it had overstepped its authority in becoming a member state of the newly formed Confederacy. He refused to take an oath of allegiance to the Confederacy and was deposed from office. In a speech he wrote, but did not deliver, he said:\\r\\n\\r\\nFellow-Citizens, in the name of your rights and liberties, which I believe have been trampled upon, I refuse to take this oath. In the name of the nationality of Texas, which has been betrayed by the Convention, I refuse to take this oath. In the name of the Constitution of Texas, I refuse to take this oath. In the name of my own conscience and manhood, which this Convention would degrade by dragging me before it, to pander to the malice of my enemies, I refuse to take this oath. I deny the power of this Convention to speak for Texas....I protest....against all the acts and doings of this convention and I declare them null and void.[24]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter his ouster from the governor's office, Houston maintained a low public profile until his death in July 1863. Before he died, Houston wrote a friend: \\"There comes a time a man's section is his country...I stand with mine. I was a conservative citizen of the United States...I am now a conservative citizen of the Southern Confederacy.\\"[25]\\r\\n\\r\\nOver 70,000 Texans served in the Confederate army and Texas regiments fought in every major battle throughout the war. Some men were veterans of the MexicanÿAmerican War; a few had served in the earlier Texas Revolution. The state furnished the Confederacy with 45 regiments of cavalry, 23 regiments of infantry, 12 battalions of cavalry, 4 battalions of infantry, 5 regiments of heavy artillery, and 30 batteries of light artillery. The state maintained at its own expense some additional troops that were for home defense. These included 5 regiments and 4 battalions of cavalry, and 4 regiments and one battalion of infantry. In 1862 the Confederate Congress in Richmond, Virginia, passed a conscription law that ordered all men from 18 to 45 years of age to be placed into military service except ministers, state, city, county officers, and certain slave owners; all persons holding 20 slaves or more were exempt from Confederate conscription under the \\"Twenty Negro Law\\".[26]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the first companies of Texas soldiers reached Richmond, Virginia, Confederate President Jefferson Davis greeted them with the words: \\"Texans! The troops of other states have their reputations to gain, but the sons of the defenders of the Alamo have theirs to maintain. I am assured that you will be faithful to the trust.\\"[27]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\"The Texas Brigade\\" (also known as \\"Hood's Brigade\\") was a unit composed of the 1st, 4th and 5th Texas infantry regiments augmented at times by the 18th Georgia Infantry and Hampton's (South Carolina) Legion until they were permanently teamed with the 3rd Arkansas Infantry. Often serving as \\"shock troops\\" of General Robert E. Lee's Army of Northern Virginia, the Texas Brigade was \\"always favorites\\" of General Lee and on more than one occasion Lee praised their fighting qualities, remarking that none had brought greater honor to their native state than \\"my Texans.\\" Hood's men suffered severe casualties in a number of fights, most notably at the Battle of Antietam, where they faced off with Wisconsin's Iron Brigade, and at Gettysburg, where they assaulted Houck's Ridge and then Little Round Top.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\"Walker's Greyhound Division\\" was a division composed of four brigades with Texan units; the only division in the Confederate States Army that maintained its single-state composition throughout the War. Formed in 1862 under command of Major General John George Walker it fought in the Western Theater and the Trans-Mississippi Department, and was considered an elite backbone of the army. Detached from the division in 1863, the 4th brigade fought at the Battle of Arkansas Post, where it became isolated and was forced to surrender. A new fourth brigade was added the division in 1865.\\r\\n\\r\\nAmong the most famous mounted units were Terry's Texas Rangers, a militia of former rangers and frontiersmen, many of whom later became peacekeepers in the Old West; and the 33rd Texas Cavalry Regiment of Colonel Santos Benavides, which guarded the Confederate cotton trade lines from Texas into northern Mexico.\\r\\n\\r\\nOver 2,000 Texas men joined the Union Army. Notable among them was future Texas governor Edmund J. Davis who initially commanded the Union Army's 1st Texas Cavalry and rose to the rank of brigadier general.\\r\\n\\r\\nTexas's relatively large German population around Austin County led by Paul Machemehl tried to remain neutral in the War but eventually left Confederate Texas for Mexico. East Texas gave the most support to secession, and the only East Texas counties in which significant numbers of people opposed secession were Angelina County, Fannin County, and Lamar County, although these counties supplied many men to Texas regiments, including the 9th Texas Infantry Regiment; the 1st Partisan Rangers; 3rd, 4th, 9th, 27th, and 29th Texas Cavalry; and the 9th Texas Field Battery.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1862, Abraham Lincoln named a former United States Congressman, Andrew J. Hamilton, as the Military Governor of Texas. Hamilton held the title throughout the War. During the early stages of Reconstruction Hamilton was named as the first provisional civilian governor. For a time thereafter, active-duty U.S. Army officers served as military governors of Texas.\\r\\n\\r\\nYears into the war, one Confederate soldier from Texas gave his reasons for fighting for the Confederacy, stating that \\"we are fighting for our property\\", whereas Union soldiers were fighting for the \\"flimsy and abstract idea that a negro is equal to an Anglo\\".[28]\\r\\n\\r\\nTexas did not experience many significant battles. However, the Union mounted several attempts to capture the \\"Trans-Mississippi\\" regions of Texas and Louisiana from 1862 until the war's end. With ports to the east captured or under blockade, Texas in particular became a blockade-running haven. Referred to as the \\"backdoor\\" of the Confederacy, Texas and western Louisiana continued to provide loads of harvested cotton that were transported overland to the Mexican border town of Matamoros, Tamaulipas and shipped to Europe in exchange for supplies. Determined to shut off this trade, the Union mounted several attacks, each of them unsuccessful.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Union Navy blockaded the principal seaport, Galveston, for four years, and federal troops occupied the city for three months in late 1862. Confederate troops under Gen. John B. Magruder recaptured the city on January 1, 1863 and it remained in Confederate hands until the end of the war. A few days later the Confederate raider CSS Alabama attacked and sank the USS Hatteras in a naval engagement off the coast of Galveston.\\r\\n\\r\\nA few other cities also fell to Union troops at times during the war, including Port Lavaca, Indianola, and Brownsville. Federal attempts to seize control of Laredo, Corpus Christi, and Sabine Pass failed. By the end of the war no territory but Brazos Island and El Paso was in Union hands.  The California Column occupied the region around El Paso from 1862 to the end of the war.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe most notable military battle in Texas during the war happened on September 8, 1863. At the Second Battle of Sabine Pass, a small garrison of 46 Confederates from the mostly-Irish Davis Guards under Lt. Richard W. Dowling, 1st Texas Heavy Artillery, defeated a much larger Union force from New Orleans under Gen. William B. Franklin. Skilled gunnery by Dowling's troops disabled the lead ships in Franklin's flotilla, prompting the remainder4,000 men on 27 shipsto retreat back to New Orleans. This victory against such overwhelming odds resulted in the Confederate Congress passing a special resolution of recognition, and the only contemporary military decoration of the South, the Davis Guard Medal.[29] CSA President Jefferson Davis stated, \\"Sabine Pass will stand, perhaps for all time, as the greatest military victory in the history of the world.\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1864, many Texas forces, including a division under Camille de Polignac, a French prince and Confederate general, moved into Northwestern Louisiana to stall Union Maj. Gen. Nathaniel Banks' Red River Campaign, which was intended to advance into Texas from its eastern border. Confederate forces halted the expedition at the Battle of Mansfield, just east of the Texas border.\\r\\n\\r\\nUnion forces from Brazos Island launched the Brazos Santiago Expedition, leading to the last battle of the Civil War, the Battle of Palmito Ranch, fought in Texas on May 12, 1865, well after Robert E. Lee's surrender on April 9, 1865, at Old Appomattox Court House, Virginia.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the spring of 1865, Texas contained over 60,000 soldiers of the Army of the Trans-Mississippi under General Edmund Kirby Smith. As garrison troops far removed from the main theaters of the war, morale had deteriorated to the point of frequent desertion and thievery. News of the surrender of Lee and other Confederate generals east of the Mississippi finally reached Texas around April 20. Local Confederate authorities had mixed opinions on their future course of action. Most senior military leaders vowed to press on with the war, including commanding general Kirby Smith. Many soldiers, however, greeted frequent speeches whose theme was \\"fight on, boys\\" with derision, or simply failed to attend them.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe month of May brought increasing rates of desertion. News of Joseph E. Johnston's and Richard Taylor's surrenders confirmed that Texas, Louisiana, and Arkansas were now essentially alone to continue the Confederate cause. On May 14, troops in Galveston briefly mutinied, but were persuaded to remain under arms. However, morale continued to sink. Generals John B. Magruder and Kirby Smith (who had already corresponded with Union Maj. Gen. John Pope regarding surrender terms on May 9) no longer sought to rally their demoralized troops, but rather began discussing the distribution of Confederate government property. Magruder pleaded that the rapid disbanding of the army would prevent depredations by disgruntled soldiers against the civilian population.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe haste to disband the army, combined with the pressing need to protect Confederate property from Union confiscation, created general mayhem. Soldiers began openly pillaging the Galveston quartermasters stores on May 21. Over the next few days, a mob demanded that a government warehouse be opened to them, and soldiers detained and plundered a train. Several hundred civilians sacked the blockade runner Lark when it docked on May 24, and troops sent to pacify the crowd soon joined in the plunder. On May 23, residents in Houston sacked the ordnance building and the clothing bureau. Riots continued in the city until May 26. Both government and private stores were raided extensively in Tyler, Marshall, Huntsville, Gonzales, Hempstead, La Grange, and Brownsville. In Navasota, a powder explosion cost eight lives and flattened twenty buildings. In Austin, the State Treasury was raided and $17,000 in gold was stolen. By May 27, half of the original confederate forces in Texas had deserted or been disbanded, and formal order had disappeared into lawlessness in many areas of Texas.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe formal remnants of Kirby Smith's army had finally disintegrated by the end of May. Upon his arrival in Houston from Shreveport, the general called a court of inquiry to investigate the \\"causes and manner of the disbandment of the troops in the District of Texas, New Mexico and Arizona.\\" The May 30 findings laid the blame primarily on the civilian population. Kirby Smith addressed his few remaining soldiers and condemned those that had fled for not struggling to the last and leaving him \\"a commander without an armyÿ a General without troops.\\" On June 2, he formally surrendered what was left of the Army of the \\"Trans-Mississippi\\".\\r\\n\\r\\nFederal troops did not arrive in Texas to restore order until June 19, 1865, when Union Maj. Gen. Gordon Granger and 2,000 Union soldiers arrived on Galveston Island to take possession of the state and enforce the new freedoms of former slaves. The Texas holiday Juneteenth commemorates this date. The Stars and Stripes were not raised over Austin until June 25.[30]\\r\\n\\r\\nPresident Andrew Johnson appointed Union General Andrew J. Hamilton, a prominent politician before the war, as the provisional governor on June 17. He granted amnesty to ex-confederates if they promised to support the Union in the future, appointing some to office. On March 30, 1870, the United States Congress permitted Texas' representatives to take their seat in Congress,[31] although Texas did not meet all the formal requirements for readmission.\\r\\n\\r\\nA number of notable leaders were associated with Texas during the Civil War. John Bell Hood gained fame as the commander of the Texas Brigade in the Army of Northern Virginia and played a prominent role as an army commander late in the war. \\"Sul\\" Ross was a significant leader in a number of \\"Trans-Mississippi\\" Confederate armies. Felix Huston Robertson was the only native Texan Confederate general. Capt. TJ Goree was one of Lt. General James Longstreet's most trusted aides. John H. Reagan was an influential member of Jefferson Davis's cabinet. Col. Santos Benavides was a Confederate colonel during the American Civil War. Benavides was the highest-ranking Tejano soldier to serve in the Confederate military.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe office of Governor of Texas was in flux throughout the war, with several men in power at various times. Sam Houston was governor when Texas seceded from the United States, but refused to declare any loyalty to the new Confederacy. He was replaced by Lieutenant Governor Edward Clark. Clark filled the rest of Houston's term in 1861, and narrowly lost re-election by just 124 votes to Francis Lubbock. During his tenure, Lubbock supported Confederate conscription, working to draft all able-bodied men, including resident aliens, into the Confederate army. When Lubbock's term ended in 1863, he joined the military. Ardent secessionist Pendleton Murrah replaced him in office. Even after Robert E. Lee surrendered in 1865, Murrah encouraged Texans to continue the revolution, and he and several supporters fled to Mexico.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough one of the original members of the Confederate States of America, much of Texas was not settled until after the Civil War. However, Confederate Heroes Day is an official state holiday, and the month of April is recognized by the Texas Senate as Confederate History Month.[32] Although not an official holiday, April 26 is, among Southern historical organizations within the state, often observed as \\"Confederate Memorial Day.\\" On the south lawn of the state capitol in Austin is a Confederate monument, and several other memorials to individual Texas Confederate military units are nearby. In addition, most Texas county courthouse grounds feature a Confederate memorial.[33]\\r\\nTexas' largest city, Houston, features a monument to the Confederacy at its oldest city park, Sam Houston Park, titled \\"Spirit of the Confederacy.\\" It was sculpted in bronze by Louis Amateis in 1908.[34]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCoordinates: 31N 100W? / ?31N 100W? / 31; -100","input":"Why did texas originally joined the confederate states of america?"},{"output":"Jerry Goldsmith","context":"This is a list of composers of music for the series Star Trek, and other articles about music associated with the franchise.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe following individuals wrote movie scores, theme music, or incidental music for several episodes and/or installments of the Star Trek franchise.\\r\\nOther notable composers who contributed music to at least one episode include Don Davis, John Debney, Jerry Fielding, Brian Tyler, and George Romanis.\\r\\nThe score for Star Trek: The Motion Picture was written by Jerry Goldsmith, who would later compose the scores Star Trek V: The Final Frontier, Star Trek: First Contact, Star Trek: Insurrection, and Star Trek: Nemesis, as well as the themes to the television series Star Trek: The Next Generation and Star Trek: Voyager.[3][4] Gene Roddenberry had originally wanted Goldsmith to score Star Trek's pilot episode, \\"The Cage\\", but the composer was unavailable.[5] When Robert Wise signed on to direct the film, Paramount asked the director if he had any objection to using Goldsmith. Wise, who had worked with the composer for The Sand Pebbles, replied \\"Hell, no. He's great!\\" Wise would later consider his work with Goldsmith one of the best relationships he ever had with a composer.[6]\\r\\nGoldsmith was influenced by the style of the romantic, sweeping music of Star Wars. \\"When you stop and think about it, space is a very romantic thought. It is, to me, like the Old West, were up in the universe. Its about discovery and new life [...] its really the basic premise of Star Trek,\\" he said. Goldsmith's initial bombastic main theme reminded Ramsay and Wise of sailing ships. Unable to articulate what he felt was wrong with the piece, Wise recommended writing an entirely different piece. Although irked by the rejection, Goldsmith consented to re-work his initial ideas.[5] The rewriting of the theme required changes to several sequences Goldsmith had scored without writing a main title piece. The approach of Kirk and Scott to the drydocked Enterprise by shuttle lasted a ponderous five minutes due to the effect shots coming in late and unedited, requiring Goldsmith to maintain interest with a revised and developed cue.[7] :88 Star Trek: The Motion Picture is the only Star Trek film to have a true overture, using \\"Ilia's Theme\\" in this role. Star Trek and The Black Hole would be the only feature films to use an overture from the end of 1979 until the year 2000 (with the movie Dancer in the Dark).[8]\\r\\nMuch of the recording equipment used to create the movie's intricately complicated sound effects was, at the time, extremely cutting edge. Among these pieces of equipment was the ADS (Advanced Digital Synthesizer) 11, manufactured by Pasadena, California custom synthesizer manufacturer Con Brio, Inc. The movie provided major publicity and was used to advertise the synthesizer, though no price was given.[9] The film's soundtrack also provided a debut for the Blaster Beam, an electronic instrument 12 to 15 feet (3.7 to 4.6?m) long.[10][11] It was created by musician Craig Huxley, who played a small role in two episodes of the original television series.[7]:89[12] The Blaster had steel wires connected to amplifiers fitted to the main piece of aluminum; the device was played with an artillery shell. Goldsmith heard it and immediately decided to use it for V'ger's cues.[5] An enormous pipe organ first plays the V'ger theme on the Enterprise's approach, a literal indication of the machine's power.[7]:89\\r\\nGoldsmith scored The Motion Picture over a period of three to four months, a relatively relaxed schedule compared to typical production, but time pressures resulted in Goldsmith bringing on colleagues to assist in the work. Alexander Courage, composer of the original Star Trek theme, provided arrangements to accompany Kirk's log entries, while Fred Steiner wrote the music to accompany the Enterprise achieving warp speed and first meeting V'ger.[7]:90 The rush to finish the rest of the film impacted the score.[7]:89 The final recording session finished at 2:00am on December 1,[5] only five days before the film's release.[13]\\r\\nA soundtrack featuring the film's music was released in 1979 together with the film debut, and was one of Goldsmith's best-selling scores.[7]:90 Sony's Legacy Recordings released an expanded two-disc edition of the soundtrack on November 10, 1998. The album added an additional 21 minutes of music to supplement the original track list, and was resequenced to reflect the story line of the film. The first disc features the expanded score, while the sequence disc contains \\"Inside Star Trek\\", a spoken word documentary.[14] In 2012, La-La Land Records released a comprehensive 3 CD special edition which includes the complete score along with alternates and outtakes remastered from restored original 16 track masters, the original digital album master, and popular cover versions of the film's love theme.\\r\\nWhile Jerry Goldsmith had composed the music for The Motion Picture, he was not an option for The Wrath of Khan due to a budget reduction; director Nicholas Meyer's composer for Time After Time, Mikl܇s R܇zsa, was likewise prohibitively expensive.[7]:105 Meyer and producer Harve Bennett wanted the music for the sequel to go in a different direction, but had not decided on a composer by the time filming began. Initially Meyer hoped to hire an associate named John Morgan, but Morgan lacked film experience, which would have troubled the studio.[7]:5\\r\\nParamount's vice-president of music Joel Sill took a liking to a 28-year-old composer named James Horner, feeling that his demo tapes stood out from generic film music.[7]:6 Horner was introduced to Bennett, Meyer and Salin.[15] Horner said that \\"[The producers] did not want the kind of score they had gotten before. They did not want a John Williams score, per se. They wanted something different, more modern.\\"[16] When asked about how he landed the assignment, the composer replied that \\"the producers loved my work for Wolfen, and had heard my music for several other projects, and I think, so far as I've been told, they liked my versatility very much. I wanted the assignment, and I met with them, we all got along well, they were impressed with my music, and that's how it happened.\\"[17] Horner agreed with the producers' expectations and agreed to begin work in mid-January 1982.[15]\\r\\nIn keeping with the nautical tone, Meyer wanted music evocative of seafaring and swashbuckling, and the director and composer worked together closely, becoming friends in the process.[7]:6 As a classical music fan, Meyer was able to describe the effects and sounds he wanted in the music.[16] While Horner's style was described as \\"echoing both the bombastic and elegiac elements of John Williams' Star Wars and Jerry Goldsmith's original Star Trek (The Motion Picture) scores,\\"[18] Horner was expressly told not to use any of Goldsmith's score. Instead Horner adapted the opening fanfare of Alexander Courage's Star Trek television theme. \\"The fanfare draws you in immediatelyyou know you're going to get a good movie,\\" Horner said.[7]:9\\r\\nIn comparison to the flowing main theme, Khan's leitmotif was designed as a percussive texture that could be overlaid with other music and emphasized the character's insanity.[19] The seven-note brass theme was echoplexed to emphasize the character's ruminations about the past while on Ceti Alpha V, but does not play fully until Reliant's attack on the Enterprise. Many elements drew from Horner's previous work (a rhythm that accompanies Khan's theme during the surprise attack borrows from an attack theme from Wolfen, in turn influenced by Goldsmith's score for Alien. Musical moments from the original television series are also heard during investigation of the Regula space station and elsewhere.[7]:106ÿ107\\r\\nTo Horner, the \\"stuff underneath\\" the main story was what needed to be addressed by the score; in The Wrath of Khan, this was the relationship between Kirk and Spock. The main theme serves as Kirk's theme, with a mellower section following that is the theme for the Starship Enterprise.[7]:8 Horner also wrote a motif for Spock, to emphasize the character's depth: \\"By putting a theme over Spock, it warms him and he becomes three-dimensional rather than a collection of schticks.\\"[19] The difference in the short, French horn-based cues for the villain and longer melodies for the heroes helped to differentiate characters and ships during the battle sequences.[7]:9\\r\\nThe soundtrack was Horner's first major film score,[18] and was written in four and a half weeks. The resulting 72 minutes of music was then performed by a 91-piece orchestra.[16] Recording sessions took place April 12ÿ15 at the Warner Brothers lot, The Burbank Studios.[7]:9 A pickup session was held on April 30 to record music for the Mutara nebula battle, while another session held on May 3 was used to cover the recently changed epilogue.[7]:10 Horner used synthesizers for ancillary effects; at the time, science-fiction films such as E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial and The Thing were eschewing the synthesizer in favor of more traditional orchestras.[20] Craig Huxley performed his invented instrumentthe Blaster Beamduring recording, as well as composing and performing electronic music for the Genesis Project video.[7]:17 While most of the film was \\"locked in\\" by the time Horner had begun composing music, he had to change musical cue orchestration after the integration of special effects caused changes in scene durations.[16]\\r\\nComposer James Horner returned to score The Search for Spock, fulfilling a promise he had made to Bennett on The Wrath of Khan. Much like the content of the film, Horner's music was a direct continuation of the score he wrote for the previous film. When writing music for The Wrath of Khan, Horner was aware he would reuse certain cues for an impending sequel; two major themes he reworked were for Genesis and Spock. While the Genesis theme supplants the title music Horner wrote for The Wrath of Khan, the end credits were quoted \\"almost verbatim\\".[21]\\r\\nIn hours-long discussions with Bennett and Nimoy, Horner agreed with the director that the \\"romantic and more sensitive\\" cues were more important than the \\"bombastic\\" ones.[21] Horner had written Spock's theme to give the character more dimension: \\"By putting a theme over Spock, it warms him and he becomes three-dimensional rather than a collection of schticks,\\" he said.[22] The theme was expanded in The Search for Spock to represent the ancient alien mysticism and culture of Spock and Vulcan.[21]\\r\\nAmong the new cues Horner wrote was a \\"percussive and atonal\\" theme for the Klingons which is represented heavily in the film.[21] Jeff Bond described the cue as a compromise between music from Horner's earlier film Wolfen, Khan's motif from The Wrath of Khan, and Jerry Goldsmith's Klingon music from The Motion Picture.[7]:113 Horner also adapted music from Sergei Prokofiev's Romeo and Juliet for part of the Enterprise theft sequence and its destruction, while the scoring to Spock's resurrection on Vulcan draws similarities to Horner's Brainstorm ending.[7]:114\\r\\nJames Horner, composer for The Wrath of Khan and The Search for Spock, declined to return for The Voyage Home. Because of this Nimoy turned to his friend Leonard Rosenman, who had written the music to, among other films, Fantastic Voyage, Ralph Bakshi's The Lord of the Rings, and three Planet of the Apes sequels.[7]:119[23] Rosenman wrote an arrangement of Alexander Courage's Star Trek television theme as the title music for The Voyage Home, but Nimoy suggested that he write his own instead. As music critic Jeff Bond writes, \\"The final result was one of the most unusual Star Trek movie themes,\\" consisting of a six note theme and variations set against a repetitious four note brass motif; the theme's bridge is reminiscent of material in Rosenman's \\"Frodo March\\" for The Lord of the Rings.[7]:119 The melody makes appearances in the beginning of the film at Vulcan as well as when Taylor seeks Kirk's help finding her whales.[7]:120\\r\\nThe Earth-based setting of the filming gave Rosenman leeway to write a variety of music in different styles. Nimoy intended the crew's introduction to the streets of San Francisco to be accompanied by something reminiscent of George Gershwin, but Rosenman changed the director's mind[7]:131 and the scene was scored with a contemporary jazz fusion piece by Yellowjackets. When Chekov flees detention aboard the aircraft carrier, Rosenman wrote a bright cue that incorporated classical Russian compositions, while the escape from the hospital was done in a baroque style. More familiar Rosenman compositions included the action music as the Bird of Prey and a whaling ship face off in open water, while the whale's communication with the probe used atmospheric music reminiscent of the composer's work in Fantastic Voyage. After the probe leaves, the music turns into a Vivaldiesque \\"whale fugue\\". The first sighting of the Enterprise-A uses the Alexander Courage theme before the end title music.[7]:120\\r\\nMark Mangini served as The Voyage Home's sound designer. He described it as different from working on many other films because Nimoy appreciated the role of sound effects and made sure that they were prominent in the film. Since many sounds familiar to Star Trek had already been establishedthe Bird of Prey's cloaking device, the transporter beam, et al.Mangini focused on making only small changes to them. The most important sounds were those created by the whales and the probe. Mangini's brother lived close to Roger Payne, a biologist who had many recordings of whale song. Mangini went through the tapes and chose sounds that could be mixed to suggest a sort of language and conversation. The probe's screeching calls were the whale song in distorted form. The humpback's communication with the probe at the climax of the film contained no dramatic music, meaning that Mangini's sounds had to stand alone. He recalled that he had some difficulty with envisioning how the scene would unfold, leading Bennett to perform a puppet show to explain. Nimoy and the other producers were unhappy with Mangini's attempts to create the probe's droning operating noise; after 18 attempts, the sound designer finally asked Nimoy what he thought the probe should sound like, and recorded Nimoy's response. Nimoy's voice was distorted with \\"just the tiniest bit of dressing\\" and used as the final sound.[24]\\r\\nThe punk music that blares during the bus scene was written by Thatcher after he learned that the audio to be added to the scene would be \\"Duran Duran, or whoever\\" and not \\"raw\\" and authentic punk.[25] Thatcher collaborated with Mangini and two sound editors (who were in punk bands) to create their own music. They decided that punk distilled down to the sentiment of \\"I hate you\\", and wrote a sound to match. Recording in the sound studio as originally planned produced too clean a sound, so they moved to the outside hallway and recorded the entire band in one take using cheap microphones to create the distorted sound intended.[26] The song was later used for Paramount's \\"Back to the Beach\\".[25]\\r\\nMusic critic Jeff Bond wrote that Shatner made \\"at least two wise decisions\\" in making The Final Frontier; he chose Laurence Luckinbill to play the role of Sybok, and he hired Jerry Goldsmith to compose the film's score. Goldsmith had written the Academy Award-nominated score for Star Trek: The Motion Picture, and the new Trek film was an opportunity to craft music with a similar level of ambition while adding action and charactertwo elements largely missing from The Motion Picture.[7]:133\\r\\nGoldsmith's main theme begins with the traditional opening notes from Alexander Courage's original television series theme; an ascending string and electronic bridge leads to a rendition of the march from The Motion Picture. According to Jeff Bond, Goldsmith's use of The Motion Picture's march led to some confusion among Star Trek: The Next Generation fans, as they were unfamiliar with the music's origins and believed that Goldsmith was stealing the theme to The Next Generation, which was itself The Motion Picture march.[7]:133 Another theme from The Motion Picture that makes a return appearance is the Klingon theme from the 1979 film's opening scene. Here, the theme is treated in what Bond termed a \\"Prokofiev-like style as opposed to the avant-garde counterpoint\\" as seen in The Motion Picture. Goldsmith also added a crying ram's horn.[7]:134\\r\\nThe breadth of The Final Frontier's locations led Goldsmith to eschew the two-themed approach of The Motion Picture in favor of leitmotifs, recurring music used for locations and characters. Sybok is introduced with a synthesized motif in the opening scene of the film, while when Kirk and Spock discuss him en route to Nimbus III it is rendered in a more mysterious fashion. The motif also appears in the action cue as Kirk and company land on Nimbus III and try to free the hostages.[7]:133 When Sybok boards the Enterprise, a new four-note motif played by low brass highlights the character's obsession. The Sybok theme from then on is used in either a benevolent sense or a more percussive, dark rendition. Arriving at Sha-ka-ree, the planet's five-note theme bears resemblance to Goldsmith's unicorn theme from Legend; \\"...the two melodies represent very similar ideas: lost innocence and the tragic impossibility of recapturing paradise,\\" writes Bond. The music features cellos conveying a pious quality, while the appearance of \\"God\\" begins with string glissandos but turns to a dark rendition of Sybok's theme as its true nature is exposed.[7]:134 As the creature attacks Kirk, Spock and McCoy, the more aggressive Sybok theme takes on an attacking rhythm. When Spock appeals to the Klingons for help, the theme takes on a sensitive character before returning to a powerful sequence as the ship destroys the god-creature.[7]:135\\r\\nDirector Nicholas Meyer's original plan for the score of The Undiscovered Country was to adapt Gustav Holst's orchestral suite The Planets. The plan proved unfeasibly expensive, so Meyer began listening to demo tapes submitted by composers.[27] Meyer described most of the demos as generic \\"movie music\\", but was intrigued by one tape by a young composer named Cliff Eidelman. Eidelman, then 26, had made a career in composing for ballets, television, and film, but despite work on fourteen features, no film had been the hit needed to propel Eidelman to greater fame.[28]\\r\\nIn conversations with Eidelman, Meyer mentioned that since the marches that accompanied the main titles for other Star Trek films were so good, he had no desire to compete with them by composing a bombastic opening. He also felt that since the film was darker than its predecessors, it demanded something different musically as a result. He mentioned the opening to Igor Stravinsky's The Firebird as similar to the foreboding sound he wanted. Two days later Eidelman produced a tape of his idea for the main theme, played on a synthesizer. Meyer was impressed by the speed of the work and the close fit to his vision.[27] Meyer approached producer Steven Charles-Jaffe with Eidelman's CD, which reminded Jaffe of Bernard Herrmann; Eidelman was given the task of composing the score.[29]\\r\\nEidelman's previous project had been creating a compilation of music from the past five Star Trek films, and he consciously avoided taking inspiration from those scores. \\"[The compilation] showed me what to stay away from, because I couldn't do James Horner [composer for The Wrath of Khan and The Search for Spock] as well as James Horner,\\" he said.[30] Since he was hired early on in production, Eidelman had an unusually long time to develop his ideas, and he was able to visit the sets during filming. While the film was in early production Eidelman worked on electronic drafts of the final score, to placate executives who were unsure about using a relatively unknown composer.[30]\\r\\nEidelman stated that he finds science fiction the most interesting and exciting genre to compose for, and that Meyer told him to treat the film as a fresh start, rather than drawing on old Star Trek themes.[29] Eidelman wanted the music to aid the visuals; for Rura Penthe, he strove to create an atmosphere that reflected the alien and dangerous setting, introducing exotic instruments for color. Besides using percussion from around the world, Eidelman treated the choir as percussion, with the Klingon language translation for \\"to be, or not to be\\" (\\"taH pagh, taHbe\\") being repeated in the background. Spock's theme was designed to be an ethereal counterpart to the motif for Kirk and the Enterprise, aimed at capturing \\"the emotional gleam in the captain's eye\\".[31] Kirk's internal dilemma about what the future holds was echoed in the main theme: \\"It's Kirk taking control one last time and as he looks out into the stars he has the spark again [...] But there's an unresolved note, because it's very important that he doesn't trust the Klingons. He doesn't want to go on this trip even though the spark is there that overtook him.\\"[32] For the climactic battle, Eidelman starts the music quietly, building the intensity as the battle progresses.[29]\\r\\nDennis McCarthy, a composer who had worked on The Next Generation, was given the task of composing for Star Trek Generations. Critic Jeff Bond wrote that while McCarthy's score was \\"tasked with straddling the styles of both series\\", it also offered the opportunity for the composer to produce stronger dramatic writing. His opening music was an ethereal choral piece that plays while a floating champagne bottle tumbles through space. For the action scenes with the Enterprise-B, McCarthy used low brass chords and touches. Kirk was given a brass motif accented by snare drums (a touch verboten during The Next Generation), while the scene ends with a dissonant notes as Scott and Chekov discover Kirk has been blown into space.[7]:152\\r\\nMcCarthy expanded his brassy style for the film's action sequences, such as the battle over Veridian III and the crash-landing of the Enterprise. For Picard's trip to the Nexus, more choral music and synthesizers accompany Picard's discovery of his family. The film's only distinct theme, a broad fanfare, first plays when Picard and Kirk meet. The theme blends McCarthy's theme for Picard from The Next Generation's first season, notes from the theme for Star Trek: Deep Space Nine, and Alexander Courage's classic Star Trek fanfare.[7]:152\\r\\nFilm composer Jerry Goldsmith scored First Contact, his third Star Trek feature. Goldsmith wrote a sweeping main title which begins with Alexander Courage's classic Star Trek fanfare.[33] Instead of composing a menacing theme to underscore the Borg, Goldsmith wrote a pastoral theme linked to humanity's hopeful first contact. The theme uses a four-note motif used in Goldsmith's Star Trek V: The Final Frontier score, which is used in First Contact as a friendship theme and general thematic link.[7]:155ÿ156 A menacing march with touches of synthesizers was used to represent the Borg. In addition to composing new music, Goldsmith used music from his previous Star Trek scores, including his theme from The Motion Picture.[33] The Klingon theme from the same film is used to represent Worf.[34]\\r\\nBecause of delays with Paramount's The Ghost and the Darkness, the already-short four week production schedule was cut to just three weeks. While Berman was concerned about the move,[7]:158 Goldsmith hired his son, Joel, to assist.[7]:155 The young composer provided additional music for the film, writing three cues based on his father's motifs[34] and a total of 22?minutes of music.[33] Joel used variations of his father's Borg music and the Klingon theme as Worf fights hand-to-hand[7]:156 (Joel said that he and his father decided to use the theme for Worf separately).[7]:159 When the Borg invade sickbay and the medical hologram distracts them, Joel wrote what critic Jeff Bond termed \\"almost Coplandesque\\" material of tuning strings and clarinet, but the cue was unused. While Joel composed many of the film's action cues, his father contributed to the spacewalk and Phoenix flight sequences. During the fight on the deflector dish, Goldsmith used low-register electronics punctuated by stabs of violent, dissonant strings.[7]:156\\r\\nIn a break with Star Trek film tradition, the soundtrack incorporated two licensed songs: Roy Orbison's \\"Ooby Dooby\\" and Steppenwolf's \\"Magic Carpet Ride\\". GNP Crescendo president Neil Norman explained that the decision to include the tracks was controversial, but said that \\"Frakes did the most amazing job of integrating those songs into the story that we had to use them\\".[35]\\r\\nGNP released the First Contact soundtrack on December 2, 1996.[35] The album contained 51?minutes of music, with 35?minutes of Jerry Goldsmith's score, 10?minutes of additional music by Joel Goldsmith, \\"Ooby Dooby\\" and \\"Magic Carpet Ride\\". The compact disc shipped with CD-ROM features only accessible if played on a personal computer,[36] including interviews with Berman, Frakes, and Goldsmith.[35]\\r\\nInsurrection was composer Jerry Goldsmith's fourth film score for the franchise.[7]:163 Goldsmith continued using the march and Klingon themes he crafted for Star Trek: The Motion Picture in 1979, with adding new themes and variations. Insurrection opens with Alexander Courage's Star Trek: The Original Series fanfare, also introducing a six-note motif used in many of the film's action sequences. The Ba'ku are scored with a pastoral theme, repeating harps, string sections and a woodwind solo. The Ba'ku's ability to slow time uses a variation of this music.[7]:164\\r\\nGoldsmith approached starship sequences with quick bursts of brass music. While observers are watching the Ba'ku unseen, Goldsmith employed a \\"spying theme\\". Composed of a piano, timpani percussion, and brass, the theme builds until interrupted by the action theme as Data opens fire. Goldsmith did not write a motif for the Son'a, choosing to score the action sequence without designating the Son'a as an antagonist (suggesting the film's revelation that the Son'a and Ba'ku are related.) The film's climax is scored with the action material, balanced by \\"sense of wonder\\" music similar to cues from The Motion Picture.[7]:164\\r\\nThe music to Nemesis was the final Star Trek score and penultimate film score composed and conducted by Jerry Goldsmith before his death in 2004 (not including his music for the 2003 film Timeline, which was rejected due to a complicated post-production process). The score opens with Alexander Courage's Star Trek: The Original Series fanfare, but quickly transitions into a much darker theme to accompany the conflict between the Reman and Romulan empires. Goldsmith also composed a new 5-note theme to accompany the character Shinzon and the Scimitar, which is manipulated throughout the score to reflect the multiple dimensions of the character. Goldsmith also incorporated a number of zipping, swooshing synthesizers into the conventional orchestra to illustrate the suspenseful and horrific elements of the story. The score is book-ended with Goldsmith's theme from Star Trek: The Motion Picture, following a brief excerpt from the popular 1929 song \\"Blue Skies\\" by Irving Berlin.[37][38]\\r\\nMichael Giacchino, Abrams' most frequent collaborator, composed the music for Star Trek. He kept the original theme by Alexander Courage for the end credits, which Abrams said symbolized the momentum of the crew coming together.[39] Giacchino admitted personal pressure in scoring the film, as \\"I grew up listening to all of that great [Trek] music, and that's part of what inspired me to do what I'm doing [...] You just go in scared. You just hope you do your best. It's one of those things where the film will tell me what to do.\\"[40] Scoring took place at the Sony Scoring Stage with a 107-piece orchestra and 40-person choir. An erhu, performed by Karen Han, was used for the Vulcan themes. A distorted recording was used for the Romulans.[41] Varse Sarabande, the record label responsible for releasing albums of Giacchino's previous scores for Alias, Lost, Mission: Impossible III, and Speed Racer, released the soundtrack for the film on May 5.[42]\\r\\nBefore the beginning of principal photography, Michael Giacchino announced that he would compose the score to Star Trek Into Darkness. Just as with the previous installment, Giacchno kept the original theme by Alexander Courage for the end credits, allowing for his newer themes for the various young members of Enterprise to evolve.\\r\\nAs with the previous two films, Michael Giacchino composed the score to Star Trek Beyond.","input":"Who composed the star trek next generation theme?"},{"output":"8.6 miles","context":"The SeattleÿBainbridge ferry is a ferry route across Puget Sound between Seattle and Bainbridge Island, Washington. The route was called the SeattleÿWinslow ferry before the city of Winslow annexed the rest of the island and changed its name. Since 1951 the only ferries employed on the route have belonged to the Washington state ferry system, currently the largest ferry system in the United States.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThis ferry route is 8.6 miles long, with terminals at Colman Dock in Seattle and, on Bainbridge Island, at Winslow. Near the Winslow terminal is the main shipyard for the Washington State Ferry system.[1]\\r\\nBefore ferries were dominant on Puget Sound, the route was served by passenger and freight-carrying steamboats. The wooden steamship Florence K served the route for the Eagle Harbor Transportation Co., until 1915 when the company put the new steamer Bainbridge on the route, and shifted Florence K to the SeattleÿPort Washington route.[2]\\r\\nIn 1949, the Chippewa served on the route, except during summers, when Chippewa was transferred to the Anacortes-Sidney route.[3] From 1951 to 1968, the main ferry on the route was the Illahee which ran along with the Quinault (1951-1953), Evergreen State (1954-1959), and Tillikum (1959-1968), with the steam ferry San Mateo occasionally running as an extra boat.[1]\\r\\nIn 1968, with increasing demand exceeding vehicle capacity, Tillikum and Illahee were reassigned to the Edmonds-Kingston route, and replaced by the Super Class boats Kaleetan and Elwha, both with capacities of 2,500 passengers and 160 (originally) automobiles.[1] In 1972-1973 the Super Class vessels were displaced by the Jumbo class Spokane and Walla Walla, which remained in Bainbridge Island service until they were displaced in turn by the Jumbo Mark II Class vessels Tacoma and Wenatchee in 1997-1998.\\r\\nAssigned to the route as of September 2017 were the Jumbo Mark II class ferries Tacoma and Wenatchee,[4] each with a capacity of 2,500 passengers and a maximum of 202 vehicles.[5]","input":"How long is the ferry from bainbridge to seattle?"},{"output":"D major (B minor)","context":"In musical notation, a key signature is a set of sharp (?), flat (?), and rarely, natural (?) symbols placed together on the staff. Key signatures are generally written immediately after the clef at the beginning of a line of musical notation, although they can appear in other parts of a score, notably after a double barline.\\r\\nA key signature designates notes that are to be played higher or lower than the corresponding natural notes and applies through to the end of the piece or up to the next key signature. A sharp symbol on a line or space in the key signature raises the notes on that line or space one semitone above the natural, and a flat lowers such notes one semitone. Further, a symbol in the key signature affects all the notes of one letter: for instance, a sharp on the top line of the treble staff applies to Fs not only on that line, but also to Fs in the bottom space of the staff, and to any other Fs. This convention was not universal until the late Baroque and early Classical period, however; music published in the 1720s and 1730s, for example, uses key signatures showing sharps or flats on both octaves for notes which fall within the staff.[citation needed]\\r\\nAn accidental is an exception to the key signature, applying only in the measure in which it appears.\\r\\nAlthough a key signature may be written using any combination of sharp and flat symbols, a series of thirteen homogeneous key signatures, ranging from between six flats to six sharps and each flat or sharp being on notes separated by a perfect fifth from each other, are by far the most commonly used; their use is assumed in much of this article. A piece scored using a single diatonic key signature and no accidentals contains notes of at most seven of the twelve pitch classes, which seven being determined by the particular key signature.\\r\\nEach major and minor key has an associated key signature that sharpens or flattens the notes which are used in its scale. However, it is not uncommon for a piece to be written with a key signature that does not match its key, for example, in some Baroque pieces,[1] or in transcriptions of traditional modal folk tunes.[2]\\r\\nLater on, this use of a key signature that is theoretically incorrect for a piece as a whole or a self-contained section of a piece became less common (in contrast to brief passages within a piece, which, as they modulate from key to key often temporarily disagree with the key signature); but it can be found at least as late as one of Beethoven's very late piano sonatas. For example, in his Sonata No. 31 in A? major, Op. 110, the first appearance of the Arioso section in the final movement is notated throughout in six flats; but it both begins and ends in A? minor and has a significant modulation to C? major, and both these keys theoretically require seven flats in their key signature. (The second appearance later in the movement of this same section, a semitone lower, in G minor, uses the correct key signature of two flats.)\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn principle, any piece can be written with any key signature, using accidentals to correct the pattern of whole and half steps. The purpose of the key signature is to minimize the number of such accidentals required to notate the music. The sequence of sharps or flats in key signatures is generally rigid in modern music notation. This allows musicians to identify the key simply by the number of sharps or flats (which is the same in any clef), rather than their position on the staff. For example, if a key signature has only one sharp, it must be an F-sharp,[3] which corresponds to a G major or an E minor key.\\r\\nHowever, in 20th-century music, there are occasional exceptions to this, where a piece uses an unorthodox or synthetic scale, where a key signature may be invented to reflect this. This may consist of a number of sharps or flats that are not the normal ones (such as a signature of just C? or E?), or it may consist of one or more sharps combined with one or more flats (such as a signature containing both F? and B?). Key signatures of this kind can be found in the music of Bla Bart܇k, for example.\\r\\nThe effect of a key signature continues throughout a piece or movement, unless explicitly cancelled by another key signature. For example, if a five-sharp key signature is placed at the beginning of a piece, every A in the piece in any octave will be played as A sharp, unless preceded by an accidental (for instance, the A in scale 2 illustrated ÿ the next-to-last note ÿ is played as an A? even though the A? in the key signature (the last sharp sign) is written an octave lower).[3]\\r\\nIn a score containing more than one instrument, all the instruments are usually written with the same key signature. Exceptions include:\\r\\nThe convention for the notation of key signatures follows the circle of fifths. Starting from C major (or equivalently A minor) which has no sharps or flats, successively raising the key by a fifth adds a sharp, going clockwise round the circle of fifths. The new sharp is placed on the new key's leading note (seventh degree) for major keys or supertonic (second degree) for minor keys. Thus G major (E minor) has one sharp which is on the F; then D major (B minor) has two sharps on F and C and so on.\\r\\nSimilarly successively lowering the key by a fifth adds a flat, going counterclockwise around the circle of fifths. The new flat is placed on the subdominant (fourth degree) for major keys or submediant (sixth degree) for minor keys. Thus F major (D minor) has one flat which is on the B; then B? major (G minor) has two flats (on B and E) and so on.\\r\\nPut another way: for key signatures with sharps, the first sharp is placed on F with subsequent sharps on C, G, D, A, E and B; for key signatures with flats, the first flat is placed on B with subsequent flats on E, A, D, G, C and F. There are thus 15 conventional key signatures, with up to seven sharps or flats and including the empty signature of C major (A minor).\\r\\nCorollaries:\\r\\nThe relative minor is a minor third down from the major, regardless of whether it is a flat or a sharp key signature.\\r\\nThe key signatures with seven flats (?) and seven sharps (?) are rarely used because they have simpler enharmonic equivalents. For example, the key of C? major (seven sharps) is more simply represented as D? major (five flats). For modern practical purposes these keys are (in twelve tone equal temperament) the same, because C? and D? are enharmonically the same note. Pieces are written in these extreme sharp or flat keys, however: for example, Bach's Prelude and Fugue No. 3 from Book 1 of The Well-Tempered Clavier BWV 848 is in C? major. The modern musical Seussical by Flaherty and Ahrens also has several songs written in these extreme keys.\\r\\nKey signatures can be further extended through double sharps and double flats (for example, a piece in the key of G? major can be expressed with a double sharp on F and six sharps on the other six pitches). As with the seven-sharp and seven-flat examples, it is rarely necessary to express music in such keys when simpler enharmonic examples can instead be used (in the case of G?, the same passage could be expressed in A? with only four flats).\\r\\nThe key signature may be changed at any time in a piece, usually at the beginning of a measure, simply by notating the new signature, although if the new signature has no sharps or flats, a signature of naturals, as shown, is needed to cancel the preceding signature. If a change in signature occurs at the start of a new line on the page, where a signature would normally appear anyway, the new signature is customarily repeated at the end of the previous line to make the change more conspicuous.\\r\\nIn traditional use, when the key signature change goes from sharps to flats or vice versa, the old key signature is cancelled with the appropriate number of naturals before the new one is inserted; but many more recent publications (whether of newer music or newer editions of older music) dispense with the naturals and simply insert the new signature.\\r\\nSimilarly, when a signature with either flats or sharps in it changes to a smaller signature of the same type, strict application of tradition or convention would require that naturals first be used to cancel just those flats or sharps that are being subtracted in the new signature before the new signature itself is written; but, again, more modern usage often dispenses with these naturals.\\r\\nWhen the signature changes from a smaller to a larger signature of the same type, the new signature is simply written in by itself, in both traditional and newer styles.\\r\\nAt one time it was usual to precede the new signature with a double barline (provided the change occurred between bars and not inside a bar), even if it was not required by the structure of the music to mark sections within the movement; but more recently it has increasingly become usual to use just a single barline. The courtesy signature that appears at the end of a line immediately before a change is usually preceded by an additional barline; the line at the very end of the staff is omitted in this case.\\r\\nIf both naturals and a new key signature appear at a key signature change, there are also more recently variations about where a barline will be placed (in the case where the change occurs between bars). For example, in some scores by Debussy, in this situation the barline is placed after the naturals but before the new key signature. Hitherto, it would have been more usual to place all the symbols after the barline.\\r\\nIn key signatures of five or more sharps or of seven flats, one occasionally encounters variant positions of particular symbols in the key signatures, both of them in the bass clef.\\r\\nThe A? which is the fifth sharp in the sharp signatures may occasionally be notated on the top line of the bass staff, whereas it is more usually found in the lowest space on that staff. An example of this can be seen in the full score of Ottorino Respighi's Pines of Rome, in the third section, \\"Pines of the Janiculum\\" (which is in B major), in the bass-clef instrumental parts.\\r\\nIn the case of seven-flat key signatures, the final F? may occasionally be seen on the second-top line of the bass staff, whereas it would more usually appear below the bottom line. An example of this can be seen in Isaac Albniz's Iberia: first movement, \\"Evocaci܇n\\", which is in A? minor.\\r\\nExcept for C major, key signatures appear in two varieties, \\"sharp key signatures\\" (\\"sharp keys\\") and \\"flat key signatures\\" (\\"flat keys\\"), so called because they contain only one or other.[4]\\r\\nSharp key signatures consist of a number of sharps between one and seven, applied in this order: F C G D A E B.[5][6] A mnemonic device often used to remember this is \\"Father Charles Goes Down And Ends Battle.\\"[4][not in citation given]Schonbrun indeed offers this mnemonic, but makes no claim whatever about frequency of use, or indeed whether it had ever been used before Schonbrun concocted it for his book.--> The key note or tonic of a piece in a major key is immediately above the last sharp in the signature.[7] For example, one sharp (F?) in the key signature of a piece in a major key indicates the key of G major, the next note above F?. (Six sharps, the last one being E? (an enharmonic spelling of F?) indicate the key of F? major, since F has already been sharped in the key signature.)\\r\\nThis table shows that each scale starting on the fifth scale degree of the previous scale has one new sharp, added in the order given above.[6]\\r\\n\\"Flat key signatures\\" consist of one to seven flats, applied as: B E A D G C F[5][6] The mnemonic device is then reversed for use in the flat keys: \\"Battle Ends And Down Goes Charles' Father\\".[4] The major scale with one flat is F major. In all other \\"flat major scales\\", the tonic or key note of a piece in a major key is four notes below the last flat, which is the same as the second-to-last flat in the signature.[7] In the major key with four flats (B? E? A? D?), for example, the penultimate flat is A?, indicating a key of A? major.\\r\\nIn this case each new scale starts a fifth below (or a fourth above) the previous one.\\r\\nA key signature is not the same as a key; key signatures are merely notational devices. They are convenient principally for diatonic or tonal music.\\r\\nThe key signature defines the diatonic scale that a piece of music uses without the need for accidentals. Most scales require that some notes be consistently sharped or flatted. For example, the only sharp in the G major scale is F sharp, so the key signature associated with the G major key is the one-sharp key signature. However, it is only a notational convenience; a piece with a one-sharp key signature is not necessarily in the key of G major, and likewise, a piece in G major may not always be written with a one-sharp key signature; this is particularly true in pre-Baroque music, when the concept of key had not yet evolved to its present state.\\r\\nIn any case, more extensive pieces often change key (modulate) during contrasting sections, and only sometimes is this change indicated with a change of key signature; if not, the passage in the second key will not have a matching key signature.\\r\\nThe Toccata and Fugue in D minor, BWV 538 by Bach has no key signature, leading it to be called the Dorian, but it is still in D minor; the B?s that occur in the piece are written with accidentals.\\r\\nKeys which are associated with the same key signature are called relative keys.\\r\\nWhen musical modes, such as Lydian or Dorian, are written using key signatures, they are called transposed modes.\\r\\nExceptions to common-practice-period use may be found in Klezmer scales, such as Freygish (Phrygian). In the 20th century, composers such as Bart܇k and Rzewski (see below) began experimenting with unusual key signatures that departed from the standard order.\\r\\nBecause of the limitations of the traditional highland bagpipe scale, key signatures are often omitted from written pipe music, which otherwise would be written with two sharps, the usual F? and C?.[8] (In this case the pipes are incapable of playing F? and C? so it is not necessary to specify the sharps.)\\r\\nThe above 15 key signatures only express diatonic scales and are therefore sometimes called standard key signatures. Other scales are written either with a standard key signature and use accidentals as required, or with a nonstandard key signature. Examples of the latter include the E? (right hand), and F? and G? (left hand) used for the E? diminished (E? octatonic) scale in Bart܇k's Crossed Hands (no. 99, vol. 4, Mikrokosmos), or the B?, E? and F? used for the D Phrygian dominant scale in Frederic Rzewski's God to a Hungry Child.\\r\\nThe absence of a key signature does not always mean that the music is in the key of C major / A minor as each accidental may be notated explicitly as required, or the piece may be modal or atonal. An example is Bart܇k's Piano Sonata, which has no fixed key and is highly chromatic.\\r\\nIf not bound by common practice conventions, microtones can also be notated in a key signature; which microtonal symbols are used depends on the system.\\r\\nThe common practice period conventions are so firmly established that some musical notation programs have been unable to show nonstandard key signatures until recently.[9]\\r\\nThe use of a one-flat signature developed in the Medieval period, but signatures with more than one flat did not appear until the 16th century, and signatures with sharps not until the mid-17th century.[10]\\r\\nWhen signatures with multiple flats first came in, the order of the flats was not standardized, and often a flat appeared in two different octaves, as shown at right. In the late 15th and early 16th centuries, it was common for different voice parts in the same composition to have different signatures, a situation called a partial signature or conflicting signature. This was actually more common than complete signatures in the 15th century.[11] The 16th-century motet Absolon fili mi attributed to Josquin des Prez features two voice parts with two flats, one part with three flats, and one part with four flats.\\r\\nBaroque music written in minor keys often was written with a key signature with fewer flats than we now associate with their keys; for example, movements in C minor often had only two flats (because the A? would frequently have to be sharpened to A? in the ascending melodic minor scale, as would the B?).","input":"What key is f sharp and c sharp?"},{"output":"King's Cross St. Pancras","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe London Underground is a metro system in the United Kingdom that serves Greater London and the neighbouring counties of Essex, Hertfordshire and Buckinghamshire.

The resort consists of a casino, a convention centre with meeting rooms, theatre and two ballrooms along with 32 restaurants and bars, a nightclub and recreational facilities. It also features three hotels: the 405-room Crown Metropol Perth [3], the 291-room Crown Promenade Perth [4] and the 500-room luxury hotel Crown Towers Perth, which was opened in December 2016.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1984, the Western Australian Government proposed at the suggestion of Perth businessman Dallas Dempster[5] that a casino complex be constructed at Burswood Island on the Swan River, 3 kilometres (2?mi) east of the Perth city centre.[6] This was the site of a large landfill facility,[5] which posed difficulties in the proposal, design and construction phases due to the risk of subsidence resulting from decomposition and also the risk of release of effluent into the adjacent river as a result of pile driving for the construction.[7] The winning bidder to build the complex was Tileska Pty Ltd, a joint venture between Dallas Dempster and Genting Berhad, a Malaysian casino operator.[6] At the time, there were allegations by rival bidders of misconduct against Dempster and Western Australian Premier Brian Burke,[8] but, after a thorough investigation of these accusations, the WA Inc Royal Commission found no impropriety in that regard.[9] This consortium planned a two-stage construction. The first stage was initially expected to cost A$200m, and involved futuristic-looking buildings[10] comprising a 135-table casino, 400-room hotel, 18-hole golf course, convention and exhibition centre, tennis courts, amphitheatre and other amenities, together with a beautification of the Burswood Island area.[6] The second stage of the plan involved the A$100m construction of another hotel on the site, but no time schedule was ever set for this[6] and the second hotel was not constructed until two decades later. The Tileska joint venture took up 60% of the capital in the Burswood Property Trust, which was to own the complex.[6] Genting would run the resort, having experience operating casinos in Malaysia's Genting Highlands.[11]\\r\\nConstruction of the resort was approved by the Western Australian Parliament in March 1985 in the Casino (Burswood Island) Agreement Act 1985.[7] It was hoped that the hotel-casino complex would be ready in time for the 1987 America's Cup race, to be hosted by Perth[6] and construction was to be to a tight schedule in order to achieve that deadline.[7] The Burswood Property Trust was listed on Australian stock exchanges on 30 May 1985.[12] When it opened on 30 December 1985, Burswood Island Casino (as it was then known) was the largest in Australia,[12] and third-largest in the world.[13] It was expected to receive two to three million visitors per year and have an annual gross profit of A$100m.[14] The public interest in the casino proved so much in its early months of operation that it posted a gross profit of A$1 million per day for its first two months, far outstripping expectations.[15] In its early weeks of opening, people were reportedly forced to queue at the entrance for hours as the gaming floor was at its full legal capacity.[15]\\r\\nThe Burswood Island Casino was opened several months ahead of schedule,[15] and the other parts of Stage 1 (including the hotel, conference centre, theatre and indoor stadium) remained under construction throughout 1986 and much of 1987. By January 1987, the complex recorded its three millionth visitor.[16] Not sharing in this financial success, the Burswood Property Trust encountered financial difficulties and sold the hotel operations in the under-construction Burswood Island Hotel to Japanese investor Brisney Pty Ltd,[17] a joint venture between investment company Yunan Development Co Ltd and hotel operator Kanematsu Trading Co Ltd.[18][19] On 28 August 1987, the Burswood Dome indoor sports stadium was opened to the public, and was noted as being by far the largest auditorium in the southern hemisphere.[20]\\r\\nThe hotel's opening was delayed by 85 days, largely as a result of inclement weather and industrial disputes.[17] This delay meant that the hotel and conference centre was not available during the early stages of the America's Cup race, necessitating refunds to overseas visitors.[19] Although the 417-room Burswood Island Hotel opened its doors to the public on 4 October 1987,[21] the hotel's management reportedly allowed one of the casino's highest rollers to stay there a day early, during which time he won A$1.4 million,[21] which was believed at the time to be the highest amount ever won by an individual in an Australian casino.[21]\\r\\nThe Burswood Convention Centre was opened on 20 November 1987, and on 8 April 1988, the entire Burswood Island complex had its official opening.\\r\\nThe casino was expanded in 1990, and an improved International Room (for high-rolling punters) was unveiled in 1995. 1998 saw the corporatisation of the Burswood Property Trust, and also saw the complete renovation of the Burswood Theatre. In 1999, the management of Burswood undertook an extensive refurbishment program of the hotel rooms.\\r\\nIn 1996, pop superstar Michael Jackson performed three sold-out shows at Burswood Dome, on 30 November, 2 and 4 December, as part of his HIStory World Tour in front of 60,000 attendees.\\r\\nIn 2000, a $96 million resort renovation and improvement program was undertaken. 2001 and 2002 saw the opening of the Ruby Room nightclub and Champion's Bar, both within the casino, and also the opening of the Grand Ballroom. In 2003, Burswood entered into a deal with land developer Mirvac Fini for the residential development of vacant land between the complex and the Graham Farmer Freeway. Picking up from the long-neglected Stage 2 of the Burswood development plan, in the early 2000s the management of Burswood made various plans to build a second hotel on the site. Eventually, in 2003 they entered into a joint venture deal with the InterContinental Hotels Group to run the existing Burswood Resort Hotel (to be re-branded as Burswood InterContinental Hotel) and a new, 291-room Holiday Inn hotel to be constructed adjacent to the Burswood Theatre.[22] In 2004, Publishing and Broadcasting Limited, whose principal shareholder was Kerry Packer, acquired full control of the Burswood International Resort Casino, and in 2005 re-branded the site as \\"Burswood Entertainment Complex\\". On 1 August 2005, the Holiday Inn Burswood opened for business after 29 months of construction.[23] Construction finished three months early and was A$2 million under budget.[23] The promoters proclaimed that it was \\"Perth's first purpose-built hotel in more than 12 years\\".[23]\\r\\nIn 2006, Burswood closed its renowned fine-dining Windows Restaurant in order to make way for a newer, expanded VIP room for high rollers. This new facility, called The Pearl Room, opened in late 2006 featuring 180 degree Swan River views. It replaced the old International Room which closed its doors following the unveiling of The Pearl Room. In 2007 Publishing and Broadcasting Limited vested its gaming interests, which included Burswood, into Crown Limited, a company controlled by James Packer, the son and heir of Kerry Packer, who died in December 2005. Also in 2007 Burswood opened The Riviera Room - a new gaming room featuring higher stakes open to the general public. The Riviera Room is located at the site of the old International Room, and has been refurbished to feature a contemporary design. MINQ, an exclusive late night bar, accessible only by a hosted lift at the entrance of The Riviera Room, opened in August 2007. Carbon Sports Bar opened in December 2007 and features a giant 12.5 x 4m wide screen and 16 x 52-inch plasmas. In December 2008, Burswood opened its new world-class dedicated poker room featuring plasma screens, dedicated bar and lounge area. In November 2009, Britney Spears performed 2 shows at the arena for her highly anticipated The Circus Starring Britney Spears tour. The shows at Burswood were Spears' first concerts in Australia. She was originally supposed to perform 5 shows in Australia during her 2004 Onyx Hotel Tour (including one at the Burswood Dome), but the shows were canceled after Spears injured her knee while filming her video \\"Outrageous\\". In April 2010 the world-renowned musical \\"Cats\\" performed the first of many shows over a 3-week period at Burswood Theatre.\\r\\nOn 14 December 2011, James Packer as the Executive Chairman of Crown Limited announced the re-branding of Burswood Entertainment Complex as Crown Perth.[24] In March 2012 it was confirmed that the hotels on site would also be re-branded in line with sister complex Crown Melbourne upon completion of a $750 million refurbishment. InterContinental Burswood became Crown Metropol Perth from 27 June 2012, while the Holiday Inn Perth Burswood was officially rebranded Crown Promenade on 20 June 2012.[25]\\r\\nOn 1 August 2012 it was revealed a new 500 room 'six star' hotel would be built at Burswood at a cost of $568 million. The hotel, Crown Towers, opened in December 2016 and is Perth's largest, taking the casino's hotel capacity to 1,200 rooms. Colin Barnett, the then-premier of Western Australia also made the announcement saying his government was also backing a bid by Crown to increase its number of poker machines by 500, and the number of gaming tables by 130.[26]\\r\\nThe casino operates 24 hours, 7 days a week. As of 2012[update] it is the monopoly casino operator in Perth, Western Australia. There are up to 2,400 coin-operated game machines with a variety of games such as Keno, Video Poker and others involving dice, dominoes and balls. Jackpots are linked to many of these games. Reel-slots, operated with a pull-down lever, are not permitted in Western Australia.\\r\\nThe table games include Baccarat, Mini Baccarat, Blackjack, Roulette, Poker (Texas Hold'Em, Omaha), Three Card Poker, Casino War, Progressive Texas Hold'Em, Pai Gow, Money Wheel, Sic Bo and Caribbean Stud.\\r\\nOn 1 August 2012, Crown Limited announced it was seeking a \\"massive\\" expansion of gambling facilities, increasing the number of poker machines to 2,500 and gaming tables will increase from the present number of 220 to 350, an increase of nearly 60%. The Government of Western Australia is backing Crown's application to the state's Gaming and Wagering Commission, and the proposal has the personal support of WA premier Colin Barnett, who described the increase in gambling facilities \\"as natural growth,\\" and said it was \\"common sense\\" for the expansion as it was being made in line with the development of a new six-star hotel in the casino complex.[27]\\r\\nCrown has entered into an agreement with the state government to build the hotel on land the government will provide for $60 million. The government's agreement not to object to the increase in gambling facilities is part of the deal. Crown Perth is the only venue in Australia's biggest state that is allowed to operate poker machines. In all other Australian states and territories almost every hotel is equipped with poker machines, while licensed clubs packed with poker machines are widespread.[28]\\r\\nThe proposal to upscale gambling facilities is controversial. Independent senator Nick Xenophon said \\"James Packer knows he has just been handed the gift that will give him hundreds of millions of dollars for years to come.\\" Ian Carter, chief executive of Anglicare WA, told ABC Radio \\"The Productivity Commission report and a whole range of other reports around this country have clearly highlighted the cost to our community of gaming machines and poker machines.\\"[29]\\r\\nThe parklands surrounding the casino is known as Burswood Park. Originally a rubbish tip from the mid-1940s, the construction of the casino complex also saw the parklands regenerated into a public recreational facility. The park contains wildflower displays, a heritage trail with various statues. It also initially featured a public golf course that was closed for redevelopment in 2013,[30] with The Camfield, a large pub and micro brewery built adjacent to Perth Stadium now occupying the site.[31]\\r\\nThe Olympians\\r\\nWillem de Vlamingh\\r\\nPaddy Hannan\\r\\nHenry Camfield\\r\\nThe Dome at Crown Perth (originally the Burswood Superdome and formerly the Burswood Dome ) was a multipurpose indoor arena used for sports and entertainment. The dome was 8,800 square metres in size, with seating for 13,600 people. The whole arena was pressurised so that the fibreglass roof was suspended 35?m above the ground.[32] It was a venue for indoor sports, notably the Hopman Cup tennis tournament, which was moved to the Perth Arena for the 2013 and future events, and for pop music concerts. Many notable artists performed there, the record attendance being 20,000 for Cliff Richard & The Shadows.[32] Other performers since 1987 have included AC/DC, Kiss, Mick Jagger, Michael Jackson, Mariah Carey, Pink, Lady Gaga, Kylie Minogue, Elton John, Iron Maiden, Britney Spears, Beyonc, The Black Eyed Peas, Guns N' Roses, Florence and the Machine, George Michael, Christina Aguilera, Delta Goodrem, Gwen Stefani, Justin Bieber, Taylor Swift, Rihanna, Roger Waters and Top Gear Live.[33] It was the hosting venue for the Hopman Cup from 1989 until 2012.\\r\\nAs a sports venue, the Dome was the home of the Hopman Cup and in 2004 played host to a single National Basketball League game between the Perth Wildcats and Melbourne Tigers which drew 8,501 fans. At one time the dome was also considered as a possible home venue for the A-League's Perth Glory while renovations were taking place at their usual home, Perth Oval, though the Glory eventually decided to stay at the Oval rather than play inside the Dome on an artificial surface. The Dome was also the venue used for World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) shows in Perth while on their Australian tours.\\r\\nAs of October 2012[update], firm plans for Crown's major new hotel development and for a state-controlled Perth Stadium on nearby land have ensured that the dome will be removed, probably to provide an additional 2.2 hectares of car parking.[30] Government approval for demolition was granted on 31 May 2012, and demolition works started in July 2013 with the land to be used for 1000 car parking bays.[34][35] The roof was deflated on 28 June 2013.[36]\\r\\nThe Star (Sydney)\\r\\nCrown (Sydney)\\r\\nCrown (Melbourne)\\r\\nThe Star (Gold Coast)\\r\\nThe Treasury (Brisbane)\\r\\nThe Reef (Cairns)\\r\\nThe Ville (Townsville)\\r\\nAdelaide Casino (Adelaide)\\r\\nCrown (Perth)\\r\\nWrest Point (Hobart)\\r\\nCountry Club (Launceston)\\r\\nSkycity (Darwin)\\r\\nLasseters (Alice Springs)\\r\\nCasino Canberra (Canberra)\\r\\nChristmas Island Resort","input":"How many rooms does the luxury crown metropol perth have?"},{"output":"Thomas Helwys","context":"Baptists are those Christians belonging to local churches mainly distinguished by baptising professing believers only. A Baptist church generally consists of a gathered group of believers that subscribe to a doctrine that baptism should be performed only for professing believers (believer's baptism, as opposed to infant baptism), and that it should be done by complete immersion (as opposed to affusion or sprinkling). Other tenets of Baptist churches include soul competency (liberty), salvation through faith alone, Scripture alone as the rule of faith and practice, and the autonomy of the local congregation. Baptists recognize two ministerial offices, pastors and deacons, and two ordinances, baptism and the Lord's supper (also called, communion). Baptist churches are widely considered to be Protestant churches, though some Baptists disavow this identity.[1]\\r\\nDiverse from their beginning, those identifying as Baptists today differ widely from one another in what they believe, how they worship, their attitudes toward other Christians, and their understanding of what is important in Christian discipleship.[2]\\r\\nHistorians trace the earliest church labeled \\"Baptist\\" back to 1609 in Amsterdam, Dutch Republic with English Separatist John Smyth as its pastor.[3] In accordance with his reading of the New Testament, he rejected baptism of infants and instituted baptism only of believing adults.[4] Baptist practice spread to England, where the General Baptists considered Christ's atonement to extend to all people, while the Particular Baptists believed that it extended only to the elect.[5] Thomas Helwys formulated a distinctively Baptist request that the church and the state be kept separate in matters of law, so that individuals might have freedom of religion. Helwys died in prison as a consequence of the religious persecution of English dissenters under King James I. In 1638, Roger Williams established the first Baptist congregation in the North American colonies. In the mid-18th century, the First Great Awakening contributed to Baptist growth in both New England and the South.[6] The Second Great Awakening in the South in the early 19th century greatly increased church membership. Baptist missionaries have spread their faith to every continent.[4]\\r\\nThe largest Baptist denomination is the Southern Baptist Convention, with the membership of associated churches totaling more than 15?million.[6] Many other Baptists cooperate through the Baptist World Alliance.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBaptist historian Bruce Gourley outlines four main views of Baptist origins: (1)?The modern scholarly consensus that the movement traces its origin to the 17th century via the English Separatists, (2)?the view that it was an outgrowth of Anabaptist traditions, (3)?the perpetuity view which assumes that the Baptist faith and practice has existed since the time of Christ, and (4)?the successionist view, or \\"Baptist successionism\\", which argues that Baptist churches actually existed in an unbroken chain since the time of Christ.[3]\\r\\nModern Baptist churches trace their history to the English Separatist movement in the 1600s, the century after the rise of the original Protestant denominations.[7] This view of Baptist origins has the most historical support and is the most widely accepted.[8] Adherents to this position consider the influence of Anabaptists upon early Baptists to be minimal.[3] It was a time of considerable political and religious turmoil. Both individuals and churches were willing to give up their theological roots if they became convinced that a more biblical \\"truth\\" had been discovered.[9][page?needed][10]\\r\\nDuring the Protestant Reformation, the Church of England (Anglicans) separated from the Roman Catholic Church. There were some Christians who were not content with the achievements of the mainstream Protestant Reformation.[2][11] There also were Christians who were disappointed that the Church of England had not made corrections of what some considered to be errors and abuses. Of those most critical of the Church's direction, some chose to stay and try to make constructive changes from within the Anglican Church. They became known as \\"Puritans\\" and are described by Gourley as cousins of the English Separatists. Others decided they must leave the Church because of their dissatisfaction and became known as the Separatists.[3]\\r\\nHistorians trace the earliest Baptist church back to 1609 in Amsterdam, with John Smyth as its pastor.[3] Three years earlier, while a Fellow of Christ's College, Cambridge, he had broken his ties with the Church of England. Reared in the Church of England, he became \\"Puritan, English Separatist, and then a Baptist Separatist,\\" and ended his days working with the Mennonites.[12] He began meeting in England with 60ÿ70 English Separatists, in the face of \\"great danger.\\"[13] The persecution of religious nonconformists in England led Smyth to go into exile in Amsterdam with fellow Separatists from the congregation he had gathered in Lincolnshire, separate from the established church (Anglican). Smyth and his lay supporter, Thomas Helwys, together with those they led, broke with the other English exiles because Smyth and Helwys were convinced they should be baptized as believers. In 1609 Smyth first baptized himself and then baptized the others.[11][14]\\r\\nIn 1609, while still there, Smyth wrote a tract titled \\"The Character of the Beast,\\" or \\"The False Constitution of the Church.\\" In it he expressed two propositions: first, infants are not to be baptized; and second, \\"Antichristians converted are to be admitted into the true Church by baptism.\\"[15] Hence, his conviction was that a scriptural church should consist only of regenerate believers who have been baptized on a personal confession of faith. He rejected the Separatist movement's doctrine of infant baptism (paedobaptism).[16][17] Shortly thereafter, Smyth left the group, and layman Thomas Helwys took over the leadership, leading the church back to England in 1611.[3] Ultimately, Smyth became committed to believers' baptism as the only biblical baptism. He was convinced on the basis of his interpretation of Scripture that infants would not be damned should they die in infancy.[18]\\r\\nSmyth, convinced that his self-baptism was invalid, applied with the Mennonites for membership. He died while waiting for membership, and some of his followers became Mennonites. Thomas Helwys and others kept their baptism and their Baptist commitments.[18] The modern Baptist denomination is an outgrowth of Smyth's movement.[11] Baptists rejected the name Anabaptist when they were called that by opponents in derision. McBeth writes that as late as the 18th century, many Baptists referred to themselves as \\"the Christians commonlythough falselycalled Anabaptists.\\"[19]\\r\\nAnother milestone in the early development of Baptist doctrine was in 1638 with John Spilsbury, a Calvinistic minister who helped to promote the strict practice of believer's baptism by immersion.[8] According to Tom Nettles, professor of historical theology at Southern Baptist Theological Seminary, \\"Spilsbury's cogent arguments for a gathered, disciplined congregation of believers baptized by immersion as constituting the New Testament church gave expression to and built on insights that had emerged within separatism, advanced in the life of John Smyth and the suffering congregation of Thomas Helwys, and matured in Particular Baptists.\\"[8]\\r\\nA minority view is that early 17th century Baptists were influenced by (but not directly connected to) continental Anabaptists.[20] According to this view, the General Baptists shared similarities with Dutch Waterlander Mennonites (one of many Anabaptist groups) including believer's baptism only, religious liberty, separation of church and state, and Arminian views of salvation, predestination and original sin. Representative writers including A.C. Underwood and William R. Estep. Gourley wrote that among some contemporary Baptist scholars who emphasize the faith of the community over soul liberty, the Anabaptist influence theory is making a comeback.[3]\\r\\nHowever, the relations between Baptists and Anabaptists were early strained. In 1624, the then five existing Baptist churches of London issued a condemnation of the Anabaptists. Furthermore, the original group associated with Smyth and popularly believed to be the first Baptists broke with the Waterlander Mennonite Anabaptists after a brief period of association in the Netherlands.[21]\\r\\nPrior to the 20th century, some Baptist historians wrote from the perspective that Baptists had existed since the time of Christ.[22] However, the Southern Baptist Convention passed resolutions rejecting this view in 1859. Proponents of the Baptist successionist or perpetuity view consider the Baptist movement to have existed independently from Roman Catholicism and prior to the Protestant Reformation.[23]\\r\\nThe perpetuity view is often identified with The Trail of Blood, a booklet of five lectures by J.M. Carrol published in 1931.[23] Other Baptist writers who advocate the successionist theory of Baptist origins are John T. Christian, Thomas Crosby, G. H. Orchard, J. M. Cramp, William Cathcart, Adam Taylor and D. B. Ray[23][24] This view was also held by English Baptist preacher, Charles Spurgeon[25] as well as Jesse Mercer, the namesake of Mercer University.[26][original research?]\\r\\nIn 1612, Thomas Helwys established a Baptist congregation in London, consisting of congregants from Smyth's church. A number of other Baptist churches sprang up, and they became known as the General Baptists. The Particular Baptists were established when a group of Calvinist Separatists adopted believers' Baptism.[27][page?needed] The Particular Baptists consisted of seven churches by 1644 and had created a confession of faith called the First London Confession of Faith.[28]\\r\\nBoth Roger Williams and John Clarke, his compatriot and coworker for religious freedom, are variously credited as founding the earliest Baptist church in North America.[29] In 1639, Williams established a Baptist church in Providence, Rhode Island, and Clarke began a Baptist church in Newport, Rhode Island. According to a Baptist historian who has researched the matter extensively, \\"There is much debate over the centuries as to whether the Providence or Newport church deserved the place of 'first' Baptist congregation in America. Exact records for both congregations are lacking.\\"[7][30]\\r\\nThe Great Awakening energized the Baptist movement, and the Baptist community experienced spectacular growth. Baptists became the largest Christian community in many southern states, including among the black population.[4]\\r\\nBaptist missionary work in Canada began in the British colony of Nova Scotia (present day Nova Scotia and New Brunswick) in the 1760s.[31] The first official record of a Baptist church in Canada was that of the Horton Baptist Church (now Wolfville) in Wolfville, Nova Scotia on 29 October 1778.[32] The church was established with the assistance of the New Light evangelist Henry Alline. Many of Alline's followers, after his death, would convert and strengthen the Baptist presence in the Atlantic region.[33][page?needed][34][35] Two major groups of Baptists formed the basis of the churches in the Maritimes. These were referred to as Regular Baptist (Calvinistic in their doctrine) and Free Will Baptists.[34]\\r\\nIn May 1845, the Baptist congregations in the United States split over slavery and missions. The Home Mission Society prevented slaveholders from being appointed as missionaries.[36] The split created the Southern Baptist Convention, while the northern congregations formed their own umbrella organization now called the American Baptist Churches USA (ABC-USA). The Methodist Episcopal Church, South had recently separated over the issue of slavery, and southern Presbyterians would do so shortly thereafter.[37]\\r\\nDenominational associations\\r\\nRegional associations\\r\\nAustralian Evangelical Alliance ??  site\\r\\nNational Council of Churches\\r\\nAnglican Church of Australia\\r\\nRoman Catholic Church\\r\\nChristian and Missionary Alliance\\r\\nChristian Outreach Centre\\r\\nChurch of the Nazarene\\r\\nSalvation Army\\r\\nSeventh-day Adventist Church\\r\\nAustralian Friends\\r\\nAustralian Baptist Ministries\\r\\nOpen Brethren\\r\\nChristian Reformed Churches of Australia\\r\\nChurches of Christ\\r\\nFellowship of Congregational Churches\\r\\nLutheran Church of Australia\\r\\nPresbyterian Church of Australia\\r\\nUniting Church in Australia\\r\\nWesleyan Methodist Church of Australia\\r\\nAntiochian Orthodox of Australia and New Z.\\r\\nGreek Orthodox Archdiocese of Australia\\r\\nSerbian Orthodox of Australia and New Z.\\r\\nCoptic Orthodox Church in Australia\\r\\nAustralian Christian Churches (AOG)\\r\\nChristian City Church Intl.\\r\\nCRC Churches International\\r\\nRevival Centres International\\r\\nVineyard Churches Australia\\r\\nWorldwide Church of God\\r\\nLDS Church\\r\\nCanadian Council of Churches\\r\\nS.

There also are a substantial number of smaller cooperative groups. Finally, there are Independent Baptist churches that choose to remain autonomous and independent of any denomination, organization, or association.[38] It has been suggested that a primary Baptist principle is that local Baptist Churches are independent and self-governing,[39] and if so the term 'Baptist denomination' may be considered somewhat incongruous.\\r\\nIn 1925, Baptists worldwide formed the Baptist World Alliance (BWA). The BWA now counts 218 Baptist conventions and unions worldwide with over 41?million members.[40] The BWA's goals include caring for the needy, leading in world evangelism and defending human rights and religious freedom. Though it played a role in the founding of the BWA, the Southern Baptist Convention severed its affiliation with BWA in 2004.[41]\\r\\nToday, more than 100 million Christians identify themselves as Baptist or belong to Baptist-type churches. There are 36?million Baptists who belong to churches cooperating with the Baptist World Alliance. Many Baptist groups, including the Southern Baptist Convention and the Baptist Bible Fellowship do not cooperate with the Alliance.[43]\\r\\nBaptists are present in almost all continents in big denominations. The largest number by baptized memberships are in Nigeria (3.5 million) and Democratic Republic of the Congo (2 million) in Africa, India (2.5 million) and Myanmar (1 million) in Asia, United States (35 million) and Brazil (1.8 million) in the North and South America.[44]\\r\\nAccording to the Barna Group researchers, Baptists are the largest denominational grouping of born again Christians in the USA.[45] A 2009 ABCNEWS/Beliefnet phone poll of 1,022 adults suggests that fifteen percent of Americans identify themselves as Baptists.[46]\\r\\nA large percentage of Baptists in North America are found in five bodiesthe Southern Baptist Convention (SBC); National Baptist Convention (NBC); National Baptist Convention of America, Inc.; (NBCA); American Baptist Churches USA (ABC); and Baptist Bible Fellowship International (BBFI).[47]\\r\\nMembership policies vary due to the autonomy of churches, but the traditional method by which an individual becomes a member of a church is through believer's baptism, which is a public profession of faith in Jesus, followed by water baptism.[48]\\r\\nMost baptists do not believe that baptism is a requirement for salvation, but rather a public expression of one's inner repentance and faith.[7] Therefore, some churches will admit into membership persons who make a profession without believer's baptism.[49]\\r\\nIn general, Baptist churches do not have a stated age restriction on membership, but believer's baptism requires that an individual be able to freely and earnestly profess their faith.[50] (See Age of Accountability)\\r\\n\\r\\nBaptists, like other Christians, are defined by school of thoughtsome of it common to all orthodox and evangelical groups and a portion of it distinctive to Baptists.[51] Through the years, different Baptist groups have issued confessions of faithwithout considering them to be creedsto express their particular doctrinal distinctions in comparison to other Christians as well as in comparison to other Baptists.[52] Most Baptists are evangelical in doctrine, but Baptist beliefs can vary due to the congregational governance system that gives autonomy to individual local Baptist churches.[1] Historically, Baptists have played a key role in encouraging religious freedom and separation of church and state.[53]\\r\\nShared doctrines would include beliefs about one God; the virgin birth; miracles; atonement for sins through the death, burial, and bodily resurrection of Jesus; the Trinity; the need for salvation (through belief in Jesus Christ as the son of God, his death and resurrection, and confession of Christ as Lord); grace; the Kingdom of God; last things (eschatology) (Jesus Christ will return personally and visibly in glory to the earth, the dead will be raised, and Christ will judge everyone in righteousness); and evangelism and missions. Some historically significant Baptist doctrinal documents include the 1689 London Baptist Confession of Faith, 1742 Philadelphia Baptist Confession, the 1833 New Hampshire Baptist Confession of Faith, the Southern Baptist Convention's Baptist Faith and Message, and written church covenants which some individual Baptist churches adopt as a statement of their faith and beliefs.\\r\\nMost Baptists hold that no church or ecclesiastical organization has inherent authority over a Baptist church. Churches can properly relate to each other under this polity only through voluntary cooperation, never by any sort of coercion. Furthermore, this Baptist polity calls for freedom from governmental control.[54]\\r\\nExceptions to this local form of local governance include a few churches that submit to the leadership of a body of elders, as well as the Episcopal Baptists that have an Episcopal system.\\r\\nBaptists generally believe in the literal Second Coming of Christ. Beliefs among Baptists regarding the \\"end times\\" include amillennialism, dispensationalism, and historic premillennialism, with views such as postmillennialism and preterism receiving some support.\\r\\nSome additional distinctive Baptist principles held by many Baptists:[55]:2\\r\\nSince there is no hierarchical authority and each Baptist church is autonomous, there is no official set of Baptist theological beliefs.[56] These differences exist both among associations, and even among churches within the associations.\\r\\nSome doctrinal issues on which there is widespread difference among Baptists are:\\r\\nBaptists have faced many controversies in their 400-year history, controversies of the level of crises. Baptist historian Walter Shurden says the word \\"crisis\\" comes from the Greek word meaning \\"to decide.\\" Shurden writes that contrary to the presumed negative view of crises, some controversies that reach a crisis level may actually be \\"positive and highly productive.\\" He claims that even schism, though never ideal, has often produced positive results. In his opinion crises among Baptists each have become decision-moments that shaped their future.[60] Some controversies that have shaped Baptists include the \\"missions crisis\\", the \\"slavery crisis\\", the \\"landmark crisis\\", and the \\"modernist crisis\\".\\r\\nEarly in the 19th century, the rise of the modern missions movement, and the backlash against it, led to widespread and bitter controversy among the American Baptists.[61] During this era, the American Baptists were split between missionary and anti-missionary. A substantial secession of Baptists went into the movement led by Alexander Campbell, to return to a more fundamental church.[62]\\r\\nLeading up to the American Civil War, Baptists became embroiled in the controversy over slavery in the United States. Whereas in the First Great Awakening, Methodist and Baptist preachers had opposed slavery and urged manumission, over the decades they made more of an accommodation with the institution. They worked with slaveholders in the South to urge a paternalistic institution. Both denominations made direct appeals to slaves and free blacks for conversion. The Baptists particularly allowed them active roles in congregations. By the mid-19th century, northern Baptists tended to oppose slavery. As tensions increased, in 1844 the Home Mission Society refused to appoint a slaveholder as a missionary who had been proposed by Georgia. It noted that missionaries could not take servants with them, and also that the board did not want to appear to condone slavery.Citation Needed\\r\\nThe Southern Baptist Convention was formed by nine state conventions in 1845. They believed that the Bible sanctions slavery and that it was acceptable for Christians to own slaves. They believed slavery was a human institution which Baptist teaching could make less harsh. By this time many planters were part of Baptist congregations, and some of the denomination's prominent preachers, such as the Rev. Basil Manly, Sr., president of the University of Alabama, were also planters who owned slaves.\\r\\nAs early as the late 18th century, black Baptists began to organize separate churches, associations and mission agencies. Blacks set up some independent Baptist congregations in the South before the American Civil War. White Baptist associations maintained some oversight of these and, after a slave rebellion, required a white man to be at church services.Citation Needed\\r\\nIn the postwar years, freedmen quickly left the white congregations and associations, setting up their own churches in order to be free of white supervision.[63] In 1866 the Consolidated American Baptist Convention, formed from black Baptists of the South and West, helped southern associations set up black state conventions, which they did in Alabama, Arkansas, Virginia, North Carolina, and Kentucky. In 1880 black state conventions united in the national Foreign Mission Convention, to support black Baptist missionary work. Two other national black conventions were formed, and in 1895 they united as the National Baptist Convention. This organization later went through its own changes, spinning off other conventions. It is the largest black religious organization and the second-largest Baptist organization in the world.[64] Baptists are numerically most dominant in the Southeast.[65] In 2007, the Pew Research Center's Religious Landscape Survey found that 45% of all African Americans identify with Baptist denominations, with the vast majority of those being within the historically black tradition.[66]\\r\\nA healthy Church kills error, and tears evil in pieces! Not so very long ago our nation tolerated slavery in our colonies. Philanthropists endeavored to destroy slavery, but when was it utterly abolished? It was when Wilberforce roused the Church of God, and when the Church of God addressed herself to the conflictthen she tore the evil thing to pieces! -- C.H. Spurgeon an outspoken British Baptist opponent of slavery in 'The Best War Cry' (1883)[67]\\r\\nElsewhere in the Americas, in the Caribbean in particular, Baptist missionaries and members took an active role in the anti-slavery movement. In Jamaica, for example, William Knibb, a prominent British Baptist missionary, worked toward the emancipation of slaves in the British West Indies (which took place in full in 1838). Knibb also supported the creation of \\"Free Villages\\" and sought funding from English Baptists to buy land for freedmen to cultivate; the Free Villages were envisioned as rural communities to be centred around a Baptist church where emancipated slaves could farm their own land. Thomas Burchell, missionary minister in Montego Bay, also was active in this movement, gaining funds from Baptists in England to buy land for what became known as Burchell Free Village.\\r\\nPrior to emancipation, Baptist deacon Samuel Sharpe, who served with Burchell, organized a general strike of slaves seeking better conditions. It developed into a major rebellion of as many as 60,000 slaves, which became known as the Christmas Rebellion (when it took place) or the Baptist War. It was put down by government troops within two weeks. During and after the rebellion, an estimated 200 slaves were killed outright, with more than 300 judicially executed later by prosecution in the courts, sometimes for minor offenses.\\r\\nBaptists were active after emancipation in promoting the education of former slaves; for example, Jamaica's Calabar High School, named after the port of Calabar in Nigeria, was founded by Baptist missionaries. At the same time, during and after slavery, slaves and free blacks formed their own Spiritual Baptist movements - breakaway spiritual movements which theology often expressed resistance to oppression.[68]\\r\\nIn the American South the interpretation of the American Civil War, abolition of slavery and postwar period has differed sharply by race since those years. Like other peoples, Americans have often interpreted great events in religious terms. Historian Wilson Fallin contrasts the interpretation of Civil War and Reconstruction in white versus black memory by analyzing Baptist sermons documented in Alabama. It should be noted that, soon after the Civil War, most black Baptists in the South left the Southern Baptist Convention, reducing its numbers by hundreds of thousands or more.Citation Needed They quickly organized their own congregations and developed their own regional and state associations and, by the end of the 19th century, a national convention.Citation Needed\\r\\nWhite preachers in Alabama after Reconstruction expressed the view that:\\r\\nGod had chastised them and given them a special mission ÿ to maintain orthodoxy, strict biblicism, personal piety, and \\"traditional\\" race relations. Slavery, they insisted, had not been sinful. Rather, emancipation was a historical tragedy and the end of Reconstruction was a clear sign of God's favor.\\r\\nBlack preachers interpreted the Civil War, Emancipation and Reconstruction as: \\"God's gift of freedom.\\" They had a gospel of liberation, having long identified with the Book of Exodus from slavery in the Old Testament. They took opportunities to exercise their independence, to worship in their own way, to affirm their worth and dignity, and to proclaim the fatherhood of God and the brotherhood of man. Most of all, they quickly formed their own churches, associations, and conventions to operate freely without white supervision. These institutions offered self-help and racial uplift, a place to develop and use leadership, and places for proclamation of the gospel of liberation. As a result, black preachers said that God would protect and help him and God's people; God would be their rock in a stormy land.[69]\\r\\nThe Southern Baptist Convention supported white supremacy and its results: disenfranchising most blacks and many poor whites at the turn of the 20th century by raising barriers to voter registration, and passage of racial segregation laws that enforced the system of Jim Crow.Citation Needed Its members largely resisted the Civil Rights Movement in the South, which sought to enforce their constitutional rights for public access and voting; and enforcement of midcentury federal civil rights laws.Citation Needed\\r\\nOn 20 June 1995, the Southern Baptist Convention voted to adopt a resolution renouncing its racist roots and apologizing for its past defense of slavery. More than 20,000 Southern Baptists registered for the meeting in Atlanta. The resolution declared that messengers, as SBC delegates are called, \\"unwaveringly denounce racism, in all its forms, as deplorable sin\\" and \\"lament and repudiate historic acts of evil such as slavery from which we continue to reap a bitter harvest.\\" It offered an apology to all African Americans for \\"condoning and/or perpetuating individual and systemic racism in our lifetime\\" and repentance for \\"racism of which we have been guilty, whether consciously or unconsciously.\\" Although Southern Baptists have condemned racism in the past, this was the first time the convention, predominantly white since the Reconstruction era, had specifically addressed the issue of slavery.\\r\\nThe statement sought forgiveness \\"from our African-American brothers and sisters\\" and pledged to \\"eradicate racism in all its forms from Southern Baptist life and ministry.\\" In 1995 about 500,000 members of the 15.6-million-member denomination were African Americans and another 300,000 were ethnic minorities. The resolution marked the denomination's first formal acknowledgment that racism played a role in its founding.[70]\\r\\nSouthern Baptist Landmarkism sought to reset the ecclesiastical separation which had characterized the old Baptist churches, in an era when inter-denominational union meetings were the order of the day.[71] James Robinson Graves was an influential Baptist of the 19th century and the primary leader of this movement.[72] While some Landmarkers eventually separated from the Southern Baptist Convention, the movement continued to influence the Convention into the 20th and 21st centuries.[73] For instance, in 2005, the Southern Baptist International Mission Board forbade its missionaries to receive alien immersions for baptism.[74]\\r\\nThe rise of theological modernism in the latter 19th and early 20th centuries also greatly affected Baptists.[75] The Landmark movement, already mentioned, has been described as a reaction among Southern Baptists in the United States against incipient modernism .[76] In England, Charles Haddon Spurgeon fought against modernistic views of the Scripture in the Downgrade Controversy and severed his church from the Baptist Union as a result.[77][78][79]\\r\\nThe Northern Baptist Convention in the United States had internal conflict over modernism in the early 20th century, ultimately embracing it.[80] Two new conservative associations of congregations that separated from the Convention were founded as a result: the General Association of Regular Baptist Churches in 1933 and the Conservative Baptist Association of America in 1947.[80]\\r\\nFollowing similar conflicts over modernism, the Southern Baptist Convention adhered to conservative theology as its official position.[81][82] In the late 20th century, moderate Southern Baptists who disagreed with this direction founded two new groups: the Alliance of Baptists in 1987 and the Cooperative Baptist Fellowship in 1991.[83][84][85][86] Members of both groups originally continued to identify as Southern Baptist, but over time the groups \\"became permanent new families of Baptists.\\"[83]","input":"Who is the leader of the baptist denomination?"},{"output":"Waylon Jennings","context":"The Dukes of Hazzard is an American action-comedy television series that aired on CBS from January 26, 1979, to February 8, 1985. The show aired for a total of 147 episodes spanning seven seasons. The series was inspired by the 1975 film Moonrunners, which was also created by Gy Waldron and had many identical or similar character names and concepts.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Dukes of Hazzard follows the adventures of \\"The Duke Boys,\\" cousins Bo Duke (John Schneider) and Luke Duke (Tom Wopat) (including Coy and Vance Duke for most of season 5), who live on a family farm in fictional Hazzard County, Georgia, with their attractive female cousin Daisy (Catherine Bach) and their wise old Uncle Jesse (Denver Pyle). The Duke boys race around in their customized 1969 Dodge Charger stock car, dubbed (The) General Lee, evading crooked and corrupt county commissioner Boss Hogg (Sorrell Booke) and his bumbling and corrupt Sheriff Rosco P. Coltrane (James Best) along with his deputy(s), and always managing to get caught in the middle of the various escapades and incidents that often occur in the area. Bo and Luke had previously been sentenced to probation for illegal transportation of moonshine; their Uncle Jesse made a plea bargain with the U.S. Government to refrain from distilling moonshine in exchange for Bo and Luke's freedom. As a result, Bo and Luke are on probation and not allowed to carry firearms? instead, they often use compound bows, sometimes with arrows tipped with dynamite  or to leave Hazzard County unless they get probation permission from their probation officer, Boss Hogg, although the exact details of their probation terms vary from episode to episode. Sometimes it is implied that they would be jailed for merely crossing the county line; on other occasions, it is shown that they may leave Hazzard, as long as they are back within a certain time limit. Several other technicalities of their probation also came into play at various times.\\r\\nCorrupt county commissioner Jefferson Davis (J.D.) \\"Boss\\" Hogg, who either runs or has fingers in virtually everything in Hazzard County, is forever angry with the Dukes, especially Bo and Luke, for always foiling his crooked schemes. He is always looking for ways to get them out of the picture so that his plots have a chance of succeeding. Many episodes revolve around Hogg trying to engage in an illegal scheme, sometimes with aid of hired criminal help. Some of these are get-rich-quick schemes, though many others affect the financial security of the Duke farm, which Hogg has long wanted to acquire for various reasons. Other times, Hogg hires criminals from out of town to do his dirty work for him, and often tries to frame Bo and Luke for various crimes as part of these plots. Bo and Luke always seem to stumble over Hogg's latest scheme, sometimes by curiosity, and often by sheer luck, and put it out of business. Despite the Dukes often coming to his rescue (see below), Hogg forever seems to have an irrational dislike of the clan, particularly Bo and Luke, often accusing them of spying on him, robbing or planning to rob him, and other supposedly nefarious actions, as he believes they are generally out to get him.\\r\\nThe other main characters of the show include local mechanic Cooter Davenport (Ben Jones), who in early episodes was portrayed as a wild, unshaven rebel, often breaking or treading on the edge of the law, before settling down to become the Duke family's best friend (he is often referred to as an \\"honorary Duke\\") and owns the local garage; and Enos Strate (Sonny Shroyer), an honest but naive young deputy who, despite his friendship with the Dukes (and his crush on Daisy), is reluctantly forced to take part in Hogg and Rosco's crooked schemes. In the third and fourth seasons, when Enos leaves for his own show, he is replaced by Deputy Cletus Hogg (Rick Hurst), Boss's cousin, who is slightly more wily than Enos but still a somewhat reluctant player in Hogg's plots.\\r\\nOwing to their fundamentally good natures, the Dukes often wind up helping Boss Hogg out of trouble, albeit grudgingly. More than once Hogg is targeted by former associates who are either seeking revenge or have double crossed him after a scheme has unraveled in one way or another. Sheriff Coltrane also finds himself targeted in some instances. On such occasions, Bo and Luke usually have to rescue their adversaries as an inevitable precursor to defeating the bad guys; in other instances, the Dukes join forces with Hogg and Coltrane to tackle bigger threats to Hazzard or one of their respective parties. These instances became more frequent as the show progressed, and later seasons saw a number of stories where the Dukes and Hogg (and Coltrane) temporarily work together.\\r\\nThe series was developed from the 1975 film Moonrunners. Created by Gy Waldron in collaboration with ex-moonshiner Jerry Rushing, this movie shares many identical and very similar names and concepts with the subsequent TV series. Although itself essentially a comedy, this original movie was much cruder and edgier than the family-friendly TV series that would evolve from it.\\r\\nIn 1977, Waldron was approached by Warner Bros. with the idea of developing Moonrunners into a television series. Waldron reworked various elements from Moonrunners, and from it was devised what would become The Dukes of Hazzard. Production began in October 1978 with the original intention of only nine episodes being produced as mid-season filler. The first five episodes were filmed in Covington and Conyers, Georgia and surrounding areas, including some location work in nearby Atlanta. After completing production on the fifth episode, \\"High Octane\\", the cast and crew broke for Christmas break, expecting to return in several weeks' time to complete the ordered run of episodes. In the meantime, executives at Warner Bros. were impressed by the rough preview cuts of the completed episodes and saw potential in developing the show into a full-running series; part of this plan was to move production from Georgia to the Warner Bros. lot in Burbank, California, primarily to simplify production as well as develop a larger workshop to service the large number of automobiles needed for the series.\\r\\nRushing appeared as shady used car dealer Ace Parker in the third episode produced, \\"Repo Men\\" (the fourth to be broadcast). Rushing believed this to be the start of a recurring role, in return for which he would supply creative ideas from his experiences: many of the Dukes (and thus Moonrunners) characters and situations were derived from Rushing's experiences as a youth, and much of the character of Bo Duke he states to be based on him. However, \\"Repo Men\\" would turn out to be the character's only appearance in the entire show's run, leading to a legal dispute in the following years over the rights to characters and concepts between Rushing and Warner Bros., although he remained on good terms with cast and crew and in recent years has made appearances at several fan conventions.\\r\\nBy the end of the first (half) season, the family-friendly tone of The Dukes of Hazzard was mostly in place. When the show returned for a second season in Fall 1979 (its first full season), with a few further minor tweaks, the show quickly found its footing as a family-friendly comedy-adventure series. By the third season, starting in Fall 1980, the template was well set in place for that which would be widely associated with the show.\\r\\nAs well as its regular car chases, jumps and stunts, The Dukes of Hazzard relied on character familiarity, with each character effectively serving the same role within a typical episode, and with Deputy Cletus replacing Deputy Enos in Seasons 3 and 4, and Coy and Vance Duke temporarily replacing Bo and Luke (due to a salary dispute) for most of Season 5, being the only major cast changes through the show's run (Ben Jones and James Best both left temporarily during the second season due to different disputes with producers, but both returned within a few episodes). Of the characters, only Uncle Jesse and Boss Hogg appeared in all 145 episodes; Daisy appears in all but one, the third season's \\"To Catch a Duke\\". The General Lee also appears in all but one (the early first-season episode \\"Mary Kaye's Baby\\", the fourth to be produced and the third broadcast).\\r\\nThe pilot episode was to include a barber modeled after Floyd Lawson on The Andy Griffith Show as a regular character, but was eliminated when the final draft of the pilot's script was written and before the show was cast.\\r\\nWhen John Schneider auditioned for the role of Bo Duke, he came to the audition in a dilapidated pickup truck, sporting a week-long beard growth, wearing overalls and a white T-shirt with a pack of cigarettes rolled up in a sleeve collar, and carrying a can of beer, trying to look the part. At the audition, Schneider drank the beer and said he was from Snellville. The producers bought his \\"Good Ol' Boy\\" act and Schneider was hired on the spot.\\r\\nThroughout its network television run, The Dukes of Hazzard had a consistent mix of up-and-comers and established stars make guest appearances.\\r\\nNASCAR driver Terry Labonte makes a brief, uncredited appearance as a crewman in the episode Undercover Dukes Part 1. The race cars supplied for both part 1 and part 2 of Undercover Dukes were supplied by Labonte's race owner, Billy Hagan. However, the emblems of the sponsors of the cars (at that time Labonte was sponsored by Budweiser) were covered to avoid paying royalties.\\r\\nDuring the show's second season, the show's writers began flirting with the idea of incorporating a \\"celebrity speed trap\\" into some of the episodes, as a means to feature top country stars of the day performing their hits. On its first couple of instances, the \\"Speed Trap\\" was featured early in the story, but for most of the cases, it was featured in the last few minutes of an episode, often used when the main story was running too short to fill episode time.\\r\\nThe \\"celebrity speed trap\\" feature was essentially similar: Aware that a big-name country star was passing through the area, Boss Hogg would order Rosco to lower the speed limit on a particular road to an unreasonable level (using a reversible sign, with one speed limit on one side and another, far lower, on the back), so that the targeted singer would be in violation of the posted limit. The singer would be required to give a free performance at the Boar's Nest in exchange for having their citations forgiven; the performer would then perform one of their best-known hits or other popular country music standard, while the Dukes, Boss, Rosco, Enos, Cletus, Cooter, and other patrons whooped and hollered in enjoyment of the performance. More often than not, the performer would give a sarcastic parting shot to Boss and Rosco.\\r\\nSingers who were featured in the \\"speed trap\\" segments were:\\r\\nHonorable Mentions: Mickey Gilley, Loretta Lynn\\r\\nGilley's and Lynn's appearances were not solely for the celebrity speed trap. After performing a concert in Hazzard, Gilley was nabbed while leaving and forced to do a second show to nullify his citation. Lynn was kidnapped by criminals wanting to break into the music business. Loretta Lynn was the very first country music guest star on the show in 1979 and had an entire show titled \\"Find Loretta Lynn.\\"\\r\\nNote: Janie Fricke was the only guest country star who did not perform a song, celebrity speed trap or otherwise. She played an accomplice to a robber in an episode who hid money in the dashboard of the car that was to become the General Lee.\\r\\nThe Dukes of Hazzard was consistently among the top-rated television series (at one point, ranking second only to Dallas, which immediately followed the show on CBS' Friday night schedule). With that success came huge profits in merchandising, with a wide array of Dukes of Hazzard toys and products being licensed and becoming big sellers. However, over the course of the show's fourth season, series stars Tom Wopat and John Schneider became increasingly concerned about a contract dispute over their salaries and merchandising royalties owed to them over the high sales of Dukes products. Neither were being paid what was owed to them and this became very frustrating to the duo. As a result, in the spring of 1982, as filming was due to begin on the fifth season, Wopat and Schneider did not report to the set in protest over the matter. Catherine Bach also considered walking out due to similar concerns, but Wopat and Schneider convinced her to stay, insisting that if she left then there may not be a show to come back to, and that settling the issue was up to them.[4]\\r\\nProduction was pushed back by a few weeks as fairly similar looking replacements were subsequently, hastily hired: Byron Cherry as Coy Duke and Christopher Mayer as Vance Duke. Bo and Luke were said to have gone to race on the NASCAR circuit; how they managed to do this, bearing in mind the terms of their probation, was never explained. Cherry and Mayer were originally contracted at just ten episodes as stand-ins, still with hope that a settlement might be reached with Wopat and Schneider[5] (in total, they made 19 episodes including 1 with Bo and Luke). Some scripts for Coy and Vance were originally written for Bo and Luke but with their names quite literally crossed out and Coy and Vance penned in.[4]\\r\\nThe new Dukes  previously-unmentioned nephews of Uncle Jesse, who were said to have left the farm in 1976, before the show had started  were unpopular with the great majority of viewers, and the ratings immediately sank. Much of the criticism was that Coy and Vance were nothing but direct clones of Bo and Luke, with Coy a direct \\"carbon copy\\" replacement for Bo and Vance for Luke, with little variation in character. This was something that even show creator Gy Waldron has said was wrong,[6] and that he insisted, unsuccessfully, that audiences would not accept direct character clones and the two replacements should be taken in a different direction characterwise, but was overridden by producers. Waldron also commented that if Bach too had walked, the show would have most probably been cancelled. It was reported that prior to filming, Cherry and Mayer were given Bo and Luke episodes to watch, to study and learn to emulate them, although Cherry has said in interviews that he doesn't recall this ever happening.\\r\\nHit hard by the significant drop in ratings, Warner Bros. renegotiated with Wopat and Schneider, and eventually a settlement was reached, and the original Duke boys returned to the series in early 1983, four episodes from the conclusion of the fifth season. Initially, part of the press release announcing Wopat and Schneider's return suggested that Cherry and Mayer would remain as part of the cast (though presumably in a reduced role),[7] but it was quickly realized that \\"four Duke boys\\" would not work within the context of the series, and due to the huge unpopularity associated with their time on the show, they were quickly written out of the same episode in which Bo and Luke returned.\\r\\nAlthough Coy and Vance were never popular with the majority, a few viewers were disappointed by their departure episode, \\"Welcome Back, Bo 'N' Luke\\", which was for the most part a standard episode, with the return of Bo and Luke and the departure of Coy and Vance tacked onto the beginning (Bo and Luke return from their NASCAR tour just as Coy and Vance leave Hazzard to tend to a sick relative). Even a few viewers commented that they were disappointed by this, and that they would have liked to have seen both pairs of Duke boys team up to tackle a particularly dastardly plot by Boss Hogg before Coy and Vance's departure, but as it turned out, Coy and Vance had little dialogue and were gone by the first commercial break, never to be seen again.[8]\\r\\nWhile the return of Bo and Luke was welcomed by ardent and casual viewers alike, and as a result ratings recovered slightly, the show never completely regained its former popularity. One of Wopat and Schneider's disputes even before they left was what they considered to be increasingly weak and formulaic scripts and episode plots.[9] With Wopat and Schneider's return, the producers agreed to try a wider scope of storylines.[10] However, although it continued for two more seasons, the show never fully returned to its former glory. Many cast members[who?] decried the miniature car effects newly incorporated to depict increasingly absurd General Lee and patrol car stunts (which had previously been performed with real cars by stunt drivers). The miniature car effects were intended as a budget saving measure (to save the cost of repairing or replacing damaged vehicles) and to help compete visually with KITT from the NBC series Knight Rider.[citation needed] In February 1985, The Dukes of Hazzard ended its run after seven seasons.\\r\\nThe General Lee was based on a 1969 Dodge Charger owned by Bo and Luke (the series used mostly 1969 Chargers in the beginning; later on, they also modified 1968 Chargers to look like 1969s by installing 1969-model taillamps, taillamp panels, and grilles). It was orange with a Confederate battle flag painted on the roof, the words \\"GENERAL LEE\\" over each door, and the number \\"01\\" on each door. In the original five Georgia-filmed episodes, a Confederate flag along with a checkered racing flag in a criss-cross pattern could be seen behind the rear window; this was removed when it was felt that this extra detail did not show up enough on-screen to warrant the already very tight time constraints of preparing and repairing each example of the car. The name refers to the American Civil War Confederate General Robert E. Lee. The television show was based on the movie Moonrunners, in turn based on actual moonshine runners who used a 1958 Chrysler named Traveler, after General Lee's horse (with a slight spelling change). Traveler was originally intended to be the name of the Duke boys' stock car too, until producers agreed that General Lee had more punch to it.\\r\\nSince it was built as a race car, the doors were welded shut. Through the history of the show, an estimated 309 Chargers were used; 17 are still known to exist in various states of repair. A replica was owned by John Schneider, known as \\"Bo's General Lee.\\" In 2008, Schneider sold \\"Bo's General Lee\\" at the Barrett-Jackson automobile auction for $230,000. An eBay auction which garnered a bid of $9,900,500 for the car was never finalized, with the purported bidder claiming his account had been hacked.[11] The underside of the hood has the signatures of the cast from the 1997 TV movie. Schneider has also restored over 20 other General Lees to date. In 2008, a replica of the General Lee fetched a high bid of $450,000 at the Barrett-Jackson auto auction, indicating the significant interest in the car as a cultural icon. In 2012, the \\"General Lee 1\\", the first car used in filming the series, was purchased at auction by golfer Bubba Watson for $110,000. The car had been scrapped after being wrecked during the famous opening jump shoot, and was later discovered in a junk-yard by the president of the North American General Lee fan club.[12] In 2015, following a wave of sentiment against confederate symbolism in the wake of shootings in Charleston, SC, (relating to photos where the attacker had posed with the Confederate flag), Bubba Watson announced that he would remove the Confederate Flag from the roof of General Lee 1 and repaint it with the US National Flag.[13]\\r\\nThe show also used 1968 Chargers (which shared the same sheet metal) by changing the grille and taillight panel to the 1969 style, and removing the round side marker lights. These Chargers performed many record-breaking jumps throughout the show, almost all of them resulting in a completely destroyed car. The 1970 Chargers were modified by removing the chrome bumper and changing the taillights.\\r\\nThe Duke boys added a custom air horn to the General Lee that played the first twelve notes of the song Dixie. The Dixie horn was not originally planned, until a Georgia local hot rod racer drove by and sounded his car's Dixie horn. The producers immediately rushed after him asking where he had bought the horn. Warner Bros. purchased several Chargers for stunts, as they generally destroyed at least one or two cars per episode. By the end of the show's sixth season, the Chargers were becoming harder to find, and more expensive. In addition, the television series Knight Rider began to rival the General Lee's stunts. As such, the producers used 1:8 scale miniatures, filmed by Jack Sessums' crew, or recycled stock jump footage  the latter being a practice that had been in place to an extent since the second season, and had increased as the seasons passed.\\r\\nSome of the 01 and Confederate flag motifs were initially hand painted, but as production sped up, these were replaced with vinyl decals for quick application (and removal), as needed.\\r\\nDuring the first five episodes of the show that were filmed in Georgia, the cars involved with filming were given to the crew at H&H body shop near the filming location. At this shop, the men worked day and night to prepare the wrecked cars for the next day while still running their body shop during the day. Time was of the essence, and the men that worked at this shop worked hard hours to get the cars prepared for the show.\\r\\nThe third episode \\"Mary Kaye's Baby\\" is the only one in which the General Lee does not appear. Instead, the Dukes drove around in a blue 1975 Plymouth Fury borrowed from Cooter that Luke later destroyed by shooting an arrow at the car, whose trunk had been leaking due to the moonshine stowed in the back.\\r\\nThe Duke boys' CB handle was (jointly) \\"Lost Sheep\\". Originally when the show was conceived, their handle was to be \\"General Lee\\" to match their vehicle, but this was only ever used on-screen on one occasion, in the second episode, \\"Daisy's Song\\", when Cooter calls Bo and Luke over the CB by this handle, although they were actually driving Daisy's Plymouth Roadrunner (see below) at the time. As it became obvious that the \\"General Lee\\" handle would be out of place when the Duke boys were in another vehicle, the \\"Lost Sheep\\" handle was devised (with Uncle Jesse being \\"Shepherd\\" and Daisy being \\"Bo Peep\\").\\r\\nThe 1975 AMC Matador[14] was one of many different Hazzard County police cars used on the series, mostly in the first season; they had light bars and working radios. A 1972 Dodge Polara[15] and a 1974 Dodge Monaco[16] were used during the pilot episode \\"One Armed Bandits\\", these were also seen in the show's title sequence. From the second season, the 1977 Dodge Monaco[17] was mostly used. From mid-season four the similar looking 1978 Plymouth Fury[18] was used instead. The Matadors and Furies were former Los Angeles Police Department vehicles, while the Monacos were former California Highway Patrol units.\\r\\nA 1974 Plymouth Road Runner[19] (yellow with a black stripe) was Daisy Duke's car in the first five episodes of the first season. For the last episodes of the first season a similarly painted 1971 model with a matching \\"Road Runner\\" stripe was used. In the second season Bo and Luke send it off a cliff in \\"The Runaway.\\" Another identical Plymouth 1971 model car appeared in the background a few more episodes along with the Jeep CJ-7 until it was finally dropped altogether.\\r\\nDixie was the name given to Daisy Duke's white 1980 Jeep CJ-7 \\"Golden Eagle\\" which had a golden eagle emblem on the hood and the name \\"Dixie\\" on the sides. Like other vehicles in the show, there was actually more than one Jeep used throughout the series. Sometimes it would have an automatic transmission, and other times it would be a manual. The design of the roll cage also varied across the seasons. When the Jeep was introduced at the end of the second season's \\"The Runaway\\", it was seen to have doors and a slightly different paint job, but, bar one appearance in the next produced episode, \\"Arrest Jesse Duke\\" (actually broadcast before \\"The Runaway\\", causing a continuity error), thereafter the doors were removed and the paint job was made all-white, with \\"Dixie\\" painted on the sides of the hood. These Jeeps were leased to the producers of the show by American Motors Corporation in exchange for a brief mention in the closing credits of the show.\\r\\nUncle Jesse's truck was a white Ford pickup truck, most commonly a Sixth generation (1973ÿ1977) F100 Styleside.[20] However, in the earliest episodes it had a Flareside bed, and varied between F100 and F250 models throughout the show's run. Bo, Luke and Daisy also drove Jesse's truck on occasion.\\r\\nA White 1970 Cadillac De Ville convertible was used as Boss Hogg's car, notably with large bull horns as a hood ornament. In early seasons, Hogg was almost always driven by a chauffeur, who was normally nameless and had little or no dialogue, but identified on occasion as being called \\"Alex\\"; and played by several different uncredited actors, including stuntman Gary Baxley. This chauffeur would often be dressed in a red plaid shirt and deep brown or black Stetson hat, but on occasion would be an older man, sometimes dressed in more typical chauffeur attire.\\r\\nHogg is first seen to drive for himself in the second season opener \\"Days of Shine and Roses\\", where he and Jesse challenge each other to one last moonshine race. From the fourth season onward, except for a couple of brief reappearances of the chauffeur (during the fourth season), Hogg drove himself around in his Cadillac (or occasionally driven by Rosco and, in the series' finale, by Uncle Jesse) and frequently challenged others by invoking his driving expertise from his days as a ridge-runner. Unlike other vehicles in the series, Boss Hogg's Cadillac is typically treated with kid gloves. The car is almost always seen with its convertible top down, with the top only being seen in two episodes, \\"Daisy's Song\\" (the chauffeur was called \\"Eddie\\" in this episode), the second to be produced and broadcast, and briefly in the second-season episode \\"Witness for the Persecution\\", when Cooter is returning it to the Court House after repairs.\\r\\nThe theme song \\"The Good Ol' Boys\\" was written and performed by Waylon Jennings. He was also \\"The Balladeer\\" (as credited), and served as narrator of the show. However, the version released as a single is not the same version that was used in the show's opening credits; the single version has a repeat of the chorus and an instrumental to pad out the length, uses a different instrumental mix that emphasizes the bass, and replaces the last verse with an inside joke about how the TV show producers \\"keep on showing (Jennings's) hands and not (his) face on TV.\\"\\r\\nIn 1980, the song reached #1 on the American Country chart and peaked at #21 on the Billboard Hot 100.[21]\\r\\nSoon before the series ended its original run on CBS, The Dukes of Hazzard went into off-network syndication. Although not as widely run as it was back in the 1980s and the years since, reruns of the program do continue to air in various parts of the United States.\\r\\nNotably, television stations that aired the show in syndication include KCOP Los Angeles, WGN-TV Chicago, KBHK San Francisco, WKBD Detroit, WTAF/WTXF Philadelphia, KTXL Sacramento, WVTV Milwaukee, KMSP MinneapolisÿSaint Paul, among others.\\r\\nNationwide, the show also aired on ABC Family (2000ÿ2001, 2004) and CMT (2005ÿ2007, 2010ÿ2012, 2014ÿ15) and TV Land (2015); TV Land dropped the show in the wake of protests and controversy surrounding the display of the Confederate flag.[23]\\r\\nThe Nashville Network bought The Dukes of Hazzard from Warner Bros. in 1997 for well over $10 million; not only did it improve the network's ratings, the show was also popular among younger viewers, a demographic TNN had a notorious difficulty in drawing; The Dukes of Hazzard has run either on TNN or sister network CMT ever since.[24]\\r\\nThe show ran for seven seasons and a total of 145 episodes. Many of the episodes followed a similar structure \\"out-of-town crooks pull a robbery or commit a crime or scandal, Duke boys blamed, spend the rest of the hour clearing their names, the General Lee flies and the squad cars crash\\".[34]\\r\\nThere were two made-for-TV reunion movies that aired on CBS, The Dukes of Hazzard: Reunion! (1997) and The Dukes of Hazzard: Hazzard in Hollywood (2000). Also made were The Dukes of Hazzard in 2005 and a direct-to-video prequel The Dukes of Hazzard: The Beginning in 2007.\\r\\nWarner Home Video has released all seven seasons of The Dukes of Hazzard on DVD in Regions 1 and 2. The two TV-movies that followed the series were released on DVD in Region 1 on June 10, 2008 and in Region 4 on June 4, 2014.[36] In Region 4, Warner has released only the first six seasons on DVD and the two TV movies. The Compete Series & 2 TV Movies was released on DVD in Region 1 on November 14, 2017.[37]\\r\\nThe TV series was also made available for streaming and download through a variety of services.[39]\\r\\nIn 2005, Tom Wopat and John Schneider were reunited during \\"Exposed\\", a fifth season episode of the television series Smallville.[40] Wopat guest-starred as Kansas State Senator Jack Jennings, an old friend of Clark Kent's adoptive father Jonathan Kent (portrayed by Schneider). In the episode, Jennings drives a 1968 Dodge Chargerthe same body style as The General Lee.[41]\\r\\nLizard Lick Towing featured an episode with its repossession specialists Ronnie Shirley and Bobby Brantley repossess a General Lee replica.[citation needed]\\r\\nIn 2015, in the wake of renewed debate about the symbolism of the Confederate battle flag (which was prominently featured on the General Lee 's roof and panel behind the rear window in the first five episodes), reruns of the original series were pulled from circulation. Warner Bros., which owns the property, announced it would also no longer create merchandise bearing the flag, including miniatures of the General Lee.[42]\\r\\nArtifacts from the show are on display in Luray, Virginia, Nashville, Tennessee and in Gatlinburg, Tennessee. Cooter's Place in Luray is overseen by Ben \\"Cooter\\" Jones from the series. The Gatlinburg location features a gift shop, Dukes of Hazzard-themed indoor mini golf and go-cart track, with a small display of costumes, collectables and artifacts from the show.\\r\\nCovington and Conyers, Georgia; where the original five episodes were produced, have been two major tourist attractions for Dukes of Hazzard fans.\\r\\nDixie Outfitters in Branson, Missouri on Highway 76 has the General Lee and Rosco's police car signed by Daisy, Cooter, Cletus and Enos.[citation needed]","input":"Who was the narrator for the dukes of hazzard?"},{"output":"June 11, 1963","context":"The Civil Rights Act of 1964 (Pub.L. 88ÿ352, 78?Stat.?241, enacted July?2, 1964) is a landmark civil rights and US labor law in the United States[5] that outlaws discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.[6] It prohibited unequal application of voter registration requirements, racial segregation in schools, employment, and public accommodations.\\r\\nPowers given to enforce the act were initially weak, but were supplemented during later years. Congress asserted its authority to legislate under several different parts of the United States Constitution, principally its power to regulate interstate commerce under Article One (section 8), its duty to guarantee all citizens equal protection of the laws under the Fourteenth Amendment and its duty to protect voting rights under the Fifteenth Amendment. The Act was signed into law by President Lyndon B. Johnson on July 2, 1964, at the White House.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe bill was called for by President John F. Kennedy in his Report to the American People on Civil Rights of June 11, 1963,[7] in which he asked for legislation \\"giving all Americans the right to be served in facilities which are open to the publichotels, restaurants, theaters, retail stores, and similar establishments\\", as well as \\"greater protection for the right to vote\\". Kennedy delivered this speech following the immediate aftermath of the Birmingham campaign and the growing number of demonstrations and protests throughout the southern United States. Kennedy was moved to action following the elevated racial tensions and wave of black riots in the spring 1963.[8]\\r\\nEmulating the Civil Rights Act of 1875, Kennedy's civil rights bill included provisions to ban discrimination in public accommodations, and to enable the U.S. Attorney General to join in lawsuits against state governments which operated segregated school systems, among other provisions. However, it did not include a number of provisions deemed essential by civil rights leaders including protection against police brutality, ending discrimination in private employment, or granting the Justice Department power to initiate desegregation or job discrimination lawsuits.[9]\\r\\nOn June 11, 1963, President Kennedy met with the Republican leaders to discuss the legislation before his television address to the nation that evening. Two days later, Senate Minority Leader Everett Dirksen and Senate Majority Leader Mike Mansfield both voiced support for the president's bill, except for provisions guaranteeing equal access to places of public accommodations. This led to several Republican Congressmen drafting a compromise bill to be considered. On June 19, the president sent his bill to Congress as it was originally written, saying legislative action was \\"imperative\\".[10][11] The president's bill went first to the House of Representatives, where it was referred to the Judiciary Committee, chaired by Emanuel Celler, a Democrat from New York. After a series of hearings on the bill, Celler's committee strengthened the act, adding provisions to ban racial discrimination in employment, providing greater protection to black voters, eliminating segregation in all publicly owned facilities (not just schools), and strengthening the anti-segregation clauses regarding public facilities such as lunch counters. They also added authorization for the Attorney General to file lawsuits to protect individuals against the deprivation of any rights secured by the Constitution or U.S. law. In essence, this was the controversial \\"Title III\\" that had been removed from the 1957 and 1960 Acts. Civil rights organizations pressed hard for this provision because it could be used to protect peaceful protesters and black voters from police brutality and suppression of free speech rights.\\r\\nKennedy called the congressional leaders to the White House in late October, 1963 to line up the necessary votes in the House for passage.[12] The bill was reported out of the Judiciary Committee in November 1963, and referred to the Rules Committee, whose chairman, Howard W. Smith, a Democrat and avid segregationist from Virginia, indicated his intention to keep the bill bottled up indefinitely.\\r\\nThe assassination of John F. Kennedy on November 22, 1963, changed the political situation. Kennedy's successor as president, Lyndon Johnson, made use of his experience in legislative politics, along with the bully pulpit he wielded as president, in support of the bill. In his first address to a joint session of Congress on November 27, 1963, Johnson told the legislators, \\"No memorial oration or eulogy could more eloquently honor President Kennedy's memory than the earliest possible passage of the civil rights bill for which he fought so long.\\"[13]\\r\\nJudiciary Committee chairman Celler filed a petition to discharge the bill from the Rules Committee; it required the support of a majority of House members to move the bill to the floor. Initially Celler had a difficult time acquiring the signatures necessary, with many congressmen who supported the civil rights bill itself remaining cautious about violating normal House procedure with the rare use of a discharge petition. By the time of the 1963 winter recess, 50 signatures were still needed.\\r\\nAfter the return of Congress from its winter recess, however, it was apparent that public opinion in the North favored the bill and that the petition would acquire the necessary signatures. To avert the humiliation of a successful discharge petition, Chairman Smith relented and allowed the bill to pass through the Rules Committee.\\r\\nLobbying support for the Civil Rights Act was coordinated by the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights, a coalition of 70 liberal and labor organizations. The principal lobbyists for the Leadership Conference were civil rights lawyer Joseph L. Rauh Jr. and Clarence Mitchell, Sr. of the NAACP.[14]\\r\\nJohnson, who wanted the bill passed as soon as possible, ensured that the bill would be quickly considered by the Senate. Normally, the bill would have been referred to the Senate Judiciary Committee, chaired by Senator James O. Eastland, Democrat from Mississippi. Given Eastland's firm opposition, it seemed impossible that the bill would reach the Senate floor. Senate Majority Leader Mike Mansfield took a novel approach to prevent the bill from being relegated to Judiciary Committee limbo. Having initially waived a second reading of the bill, which would have led to it being immediately referred to Judiciary, Mansfield gave the bill a second reading on February 26, 1964, and then proposed, in the absence of precedent for instances when a second reading did not immediately follow the first, that the bill bypass the Judiciary Committee and immediately be sent to the Senate floor for debate.\\r\\nWhen the bill came before the full Senate for debate on March 30, 1964, the \\"Southern Bloc\\" of 18 southern Democratic Senators and one Republican Senator led by Richard Russell (D-GA) launched a filibuster to prevent its passage.[16] Said Russell: \\"We will resist to the bitter end any measure or any movement which would have a tendency to bring about social equality and intermingling and amalgamation of the races in our (Southern) states.\\"[17]\\r\\nThe most fervent opposition to the bill came from Senator Strom Thurmond (D-SC): \\"This so-called Civil Rights Proposals, which the President has sent to Capitol Hill for enactment into law, are unconstitutional, unnecessary, unwise and extend beyond the realm of reason. This is the worst civil-rights package ever presented to the Congress and is reminiscent of the Reconstruction proposals and actions of the radical Republican Congress.\\"[18]\\r\\nAfter 54 days of filibuster, Senators Hubert Humphrey (D-MN), Mike Mansfield (D-MT), Everett Dirksen (R-IL), and Thomas Kuchel (R-CA), introduced a substitute bill that they hoped would attract enough Republican swing votes in addition to the core liberal Democrats behind the legislation to end the filibuster. The compromise bill was weaker than the House version in regard to government power to regulate the conduct of private business, but it was not so weak as to cause the House to reconsider the legislation.[19]\\r\\nOn the morning of June 10, 1964, Senator Robert Byrd (D-W.Va.) completed a filibustering address that he had begun 14 hours and 13 minutes earlier opposing the legislation. Until then, the measure had occupied the Senate for 60 working days, including six Saturdays. A day earlier, Democratic Whip Hubert Humphrey of Minnesota, the bill's manager, concluded he had the 67 votes required at that time to end the debate and end the filibuster. With six wavering senators providing a four-vote victory margin, the final tally stood at 71 to 29. Never in history had the Senate been able to muster enough votes to cut off a filibuster on a civil rights bill. And only once in the 37 years since 1927 had it agreed to cloture for any measure.[20]\\r\\nOn June 19, the substitute (compromise) bill passed the Senate by a vote of 73ÿ27, and quickly passed through the HouseÿSenate conference committee, which adopted the Senate version of the bill. The conference bill was passed by both houses of Congress, and was signed into law by President Johnson on July 2, 1964.[21]\\r\\nTotals are in \\"YeaÿNay\\" format:\\r\\nThe original House version:[22]\\r\\nCloture in the Senate:[23]\\r\\nThe Senate version:[22]\\r\\nThe Senate version, voted on by the House:[22]\\r\\nNote: \\"Southern\\", as used in this section, refers to members of Congress from the eleven states that made up the Confederate States of America in the American Civil War. \\"Northern\\" refers to members from the other 39 states, regardless of the geographic location of those states.[24]\\r\\nThe original House version:\\r\\nThe Senate version:\\r\\nJust one year earlier, the same Congress had passed the Equal Pay Act of 1963, which prohibited wage differentials based on sex. The prohibition on sex discrimination was added to the Civil Rights Act by Howard W. Smith, a powerful Virginia Democrat who chaired the House Rules Committee and who strongly opposed the legislation. Smith's amendment was passed by a teller vote of 168 to 133. Historians debate Smith's motivation, whether it was a cynical attempt to defeat the bill by someone opposed to civil rights both for blacks and women, or an attempt to support their rights by broadening the bill to include women.[26][27][28][29] Smith expected that Republicans, who had included equal rights for women in their party's platform since 1944,[30] would probably vote for the amendment. Historians speculate that Smith was trying to embarrass northern Democrats who opposed civil rights for women because the clause was opposed by labor unions. Representative Carl Elliott of Alabama later claimed, \\"Smith didn't give a damn about women's rights...he was trying to knock off votes either then or down the line because there was always a hard core of men who didn't favor women's rights,\\"[31] and the Congressional Record records that Smith was greeted by laughter when he introduced the amendment.[32]\\r\\nSmith asserted that he was not joking; he sincerely supported the amendment and, indeed, along with Rep. Martha Griffiths,[33] he was the chief spokesperson for the amendment.[32] For twenty years Smith had sponsored the Equal Rights Amendment (with no linkage to racial issues) in the House because he believed in it. He for decades had been close to the National Woman's Party and its leader Alice Paul, who was also the leader in winning the right to vote for women in 1920, the author of the first Equal Rights Amendment, and a chief supporter of equal rights proposals since then. She and other feminists had worked with Smith since 1945 trying to find a way to include sex as a protected civil rights category. Now was the moment.[34] Griffiths argued that the new law would protect black women but not white women, and that was unfair to white women. Furthermore, she argued that the laws \\"protecting\\" women from unpleasant jobs were actually designed to enable men to monopolize those jobs, and that was unfair to women who were not allowed to try out for those jobs.[35] The amendment passed with the votes of Republicans and Southern Democrats. The final law passed with the votes of Republicans and Northern Democrats. Thus, as Justice William Rehnquist explained in Meritor Savings Bank v. Vinson, \\"The prohibition against discrimination based on sex was added to Title VII at the last minute on the floor of the House of Representatives... the bill quickly passed as amended, and we are left with little legislative history to guide us in interpreting the Act's prohibition against discrimination based on 'sex.'\\"[36]\\r\\nOne of the most damaging arguments by the bill's opponents was that once passed, the bill would require forced busing to achieve certain racial quotas in schools.[37] Proponents of the bill, such as Emanuel Celler and Jacob Javits, said that the bill would not authorize such measures. Leading sponsor Senator Hubert Humphrey (D-MN) wrote two amendments specifically designed to outlaw busing.[37] Humphrey said \\"if the bill were to compel it, it would be a violation [of the Constitution], because it would be handling the matter on the basis of race and we would be transporting children because of race.\\"[37] While Javits said any government official who sought to use the bill for busing purposes \\"would be making a fool of himself,\\" two years later the Department of Health, Education and Welfare said that Southern school districts would be required to meet mathematical ratios of students by busing.[37]\\r\\nThe bill divided and engendered a long-term change in the demographic support of both parties. President Johnson realized that supporting this bill would risk losing the South's overwhelming support of the Democratic Party. Both Attorney General Robert Kennedy and Vice President Johnson had pushed for the introduction of the civil rights legislation. Johnson told Kennedy aide Ted Sorensen that \\"I know the risks are great and we might lose the South, but those sorts of states may be lost anyway.\\"[38] Senator Richard Russell, Jr. later warned President Johnson that his strong support for the civil rights bill \\"will not only cost you the South, it will cost you the election\\".[39] Johnson, however, went on to win the 1964 election by one of the biggest landslides in American history. The South, which had five states swing Republican in 1964, became a stronghold of the Republican Party by the 1990s.[40]\\r\\nAlthough majorities in both parties voted for the bill, there were notable exceptions. Though he opposed forced segregation,[41] Republican Senator Barry Goldwater of Arizona voted against the bill, remarking, \\"You can't legislate morality.\\" Goldwater had supported previous attempts to pass civil rights legislation in 1957 and 1960 as well as the 24th Amendment outlawing the poll tax. He stated that the reason for his opposition to the 1964 bill was Title II, which in his opinion violated individual liberty and states' rights. Democrats and Republicans from the Southern states opposed the bill and led an unsuccessful 83-day filibuster, including Senators Albert Gore, Sr. (D-TN) and J. William Fulbright (D-AR), as well as Senator Robert Byrd (D-WV), who personally filibustered for 14 hours straight.\\r\\n(The full text of the Act is available online.)\\r\\nBarred unequal application of voter registration requirements.\\r\\nTitle I did not eliminate literacy tests, which were one of the main methods used to exclude Black voters, other racial minorities, and poor Whites in the South, nor did it address economic retaliation, police repression, or physical violence against nonwhite voters. While the Act did require that voting rules and procedures be applied equally to all races, it did not abolish the concept of voter \\"qualification\\", that is to say, it accepted the idea that citizens do not have an automatic right to vote but rather might have to meet some standard beyond citizenship.[42][43] It was the Voting Rights Act, enacted one year later in 1965, that directly addressed and eliminated most voting qualifications beyond citizenship.\\r\\nOutlawed discrimination based on race, color, religion or national origin in hotels, motels, restaurants, theaters, and all other public accommodations engaged in interstate commerce; exempted private clubs without defining the term \\"private\\".[44]\\r\\nProhibited state and municipal governments from denying access to public facilities on grounds of race, color, religion or national origin.\\r\\nEncouraged the desegregation of public schools and authorized the U.S. Attorney General to file suits to enforce said act.\\r\\nExpanded the Civil Rights Commission established by the earlier Civil Rights Act of 1957 with additional powers, rules and procedures.\\r\\nPrevents discrimination by government agencies that receive federal funds. If an agency is found in violation of Title VI, that agency may lose its federal funding.\\r\\nGeneral\\r\\nThis title declares it to be the policy of the United States that discrimination on the ground of race, color, or national origin shall not occur in connection with programs and activities receiving Federal financial assistance and authorizes and directs the appropriate Federal departments and agencies to take action to carry out this policy. This title is not intended to apply to foreign assistance programs. Section 601?ÿ This section states the general principle that no person in the United States shall be excluded from participation in or otherwise discriminated against on the ground of race, color, or national origin under any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.\\r\\nSection 602 directs each Federal agency administering a program of Federal financial assistance by way of grant, contract, or loan to take action pursuant to rule, regulation, or order of general applicability to effectuate the principle of section 601 in a manner consistent with the achievement of the objectives of the statute authorizing the assistance. In seeking the effect compliance with its requirements imposed under this section, an agency is authorized to terminate or to refuse to grant or to continue assistance under a program to any recipient as to whom there has been an express finding pursuant to a hearing of a failure to comply with the requirements under that program, and it may also employ any other means authorized by law. However, each agency is directed first to seek compliance with its requirements by voluntary means.\\r\\nSection 603 provides that any agency action taken pursuant to section 602 shall be subject to such judicial review as would be available for similar actions by that agency on other grounds. Where the agency action consists of terminating or refusing to grant or to continue financial assistance because of a finding of a failure of the recipient to comply with the agency's requirements imposed under section 602, and the agency action would not otherwise be subject to judicial review under existing law, judicial review shall nevertheless be available to any person aggrieved as provided in section 10 of the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C.??1009). The section also states explicitly that in the latter situation such agency action shall not be deemed committed to unreviewable agency discretion within the meaning of section 10. The purpose of this provision is to obviate the possible argument that although section 603 provides for review in accordance with section 10, section 10 itself has an exception for action \\"committed to agency discretion,\\" which might otherwise be carried over into section 603. It is not the purpose of this provision of section 603, however, otherwise to alter the scope of judicial review as presently provided in section 10(e) of the Administrative Procedure Act.\\r\\nTitle VII of the Act, codified as Subchapter VI of Chapter 21 of title 42 of the United States Code, prohibits discrimination by covered employers on the basis of race, color, religion, sex or national origin (see 42 U.S.C.??2000e-2[45]). Title VII applies to and covers an employer \\"who has fifteen (15) or more employees for each working day in each of twenty or more calendar weeks in the current or preceding calendar year\\" as written in the Definitions section under 42 U.S.C. 2000e(b). Title VII also prohibits discrimination against an individual because of his or her association with another individual of a particular race, color, religion, sex, or national origin, such as by an interracial marriage.[46] The EEO Title VII has also been supplemented with legislation prohibiting pregnancy, age, and disability discrimination (See Pregnancy Discrimination Act of 1978, Age Discrimination in Employment Act,[47] Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990).\\r\\nIn very narrowly defined situations, an employer is permitted to discriminate on the basis of a protected trait where the trait is a bona fide occupational qualification (BFOQ) reasonably necessary to the normal operation of that particular business or enterprise. To prove the bona fide occupational qualifications defense, an employer must prove three elements: a direct relationship between the protected trait and the ability to perform the duties of the job, the BFOQ relates to the \\"essence\\" or \\"central mission of the employer's business\\", and there is no less-restrictive or reasonable alternative (United Automobile Workers v. Johnson Controls, Inc., 499 U.S. 187 (1991) 111 S.Ct. 1196). The Bona Fide Occupational Qualification exception is an extremely narrow exception to the general prohibition of discrimination based on protected traits (Dothard v. Rawlinson, 433 U.S. 321 (1977) 97 S.Ct. 2720). An employer or customer's preference for an individual of a particular religion is not sufficient to establish a Bona Fide Occupational Qualification (Equal Employment Opportunity Commission v. Kamehameha School  Bishop Estate, 990 F.2d 458 (9th Cir. 1993)).\\r\\nTitle VII allows for any employer, labor organization, joint labor-management committee, or employment agency to bypass the \\"unlawful employment practice\\" for any person involved with the Communist Party of the United States or of any other organization required to register as a Communist-action or Communist-front organization by final order of the Subversive Activities Control Board pursuant to the Subversive Activities Control Act of 1950.[48]\\r\\nThere are partial and whole exceptions to Title VII for four types of employers:\\r\\nThe Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) as well as certain state fair employment practices agencies (FEPAs) enforce Title VII (see 42 U.S.C.??2000e-4[45]). The EEOC and state FEPAs investigate, mediate, and may file lawsuits on behalf of employees. Where a state law is contradicted by a federal law, it is overridden.[49] Every state, except Arkansas and Mississippi, maintains a state FEPA (see EEOC and state FEPA directory ). Title VII also provides that an individual can bring a private lawsuit. An individual must file a complaint of discrimination with the EEOC within 180 days of learning of the discrimination or the individual may lose the right to file a lawsuit. Title VII only applies to employers who employ 15 or more employees for 20 or more weeks in the current or preceding calendar year (42 U.S.C.??2000e(b)).\\r\\nIn the early 1980s, the EEOC and some federal courts began holding that sexual harassment is also prohibited under the Act. In 1986, the Supreme Court held in Meritor Savings Bank v. Vinson, 477 U.S. 57 (1986), that sexual harassment is sex discrimination and is prohibited by Title VII. Same-sex sexual harassment has also been held in a unanimous decision written by Justice Scalia to be prohibited by Title VII (Oncale v. Sundowner Offshore Services, Inc., 523 U.S. 75 (1998), 118 S.Ct. 998).\\r\\nIn 2012, the EEOC ruled that employment discrimination on the basis of gender identity or transgender status is prohibited under Title VII. The decision held that discrimination on the basis of gender identity qualified as discrimination on the basis of sex whether the discrimination was due to sex stereotyping, discomfort with the fact of an individual's transition, or discrimination due to a perceived change in the individual's sex.[50][51] In 2014, the EEOC initiated two lawsuits against private companies for discrimination on the basis of gender identity, with additional litigation under consideration.[52] As of November 2014, Commissioner Chai Feldblum is making an active effort to increase awareness of Title VII remedies for individuals discriminated on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity.[53][54]\\r\\nOn December 15, 2014, under a memorandum issued by Attorney General Eric Holder, the United States Department of Justice (DoJ) took a position that aligned with the EEOC, namely the prohibition of sex discrimination under Title VII encompassed the prohibition of discrimination based on gender identity or transgender status. DoJ had already stopped opposing claims of discrimination brought by federal transgender employees.[55]\\r\\nIn October 2017, Attorney General Jeff Sessions issued a directive that withdrew the Holder memorandum.[56] According to a copy of the directive reviewed by BuzzFeed News, Sessions stated that Title VII should be narrowly interpreted to cover discrimination between \\"men and women\\". Attorney General Session stated as a matter of law, Title VII does not prohibit discrimination based on gender identity per se.[57] Devin O'Malley, speaking on behalf of the DoJ, stated \\"the last administration abandoned that fundamental principle [that the Department of Justice cannot expand the law beyond what Congress has provided], which necessitated today's action.\\" Sharon McGowan, a lawyer with Lambda Legal who previously served in the Civil Rights division of DoJ, rejected that argument, saying \\"[T]his memo is not actually a reflection of the law as it is  it's a reflection of what the DOJ wishes the law were\\" and \\"The Justice Department is actually getting back in the business of making anti-transgender law in court.\\"[56]\\r\\nOn December 11, 2017, the United States Supreme Court refused to hear an appeal in Evans v. Georgia Regional Hospital, in which a lower court ruled against the plaintiff, who had argued Title VII protections applied to sexual orientation. The 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals stated in its earlier ruling that only the Supreme Court could determine if Title VII applied.[58]\\r\\nRequired compilation of voter-registration and voting data in geographic areas specified by the Commission on Civil Rights.\\r\\nTitle IX made it easier to move civil rights cases from state courts to federal court. This was of crucial importance to civil rights activists[who?] who contended that they could not get fair trials in state courts.[citation needed]\\r\\nTitle IX of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 should not be confused with Title IX of the Education Amendments Act of 1972, which prohibits sex discrimination in federally funded education programs and activities.\\r\\nEstablished the Community Relations Service, tasked with assisting in community disputes involving claims of discrimination.\\r\\nTitle XI gives a defendant accused of certain categories of criminal contempt in a matter arising under title II, III, IV, V, VI, or VII of the Act the right to a jury trial. If convicted, the defendant can be fined an amount not to exceed $1,000 or imprisoned for not more than six months.\\r\\nThere were white business owners who claimed that Congress did not have the constitutional authority to ban segregation in public accommodations. For example, Moreton Rolleston, the owner of a motel in Atlanta, Georgia, said he should not be forced to serve black travelers, saying, \\"the fundamental questionis whether or not Congress has the power to take away the liberty of an individual to run his business as he sees fit in the selection and choice of his customers\\".[59] Rolleston claimed that the Civil Rights Act of 1964 was a breach of the Fourteenth Amendment and also violated the Fifth and Thirteenth Amendments by depriving him of \\"liberty and property without due process\\".[59] In Heart of Atlanta Motel v. United States (1964), the Supreme Court held that Congress drew its authority from the Constitution's Commerce Clause, rejecting Rolleston's claims.\\r\\nResistance to the public accommodation clause continued for years on the ground, especially in the South.[60] When local college students in Orangeburg, South Carolina attempted to desegregate a bowling alley in 1968, they were violently attacked, leading to rioting and what became known as the \\"Orangeburg massacre.\\"[61] Resistance by school boards continued into the next decade, with the most significant declines in black-white school segregation only occurring at the end of the 1960s and the start of the 1970s in the aftermath of the Green v. County School Board of New Kent County (1968) court decision.[62]\\r\\nBetween 1965 and 1972, Title VII lacked any strong enforcement provisions. Instead, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission was authorized only to investigate external claims of discrimination. The EEOC could then refer cases to the Justice Department for litigation if reasonable cause was found. The EEOC documented the nature and magnitude of discriminatory employment practices, the first study of this kind done.\\r\\nIn 1972, Congress passed the Equal Employment Opportunity Act. The Act amended Title VII and gave EEOC authority to initiate its own enforcement litigation. The EEOC now played a major role in guiding judicial interpretations of civil rights legislation. The commission was also permitted for the first time to define \\"discrimination,\\" a term excluded from the 1964 Act.[63]\\r\\nThe Constitutionality of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 was, at the time, in some dispute as it applied to the private sector. In the landmark Civil Rights Cases the United States Supreme Court had ruled, in 1883, that Congress did not have the power to prohibit discrimination in the private sector, thus stripping the Civil Rights Act of 1875 of much of its ability to protect civil rights.[64]\\r\\nIn the late 19th and early 20th century, the legal justification for voiding the Civil Rights Act of 1875 was part of a larger trend by members of the United States Supreme Court to invalidate most government regulations of the private sector, except when dealing with laws designed to protect traditional public morality.\\r\\nIn the 1930s, during the New Deal, the majority of the Supreme Court justices gradually shifted their legal theory to allow for greater government regulation of the private sector under the commerce clause, thus paving the way for the Federal government to enact civil rights laws prohibiting both public and private sector discrimination on the basis of the commerce clause.\\r\\nAfter the Civil Rights Act of 1964 was passed, the Supreme Court upheld the law's application to the private sector, on the grounds that Congress has the power to regulate commerce between the States. The landmark case Heart of Atlanta Motel v. United States established the constitutionality of the law, but it did not settle all of the legal questions surrounding the law.\\r\\nIn Phillips v. Martin Marietta Corp., a 1971 Supreme Court case regarding the gender provisions of the Act, the Court ruled that a company could not discriminate against a potential female employee because she had a preschool-age child unless they did the same with potential male employees.[29] A federal court overruled an Ohio state law that barred women from obtaining jobs which required the ability to lift 25 pounds and required women to take lunch breaks when men were not required to.[29] In Pittsburgh Press Co. v. Pittsburgh Commission on Human Relations, the United States Supreme Court decided that printing separate job listings for men and women was illegal, which ended that practice among the country's newspapers. The United States Civil Service Commission ended the practice among federal jobs which designated them \\"women only\\" or \\"men only\\".[29]\\r\\nIn 1974, the Supreme Court also ruled that the San Francisco school district was violating non-English speaking students' rights under the 1964 act by placing them in regular classes rather than providing some sort of accommodation for them.[65]\\r\\nIn 1975, a federal civil rights agency warned a Phoenix, Arizona school that its end-of-year father-son and mother-daughter baseball games were illegal according to the 1964 Civil Rights Act.[29] President Gerald Ford intervened, and the games were allowed to continue.[29]\\r\\nIn 1977, the Supreme Court struck down state minimum height requirements for police officers as violating the Act; women usually could not meet these requirements.[29]\\r\\nOn April 4, 2017, the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit in Chicago, sitting en banc, ruled that Title VII of the Act forbids discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation by a vote of 8ÿ3.[66][67] Over the prior month, panels of both the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit in Atlanta and the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in New York City had reached the opposite conclusion, finding that Title VII sex discrimination does not include claims based on sexual orientation.[68]\\r\\nDespite its lack of influence during its time, the Civil Rights Act of 1964 had considerable impact on later civil rights legislation in the United States. It paved the way for future legislation that was not limited to African American civil rights. The Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990which has been called \\"the most important piece of federal legislation since the Civil Rights Act of 1964\\"was influenced both by the structure and substance of the previous Civil Rights Act of 1964. The act was arguably of equal importance, and \\"draws substantially from the structure of that landmark legislation [Civil Rights Act of 1964]\\". The Americans With Disabilities Act paralleled its landmark predecessor structurally, drawing upon many of the same titles and statutes. For example, \\"Title I of the ADA, which bans employment discrimination by private employers on the basis of disability, parallels Title VII of the Act\\". Similarly, Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act, \\"which proscribes discrimination on the basis of disability in public accommodations, tracks Title II of the 1964 Act while expanding upon the list of public accommodations covered.\\" The Americans with Disabilities Act extended \\"the principle of nondiscrimination to people with disabilities\\",[69] an idea unsought in the United States before the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The Act also influenced later civil rights legislation, such as the Voting Rights Act of 1965 and the Civil Rights Act of 1968, aiding not only African Americans, but also women.","input":"When was the civil rights act of 1964 proposed?"},{"output":"Florida, Louisiana, and South Texas.","context":"Sugarcane, or sugar cane, are several species of tall perennial true grasses of the genus Saccharum, tribe Andropogoneae, native to the warm temperate to tropical regions of South Asia and Melanesia, and used for sugar production. It has stout, jointed, fibrous stalks that are rich in the sugar sucrose, which accumulates in the stalk internodes. The plant is two to six meters (six to twenty feet) tall. All sugar cane species interbreed and the major commercial cultivars are complex hybrids. Sugarcane belongs to the grass family Poaceae, an economically important seed plant family that includes maize, wheat, rice, and sorghum, and many forage crops.\\r\\nSucrose, extracted and purified in specialized mill factories, is used as raw material in the food industry or is fermented to produce ethanol. Ethanol is produced on a large scale by the Brazilian sugarcane industry. Sugarcane is the world's largest crop by production quantity.[1] In 2012, The Food and Agriculture Organization estimates it was cultivated on about 26G106 hectares (6.4G107 acres), in more than 90 countries, with a worldwide harvest of 1.83G109 tonnes (1.80G109 long tons; 2.02G109 short tons). Brazil was the largest producer of sugar cane in the world. The next five major producers, in decreasing amounts of production, were India, China, Thailand, Pakistan, and Mexico.\\r\\nThe world demand for sugar is the primary driver of sugarcane agriculture. Cane accounts for 80% of sugar produced; most of the rest is made from sugar beets. Sugarcane predominantly grows in the tropical and subtropical regions (sugar beets grow in colder temperate regions). Other than sugar, products derived from sugarcane include falernum, molasses, rum, cacha?a (a traditional spirit from Brazil), bagasse, and ethanol. In some regions, people use sugarcane reeds to make pens, mats, screens, and thatch. The young, unexpanded inflorescence of tebu telor is eaten raw, steamed, or toasted, and prepared in various ways in certain island communities of Indonesia.[2]\\r\\nThe Persians, followed by the Greeks, discovered the famous \\"reeds that produce honey without bees\\" in India between the 6th and 4th centuries BC. They adopted and then spread sugarcane agriculture.[3] Merchants began to trade in sugar from India, which was considered a luxury and an expensive spice. In the 18th century AD, sugarcane plantations began in Caribbean, South American, Indian Ocean and Pacific island nations and the need for laborers became a major driver of large human migrations, including slave labor[4] and indentured servants.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSugarcane is a tropical, perennial grass that forms lateral shoots at the base to produce multiple stems, typically three to four?m (10 to 13?ft) high and about 5?cm (2?in) in diameter. The stems grow into cane stalk, which when mature constitutes around 75% of the entire plant. A mature stalk is typically composed of 11ÿ16% fiber, 12ÿ16% soluble sugars, 2ÿ3% nonsugars, and 63ÿ73% water. A sugarcane crop is sensitive to the climate, soil type, irrigation, fertilizers, insects, disease control, varieties, and the harvest period. The average yield of cane stalk is 60ÿ70 tonnes per hectare (24ÿ28?long ton/acre; 27ÿ31?short ton/acre) per year. However, this figure can vary between 30 and 180 tonnes per hectare depending on knowledge and crop management approach used in sugarcane cultivation. Sugarcane is a cash crop, but it is also used as livestock fodder.[6]\\r\\nSugarcane is indigenous to tropical South and Southeast Asia.[8] Different species likely originated in different locations, with Saccharum barberi originating in India and S. edule and S. officinarum in New Guinea.[8] The earliest known production of crystalline sugar began in northern India. The exact date of the first cane sugar production is unclear. The earliest evidence of sugar production comes from ancient Sanskrit and Pali texts.[9]\\r\\nAround the 8th century, Muslim and Arab traders introduced sugar from South Asia to the other parts of the Abbasid Caliphate in the Mediterranean, Mesopotamia, Egypt, North Africa, and Andalusia. By the 10th century, sources state that no village in Mesopotamia did not grow sugarcane.[7] It was among the early crops brought to the Americas by the Spanish, mainly Andalusians, from their fields in the Canary Islands, and the Portuguese from their fields in the Madeira Islands.\\r\\nChristopher Columbus first brought sugarcane to the Caribbean during his second voyage to the Americas; initially to the island of Hispaniola (modern day Haiti and the Dominican Republic). In colonial times, sugar formed one side of the triangle trade of New World raw materials, along with European manufactured goods, and African slaves. Sugar (often in the form of molasses) was shipped from the Caribbean to Europe or New England, where it was used to make rum. The profits from the sale of sugar were then used to purchase manufactured goods, which were then shipped to West Africa, where they were bartered for slaves. The slaves were then brought back to the Caribbean to be sold to sugar planters. The profits from the sale of the slaves were then used to buy more sugar, which was shipped to Europe.\\r\\nFrance found its sugarcane islands so valuable that it effectively traded its portion of Canada, famously dubbed \\"a few acres of snow\\", to Britain for their return of Guadeloupe, Martinique and St. Lucia at the end of the Seven Years' War. The Dutch similarly kept Suriname, a sugar colony in South America, instead of seeking the return of the New Netherlands (New York).\\r\\nBoiling houses in the 17th through 19th centuries converted sugarcane juice into raw sugar. These houses were attached to sugar plantations in the Western colonies. Slaves often ran the boiling process under very poor conditions. Rectangular boxes of brick or stone served as furnaces, with an opening at the bottom to stoke the fire and remove ashes. At the top of each furnace were up to seven copper kettles or boilers, each one smaller and hotter than the previous one. The cane juice began in the largest kettle. The juice was then heated and lime added to remove impurities. The juice was skimmed and then channeled to successively smaller kettles. The last kettle, the \\"teache\\", was where the cane juice became syrup. The next step was a cooling trough, where the sugar crystals hardened around a sticky core of molasses. This raw sugar was then shoveled from the cooling trough into hogsheads (wooden barrels), and from there into the curing house.\\r\\nIn the British Empire, slaves were liberated after 1833 and many would no longer work on sugarcane plantations when they had a choice. British owners of sugarcane plantations therefore needed new workers, and they found cheap labour in China, Portugal and India.[10][11] The people were subject to indenture, a long-established form of contract which bound them to forced labour for a fixed term; apart from the fixed term of servitude, this resembled slavery.[12] The first ships carrying indentured labourers from India left in 1836.[13] The migrations to serve sugarcane plantations led to a significant number of ethnic Indians, southeast Asians and Chinese settling in various parts of the world.[14] In some islands and countries, the South Asian migrants now constitute between 10 and 50 percent of the population. Sugarcane plantations and Asian ethnic groups continue to thrive in countries such as Fiji, Natal, Burma, Sri Lanka, Malaysia, British Guiana, Jamaica, Trinidad, Martinique, French Guiana, Guadeloupe, Grenada, St. Lucia, St. Vincent, St. Kitts, St. Croix, Suriname, Nevis, and Mauritius.[13][15]\\r\\nThe then British colony of Queensland, now a state of Australia, coerced (or \\"blackbirded\\") between 55,000 and 62,500 (estimates vary) people from the South Pacific Islands to work on sugarcane plantations between 1863 and 1900.[16]\\r\\nCuban sugar derived from sugarcane was exported to the USSR, where it received price supports and was ensured a guaranteed market. The 1991 dissolution of the Soviet state forced the closure of most of Cuba's sugar industry.\\r\\nSugarcane remains an important part of the economy of Guyana, Belize, Barbados, and Haiti, along with the Dominican Republic, Guadeloupe, Jamaica, and other islands.\\r\\nAbout 70% of the sugar produced globally comes from S. officinarum and hybrids using this species.[17]\\r\\nSugarcane cultivation requires a tropical or temperate climate, with a minimum of 60?cm (24?in) of annual moisture. It is one of the most efficient photosynthesizers in the plant kingdom. It is a C4 plant, able to convert up to 1% of incident solar energy into biomass.[18] In prime growing regions, such as Mauritius, Dominican Republic, Puerto Rico, India, Guyana, Indonesia, Pakistan, Peru, Brazil, Bolivia, Colombia, Australia, Ecuador, Cuba, the Philippines, El Salvador, Jamaica, and Hawaii, sugarcane crops can produce over 15 kg/m2 of cane. Once a major crop of the southeastern region of the United States, sugarcane cultivation has declined there in recent decades, and is now primarily confined to Florida, Louisiana, and South Texas.\\r\\nSugarcane is cultivated in the tropics and subtropics in areas with a plentiful supply of water for a continuous period of more than six to seven months each year, either from natural rainfall or through irrigation. The crop does not tolerate severe frosts. Therefore, most of the world's sugarcane is grown between 22N and 22S, and some up to 33N and 33S.[19] When sugarcane crop is found outside this range, such as the Natal region of South Africa, it is normally due to anomalous climatic conditions in the region, such as warm ocean currents that sweep down the coast. In terms of altitude, sugarcane crop is found up to 1,600 metres or 5,200 feet close to the equator in countries such as Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru.[20]\\r\\nSugarcane can be grown on many soils ranging from highly fertile well-drained mollisols, through heavy cracking vertisols, infertile acid oxisols, peaty histosols, to rocky andisols. Both plentiful sunshine and water supplies increase cane production. This has made desert countries with good irrigation facilities such as Egypt some of the highest-yielding sugarcane-cultivating regions.\\r\\nAlthough some sugarcanes produce seeds, modern stem cutting has become the most common reproduction method.[21] Each cutting must contain at least one bud, and the cuttings are sometimes hand-planted. In more technologically advanced countries like the United States and Australia, billet planting is common. Billets harvested from a mechanical harvester are planted by a machine that opens and recloses the ground. Once planted, a stand can be harvested several times; after each harvest, the cane sends up new stalks, called ratoons. Successive harvests give decreasing yields, eventually justifying replanting. Two to 10 harvests are usually made depending on the type of culture. In a country with a mechanical agriculture looking for a high production of large fields, like in North America, sugar canes are replanted after two or three harvests to avoid a lowering in yields. In countries with a more traditional type of agriculture with smaller fields and hand harvesting, like in the French island la Runion, sugar canes are often harvested up to 10 years before replanting.\\r\\nSugarcane is harvested by hand and mechanically. Hand harvesting accounts for more than half of production, and is dominant in the developing world. In hand harvesting, the field is first set on fire. The fire burns dry leaves, and chases away or kills any lurking venomous snakes, without harming the stalks and roots. Harvesters then cut the cane just above ground-level using cane knives or machetes. A skilled harvester can cut 500?kg (1,100?lb) of sugarcane per hour.[citation needed]\\r\\nMechanical harvesting uses a combine, or sugarcane harvester.[22] The Austoft 7000 series, the original modern harvester design, has now been copied by other companies, including Cameco?/?John Deere.[citation needed] The machine cuts the cane at the base of the stalk, strips the leaves, chops the cane into consistent lengths and deposits it into a transporter following alongside. The harvester then blows the trash back onto the field. Such machines can harvest 100 long tons (100?t) each hour; however, harvested cane must be rapidly processed. Once cut, sugarcane begins to lose its sugar content, and damage to the cane during mechanical harvesting accelerates this decline. This decline is offset because a modern chopper harvester can complete the harvest faster and more efficiently than hand cutting and loading. Austoft also developed a series of hydraulic high-lift infield transporters to work alongside their harvesters to allow even more rapid transfer of cane to, for example, the nearest railway siding. This mechanical harvesting doesn't require the field to be set on fire; the remains left in the field by the machine consist of the top of the sugar cane and the dead leaves, which act as mulch for the next round of planting.\\r\\nThe cane beetle (also known as cane grub) can substantially reduce crop yield by eating roots; it can be controlled with imidacloprid (Confidor) or chlorpyrifos (Lorsban). Other important pests are the larvae of some butterfly/moth species, including the turnip moth, the sugarcane borer (Diatraea saccharalis), the Mexican rice borer (Eoreuma loftini); leaf-cutting ants, termites, spittlebugs (especially Mahanarva fimbriolata and Deois flavopicta), and the beetle Migdolus fryanus. The planthopper insect Eumetopina flavipes acts as a virus vector, which causes the sugarcane disease ramu stunt.[23]\\r\\nNumerous pathogens infect sugarcane, such as sugarcane grassy shoot disease caused by Phytoplasma, whiptail disease or sugarcane smut, pokkah boeng caused by Fusarium moniliforme, Xanthomonas axonopodis bacteria causes Gumming Disease, and red rot disease caused by Colletotrichum falcatum. Viral diseases affecting sugarcane include sugarcane mosaic virus, maize streak virus, and sugarcane yellow leaf virus.\\r\\nSome sugarcane varieties are capable of fixing atmospheric nitrogen in association with the bacterium Gluconacetobacter diazotrophicus.[24] Unlike legumes and other nitrogen-fixing plants that form root nodules in the soil in association with bacteria, G. diazotrophicus lives within the intercellular spaces of the sugarcane's stem.[25][26] Coating seeds with the bacteria is a newly developed technology that can enable every crop species to fix nitrogen for its own use.[27]\\r\\nAt least 20,000 people are estimated to have died of chronic kidney disease (CKD) in Central America in the past two decades ÿ most of them sugar cane workers along the Pacific coast. This may be due to working long hours in the heat without adequate fluid intake.[28]\\r\\nTraditionally, sugarcane processing requires two stages. Mills extract raw sugar from freshly harvested cane and \\"mill-white sugar is sometimes produced immediately after the first stage at sugar-extraction mills, intended for local consumption. Sugar crystals appear naturally white in color during the crystallization process. Sulfur dioxide is added to inhibit the formation of color-inducing molecules as well as to stabilize the sugar juices during evaporation.[29][30] Refineries, often located nearer to consumers in North America, Europe, and Japan, then produce refined white sugar, which is 99 percent sucrose. These two stages are slowly merging. Increasing affluence in the sugar-producing tropics increased demand for refined sugar products, driving a trend toward combined milling and refining.\\r\\nSugarcane processing produces cane sugar (sucrose) from sugarcane. Other products of the processing include bagasse, molasses, and filtercake.\\r\\nBagasse, the residual dry fiber of the cane after cane juice has been extracted, is used for several purposes:[31]\\r\\nThe primary use of bagasse and bagasse residue is as a fuel source for the boilers in the generation of process steam in sugar plants. Dried filtercake is used as an animal feed supplement, fertilizer, and source of sugarcane wax.\\r\\nMolasses is produced in two forms: Blackstrap, which has a characteristic strong flavor, and a purer molasses syrup. Blackstrap molasses is sold as a food and dietary supplement. It is also a common ingredient in animal feed, is used to produce ethanol and rum, and in the manufacturing of citric acid. Purer molasses syrups are sold as molasses, and may also be blended with maple syrup, invert sugars, or corn syrup. Both forms of molasses are used in baking.\\r\\nSugar refining further purifies the raw sugar. It is first mixed with heavy syrup and then centrifuged in a process called \\"affination\\". Its purpose is to wash away the sugar crystals' outer coating, which is less pure than the crystal interior. The remaining sugar is then dissolved to make a syrup, about 60 percent solids by weight.\\r\\nThe sugar solution is clarified by the addition of phosphoric acid and calcium hydroxide, which combine to precipitate calcium phosphate. The calcium phosphate particles entrap some impurities and absorb others, and then float to the top of the tank, where they can be skimmed off. An alternative to this \\"phosphatation\\" technique is \\"carbonatation\\", which is similar, but uses carbon dioxide and calcium hydroxide to produce a calcium carbonate precipitate.\\r\\nAfter filtering any remaining solids, the clarified syrup is decolorized by filtration through activated carbon. Bone char or coal-based activated carbon is traditionally used in this role.[32] Some remaining color-forming impurities adsorb to the carbon. The purified syrup is then concentrated to supersaturation and repeatedly crystallized in a vacuum, to produce white refined sugar. As in a sugar mill, the sugar crystals are separated from the molasses by centrifuging.[33] Additional sugar is recovered by blending the remaining syrup with the washings from affination and again crystallizing to produce brown sugar. When no more sugar can be economically recovered, the final molasses still contains 20ÿ30 percent sucrose and 15ÿ25 percent glucose and fructose.\\r\\nTo produce granulated sugar, in which individual grains do not clump, sugar must be dried, first by heating in a rotary dryer, and then by blowing cool air through it for several days.\\r\\nRibbon cane is a subtropical type that was once widely grown in the southern United States, as far north as coastal North Carolina. The juice was extracted with horse or mule-powered crushers; the juice was boiled, like maple syrup, in a flat pan, and then used in the syrup form as a food sweetener.[34] It is not currently a commercial crop, but a few growers find ready sales for their product.[citation needed]\\r\\nParticulate matter, combustion products, and volatile organic compounds are the primary pollutants emitted during the sugarcane processing.[31] Combustion products include nitrogen oxides (NOX), carbon monoxide (CO), CO2, and sulfur oxides (SOX). Potential emission sources include the sugar granulators, sugar conveying and packaging equipment, bulk loadout operations, boilers, granular carbon and char regeneration kilns, regenerated adsorbent transport systems, kilns and handling equipment (at some facilities), carbonation tanks, multi-effect evaporator stations, and vacuum boiling pans. Modern pollution prevention technologies are capable of addressing all of these potential pollutants.[citation needed]\\r\\nSource: Food And Agricultural Organization of United Nations: Economic And Social Department: The Statistical Division\\r\\nBrazil led the world in sugarcane production in 2013 with a 739,267 TMT harvest.[1] India was the second largest producer with 341,200 TMT tons, and China the third largest producer with 125,536 TMT tons harvest.\\r\\nThe average worldwide yield of sugarcane crops in 2013 was 70.77 tons per hectare.[1] The most productive farms in the world were in Peru with a nationwide average sugarcane crop yield of 133.71 tons per hectare.\\r\\nThe theoretical possible yield for sugar cane, according to 1983 study of Duke, is about 280 metric tons per hectare per year, and small experimental plots in Brazil have demonstrated yields of 236ÿ280 metric tons of fresh cane per hectare.[35][36] The most promising region for high yield sugarcane production were in sun drenched, irrigated farms of northern Africa, and other deserts with plentiful water from river or irrigation canals.\\r\\nIn the United States, sugarcane is grown commercially in Florida, Hawaii, Louisiana, and Texas.[37]\\r\\nBrazil uses sugarcane to produce sugar and ethanol for gasoline-ethanol blends (gasohol), a locally popular transportation fuel. In India, sugarcane is used to produce sugar, jaggery and alcoholic beverages.\\r\\nEthanol is generally available as a byproduct of sugar production. It can be used as a biofuel alternative to gasoline, and is widely used in cars in Brazil. It is an alternative to gasoline, and may become the primary product of sugarcane processing, rather than sugar.\\r\\nIn Brazil, gasoline is required to contain at least 22 percent bioethanol.[38] This bioethanol is sourced from Brazil's large sugarcane crop.\\r\\nThe production of ethanol from sugar cane is more energy efficient than from corn or sugar beets or palm/vegetable oils, particularly if cane bagasse is used to produce heat and power for the process. Furthermore, if biofuels are used for crop production and transport, the fossil energy input needed for each ethanol energy unit can be very low. EIA estimates that with an integrated sugar cane to ethanol technology, the well-to-wheels CO2 emissions can be 90 percent lower than conventional gasoline.[38]\\r\\nA textbook on renewable energy[39] describes the energy transformation:\\r\\nPresently, 75 tons of raw sugar cane are produced annually per hectare in Brazil. The cane delivered to the processing plant is called burned and cropped (b&c), and represents 77% of the mass of the raw cane. The reason for this reduction is that the stalks are separated from the leaves (which are burned and whose ashes are left in the field as fertilizer), and from the roots that remain in the ground to sprout for the next crop. Average cane production is, therefore, 58 tons of b&c per hectare per year.\\r\\nEach ton of b&c yields 740 kg of juice (135 kg of sucrose and 605 kg of water) and 260 kg of moist bagasse (130 kg of dry bagasse). Since the lower heating value of sucrose is 16.5 MJ/kg, and that of the bagasse is 19.2 MJ/kg, the total heating value of a ton of b&c is 4.7 GJ of which 2.2 GJ come from the sucrose and 2.5 from the bagasse.\\r\\nPer hectare per year, the biomass produced corresponds to 0.27 TJ. This is equivalent to 0.86 W per square meter. Assuming an average insolation of 225 W per square meter, the photosynthetic efficiency of sugar cane is 0.38%.\\r\\nThe 135 kg of sucrose found in 1 ton of b&c are transformed into 70 litres of ethanol with a combustion energy of 1.7 GJ. The practical sucrose-ethanol conversion efficiency is, therefore, 76% (compare with the theoretical 97%).\\r\\nOne hectare of sugar cane yields 4,000 litres of ethanol per year (without any additional energy input, because the bagasse produced exceeds the amount needed to distill the final product). This, however, does not include the energy used in tilling, transportation, and so on. Thus, the solar energy-to-ethanol conversion efficiency is 0.13%.\\r\\nSugarcane is a major crop in many countries. It is one of the plants with the highest bioconversion efficiency. Sugarcane crop is able to efficiently fix solar energy, yielding some 55 tonnes of dry matter per hectare of land annually. After harvest, the crop produces sugar juice and bagasse, the fibrous dry matter. This dry matter is biomass with potential as fuel for energy production. Bagasse can also be used as an alternative source of pulp for paper production.[40]\\r\\nSugarcane bagasse is a potentially abundant source of energy for large producers of sugarcane, such as Brazil, India and China. According to one report, with use of latest technologies, bagasse produced annually in Brazil has the potential of meeting 20 percent of Brazils energy consumption by 2020.[41]\\r\\nA number of countries, in particular those devoid of any fossil fuel, have implemented energy conservation and efficiency measures to minimize energy used in cane processing and furthermore export any excess electricity to the grid. Bagasse is usually burned to produce steam, which in turn creates electricity. Current technologies, such as those in use in Mauritius, produce over 100 kWh of electricity per tonne of bagasse. With a total world harvest of over 1 billion tonnes of sugar cane per year, the global energy potential from bagasse is over 100,000 GWh.[42] Using Mauritius as a reference, an annual potential of 10,000 GWh of additional electricity could be produced throughout Africa.[43] Electrical generation from bagasse could become quite important, particularly to the rural populations of sugarcane producing nations.\\r\\nRecent cogeneration technology plants are being designed to produce from 200 to over 300 kWh of electricity per tonne of bagasse.[44][45] As sugarcane is a seasonal crop, shortly after harvest the supply of bagasse would peak, requiring power generation plants to strategically manage the storage of bagasse.\\r\\nA greener alternative to burning bagasse for the production of electricity is to convert bagasse into biogas. Technologies are being developed to use enzymes to transform bagasse into advanced biofuel and biogas.[41]\\r\\nIn yurveda, the Indian system of medicine, the sugarcane is most commonly known in Sanskrit as Ik?u, having characteristics such as improving strength and acting as an aphrodisiac. It has the following synonyms: Dؐrghachada, Bhrirasa, Gu?amla, Asipatra, Madhut??a. These synonyms, along with its main varieties and characteristics are described in nigha??us such as the Bhvaprak?a (1.6.23, group of sugarcanes). The juice of the sugarcane is known as Ph?ita.[46]\\r\\nIn most countries where sugarcane is cultivated, there are several foods and popular dishes derived directly from it, such as:\\r\\nIndustry organizations:","input":"Where is sugar cane grown in the usa?"},{"output":"60 feet 6 inches","context":"A baseball field, also called a ball field, sandlot or a baseball diamond, is the field upon which the game of baseball is played. The term can also be used as a metonym for a baseball park.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe starting point for much of the action on the field is home plate (officially \\"home base\\"), which is a five-sided slab of whitened rubber, 17 inches (43?cm) square with two of the corners removed so that one edge is 17 inches long, two adjacent sides are 8.5 inches (22?cm) and the remaining two sides are 12 inches (30?cm) and set at an angle to make a point. The plate is set into the ground such that its surface is level with the surrounding ground. Adjacent to each of the two parallel 8.5-inch sides is a batter's box. The point of home plate where the two 12-inch sides meet at right angles is at one corner of a 90-foot (27.43?m) square. The other three corners of the square, in counterclockwise order from home plate, are called first, second, and third base. Three canvas or rubber bases 15 inches (38?cm) square and 3ÿ5 inches (7.6ÿ12.7?cm) in thickness made of soft material mark the three bases.\\r\\n\\r\\nNear the center of the square is an artificial hill known as the pitcher's mound, atop which is a white rubber slab known as the pitcher's plate, colloquially the \\"rubber.\\" The specifications for the pitcher's mound are described below.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll the bases, including home plate, lie entirely within fair territory. Thus, any batted ball that touches those bases must necessarily be in fair territory. While the first and third base bags are placed so that they lie inside the 90-foot square formed by the bases, the second base bag is placed so that its center (unlike first, third and home) coincides exactly with the \\"point\\" of the ninety-foot square. Thus, although the \\"points\\" of the bases are 90 feet apart, the physical distance between each successive pair of base markers is closer to 88 feet (26.8?m).[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe lines from home plate to first and third bases extend to the nearest fence, stand or other obstruction and are called the foul lines. The portion of the playing field between (and including) the foul lines is fair territory; the rest is \\"foul territory.\\" The area within the square formed by the bases is officially called the infield, though colloquially this term also includes fair territory in the vicinity of the square; fair territory outside the infield is known as the outfield. Most baseball fields are enclosed with a fence that marks the outer edge of the outfield. The fence is usually set at a distance ranging from 300 to 420 feet (90 to 130?m) from home plate. Most professional and college baseball fields have a right and left foul pole. These poles are at the intersection of the foul lines and the respective ends of the outfield fence and, unless otherwise specified within the ground rules, lie in fair territory. Thus, a batted ball that passes over the outfield wall in flight and touches the foul pole is a fair ball and the batter is awarded a home run.\\r\\n\\r\\nFirst base is the first of four bases that must be touched by a player on the batting team in order to score a run. Unlike when an offensive player reaches second or third base, it is permissible for a batter-runner to overrun first base without being in jeopardy of being put out. After contact is made with the base, the batter-runner may slow down and return to first base at his leisure, so long as he makes no move or attempt to advance to second base.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first baseman is the defensive player responsible for the area near first base. A professional first baseman is often a slow runner and tall.[citation needed]  A tall first baseman presents a large target to which other fielders can throw, and his height gives him a larger range in reaching and catching errant throws. Players who are left-handed are marginally preferable for first base because: first, it is easier for a left-handed fielder to catch a pick-off throw from the pitcher and tag the baserunner; and, second, it is easier for a left handed thrower to make the throw to second base to start a 3ÿ6ÿ3, 3ÿ6ÿ4, or a 3ÿ6ÿ1 double play.[citation needed] Also, a right-handed first baseman must, when setting himself up to receive a throw from an infielder, execute a half-pivot near the base; this is a move that a left-hander need not make (this advantage is very marginal, however). There are three infield positions that can only effectively be occupied by right-handed players: 2nd base, 3rd base, and shortstop. This is because of the time it takes to pivot and set to throw. It takes a left-handed thrower more time to make that pivot and in the fast-paced major league game, that time is critical. As a result, there are fewer positions a left-handed player can occupy, and if that player is not fast, the outfield may not be a good fit.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the numbering system used to record defensive plays, the first baseman is assigned the number 3.\\r\\n\\r\\nSecond base is the second of four stations on a baseball diamond which must be touched in succession by a base runner in order to score a run for that player's team. Second base is typically defended by the second baseman and the shortstop. Second base is also known as the keystone sack. A runner on second base is said to be in \\"scoring position,\\" owing to the high likelihood of reaching home plate and scoring a run from second base on most base hits. Since second is the farthest base from home plate, it is the most common target of base stealing.\\r\\n\\r\\nIdeally, the second baseman and shortstop possess quick hands and feet and the ability to release the ball rapidly and with accuracy. One will usually cover second base when the other attempts to field the ball. Both players must communicate well to be able to make a double play. Particular agility is required of the second baseman in double play situations, which usually forces the player to throw towards first while his momentum carries him in the opposite direction. In the numbering system used to record defensive plays, the second baseman is assigned the number 4, and the shortstop 6.\\r\\n\\r\\nThird base is the third of four bases a base runner must touch in a counterclockwise succession in order to score a run. Many batted balls that result in the batter being put out (such as a sacrifice fly) may nevertheless allow a runner to reach home plate and score a run from third base, provided that the third and final out is not recorded before he can do so. A runner on third base is therefore particularly valuable to the batting team when fewer than two outs have been recorded.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe third baseman is the defensive player whose responsibility is to defend the area nearest to third base. A third baseman ideally possesses quick reaction to batted balls and a strong arm to make the long throw to first base. The distance from 3rd to 1st is about 127 feet (39?m). In the numbering system used to record defensive plays, the third baseman is assigned the number 5.\\r\\n\\r\\nHome plate, formally designated home base in the rules, is the final base that a player must touch to score. Unlike the other bases, home plate is a five-sided slab of whitened rubber that is set at ground level. The use of rubber was developed by Robert Keating, who pitched one game for the 1887 Baltimore Orioles. Previouslyand more dangerouslythe plate was made of stone, iron, or wood.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe dimensions of home plate are 17 inches (43?cm) across the front, 8.5 inches (22?cm) down each side, with a triangular rear of two sides of 12 inches (30?cm). The rear edges are at 45 degrees to the sides, making a point at the back.[1] The plate is white and surrounded by a black strip 3?4 inch (1.9?cm) in width. The plate sits entirely in \\"fair\\" territory, with the two rear edges aligned with the right and left field foul lines. The length and angle requirements for home plate mandate that it is not a regular pentagon; it is a 17 by 8.5 inches rectangle with an isosceles triangle of base 17 inches and equal sides of 12 inches attached to the back.\\r\\n\\r\\n50 to 100 feet (15 to 30 meters) behind home plate is the backstop, which is a wall/fence that will stop wild pitches, passed balls, and foul balls. In enclosed stadiums, the backstop is often composed of a lower part, which is like any other part of the wall, and an upper netting to protect spectators seated behind it; in recreational baseball fields, there is usually a tall chain-link fence, including an angled top section, composing the entire backstop.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe batter's box is the place where the batter stands when ready to receive a pitch from the pitcher. It is usually drawn in chalk on the dirt surrounding home plate, and the insides of the boxes are watered down before each game.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe chalk lines delineating the two foul lines are rarely extended through the batter's boxes. However, those lines exist conceptually for the purpose of judging a batted ball fair or foul. In addition, inside edges of the batter's boxes are often not laid-in with chalk. Similarly, though not marked, those lines continue to exist for the purpose of the rules pertaining to the batter's box and the batter's position relative thereto.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are two batter's boxes, one on each side of home plate. The batter's boxes are 4 feet (1.22?m) wide and 6 feet (1.83?m) long. The batter's boxes are centered lengthwise at the center of home plate with the inside line of each batter's box 6 inches (15?cm) from the near edge of home plate. A right-handed batter would stand in the batter's box on the left side of home plate from the perspective of the catcher and umpire. A left-handed batter would stand in the batter's box to their right. A batter may only occupy one batter's box at a time and may not legally leave the batter's box after the pitcher has come set or has started his windup. Should the batter wish to leave the batter's box once the pitcher has engaged the rubber, he must first ask the umpire for time-out. Time will not be granted if the pitcher has already started his pitching motion. For playing rules relating to the batter's box, see Rules 6.05 and 6.06 of the Official Baseball Rules.\\r\\n\\r\\nFoul poles, if present, help umpires judge whether a fly ball hit above the fence line is foul (out of play) or fair (a home run). The poles are a vertical extension of the foul lines at the edge of the field of play. The outer edge of the foul lines and foul poles define foul territory. Both the lines and the poles are in fair territory, in contrast to American football and basketball, where the lines marking the playing boundaries are out of bounds. The minimum distance to hit a home run (along either foul line) is set by baseball rules, generally at 325 feet (99?m).[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore 1920,[citation needed] the foul lines extended indefinitely; a batter was awarded a home run only if a fly ball out of the field was fair where it landed, or \\"when last seen\\" by the umpire. Now, a batted ball that leaves the field in flight is judged fair or foul at the point it leaves the field. Thus, such a fly ball passing on the fair side of a foul pole, or hitting a foul pole, is a home run regardless of where the ball goes thereafter.\\r\\n\\r\\nFoul poles are typically much higher than the top of the outfield fence or wall, and often have a narrow screen running along the fair side of the pole. This further aids the umpires' judgment, as a ball that bounces off this screen is a home run. It can still be a difficult call, especially in ballparks with no outfield stands behind the poles to provide perspective. Wrigley Field is notorious for arguments over long, curving flies down a foul line (most notably in left field) that sail higher than the foul pole.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt Major League Baseball fields, foul poles are usually yellow. Those at Citi Field are orange. At the Rogers Centre, there are no foul poles, but large nets suspended from the roof that serve the same purpose. At Petco Park, there is no foul pole in left field; the pole's function is served by a yellow metal strip along the corner of the Western Metal Supply Co. building.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn roughly the middle of the square, equidistant between first and third base, and a few feet closer to home plate than to second base, is a low artificial hill called the pitcher's mound. This is where the pitcher stands when throwing the pitch. Atop the mound is a white rubber slab, called the pitcher's plate or pitcher's rubber. It measures 6 inches (15?cm) front-to-back and 2 feet (61?cm) across, the front of which is exactly 60?feet 6?inches (18.44?m) from the rear point of home plate. This peculiar distance was set by the rule makers in 1893, not due to a clerical or surveying error as popular myth has it, but intentionally (further details under History).\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Major League Baseball, a regulation mound is 18 feet (5.5?m) in diameter, with the center 59 feet (18?m) from the rear point of home plate, on the line between home plate and second base. The front edge of the pitcher's plate or rubber is 18 inches (46?cm) behind the center of the mound, making the front edge's midpoint 60 feet 6 inches from the rear point of home plate. Six inches (15?cm) in front of the pitcher's rubber the mound begins to slope downward. The top of the rubber is to be no higher than ten inches (25?cm) above home plate. From 1903 through 1968, this height limit was set at 15 inches (38?cm), but was often slightly higher, sometimes as high as 20 inches (51?cm), especially for teams that emphasized pitching, such as the Los Angeles Dodgers, who were reputed to have the highest mound in the majors.\\r\\n\\r\\nA pitcher will push off the rubber with his foot in order to gain velocity toward home plate when pitching. In addition, a higher mound generally favors the pitcher. With the height advantage, the pitcher gains more leverage and can put more downward velocity on the ball, making it more difficult for the batter to strike the ball squarely with the bat. The lowering of the mound in 1969 was intended to \\"increase the batting\\" once again, as pitching had become increasingly dominant, reaching its peak the prior year; 1968 is known among baseball historians as \\"The Year of the Pitcher.\\" This restrictive rule apparently did its job, contributing to the hitting surge of modern baseball.\\r\\n\\r\\nA pitcher's mound is difficult for groundskeepers to maintain. Usually before every game it is watered down to keep the dust from spreading. On youth and amateur baseball fields, the mound may be much different from the rule book definition due to erosion and repair attempts. Even in the major leagues, each mound gains its own character, as pitchers are allowed to kick away pieces of dirt in their way, thereby sculpting the mound a bit to their preference.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe pitcher may keep a rosin bag on the rear of the mound to dry off his hands. Major League Baseball teams are also permitted cleat cleaners on the back of the mound. This may be a flat grate-style plate, or simply a hand tool such as a piece of wood used to remove mud and dirt from cleats. These items are allowed to remain on the backside of the mound at the discretion of the umpire, thus reducing the probability that they will affect a live play.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nA baseline is the straight line between two adjacent bases. Baselines are not drawn on the field, although the foul lines serve to mark the baseline between home plate and first base, and between third base and home.\\r\\n\\r\\nGenerally, base runners are not required to follow the baseline. A base runner seeking to advance more than one base typically \\"rounds\\" the base, following a more circular path. However, a base runner's left-right motion is constrained when the defense tries to tag him. At the moment the defense begins the attempt, the baserunner's running baseline is established as a direct line from his current position to the base he is trying for. A runner straying more than three feet (1?m) away from this baseline to avoid a tag may be called out.\\r\\n\\r\\nBeginning halfway between home and first base, and ending at first base, there is a second chalk line to the right of the foul line. This second line and the part of the foul line it runs parallel to, form the running lane that defines the path in which a batter-runner must run as he is advancing to first base. Rule 6.05(k) of the Official Baseball Rules states that, if a batter-runner running to first base runs outside the running lane, and \\"in doing so\\" interferes with the fielder taking the throw at first, then the batter-runner is automatically out. First base itself is not located in the running lane, but Rule 6.05 lets the batter-runner leave the running lane \\"by means of a step, stride or slide in the immediate vicinity of first base\\" to step on first base.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\n The grass line, where the dirt of the infield ends and the grass of the outfield begins, has no special significance to the rules of the game, but it can influence the outcome of a game. Dirt running paths between the bases (and, at one time and still in some parks, between the pitcher and the catcher) have existed since the beginning of the game, although they were not mentioned in the rule books until around 1950, and their specifications are flexible. In addition to providing a running path, the grass lines act as a visual aid so that players, umpires and fans may better judge distance from the center of the diamond. Occasionally the ball may take a tricky bounce off the dirt area or the edge between the dirt and the grass. Multiple World Series championships (including 1924, 1960 and 1986) have been decided or heavily influenced by erratic hops of ground balls.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn artificial turf stadiums, infield dirt was originally only placed around the bases and around the pitcher's and batting areas, which are referred to as \\"sliding pits.\\"  In this configuration, the \\"grass line\\" is usually designated with a white arc. Among Major League Baseball fields, Rogers Centre was the last stadium to maintain this type of configuration and was reconfigured with a full dirt infield starting in the 2016 MLB season.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn some college baseball parks with artificial turf fields, the entire field (along with possibly the pitcher's mound) is made up of turf, with parts of the field mainly containing dirt instead merely being clay-colored turf.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe outfield is made from thick grass or artificial turf. It is where the outfielders play. The positions to play in the outfield are right, center, and left field (named in relation to the batter's position; thus left field is beyond third base and right field is beyond first base). Outfields vary in size and shape depending on the overall size and shape of the playing field. The outfield stretches from the infield to the outfield wall and it contains the warning track. Outfields especially vary from Little League to Major League fields. Little League outfields vary more in size than Major League outfields. Outfields often differ from infields in the specific type of grass used, but most Major League outfields are grass.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe warning track is the strip of dirt at the edges of the baseball field (especially in front of the home run fence and along the left and right sides of a field). Because the warning track's color and feel differ from the grass field, a fielder can remain focused on a fly ball near the fence and measure his proximity to the fence while attempting to catch the ball safely.\\r\\n\\r\\nA warning track's width is not specified in the rules. It is generally designed to give about three steps of warning to the highest-level players using the field. Typical widths run from about six feet for Little League fields to about 10ÿ15 feet (3.0ÿ4.6 meters) for college- or professional-level play. A warning track this wide also lets groundskeepers avoid driving maintenance vehicles on the grass.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe track can be composed of finely ground rock particles such as cinders, which is why announcer Bob Wolff called it the \\"cinder path\\" rather than the \\"warning track.\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe idea of a warning track originated in Yankee Stadium, where an actual running track was built for use in track and field events. When ballpark designers saw how the track helped fielders, it soon became a feature of every ballpark.\\r\\n\\r\\nSingle-minded fielders often crash into a wall trying to make a catch despite the warning track. For this reason, outfield walls are typically padded for extra safety. Wrigley Field's brick wall is covered only by ivy, which is not especially soft. However, there are pads on the walls of the tight left and right field corners in foul ground.\\r\\n\\r\\nWarning-track power is a derogatory term for a batter who seems to have just enough power to hit the ball to the warning track for an out, but not enough to hit a home run. The term more generally refers to someone or something that is almost but not quite good enough for something.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe outfield wall or outfield fence is the wall or fence that marks the outer boundary of the outfield. A ball passing over the wall is dead; if it passes over the wall in fair territory while in flight, it is a home run. The official rules do not specify the shape, height, or composition of the wall, or a specific mandatory distance from home plate (though Major League Baseball mandates a minimum distance of 250 feet (76?m) and recommends a minimum distance of 320 feet (98?m) at the foul poles and 400 feet (120?m) at center field). As a result, baseball fields can vary greatly along those lines. The wall has numbers affixed or painted on it that denote the distance from that point on the wall to home plate. In most modern major league ballparks, the wall is made of some hard material (e.g., concrete, plywood, sheet metal) with padding on the field side to protect players who may collide with the wall at high speed while trying to make a play. Chain link fencing may also be incorporated into the wall in areas where the wall needs to be transparent, e.g., an outfield bullpen, a spectator area behind the wall, or to protect a scoreboard incorporated into the wall. Many ballparks feature a yellow line denoting the top of the wall to aid umpires in judging whether the ball passed over the wall or if the ball is fair or foul.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe bullpen (sometimes referred to as simply \\"the 'pen\\") is the area where pitchers warm up before entering a game. Depending on the ballpark, it may be situated in foul territory along the baselines or just beyond the outfield fence. Relief pitchers usually wait in the bullpen when they have yet to play in a game, rather than in the dugout with the rest of the team. The starting pitcher also makes his final pregame warmups in the bullpen. Managers can call coaches in the bullpen on an in-house telephone from the dugout to tell a certain pitcher to begin his warmup tosses.\\r\\n\\"Bullpen\\" is also used metonymically to describe a team's collection of relief pitchers.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are two on-deck circles in the field, one for each team, positioned in foul ground between home plate and the respective teams' benches. They are technically known as next-batter's boxes. The on-deck circle is where the next scheduled batter, or \\"on-deck\\" batter, warms up while waiting for the current batter to finish his turn. The on-deck circle is either an area composed of bare dirt; a plain circle painted onto artificial turf; or often, especially at the professional level, a mat made from artificial material, with the team or league logo painted onto it.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe coach's boxes, located behind first and third base, are where the first and third base coaches are supposed to stand, although coaches often stand outside the box. This is permissible as long as the coach does not interfere with play and the opposing team does not object (in which case the umpire shall ensure that all coaches on both teams must abide by the boundaries of the coach's boxes). The coach's boxes are marked with chalk or paint. In the early days of baseball, the term \\"coacher's box\\" was used, as \\"coach\\" was taken to be a verb. As the term \\"coach\\" evolved into a noun, the name of the box also changed.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe basic layout of the diamond has been little changed since the original Knickerbocker Rules of the 1840s. The distance between bases was already established as 90 feet (27.43?m), which it remains to this day. Through trial and error, 90 feet had been settled upon as the optimal distance. 100 feet would have given too much advantage to the defense, and 80 feet too much to the offense.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe original Knickerbocker Rules did not specify the pitching distance explicitly. By the time major league baseball began in the 1870s, the pitcher was compelled to pitch from within a \\"box\\" whose front edge was 45 feet (14?m) from the \\"point\\" of home plate. Although he had to release the ball before crossing the line, as with bowlers in cricket, he also had to start his delivery from within the box; he could not run in from the field as bowlers do. Furthermore, the pitcher had to throw underhand. By the 1880s, pitchers had mastered the underhand deliveryin fact, in 1880, there were two perfect games within a week of each other.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn an attempt to \\"increase the batting,\\" the front edge of the pitcher's box was moved back 5 feet in 1881, to 50 feet (15?m) from home plate. The size of the box was altered over the following few years. Pitchers were allowed to throw overhand starting in 1884, and that tilted the balance of power again. In 1887, the box was set at 4 feet (1.2?m) wide and 5.5 feet (1.7?m) deep, with the front edge still 50 feet from the plate. However, the pitcher was compelled to deliver the ball with his back foot at the 55.5-foot (16.9?m) line of the box, thus somewhat restricting his ability to \\"power\\" the ball with his overhand delivery.[10]:96\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1893, the box was replaced by the pitcher's plate, although \\"the box\\" is still used today as a slang term for the pitcher's location on the field. Exactly 5 feet was added to the point the pitcher had to toe, again \\"to increase the batting\\" (and hopefully to increase attendance, as fan interest had flagged somewhat), resulting in the seemingly peculiar pitching distance of 60.5 feet (18.44?m).[10]:230\\r\\n\\r\\nMany sources suggest that the pitching distance evolved from 45 to 50 to 60.5 feet. However, the first two were the \\"release point\\" and the third is the \\"pushoff point,\\" so the 1893 increase was not quite as dramatic as is often implied; that is, the 1893 rule change added only 5 feet to the release point, not 10.5 feet.\\r\\n\\r\\nOriginally the pitcher threw from flat ground, but over time the raised mound was developed, somewhat returning the advantage to the pitchers. Before the mid-20th century, it was common for baseball fields to include a dirt pathway between the pitcher's mound and home plate. This feature is sometimes known as the \\"keyhole\\" due to the shape that it makes together with the mound. The keyhole was once as wide as the pitcher's box and resembled a cricket pitch. Sometimes this path extended through the batting area and all the way to the backstop. Once the rounded pitcher's mound was developed, the path became more ornamental than practical, and was gradually thinned before being largely abandoned by the 1950s. In recent years some ballparks, such as Comerica Park and Chase Field in the major leagues, have revived the feature for nostalgic reasons.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Sports Turf Managers Association (STMA) presents various awards each year. Starting in 2001, its Sports Turf Manager of the Year Awards have been presented annually in the Triple-A, Double-A, Class A, and Short-Season/Rookie divisions of Minor League Baseball and are chosen from the 16 league winners.[11] STMA also presents the Baseball Field of the Year Award, which includes Schools and Parks, College/University and Professional categories.[12]","input":"How far is the pitcher's mound from home plate in mlb?"},{"output":"Jamestown, Virginia","context":"The British colonization of the Americas (including colonization by both the English and the Scots) began in 1607 in Jamestown, Virginia and reached its peak when colonies had been established throughout the Americas. The British were among the most important colonizers of the Americas, and their American empire came to rival the Spanish American colonies in military and economic might.\\r\\nThree types of colonies existed in the British Empire in America during the height of its power in the 18th Century. These were charter colonies, proprietary colonies and royal colonies. A group of 13 British American colonies collectively broke from the British Empire in the 1770s through a successful revolution, establishing the modern United States. After the end of the Napoleonic Wars (1803ÿ15), British territories in the Americas were slowly granted more responsible government. In 1838 the Durham Report recommended full responsible government for Canada, but this was not fully implemented for another decade. Eventually, with the Confederation of Canada, the Canadian colonies were granted significant autonomy and became a self-governing Dominion in 1867. Other colonies in the Americas followed at a much slower pace. In this way, two countries in North America, ten in the Caribbean, and one in South America have received their independence from the United Kingdom. All of these, except the United States, are members of the Commonwealth of Nations and nine are Commonwealth realms. The eight current British overseas territories in the Americas have varying degrees of self-government.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA number of English colonies were established under a system of Proprietary Governors, who were appointed under mercantile charters to English joint stock companies to found and run settlements.\\r\\nIn 1664, England took over the Dutch colony of New Netherland (including its capital of New Amsterdam) which England renamed the Province of New York. With New Netherland, the English also came to control the former New Sweden (in what is now Delaware), which the Dutch had conquered earlier. This later became part of Pennsylvania after that was established in 1680.\\r\\nThe Kingdom of Scotland tried unsuccessfully to establish a colony at Darin, and the Scottish colonization of Nova Scotia (New Scotland) lasted from 1629 to 1632. Thousands of Scotsmen also participated in English colonization before the two countries were united in 1707.\\r\\nThe Kingdom of Great Britain acquired the French colony of Acadia in 1713 and then Canada and the Spanish colony of Florida in 1763. After being renamed the Province of Quebec, the former French Canada was divided into two Provinces, the Canadas, consisting of the old settled country of Lower Canada (today Quebec) and the newly settled Upper Canada (today Ontario).\\r\\nIn the north, the Hudson's Bay Company actively traded for fur with the indigenous peoples, and had competed with French, Aboriginal, and Mtis fur traders. The company came to control the entire drainage basin of Hudson Bay, called Rupert's Land. The small part of the Hudson Bay drainage south of the 49th parallel went to the United States in the Anglo-American Convention of 1818.\\r\\nThirteen of Great Britain's colonies rebelled in the American Revolutionary War, beginning in 1775, primarily over representation, local laws and tax issues, and established the United States of America, which was recognised internationally with the signing of the Treaty of Paris on 3 September 1783.\\r\\nGreat Britain also colonised the west coast of North America, indirectly via the Hudson's Bay Company licenses west of the Rocky Mountains: the Columbia District and New Caledonia fur district. Most of these were jointly claimed as the Oregon Country by the United States from 1818 until the 49th parallel was established as the international boundary west of the Rockies by the Oregon Treaty of 1846. The Colony of Vancouver Island, founded in 1849, and the Colony of British Columbia, founded in 1858, were combined in 1866 under the name Colony of British Columbia, and joined the Confederation in 1871. British Columbia was expanded with the inclusion of the Stikine Territory in 1863; and upon joining Confederation the Peace River Block, formerly part of Rupert's Land, was added.\\r\\nIn 1867, the colonies of New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, and the Province of Canada (the southern portion of modern-day Ontario and Quebec) combined to form a self-governing dominion, named Canada, within the British Empire (the term \\"kingdom\\" was avoided so as to not provoke the United States). Quebec (including what is now the southern portion of Ontario) and Nova Scotia (including what is now New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island) had been ceded to Britain by the French. The colonies of Prince Edward Island and British Columbia joined over the next six years, and Newfoundland joined in 1949. Rupert's Land and the North-Western Territory were ceded to Canada in 1870. This area now consists of the provinces of Manitoba (admitted after negotiation between Canada and a Mtis provisional government in 1870), Saskatchewan, and Alberta (both created in 1905), as well as the Northwest Territories, the Yukon Territory (created 1898, following the start of the Klondike Gold Rush), and Nunavut (created in 1999).\\r\\nIn order of settlement or founding:","input":"What was the first british colony in north america?"},{"output":"monozygotic (\\"identical\\")","context":"Twins are two offspring produced by the same pregnancy.[1] Twins can be either monozygotic (\\"identical\\"), meaning that they develop from one zygote, which splits and forms two embryos, or dizygotic (\\"fraternal\\"), meaning that they develop from two different eggs. In fraternal twins, each twin is fertilized by its own sperm cell.[2]\\r\\nIn contrast, a fetus that develops alone in the womb is called a singleton, and the general term for one offspring of a multiple birth is multiple.[3] Non-related look-alikes whose resemblance parallels that of twins are referred to as doppelgangers.[4]\\r\\nThe human twin birth rate in the United States, rose 76% from 1980 through 2009, from 18.9 to 33.3 per 1,000 births (about 80%)[5]\\r\\nThe Yoruba peoples have the highest rate of twinning in the world, at 45ÿ50 twin sets (or 90ÿ100 twins) per 1,000 live births,[6][7][8] possibly because of high consumption of a specific type of yam containing a natural phytoestrogen which may stimulate the ovaries to release an egg from each side.[9][10]\\r\\nIn Central Africa there are 18ÿ30 twin sets (or 36ÿ60 twins) per 1,000 live births.[11] In Latin America, South Asia, and Southeast Asia, the lowest rates are found; only 6 to 9 twin sets per 1,000 live births. North America and Europe have intermediate rates of 9 to 16 twin sets per 1,000 live births.[11]\\r\\nMultiple pregnancies are much less likely to carry to full term than single births, with twin pregnancies lasting on average 37 weeks, three weeks less than full term.[12]\\r\\nWomen who have a family history of fraternal twins have a higher chance of producing fraternal twins themselves, as there is a genetically linked tendency to hyper-ovulate. There is no known genetic link for identical twinning.[13] Other factors that increase the odds of having fraternal twins include maternal age, fertility drugs and other fertility treatments, nutrition, and prior births.[14]\\r\\nThe vast majority of twins are either dizygotic (fraternal) or monozygotic (identical). Less common variants are discussed further down the article.\\r\\nTwins can be:\\r\\nAmong non-twin births, male singletons are slightly (about five percent) more common than female singletons. The rates for singletons vary slightly by country. For example, the sex ratio of birth in the US is 1.05 males/female,[15] while it is 1.07 males/female in Italy.[16] However, males are also more susceptible than females to die in utero, and since the death rate in utero is higher for twins, it leads to female twins being more common than male twins.\\r\\nZygosity is the degree of identity in the genome of twins.\\r\\nDizygotic (DZ) or fraternal twins (also referred to as \\"non-identical twins\\", \\"dissimilar twins\\", \\"biovular twins\\", and, informally in the case of females, \\"sororal twins\\") usually occur when two fertilized eggs are implanted in the uterus wall at the same time. When two eggs are independently fertilized by two different sperm cells, fraternal twins result. The two eggs, or ova, form two zygotes, hence the terms dizygotic and biovular. Fraternal twins are, essentially, two ordinary siblings who happen to be born at the same time, since they arise from two separate eggs fertilized by two separate sperm, just like ordinary siblings.\\r\\nThis is the most common type of twin.[17]\\r\\nDizygotic twins, like any other siblings, have an extremely small chance of having the same chromosome profile. Even if they happen to have the same chromosome profile, they will always have different genetic material on each chromosome, due to chromosomal crossover during meiosis. Like any other siblings, dizygotic twins may look similar, particularly given that they are the same age. However, dizygotic twins may also look very different from each other.\\r\\nStudies show that there is a genetic proclivity for dizygotic twinning. However, it is only the mother who has any effect on the chances of having such twins; there is no known mechanism for a father to cause the release of more than one ovum. Dizygotic twinning ranges from six per thousand births in Japan (similar to the rate of monozygotic twins) to 14 and more per thousand in some African countries.[18]\\r\\nDizygotic twins are also more common for older mothers, with twinning rates doubling in mothers over the age of 35.[19] With the advent of technologies and techniques to assist women in getting pregnant, the rate of fraternals has increased markedly.\\r\\nMonozygotic (MZ) or identical twins occur when a single egg is fertilized to form one zygote (hence, \\"monozygotic\\") which then divides into two separate embryos.\\r\\nRegarding spontaneous or natural monozygotic twinning, a recent theory proposes that monozygotic twins are formed after a blastocyst essentially collapses, splitting the progenitor cells (those that contain the body's fundamental genetic material) in half, leaving the same genetic material divided in two on opposite sides of the embryo. Eventually, two separate fetuses develop.[20] Spontaneous division of the zygote into two embryos is not considered to be a hereditary trait, but rather a spontaneous and random event.[19]\\r\\nMonozygotic twins may also be created artificially by embryo splitting. It can be used as an expansion of in vitro fertilization (IVF) to increase the number of available embryos for embryo transfer.[21]\\r\\nMonozygotic twinning occurs in birthing at a rate of about 3 in every 1000 deliveries worldwide.[22] (about 0.3% of the world population).\\r\\nThe likelihood of a single fertilization resulting in monozygotic twins is uniformly distributed in all populations around the world.[19] This is in marked contrast to dizygotic twinning, which ranges from about six per thousand births in Japan (almost similar to the rate of identical twins, which is around 4ÿ5) to 15 and more per thousand in some parts of India[23] and up to over 20 in some Central African countries.[11] The exact cause for the splitting of a zygote or embryo is unknown.\\r\\nIVF techniques are more likely to create dizygotic twins. For IVF deliveries, there are nearly 21 pairs of twins for every 1,000.[24]\\r\\nMonozygotic twins are genetically nearly identical and they are always the same sex unless there has been a mutation during development. The children of monozygotic twins test genetically as half-siblings (or full siblings, if a pair of monozygotic twins reproduces with another pair or with the same person), rather than first cousins. Identical twins do not have the same fingerprints however, because even within the confines of the womb, the fetuses touch different parts of their environment, giving rise to small variations in their corresponding prints and thus making them unique.[25]\\r\\nMonozygotic twins always have different phenotypes. Normally due to an environmental factor or the deactivation of different X chromosomes in female monozygotic twins, and in some extremely rare cases, due to aneuploidy, twins may express different sexual phenotypes, normally from an XXY Klinefelter syndrome zygote splitting unevenly.[26][27][28]\\r\\nMonozygotic twins, although genetically very similar, are not genetically exactly the same. The DNA in white blood cells of 66 pairs of monozygotic twins was analyzed for 506,786 single nucleotide polymorphisms known to occur in human populations. Polymorphisms appeared in 2 of the 33 million comparisons, leading the researchers to extrapolate that the blood cells of monozygotic twins may have on the order of one DNA-sequence difference for every 1.2 x 107 nucleotides, which would imply hundreds of differences across the entire genome.[29] The mutations producing the differences detected in this study would have occurred during embryonic cell-division (after the point of fertilization). If they occur early in fetal development, they will be present in a very large proportion of body cells.\\r\\nAnother cause of difference between monozygotic twins is epigenetic modification, caused by differing environmental influences throughout their lives. Epigenetics refers to the level of activity of any particular gene. A gene may become switched on, switched off, or could become partially switched on or off in an individual. This epigenetic modification is triggered by environmental events. Monozygotic twins can have markedly different epigenetic profiles. A study of 80 pairs of monozygotic twins ranging in age from three to 74 showed that the youngest twins have relatively few epigenetic differences. The number of epigenetic differences increases with age. Fifty-year-old twins had over three times the epigenetic difference of three-year-old twins. Twins who had spent their lives apart (such as those adopted by two different sets of parents at birth) had the greatest difference.[30] However, certain characteristics become more alike as twins age, such as IQ and personality.[31][32][33]\\r\\nA 1981 study of a deceased triploid XXX twin fetus without a heart showed that although its fetal development suggested that it was an identical twin, as it shared a placenta with its healthy twin, tests revealed that it was probably a polar body twin. The authors were unable to predict whether a healthy fetus could result from a polar body twinning.[34]\\r\\nIn 2003, a study argued that many cases of triploidity arise from semi-identical twinning.[35]\\r\\nIn 2007, a study reported a case of a pair of living twins, one intersex and one a phenotypical male. The twins were both found to be chimeras and to share all of their maternal DNA but only half of their father's DNA. The exact mechanism of fertilization could not be determined but the study stated that it was unlikely to be a case of polar body twinning.[36] \\r\\n\\r\\nThe degree of separation of the twins in utero depends on if and when they split into two zygotes. Dizygotic twins were always two zygotes. Monozygotic twins split into two zygotes at some time very early in the pregnancy. The timing of this separation determines the chorionicity (the number of placentae) and amniocity (the number of sacs) of the pregnancy. Dichorionic twins either never divided (i.e.: were dizygotic) or they divided within the first 4 days. Monoamnionic twins divide after the first week.\\r\\nIn very rare cases, twins become conjoined twins. Non-conjoined monozygotic twins form up to day 14 of embryonic development, but when twinning occurs after 14 days, the twins will likely be conjoined.[37] Furthermore, there can be various degrees of shared environment of twins in the womb, potentially leading to pregnancy complications.\\r\\nIt is a common misconception that two placentas means twins are dizygotic. But if monozygotic twins separate early enough, the arrangement of sacs and placentas in utero is indistinguishable from dizygotic twins.\\r\\nDiDi twins have the lowest mortality risk at about 9 percent, although that is still significantly higher than that of singletons.[40]\\r\\nMonochorionic twins generally have two amniotic sacs (called Monochorionic-Diamniotic \\"MoDi\\"), which occurs in 60ÿ70% of the pregnancies with monozygotic twins,[39] and in 0.3% of all pregnancies.[41] Monochorionic-Diamniotic twins are almost always monozygotic, with a few exceptions where the blastocysts have fused.[38]\\r\\nMonochorionic twins share the same placenta, and thus have a risk of twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome.\\r\\nMonoamniotic twins are always monozygotic.[42]\\r\\nThe survival rate for monoamniotic twins is somewhere between 50%[42] to 60%.[43]\\r\\nMonoamniotic twins, as with diamniotic monochorionic twins, have a risk of twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome. Also, the two umbilical cords have an increased chance of being tangled around the babies. Because of this, there is an increased chance that the newborns may be miscarried or suffer from cerebral palsy due to lack of oxygen.\\r\\nWhen the division of the developing zygote into 2 embryos occurs, 99% of the time it is within 8 days of fertilization.\\r\\nMortality is highest for conjoined twins due to the many complications resulting from shared organs.\\r\\nDichorionic-diamniotic twins at 8 weeks and 5 days since co-incubation as part of IVF.

Specifically, the study found that vegan mothers (who exclude dairy from their diets) are one-fifth as likely to have twins as vegetarian or omnivore mothers, and concluded that \\"Genotypes favoring elevated IGF and diets including dairy products, especially in areas where growth hormone is given to cattle, appear to enhance the chances of multiple pregnancies due to ovarian stimulation.\\"[44]\\r\\nFrom 1980 to 1997, the number of twin births in the United States rose 52%.[45] This rise can at least partly be attributed to the increasing popularity of fertility drugs and procedures such as IVF, which result in multiple births more frequently than unassisted fertilizations do. It may also be linked to the increase of growth hormones in food.[44]\\r\\nAbout 1 in 90 human births (1.1%) results from a twin pregnancy.[46] The rate of dizygotic twinning varies greatly among ethnic groups, ranging as high as about 45 per 1000 births (4.5%) for the Yoruba to 10% for Linha S?o Pedro, a tiny Brazilian settlement which belongs to the city of Candido God܇i.[47] In Candido God܇i, one in five pregnancies has resulted in twins.[48] The Argentine historian Jorge Camarasa has put forward a theory that experiments of the Nazi doctor Josef Mengele could be responsible for the high ratio of twins in the area.[49] His theory was rejected by Brazilian scientists who had studied twins living in Linha S?o Pedro; they suggested genetic factors within that community as a more likely explanation.[50] A high twinning rate has also been observed in other places of the world, including:\\r\\nThe widespread use of fertility drugs causing hyperovulation (stimulated release of multiple eggs by the mother) has caused what some call an \\"epidemic of multiple births\\". In 2001, for the first time ever in the US, the twinning rate exceeded 3% of all births. Nevertheless, the rate of monozygotic twins remains at about 1 in 333 across the globe.\\r\\nIn a study on the maternity records of 5750 Hausa women living in the Savannah zone of Nigeria, there were 40 twins and 2 triplets per 1000 births. Twenty-six percent of twins were monozygotic. The incidence of multiple births, which was about five times higher than that observed in any western population, was significantly lower than that of other ethnic groups, who live in the hot and humid climate of the southern part of the country. The incidence of multiple births was related to maternal age but did not bear any association to the climate or prevalence of malaria.[56][57]\\r\\nThe predisposing factors of monozygotic twinning are unknown.\\r\\nDizygotic twin pregnancies are slightly more likely when the following factors are present in the woman:\\r\\nWomen undergoing certain fertility treatments may have a greater chance of dizygotic multiple births. In the United States it has been estimated that by 2011 36% of twin births resulted from conception by assisted reproductive technology.[58]\\r\\nThe risk of twin birth can vary depending on what types of fertility treatments are used. With in vitro fertilisation (IVF), this is primarily due to the insertion of multiple embryos into the uterus. Ovarian hyperstimulation without IVF has a very high risk of multiple birth. Reversal of anovulation with clomifene (trade names including Clomid) has a relatively less but yet significant risk of multiple pregnancy.\\r\\nA 15-year German study[59] of 8,220 vaginally delivered twins (that is, 4,110 pregnancies) in Hesse yielded a mean delivery time interval of 13.5 minutes.[60] The delivery interval between the twins was measured as follows:\\r\\nThe study stated that the occurrence of complications \\"was found to be more likely with increasing twin-to-twin delivery time interval\\" and suggested that the interval be kept short, though it noted that the study did not examine causes of complications and did not control for factors such as the level of experience of the obstetrician, the wish of the women giving birth, or the \\"management strategies\\" of the procedure of delivering the second twin.\\r\\nResearchers suspect that as many as 1 in 8 pregnancies start out as multiples, but only a single fetus is brought to full term, because the other fetus has died very early in the pregnancy and has not been detected or recorded.[61] Early obstetric ultrasonography exams sometimes reveal an \\"extra\\" fetus, which fails to develop and instead disintegrates and vanishes in the uterus. There are several reasons for the \\"vanishing\\" fetus, including it being embodied or absorbed by the other fetus, placenta or the mother. This is known as vanishing twin syndrome. Also, in an unknown proportion of cases, two zygotes may fuse soon after fertilization, resulting in a single chimeric embryo, and, later, fetus.\\r\\nConjoined twins (or the once-commonly used term \\"siamese\\") are monozygotic twins whose bodies are joined together during pregnancy. This occurs when the zygote starts to split after day 12[38] following fertilization and fails to separate completely. This condition occurs in about 1 in 50,000 human pregnancies. Most conjoined twins are now evaluated for surgery to attempt to separate them into separate functional bodies. The degree of difficulty rises if a vital organ or structure is shared between twins, such as the brain, heart or liver.\\r\\nA chimera is an ordinary person or animal except that some of their parts actually came from their twin or from the mother. A chimera may arise either from monozygotic twin fetuses (where it would be impossible to detect), or from dizygotic fetuses, which can be identified by chromosomal comparisons from various parts of the body. The number of cells derived from each fetus can vary from one part of the body to another, and often leads to characteristic mosaicism skin coloration in human chimeras. A chimera may be intersex, composed of cells from a male twin and a female twin. In one case DNA tests determined that a woman, mystifyingly, was not the mother of two of her three children; she was found to be a chimera, and the two children were conceived from eggs derived from cells of their mother's twin.[62]\\r\\nSometimes one twin fetus will fail to develop completely and continue to cause problems for its surviving twin. One fetus acts as a parasite towards the other. Sometimes the parasitic twin becomes an almost indistinguishable part of the other, and sometimes this needs to be treated medically.\\r\\nA very rare type of parasitic twinning is one where a single viable twin is endangered when the other zygote becomes cancerous, or molar. This means that the molar zygote's cellular division continues unchecked, resulting in a cancerous growth that overtakes the viable fetus. Typically, this results when one twin has either triploidy or complete paternal uniparental disomy, resulting in little or no fetus and a cancerous, overgrown placenta, resembling a bunch of grapes.\\r\\nOccasionally, a woman will suffer a miscarriage early in pregnancy, yet the pregnancy will continue; one twin was miscarried but the other was able to be carried to term. This occurrence is similar to the vanishing twin syndrome, but typically occurs later, as the twin is not reabsorbed.\\r\\nIt is very common for twins to be born at a low birth weight. More than half of twins are born weighing less than 5.5 pounds (2.5?kg), while the average birth weight of a healthy baby should be around 6ÿ8 pounds (3ÿ4?kg).[63] This is largely due to the fact that twins are typically born premature. Premature birth and low birth weights, especially when under 3.5 pounds (1.6?kg), can increase the risk of several health-related issues, such as vision and hearing loss, mental disabilities, and cerebral palsy.[64] There is an increased possibility of potential complications as the birth weight of the baby decreases.\\r\\nMonozygotic twins who share a placenta can develop twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome. This condition means that blood from one twin is being diverted into the other twin. One twin, the 'donor' twin, is small and anemic, the other, the 'recipient' twin, is large and polycythemic. The lives of both twins are endangered by this condition.\\r\\nStillbirths occurs when a fetus dies after 20 weeks of gestation. There are two types of stillbirth, including intrauterine death and intrapartum death. Intrauterine death occurs when a baby dies during late pregnancy. Intrapartum death, which is more common, occurs when a baby dies while the mother is giving birth. The cause of stillbirth is often unknown, but the rate of babies who are stillborn is higher in twins and multiple births. Caesareans or inductions are advised after 38 weeks of pregnancy for twins, because the risk of stillbirth increases after this time.[65]\\r\\nFor otherwise healthy twin pregnancies where both twins are head down a trial of vaginal delivery is recommended at between 37 and 38 weeks.[66][67] Vaginal delivery in this case does not worsen the outcome for the infant as compared with Caesarean section.[66] There is controversy on the best method of delivery where the first twin is head first and the second is not.[66] When the first twin is not head down a caesarean section is often recommended.[66] It is estimated that 75% of twin pregnancies in the United States were delivered by caesarean section in 2008.[68] In comparison, the rate of caesarean section for all pregnancies in the general population varies between 14% and 40%.[69] In twins that share the same placenta delivery may be considered at 36 weeks.[70]\\r\\nTwin studies are utilized in an attempt to determine how much of a particular trait is attributable to either genetics or environmental influence. These studies compare monozygotic and dizygotic twins for medical, genetic, or psychological characteristics to try to isolate genetic influence from epigenetic and environmental influence. Twins that have been separated early in life and raised in separate households are especially sought-after for these studies, which have been used widely in the exploration of human nature. Classical twin studies are now being supplemented with molecular genetic studies which identify individual genes.\\r\\nAmong dizygotic twins, in rare cases, the eggs are fertilized at different times with two or more acts of sexual intercourse, either within one menstrual cycle (superfecundation) or, even more rarely, later on in the pregnancy (superfetation). This can lead to the possibility of a woman carrying fraternal twins with different fathers (that is, half-siblings). This phenomenon is known as heteropaternal superfecundation. One 1992 study estimates that the frequency of heteropaternal superfecundation among dizygotic twins, whose parents were involved in paternity suits, was approximately 2.4%; see the references section, below, for more details.\\r\\nDizygotic twins from biracial couples can sometimes be mixed twins, which exhibit differing ethnic and racial features. One such pairing was born in Germany in 2008 to a white father from Germany and a black mother from Ghana.[71][72]\\r\\nHeterotopic pregnancy is an exceedingly rare type of dizygotic twinning in which one twin implants in the uterus as normal and the other remains in the fallopian tube as an ectopic pregnancy. Ectopic pregnancies must be resolved because they can be life-threatening to the mother. However, in most cases, the intrauterine pregnancy can be salvaged.[citation needed]\\r\\nAmong monozygotic twins, in extremely rare cases, twins have been born with different sexes (one male, one female).[73] When monozygotic twins are born with different sexes it is because of chromosomal defects. There can be monozygotic boy/girl twins if the sex gene of the embryo has an extra x chromosome (the fertilized egg would be an xxy) then when the egg splits, one can have xx (girl) genes and one can have xy (boy) genes. This is rare, but possible. Records show there are only 10 known cases of these type twins.[citation needed] The probability of this is so small that multiples having different sexes is universally accepted as a sound basis for in utero clinical determination that the multiples are not monozygotic. Another abnormality that can result in monozygotic twins of different genders is if the egg is fertilized by a male sperm but during cell division only the X chromosome is duplicated. This results in one normal male (XY) and one female with Turner syndrome (45,X).[74] In these cases, although the twins did form from the same fertilized egg, it is incorrect to refer to them as genetically identical, since they have different karyotypes.\\r\\nMonozygotic twins can develop differently, due to different genes being activated.[75] More unusual are \\"semi-identical twins\\". These \\"half-identical twins\\" are hypothesized to occur when an unfertilized egg cleaves into two identical attached ova and which are viable for fertilization. Both cloned ova are then fertilized by different sperm and the coalesced eggs undergo further cell duplications developing as a chimeric blastomere. If this blastomere then undergoes a twinning event, two embryos will be formed, each of which have different paternal genes and identical maternal genes.\\r\\nThis results in a set of twins with identical genes from the mother's side, but different genes from the father's side. Cells in each fetus carry genes from either sperm, resulting in chimeras. This form had been speculated until only recently being recorded in western medicine.[76][77][78]\\r\\nMirror image twins result when a fertilized egg splits later in the embryonic stage than normal timing, around day 9ÿ12. This type of twinning could exhibit characteristics with reversed asymmetry, such as opposite dominant handedness, dental structure, or even organs (situs inversus).[79] If the split occurs later than this time period, the twins risk being conjoined. There is no DNA-based zygosity test that can determine if twins are indeed mirror image.[80]\\r\\nThere have been many studies highlighting the development of language in twins compared to single-born children. These studies have converged on the notion that there is a greater rate of delay in language development in twins compared to their single-born counterparts.[81] The reasons for this phenomenon are still in question; however, cryptophasia was thought to be the major cause.[82] Idioglossia is defined as a private language that is usually invented by young children, specifically twins. Another term to describe what some people call \\"twin talk\\" is cryptophasia where a language is developed by twins that only they can understand. The increased focused communication between two twins may isolate them from the social environment surrounding them. Idioglossia has been found to be a rare occurrence and the attention of scientists has shifted away from this idea. However, there are researchers and scientists that say cryptophasia or idioglossia is not a rare phenomenon. Current research is looking into the impacts of a richer social environment for these twins to stimulate their development of language.[83]\\r\\nTwins are common in many animal species, including cats, sheep, ferrets, giant pandas, dogs, deer, marmosets, and tamarins. The incidence of twinning among cattle is about 1ÿ4%, and research is under way to improve the odds of twinning, which can be more profitable for the breeder if complications can be sidestepped or managed. A female calf that is the twin of a bull becomes partially masculinized and is known as a freemartin.","input":"What are the different types of twin pregnancies?"},{"output":"Ben & Jerry's","context":"Ben & Jerry's Homemade Holdings Inc, trading and commonly known as Ben & Jerry's, is an American company that manufactures ice cream, frozen yogurt, and sorbet. It was founded in 1978 in Burlington, Vermont, and operates globally as a subsidiary of the Anglo-Dutch conglomerate Unilever. Its headquarters is in South Burlington, Vermont with its main factory in Waterbury, Vermont.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBen Cohen and Jerry Greenfield were childhood friends from New York. While Greenfield finished college, he found himself unable to make his way into medical school. Cohen dropped out of school.[2] In 1977, Cohen and Greenfield completed a correspondence course on ice cream making from The Pennsylvania State University's Creamery. Cohen has severe anosmia, a lack of a sense of smell or taste, and so relied on \\"mouth feel\\" and texture to provide variety in his diet. This led to the company's trademark chunks being mixed in with their ice cream.[3] On May 5, 1978, with a $12,000[4] investment, the two business partners opened an ice cream parlor in a renovated gas station in downtown Burlington, Vermont. In 1979, they marked their anniversary by holding the first-ever free cone day, now an international annual celebration at every Ben & Jerry's store.[3]\\r\\nIn 1980, they rented space in an old spool and bobbin mill on South Champlain Street in Burlington and started packing their ice cream in pints. In 1981, the first Ben & Jerry's franchise opened on Route 7 in Shelburne, Vermont. In 1983, Ben & Jerrys ice cream was used to build the worlds largest ice cream sundae in St. Albans, Vermont; the sundae weighed 27,102 pounds (12,293?kg). That same year, the cows on their cartons were redesigned by local artist Woody Jackson.[5]\\r\\nIn 1984, H?agen-Dazs wanted to limit distribution of Ben & Jerrys in Boston, prompting Ben & Jerrys to file suit against the parent company, Pillsbury, in its now famous Whats the Doughboy Afraid Of? campaign.[6] In 1987, H?agen-Dazs again tried to enforce exclusive distribution, and Ben & Jerrys filed its second lawsuit against the Pillsbury Company.\\r\\nIn 1985, the Ben & Jerrys Foundation was established at the end of the year with a gift from Ben & Jerry's to fund community-oriented projects; it was then provided with 7.5% of the companys annual pre-tax profits. In 1986, Ben & Jerrys launched its Cowmobile, a modified mobile home used to distribute free scoops of Ben & Jerrys ice cream in a unique, cross-country marketing drive쨕driven and served by Ben and Jerry themselves. The Cowmobile burned to the ground outside of Cleveland four months later, but there were no injuries. Ben said it looked like the worlds largest baked Alaska.[7]\\r\\nIn 1988, the two men won the title of U.S. Small Business Persons Of The Year, awarded by U.S. President Ronald Reagan.[8] Also that year, the first brownies were ordered from Greyston Bakery, which led to the development of the popular Chocolate Fudge Brownie flavor.[9] In 1992, Ben & Jerrys joined in a co-operative campaign with the national non-profit Children's Defense Fund; the campaign goal was to bring childrens basic needs to the top of the national agenda. Over 70,000 postcards were sent to Congress concerning kids and other national issues. In 1995, they hired Robert Holland, Jr. as CEO after holding a \\"Yo! I'm your C.E.O.\\" essay contest as part of the search.[10] Holland left after 20 months following philosophical differences and was replaced by Perry Odak in 1997.[11]\\r\\nIn 1989, Ben & Jerrys revealed their opposition of the use of rBGH (recombinant bovine growth hormone) in all their products. This genetically engineered hormone is sometimes given to cows in order to boost milk production, but Ben & Jerrys does not support this practice and is in favor of utilizing less chemically intensive ingredients for the safety of consumers and the environment.[12]\\r\\nIn 1994, Ben & Jerry's: The Inside Scoop, written by Fred \\"Chico\\" Lager, former CEO of Ben & Jerry's Ice Cream, was published. This book tracks the history of how Ben & Jerry's Ice Cream got started. The book focuses on \\"How Two Real Guys Built a Business with a Social Conscience and a Sense of Humor.\\"[13]\\r\\nIn April 2000, Ben & Jerry's sold the company to Anglo-Dutch multinational food giant Unilever.[14] Unilever said it hopes to carry on the tradition of engaging \\"in these critical, global economic and social missions\\". Although the founders' names are still attached to the product, they do not hold any board or management position and are not involved in day-to-day management of the company.[15]\\r\\nIn 2001, Ben & Jerry's U.S. completed the transition to \\"Eco-Pint\\" packaging, which packaged all pint flavors in environmentally friendly unbleached paperboard Eco-Pint containers, a decision it later reversed. The use of brown-kraft unbleached paperboard had been a critical first step toward a totally biodegradable pint made without added chlorine. Due to what they described as increasing supply, quality, and cost challenges, Ben & Jerry's discontinued their use of the Eco-Pint in 2006, transitioning to a pint container made out of a bleached paperboard that it said was more readily available.[16]\\r\\nOn Earth Day in 2005, when a vote in the U.S. Senate proposed the opening of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil drilling, Ben & Jerry's launched a protest by creating the largest ever Baked Alaska, which weighed 900 pounds (410?kg), and placed it in front of the U.S. Capitol Building.[17][18]\\r\\nIn March 2009, \\"CyClone Dairy\\"[19] launched an advertising campaign and a website to promote its milk products, which purportedly came exclusively from cloned cows.[20] On April 1, 2009 (April Fool's Day), Ben & Jerry's announced that it was behind this fake company. Ben & Jerry's had created the tongue-in-cheek hoax to raise awareness of the increasing presence of products from cloned animals within American food[21][22] and to campaign for a tracking system of cloned-animal products.[23] The hoax was revealed on April Fool's Day with the message: \\"We believe you should have the right to choose which foods you eat ÿ and not to eat cloned foods if you dont want to. And that's why Ben & Jerrys believes we need a national clone tracking system, so people and companies can know where their food is coming from.\\"[24]\\r\\nIn 2010, Jostein Solheim, a Unilever executive from Norway, became the new CEO of the company and had this to say about the transition: \\"My mantra that I've repeated a hundred times since starting at Ben & Jerry's is: Change is a wonderful thing,'\\" he said. \\"The world needs dramatic change to address the social and environmental challenges we are facing. Values led businesses can play a critical role in driving that positive change. We need to lead by example, and prove to the world that this is the best way to run a business. Historically, this company has been and must continue to be a pioneer to continually challenge how business can be a force for good and address inequities inherent in global business.\\"[25]\\r\\nOn February 24, 2012, Ben & Jerry's released a new Greek Frozen Yogurt line, which came in several flavors: \\"Strawberry Shortcake\\", \\"Blueberry Vanilla Graham\\", \\"Raspberry Fudge Chunk\\", \\"Banana Peanut Butter\\",[26] and \\"Vanilla\\" (scoop shop exclusive):[27] On April 12, 2013, \\"Pineapple Passionfruit\\", \\"Vanilla Honey Caramel\\", and \\"Liz Lemon\\" were added to the Greek Yogurt line.[28] The Liz Lemon flavor was inspired by a character of the same name created by actress Tina Fey as the main character on the NBC television sitcom 30 Rock.[29]\\r\\nIn 2013, Ben & Jerrys committed to making their products GMO-free in support of mandatory GMO labeling legislation.[30]\\r\\nThe \\"Vermonster\\" is a large ice cream sundae served in a \\"Vermonster Bucket\\" in Ben & Jerry's \\"scoop shops.\\" Its ingredients are 20 scoops of ice cream, 4 bananas, 4 ladles of hot fudge, 3 chocolate chip cookies, 1 chocolate fudge brownie, 10 scoops of walnuts, 2 scoops each of any 4 toppings, and whipped cream. It contains 14,000 calories (kcal), and 500 grams (17.64?oz) of fat. Since 2009, the Vermonster Challenge is an annual charity event held by Ben & Jerry's in which teams of four compete to finish a Vermonster and win free ice cream for a year.[31]\\r\\n\\"Chubby Hubby\\" consists of vanilla malt ice cream swirled with fudge and peanut butter, and containing pretzel nuggets covered in fudge and filled with peanut butter. During the month of September 2009, Ben and Jerry's, in partnership with Freedom to Marry, renamed \\"Chubby Hubby\\" to \\"Hubby Hubby,\\" in celebration of the legalization of same-sex marriage in the company's home state of Vermont. The carton featured the image of two men getting married beneath a rainbow.[32][33][34]\\r\\nOn March 13, 2012, Ben & Jerrys announced it would be changing the name of one of its ice cream flavours in the UK in support of equal marriage rights for same-sex couples. \\"Oh! My! Apple Pie!\\" would become \\"Apple-y Ever After\\" and tubs would feature a gay couple atop a wedding cake decorated with rainbows.[35]\\r\\n\\"Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough\\" was temporarily renamed \\"I Dough, I Dough\\" in the United States during the summer of 2015. This was in celebration of United States Supreme Court's ruling in support of same-sex marriage. The proceeds from sales were to go to the Human Rights Campaign (a nonprofit advocacy group for LGBT rights).[36]\\r\\nBen Cohen and Jerry Greenfield appeared on The Colbert Report on March 5, 2007, to promote their new ice cream flavor, \\"Stephen Colbert's AmeriCone Dream\\", and Cohen's progressive advocacy group TrueMajority.\\r\\nThe company renamed a flavour, \\"Yes Pecan!\\", in reference to Barack Obama's victory in the 2008 U.S. presidential election. They decided in January 2009 to donate all proceeds made on the sale of that flavor to the Common Cause Education Fund.[37]\\r\\nOn March 2, 2011, Cohen and Greenfield appeared on Late Night with Jimmy Fallon and unveiled their new flavour of ice cream, \\"Late Night Snack\\", whose carton features a picture of Jimmy Fallon on it.[38]\\r\\nOn February 17, 2015, Cohen and Greenfield appeared on The Tonight Show starring Jimmy Fallon and unveiled their new flavor of ice cream, \\"The Tonight Dough\\", which all of its proceeds go to the SeriousFun Children's Network that supports camps for children with major illnesses.[39]\\r\\nIn 2015, Charoset flavoured ice cream became widely available in time for the Passover holiday.[40][41][42][43][44][45]\\r\\nIn April 2015, the company confirmed that it was working on vegan options, after hearing consumers' feedback, led by a petition and FARM organization.[46] In early February 2016, the company announced a new all-vegan line with 4 flavors. Two of these are versions of existing flavors - \\"Chunky Monkey\\" and \\"Chocolate Fudge Brownie\\" - and two are all-new vegan-only flavors: \\"Coffee Caramel Fudge\\" and \\"Peanut Butter & Cookies\\".[47]\\r\\nFree Cone Day is an annual event held between late March and early May, in which Ben & Jerry's scoop shops give out free ice cream cups and cones. Free Cone Day was first held on Saturday, May 5, 1979, by Ben and Jerry as a customer and staff appreciation event for the first anniversary of their store's opening.\\r\\nOver one million free cones are given away each year, prompting the company's ad slogan \\"Be One In A Million.\\" Charitable organizations are often present at the stores each year and enjoy a significant amount of fundraising success. Often, local celebrities show up at various stores, promoting the day and the charities there.[48] Sometimes the event is scheduled to coincide with Earth Day and sometimes volunteers are on hand with clipboards and voter registration forms to help those who would like to register to vote.\\r\\nThe Center for Science in the Public Interest, a consumer-advocacy group, urged Ben & Jerry's to stop labeling their ice cream as \\"all natural,\\" due to the company's use of corn syrup, alkalised cocoa, and other chemically modified ingredients.[49] In September 2010, the company agreed to stop labeling their ice cream and frozen yogurt as \\"all natural.\\"[50]\\r\\nIn 2011, Ben & Jerry's released a flavor named Schweddy Balls, in homage to the Saturday Night Live (SNL) skit of the same name. An American group named \\"One Million Moms\\" protested, saying that the name was too explicit for grocery store shelvesspokesperson Monica Cole explained to the media: \\"I realize it could be a lot worse, but are they going to progressively get worse if we don't say something? Maybe they'll think twice before they come up with another inappropriate name for ice cream.\\" However, the expression of disdain was not unanimous among U.S. parents, as mother Gina Ragusa said to The Huffington Post: \\"We just think it's funny, that's all, and honestly we all really want to try it\\", adding that she consistently checks for the item's availability at her local supermarket.[51] Actor Alec Baldwin, who appeared in the SNL skit as baker Pete Schweddy, hosted the September 24, 2011 episode of the 37th season of the show and responded to the protests by stating that a new flavor called \\"Go Fudge Yourself\\" had been produced for those in opposition to the tribute. Following the initial release of the flavor, Baldwin informed the media that \\"thanks to Ben & Jerry's, the goodness of the Schweddy family recipe won't go with me to the great beyond,\\" as he had previously feared that his association with the SNL episode would remain permanent until his death.[52]\\r\\nFollowing rumors that suggested that Ben & Jerry's supported the defense of Mumia Abu-Jamalwho was convicted in 1982 of killing Philadelphia Police officer Daniel Faulkner[53] the company confirmed that Cohen did sign a petition, as a private citizen, asking that \\"the system of American justice be followed fully in the case.\\"[54]\\r\\nControversy emerged in 2006 after the company released a flavor of ice cream called \\"Black and Tan.\\" It had named the flavor after the alcoholic drink, which is made by mixing stout with pale ale, but the \\"Black and Tans\\" are also known as a paramilitary police force of British World War I veterans recruited during the Irish Revolution. At the time that the flavor was released, the Irish nationalist movement was still offended by the historical association of the title.[55]\\r\\nIn 2012, Vermonters for a Just Peace in Palestine/Israel (VTJP)[56] contacted Ben Cohen, Jerry Greenfield and the CEO of Ben & Jerrys after learning that ice cream produced by Ben & Jerrys franchise in Israel[57] was being sold in Israeli settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem. Leafleting occurred at locations in Vermont, New York and California on 'Free Cone Day' in April 2013[58] and April 2014.[59] As of November 2014[update], 232 organizations across the United States and in seventeen countries worldwide have signed a letter written by VTJP calling on Ben & Jerry's to end its commercial ties to such settlements.[60]\\r\\nIn late April 2014, Ben & Jerry's signed onto the \\"Fight for the Reef\\" campaign, a partnership between the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF)-Australia and the Australian Marine Conservation Society (AMCS). Premier Campbell Newman and Queensland state senator Matthew Canavan both said in statements that Ben & Jerry's was making misleading statements that exaggerated the detrimental impact that proposed government programs would have on the Great Barrier Reef,[61][61] and Environment Minister Andrew Powell said that \\"The only people taking a scoop out of the reef is Ben and Jerrys and Unilever. If you understand the facts, youd want to be boycotting Ben and Jerrys\\". Australian Ben & Jerry's brand manager Kalli Swaik responded that \\"Ben & Jerrys believes that dredging and dumping in world heritage waters surrounding the marine park area will be detrimental to the reef ecology. It threatens the health of one of Australias most iconic treasures.\\"[62]\\r\\nIn April 2016, Ben & Jerry's cofounders, Ben Cohen and Jerry Greenfield, were both arrested at the Democracy Awakening protests on the U.S. Capitol steps in Washington D.C.[63]\\r\\nIn May 2017, Ben and Jerry's announced they would not serve two scoops of the same ice cream flavor in Australia, due to the refusal of the Australian government to legalize same-sex marriage. They said this would encourage \\"fans to contact their MP's to tell them the time has come-make marriage equality legal!\\". This stance they said will continue for however long it takes for same-sex marriage to be legalized.[64][65]\\r\\nIn February 2012, a Ben & Jerry's franchise near Harvard University created a limited edition frozen yogurt flavor named \\"Taste the Lin-Sanity,\\" in honor of Asian-American basketball player Jeremy Lin, a Harvard alumnus. At inception, the product contained vanilla frozen yogurt, lychee honey swirls, and fortune cookie pieces, leading to a widely publicized controversy about racial stereotyping due to the association of the fortune cookie ingredient with Chinese culture. The latter ingredient was later replaced with waffle cookies, as the fortune cookies became soggy and the franchise received returns from customers. Ben & Jerry's general manager for Boston and Cambridge explained to the media: \\"we obviously weren't looking to offend anybody and the majority of the feedback about it has been positive.\\"[66] Ben & Jerry's released an official statement shortly after the launch of the product apologizing to those who were offended.[67]\\r\\nIn September 2014, anti-hazing activists raised concerns about the ice cream flavor \\"Hazed & Confused,\\" which had been released earlier that year. The concern was that the name could be perceived as belittling of hazing and bullying problems. The company has noted that the name was based on the word hazelnut and a play on the phrase \\"dazed and confused\\", which is both a song popularized by Led Zeppelin and a coming-of-age comedy film from the early 1990s.[68] The decision was made in October to not rename the flavor.[69]\\r\\nThe Organic Consumers Association announced in July of 2017 that it found traces of the herbicide glyphosate in 10 of 11 samples of the companys ice creams.[70] The traces were found to be at levels below the ceiling set by the Environmental Protection Agency for environmental contamination.\\r\\nBen and Jerry's has locations around the world.[71]\\r\\nBen & Jerry's used to have a policy that no employee's rate of pay shall exceed five times that of entry-level employees.[75] In 1995, entry-level employees were paid $12 hourly, and the highest paid employee was President and Chief Operating Officer Chuck Lacy, who earned $150,000 annually. When Ben Cohen resigned as Chief Executive Officer and Ben & Jerry's announced the search for a new CEO in 1995, the company ended the five-to-one-ratio policy.[76]","input":"Who makes ben and jerry's ice cream?"},{"output":"Mian Saqib Nisar","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Chief Justice of Pakistan (initials as CJP) is the head of the court system of Pakistan (the judicature branch of government) and the chief judge of the Supreme Court of Pakistan.[1] The Chief Justice is the senior most of 17 Senior Justices of the Supreme Court of Pakistan.[2] From  La1947 until 1960, the chief justice and senior justices were known as Federal Judge.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Chief Justice is the chief administrative officer of the country's court system and the highest judicial officer- ranking immediately above the Chief Justice of the Federal Shariat Court- and is responsible for supervising federal judicial policies, and conducting judicial business in the Supreme Court.[4][5]\\r\\n\\r\\nNomination for the appointment of the Chief Justice is made by Prime Minister of Pakistan, and final appointments are confirmed by the President of Pakistan.[6][7] Presiding over the oral arguments before the court, the Chief Justice has significant agenda-setting power over meetings of the Supreme Court.

It ran from 1 to 19 July in six stages over 2,428?km (1,509?mi), and was won by Maurice Garin.[1]\\r\\nThe race was invented to boost the circulation of L'Auto, after its circulation started to plummet from competition with the long-standing Le Vlo. Originally scheduled to start in June, the race was postponed one month, and the prize money was increased, after a disappointing level of applications from competitors. The 1903 Tour de France was the first stage road race, and compared to modern Grand Tours, it had relatively few stages, but each was much longer than those raced today. The cyclists did not have to compete in all six stages, although this was necessary to qualify for the general classification.\\r\\nThe pre-race favourite, Maurice Garin, won the first stage, and retained the lead throughout. He also won the last two stages, and had a margin of almost three hours over the next cyclist. The circulation of L'Auto increased more than sixfold during and after the race, so the race was considered successful enough to be rerun in 1904, by which time Le Vlo had been forced out of business.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the Dreyfus affair separated advertisers from the newspaper Le Vlo, a new newspaper L'Auto-Vlo was founded in 1900, with former cyclist Henri Desgrange as editor. After being forced to change the name of the newspaper to L'Auto in 1903, Desgrange needed something to keep the cycling fans; with circulation at 20,000, he could not afford to lose them.[2]\\r\\nWhen Desgrange and young employee Go Lefvre were returning from the MarseilleÿParis cycling race,[3] Lefvre suggested holding a race around France, similar to the popular six-day races on the track.[4] Desgrange proposed the idea to the financial controller Victor Goddet, who gave his approval, and on 19 January 1903, the Tour de France was announced in L'Auto.[5][6]\\r\\nIt was to have been a five-week race, from 1 June to 5 July, with an entry fee of 20 francs. These conditions attracted very few cyclists: one week before the race was due to start, only 15 competitors had signed up. Desgrange then rescheduled the race from 1 to 19 July, increased the total prize money to 20,000 francs, reduced the entry fee to 10 francs and guaranteed at least five francs a day to the first 50 cyclists in the classification.[7] After that, 79 cyclists signed up for the race, of whom 60 actually started the race.[8]\\r\\nGo Lefvre became the director, judge and time-keeper; Henri Desgrange was the directeur-gnral, although he did not follow the race.\\r\\nThe 1903 Tour de France was run in six stages. Compared to modern stage races, the stages were extraordinarily long, with an average distance of over 400?km (250?mi), compared to the 171?km (106?mi) average stage length in the 2004 Tour de France; cyclists had one to three rest days between each stage,[8] and the route was largely flat, with only one stage featuring a significant mountain. The cyclists were not grouped in teams but raced as individuals, and paid a fee of ten francs (?87.50 at 2003 prices) to compete in the race for general classification, or five francs to enter a single stage.[9] Because the stages were so long, all but the first started before dawn: the last stage started at 21:00 the night before.[10]\\r\\nThe first Tour de France crossed no mountain passes, but several lesser cols. The first was the col des Echarmeaux (712?m (2,336?ft)), on the opening stage from Paris to Lyon, on what is now the old road from Autun to Lyon. The stage from Lyon to Marseille included the col de la Rpublique (1,161?m (3,809?ft)), also known as the col du Grand Bois, at the edge of St-Etienne.[11]\\r\\nIn 1903, it was normal for a professional cyclist to hire pacers, who would lead them during the race. Desgrange forbade this: it was originally intended that in the final, longest, stage pacers would be allowed, but this was rescinded after the fifth stage.[5][12][13]\\r\\nTo ensure that the cyclists rode the entire route, stewards were stationed at various points around the course.[5][7] The yellow jersey for the leader in the general classification had not yet been introduced, but the leader was identified by a green armband.[5]\\r\\nThe fastest eight cyclists on each stage received a prize between 50 francs and 1,500 francs, varying per stage. The fourteen best cyclists in the general classification received a prize from 3,000 francs for the winner to 25 francs for fourteenth place.[7] The remaining seven cyclists to finish in the general classification each received 95 francs, 5 francs for each of the 19 days that the race took, provided that they had not won more than 200 francs in prize money and did not have an average speed below 20?km/h (12?mph) on any stage.[7]\\r\\nIn contrast to modern stage races, a cyclist who gave up during a stage was allowed to start again the next stage, although he would no longer be in contention for the general classification. Thus Hippolyte Aucouturier, who gave up during the first stage, was able to return, and won the second and third stages. Charles Laeser, winner of the fourth stage, had not completed the third stage.[8]\\r\\nSixty cyclists, all professionals or semi-professionals, started the race, of whom 49 were French, 4 Belgian, 4 Swiss, 2 German, and one Italian; 21 of them were sponsored by bicycle manufacturers, while 39 entered without commercial support.[7][8][14] 24 other cyclists took advantage of the opportunity to enter specific stages: one rode in both the second and fourth stages, and additionally three cyclists took part in the second stage, one in the third stage, fifteen in the fourth stage only, and a further four only competed in the fifth stage.[8]\\r\\nThe pre-race favourites for the victory were Maurice Garin and Hippolyte Aucouturier.[3] Garin dominated the race from the start by winning the first stage, a 471?km (293?mi) parcours from Paris to Lyon. The stage started at 15:16, and the cyclists initially rode with a speed of 35?km/h. The first cyclists abandoned after around 50?km (31?mi).[15] At 23:00, Garin and Emile Pagie, leading the race, reached the control point in Nevers. Garin expected at that point that they would finish at 8:00 the next morning. During the night, Garin's main rival, Aucouturier, had stomach cramps, and was unable to finish the stage.[5][15] Also during that first stage, the first breach of the rules occurred: Jean Fischer had used a car as pacer, which was illegal.[5][15] Pagie fell down, but got up again; he and Garin kept leading the race during the night. Around 9:00 in the morning, both reached Lyon. Garin got away from Pagie, and finished one minute ahead.[15]\\r\\nAlthough Aucouturier had abandoned in the first stage, and so was not eligible for the general classification, he could still start the rest of the stages. In the second stage, Aucouturier was able to win the sprint. In the third stage, the cyclists who were competing for the general classification started one hour earlier than the other cyclists, including Aucouturier. At the end of that stage, a group of four cyclists had broken away, and Eugne Brange won the sprint. Aucouturier finished 27 minutes later, but this meant that he had run the course 33 minutes faster, so he was declared the winner of the stage.[16] Garin retained the lead, helped by a crash of second-placed Pagie in the second stage, which eliminated him from the race.[5] In the fourth stage, Aucouturier had a clear lead and seemed set to win a third successive stage, but was caught using the slipstream of a car, and was removed from the race.[3] Swiss Charles Laeser (who had abandoned in the 3rd stage[8]) took the victory, becoming the first non-French winner. As in the third stage, the cyclists departed in two groups, and Laeser was in the second group because he was no longer contending for the general classification. Laeser finished more than 50 minutes after a group of six cyclists, but he had travelled the distance 4 minutes faster than them, so he was declared the winner.[17]\\r\\nAt that point, Garin was leading, with mile Georget almost two hours behind.[18] In the fifth stage, Georget had two flat tires, and fell asleep when he stopped at the side of the road to rest; he failed to finish.[3] Thus Garin extended his lead by winning this stage, carrying nearly three hours' advantage into the final day's racing.[19] Garin had requested other cyclists in the leading group to let him win the stage, but Fernand Augereau refused to do this. Garin then had Lucien Pothier throw down his bicycle in front of Augereau, who fell, and Garin then bent Augereau's rear wheel. Augereau quickly obtained a spare bike and continued to the finish, however Garin easily won the sprint.[20] Augereau still received a prize of 100 francs from Velo-Sport Nantes for the fastest final kilometer of the stage in the Nantes velodrome.[21]\\r\\nThe last stage was the longest, at 471?km (293?mi), and ran from Nantes to the small town of Ville-d'Avray, which lies between Versailles and Paris, instead of at the Parc des Princes velodrome. This was because of a bylaw forbidding road races to end on cycling tracks (a bylaw subsequently repealed in light of the race's success). Garin took his third stage win, and sealed overall victory by 2 hours 59 minutes 31 seconds: this remains the greatest margin of victory in the Tour de France.[5] After celebrating with champagne, the riders cycled to Parc des Princes, where they made several laps of honour before an adoring crowd, to the sound of a bugle.\\r\\nIn 1903, there was no distinction in the rules between plain stages and mountain stages; the icons shown here indicate whether the stage included mountains.\\r\\nThere were 21 cyclists who had completed all six stages. For these cyclists, the times taken for each stage were added up for the general classification. The cyclist with the least accumulated time was the winner. The cyclists officially were not grouped in teams; some cyclists had the same sponsor, even though they were not allowed to work together.[22]\\r\\nThe circulation of L'Auto increased significantly due to this event; a special edition of 130,000 copies was made after the race was over,[25] and normal circulation increased from 25,000 to 65,000.[2] The big success made sure that the Tour de France was scheduled again for 1904. The cyclists had also become national heroes. Maurice Garin returned for the 1904 Tour de France but his title defence failed when he was disqualified. With the prize money that he won in 1903, which totalled 6,075 francs,[8] (approximately US$40,000 and GBPS23,000 in 2006 values[5]) Garin later bought a gas station, where he worked for the rest of his life.[5]\\r\\n Media related to 1903 Tour de France at Wikimedia Commons","input":"Number of participants in the 1903 tour de france?"},{"output":"October 10, 1992","context":"Yu Yu Hakusho (Japanese: L߽߆??, Hepburn: Y Y Hakusho)[2] is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Yoshihiro Togashi. The series tells the story of Yusuke Urameshi, a yankii (teenage delinquent) who is struck and killed by a car while attempting to save a child's life. After a number of tests presented to him by Koenma, the son of the ruler of the afterlife Underworld, Yusuke is revived and appointed the title of \\"Underworld Detective\\", with which he must investigate various cases involving demons and apparitions in the human world. The manga becomes more focused on martial arts battles and tournaments as it progresses. Togashi began creating Yu Yu Hakusho around November 1990, basing the series on his interests in the occult and horror films and an influence of Buddhist mythology.\\r\\nThe manga was originally serialized in Shueisha's Weekly Shnen Jump from December 1990 to July 1994. The series consists of 175 chapters collected in 19 tankbon volumes. In North America, the manga ran completely in Viz's Shonen Jump from January 2003 to January 2010. An anime adaptation consisting of 112 television episodes was directed by Noriyuki Abe and co-produced by Fuji Television, Yomiko Advertising, and Studio Pierrot. The television series originally aired on Japan's Fuji TV network from October 10, 1992 to December 17, 1994. It was later licensed in North America by Funimation in 2001, where it aired on popular Cartoon Network blocks including Adult Swim and later Toonami. The television series has also been broadcast in various other countries around the world. The Yu Yu Hakusho franchise has spawned two animated films, a series of original video animations (OVAs), audio albums, video games, and other merchandise.\\r\\nYu Yu Hakusho has been well received, with the manga selling over 50 million copies in Japan alone and winning the prestigious Shogakukan Manga Award for shnen manga in 1993. The animated series won the Animage Anime Grand Prix prize for best anime in 1994 and 1995. Yu Yu Hakusho has been watched by a large number of television viewers in Japan and a wide range of age groups in the United States. The anime has been given mostly positive reviews by critics in North America, complimenting its writing, characters, and amount of action.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nYu Yu Hakusho follows Yusuke Urameshi, a 14-year-old street-brawling delinquent who, in an uncharacteristic act of altruism, is hit by a car and killed in an attempt to save a young boy by pushing him out of the way.[3][4][5] His ghost is greeted by Botan, a woman who introduces herself as the pilot of the River Styx, who ferries souls to the \\"Underworld\\" or Spirit World (?n, Reikai) where they may be judged for the afterlife. Botan informs Yusuke that his act had caught even the Underworld by surprise and that there was not yet a place made for him in either heaven or hell. Thus Koenma, son of the Underworld's ruler King Enma, offers Yusuke a chance to return to his body through a series of tests.[3][4][5] Yusuke succeeds with the help of his friends Keiko Yukimura and Kazuma Kuwabara. After returning to life, Koenma grants Yusuke the title of \\"Underworld Detective\\" (?n??, Reikai Tantei, lit. \\"Spirit World Detective\\"), charging him with investigating supernatural activity within the Human World (?gn, Ningen Kai). Soon Yusuke is off on his first case, retrieving three treasures stolen from the Underworld by a gang of demons: Hiei, Kurama and Goki.[4] Yusuke collects the three treasures with the aid of his new technique, the \\"Rei Gun\\", a shot of aura or Reiki (???, Reiki, \\"Spirit Energy\\") fired mentally from his index finger.[3][5] He then travels to the mountains in search of the aged, female martial arts master Genkai. Together with his rival Kuwabara, Yusuke fights through a tournament organized by Genkai to find her successor. Yusuke uses the competition as a cover to search for Rando, a demon who steals the techniques of martial arts masters and kills them.[4] Yusuke defeats Rando in the final round of the tournament and trains with Genkai for several months, gaining more mastery over his aura.[3] Yusuke is then sent to Maze Castle in the Demon Plane (@n, Makai, lit. \\"Demon World\\"), a third world occupied solely by demons, where Kuwabara and the newly reformed Kurama and Hiei assist him in defeating the Four Beasts, a quartet of demons attempting to blackmail Koenma into removing the barrier keeping them out of the human world.\\r\\nYusuke's next case sends him on a rescue mission, where he meets Toguro, a human turned into a demon. In order to test his strength, Toguro invites Yusuke to the Dark Tournament (?\\\\H, Ankoku Bujutsukai, \\"Dark Martial Arts Association\\"), an event put on by corrupt, rich humans in which teams of demons, and occasionally humans, fight fierce battles for the chance to receive any wish they desire. Team Urameshi, consisting of Yusuke, Kuwabara, Kurama, Hiei and a disguised Genkai, traverse through the strenuous early rounds to face Team Toguro in the finals and win the tournament. They learn that Team Toguro's owner, Sakyo, was attempting to win in order to create a large hole from the human world to the Demon Plane and allow countless demons through.[3] With his loss, Sakyo destroys the tournament arena, killing himself in the process.\\r\\nAfter the tournament, Yusuke returns home, but has little time to rest as he is challenged to a fight by three teenagers possessing superhuman powers and who end up taking the detective hostage. Kuwabara and the others rescue him and learn that the whole scenario was a test put on by Genkai. It is disclosed that Shinobu Sensui, Yusuke's predecessor as Underworld Detective, has recruited six other powerful beings to help him take over where Sakyo left off, opening a hole to the Demon Plane in order to cause genocide of the human race. Yusuke and his friends challenge and defeat Sensui's associates one-by-one, culminating in a final battle between the two detectives. Sensui kills Yusuke then retreats into the newly opened portal to the Demon Plane. Yusuke is reborn as a partial demon, discovering that his ancestor passed down a recessive gene that would hide until an heir with sufficient power surfaced, when his demonic lineage would be revealed.[3] Yusuke travels to the Demon Plane and defeats Sensui with the aid of the spirit of his ancestor who takes control of Yusuke's body to finish the fight.\\r\\nAs they return to the human world, Yusuke is stripped of his detective title as King Enma orders he be captured and executed in fear that Yusuke's demon blood could cause him to go on a rampage in the human world. Yusuke, unsettled at having been controlled by his ancestor Raizen, accepts an offer by Raizen's followers to return to the Demon Plane. Raizen, desiring a successor to his territory, is on the brink of dying of starvation, a death that would topple the delicate political balance of the three ruling powers of the Demon Plane. Hiei and Kurama are summoned by the other two rulers, Mukuro and Yomi, respectively, to prepare for an inevitable war.[3] The three protagonists train in the realm for one year, during which time Raizen dies and Yusuke inherits his territory. Yusuke takes initiative and proposes a fighting tournament to name the true ruler of the Demon Plane, which is agreed upon by Mukuro and Yomi. During the tournament, Yusuke and Yomi meet in the second elimination round where Yusuke is defeated and knocked unconscious. Yusuke awakens days later to find that the tournament has ended and that a similar competition is to be held every so often to determine the Demon Plane's ruler. Yusuke stays in the Demon Plane for a while longer, but eventually returns to the human world after several years to be with Keiko.[3]\\r\\nAuthor Yoshihiro Togashi stated that he began working on Yu Yu Hakusho during a period of time around November 1990, though he forgot the exact time.[6] As a fan of the occult and horror films, he desired to write and illustrate a manga based on his interests.[7] Togashi had previously published an occult detective fiction manga titled Occult Tanteidan, of which he referenced positive reception from readers as a reason for continuing to create manga.[8] When first producing Yu Yu Hakusho, he did not have a clear idea of what he wanted to call it. He used the tentative title \\"How to be a Ghost\\" while presenting rough drafts to his editors. Once given the go-ahead to begin publication, Togashi proposed \\"YuYu-Ki (Poltergeist Chronicles)\\" for the title, as there would be battles with demons and it would be a play on the title SaiYu-Ki. Because a series with a similar name (Chin-Yu-Ki) had already begun publication, Togashi quickly created an alternative: \\"YuYu Hakusho (Poltergeist Report)\\".[9] He commented that he could have used \\"Den (Legend)\\" or \\"Monogatari (Story)\\", but \\"Hakusho (Report)\\" was the first thing that came to his mind.[10] He contiguously developed the names of the main characters by skimming through a dictionary and taking out kanji characters he found appealing. \\"Yusuke Urameshi\\" is a pun, \\"Kazuma Kuwabara\\" is a combination of two professional baseball players, and \\"Hiei\\" and \\"Kurama\\" are \\"just names that popped into [Togashi's] head\\".[7] When he introduced the latter two characters in volume three, the author had early plans to make Kurama a main character but was not certain about Hiei.[7]\\r\\nThe manga's shift from occult detective fiction to the martial arts genre after Yusuke's death and revival in the early chapters was planned by Togashi from the beginning.[7] The series borrows many elements from Asian folklore, particularly Buddhist beliefs in the afterlife.[4][5] Togashi came up with the concept of the Ningenkai (human world), Reikai (Underworld), and Makai (Demon Plane) as being parallel planes of existence in the Yu Yu Hakusho universe. He thought of them as places that one could not easily travel between using modern technology, but rather as a spirit lacking a material body.[7] However, the idea for the \\"territory\\" powers from the Sensui story arc was parodied from a separate, unnamed work by Yasutaka Tsutsui.[11][12] For his drawing materials, Togashi used drafting ink and Kabura pens throughout the creation of the series. While his style of artwork began with screentone, he gradually developed into minimalism. As the series progressed, he would draw figures and faces very detailed or \\"cartoony, sketchy and jumping with action\\" whenever he desired such effects.[7]\\r\\nDuring the years he worked on Yu Yu Hakusho, Togashi would calculate the personal time he had based on a formula of four hours per page without scripting and five hours of sleep per night.[13] He wrote in his own djinshi Yoshirin de Pon! that he stopped the production on Yu Yu Hakusho out of selfishness.[14] The author had originally wanted to end the manga in December 1993, at the climax of the Sensui arc.[11][14] Although there was not a large demand from the editorial staff, Togashi was under a great deal of personal stress at certain points of the series' run, particularly during its final six months of publication. He claimed that, beginning with the Dark Tournament arc, inconsistent sleep resulting from overwork was causing him health problems.[14] He noted himself as being very ill while working on the color pages for Yusuke's match with Chu.[11] There were also many instances where he would create nearly entire manuscripts by himself, such as Yusuke's meeting with Raizen and the battle between Kurama and Karasu.[14] Togashi was relieved at the conclusion of the manga.[11] The author claimed to not have been involved in the production of the Yu Yu Hakusho anime adaptation due to his own work schedule. He stated that he was greatly impressed by Shigeru Chiba's voice depiction of Kuwabara, admitting that the voice actor understood the character better than Togashi himself.[15]\\r\\nThe Yu Yu Hakusho manga series was written and drawn by Togashi and originally serialized by Shueisha in the Japanese magazine Weekly Shnen Jump from December 1990 to July 1994.[16][17] The manga consists of 175 chapters spanning 19 tankbon with the first one being released on April 10, 1991 and the last one released on December 12, 1994.[18][19] Between August 4, 2004 and March 4, 2005, Shueisha released the kanzenban (complete) editions of the manga. Each of the 15 kanzenban volumes features a new cover and more chapters than the tankbon edition.[20][21] YuYu Hakusho has also been published as part of the Shueisha Jump Remix series of magazine-style books. Nine volumes were released between December 22, 2008 and April 27, 2009.[22][23] A bunkobon version began publication on November 18, 2010 and was finished on October 18, 2011.[24][25]\\r\\nAn English translation of the Yu Yu Hakusho manga was serialized in North America by Viz Media in the American Shonen Jump magazine, where it debuted in its inaugural January 2003 issue and ended in January 2010.[26] Viz released all 19 collected volumes of the English manga between May 13, 2003 and March 2, 2010.[27] A total of 176 chapters exist in this format due to Viz treating the extra non-numbered chapter \\"YuYu Hakusho Tales: Two Shot\\" found in volume seven (which tells the story of how Hiei and Kurama first met) as the 64th chapter.[28][29][30] Viz later re-released the series digitally as part of their digital manga releases between 2013-2014[31] and later added it to ComiXology's digital releases.[32] The YuYu Hakusho manga has additionally been licensed and published across Asia and Europe. A French translation from Kana, for example, began publication in 1997.[4]\\r\\nThe Yu Yu Hakusho anime adaptation was directed by Noriyuki Abe and co-produced by Fuji Television, Yomiko Advertising, and Studio Pierrot.[33] The series, consisting of 112 episodes, aired from October 10, 1992 to January 7, 1995 on Fuji Television.[34] The episodes were released on 23 video cassettes by Pony Canyon from January 1, 1995 to December 6, 1995. They were also released on 28 DVD volumes by Beam Entertainment, with volumes 8-14 being released on March 25, 2002, volumes 15-21 being released on April 25, 2002 and volumes 22-28 being released on May 25, 2002.[35] The anime differed from its manga source material by containing different levels of violence and profanity, as well as minor variations in art style from one to the other.[36] In early 2001, the series was acquired by Funimation Entertainment for North American distribution as Yu Yu Hakusho: Ghost Files.[37] Funimation's production saw a significant contribution from voice actor Justin Cook, who not only directed the dub but also voiced the protagonist Yusuke.[38][39]\\r\\nThe American-produced English dubbed episodes aired from February 23, 2002 to April 1, 2006 on Cartoon Network. Initially, the series was shown on the channel's Adult Swim programming block from February 2002 to April 2003, but was later moved to Toonami.[40][41] Some of the show's original depictions of mature content including violence, sexual humor, and coarse language, as well as some controversial cultural discrepancies were edited out for broadcast.[42][43] Yu Yu Hakusho was taken off Toonami around March 2005 and moved to an early Saturday morning time slot that October where the series finished its run.[44] It was also aired uncut as part of the Funimation programming block on Colours TV in 2006 and the Funimation Channel in high-definition in 2011.[45][46]\\r\\nThe series was distributed in the United Kingdom by MVM Films and in Australia and New Zealand by Madman Entertainment.[47][48] It is currently being aired by the satellite television network Animax across East Asia, Southeast Asia, the Indian subcontinent, and European countries such as Hungary and Romania.[49][50][51][52] In India the English-language version of the series was released as Ghost Fighter.[53] Yu Yu Hakusho was localized in the Philippines as Ghost Fighter and aired on IBC in the mid-1990s, as well as on GMA Network in 1999. This version of the dub localized the characters' names, such as changing \\"Yusuke\\" to \\"Eugene.\\"[54][55]\\r\\nFunimation separated the series into four \\"seasons\\", that each compose their own story arc, which they refer to as \\"sagas\\". In North America, 32 DVD compilations have been released by Funimation for the four sagas, with the first released on April 16, 2002, and the last on July 19, 2005.[56][57] The episodes have been released in both edited and uncut formats. In addition, DVD collection boxes have been released for all four sagas, each containing all the episodes of that particular saga, with the exception of the Dark Tournament Saga, which was split into two collection boxes.[58][59][60][61][62] Funimation released season box sets of the anime starting with season one on July 8, 2008 and ending with season four on January 13, 2009.[63][64] Each set contains four DVDs which have 28 episodes, or one quarter of the whole series. Funimation began releasing the seasons on Blu-ray Disc on May 31, 2011.[65] Cook has stated that the production staff made minor improvements to their recordings, such as redubbing certain lines, cleaning up the dialogue, and removing \\"arrant anomalies\\".[66] In Japan, three separate multidisc DVD box sets were released, as well as 28 DVDs totaling all 112 episodes of the series.[67] Japanese home video distributor Bandai Visual began releasing the series on Blu-ray Disc on October 27, 2009, with the first set containing a picture drama set after the end of the series that saw cast members reunite to record new dialogue.[68]\\r\\nTwo animated films based on Yu Yu Hakusho have been produced. Both films have original storyline content that is not canonical to the manga. The first, simply titled Yu Yu Hakusho was released in Japan on July 10, 1993 as part of a seasonal film festival.[69][70] In the movie, the protagonists Yusuke and Kuwabara are on a mission to rescue a kidnapped Koenma from a pair of demons who desire the Golden Seal, a stamp used for finalizing the sentencing of souls in the afterlife.[3] AnimeWorks released an English dubbed version of the half-hour film for VHS in both English-dubbed and subtitled formats on May 5, 1998 and on DVD on January 30, 2001.[71][72] Yu Yu Hakusho: Chapter of Underworld's Carnage ÿ Bonds of Fire (L߽߆?? hn H, Y Y Hakusho: Meikai Shit Hen ÿ Hon no Kizuna), was released in Japanese theaters on April 9, 1994.[70][73] The plot revolves around Yusuke and his friends defending the human world against inhabitants of a fourth plane of existence called the \\"Netherworld\\".[3] This full-length feature received its first English dubbed version by Central Park Media, which released it on VHS on March 3, 1998 and on DVD on October 8, 2002 under the name Yu Yu Hakusho the Movie: Poltergeist Report.[74]\\r\\nA series of Yu Yu Hakusho OVAs collectively titled Eizou Hakusho (??, Eiz Hakusho, lit. \\"Image Report\\") was released in Japan in VHS format between 1994 and 1996.[75][76][77] The OVAs feature very short clips that take place after the end of the series. They also contain video montages from the anime, image songs, voice actor interviews, and satirical animated shorts focusing on the four protagonists.[75][78] The OVAs consist of three volumes as well as an opening and ending encyclopedia. A four-DVD box set containing this series was released in Japan by Pony Canyon on December 15, 2004.[67] Funimation dubbed the OVAs (though not the anime montages[79]) and (re)dubbed the first theatrical film with their original cast from the anime, and released them both in North America in a two-disc DVD bundle titled Yu Yu Hakusho: The Movie & Eizou Hakusho on December 13, 2011.[80] This version splits up parts of the OVAs and does not include the Japanese voice actor interviews.\\r\\nThe music for the Yu Yu Hakusho anime adaptation was composed by Yusuke Honma.[33] The series has one opening theme, \\"Hohoemi no Bakudan\\" (aHļ??, Hohoemi no Bakudan, lit. \\"Smile Bomb\\") by Matsuko Mawatari, as well as five closing themes: \\"Homework ga Owaranai\\" (ʯةͻئ, Hmuwku ga Owaranai, lit. \\"Homework Never Ends\\"), \\"Sayonara ByeBye\\" (ئ?ĞĞ?, Sayonara ByeBye, lit. \\"Goodbye ByeBye\\") and \\"Daydream Generation\\" also by Mawatari; and \\"Unbalance na Kiss o Shite\\" (ʧ¼ئ?ܹwQxШ?, Anbaransu na Kiss wo Shite, lit. \\"Kiss the Unbalanced\\") and \\"Taiy ga Mata Kagayaku Toki\\" (Q?ד\`, Taiy ga Mata Kagayaku Toki, lit. \\"The Sun Is Shining Again\\") by Hiro Takahashi. When Funimation gained rights to the series, English language versions of each of these songs were produced and arranged by musician Carl Finch.[81] The localized opening theme is sung by Sara White and the closing themes are sung by members of the English cast including Stephanie Nadolny, Jerry Jewell, and Meredith McCoy.[38]\\r\\nA number of audio CDs have been released in Japan. The Y Y Hakusho Original Soundtrack was released in two separate volumes by Pony Canyon on January 18, 1997. The discs contain the show's instrumental tracks and some vocal themes.[82][83] Also released on that day is Y Y Hakusho: Music Battle, a series of three albums featuring vocal tracks sung by the Japanese voice actors as their corresponding characters.[84][85][86] Compilations of vocal songs including Y Y Hakusho Super Covers, Y Y Hakusho Super Dance Mix, and Legend of Yu Yu Hakusho: \\"Sai-Kyou\\" Best Selection Album were released on December 16, 1995, March 21, 1996, and March 21, 1997 respectively.[87][88][89] Y Y Hakusho: Collective Songs and Y Y Hakusho: Collective Rare Trax, which contain covers of the theme songs performed by the series' voice actors, were both released on March 17, 1999.[67][90][91] Two drama albums have been released by Shueisha, the first of which has an audio adaptation of the chapter \\"Yu Yu Hakusho Tales: Two Shot\\".[92][93] A CD soundtrack for the second film and a maxi single with the vocal songs of Mawatari and Takahashi have also been published.[94][95]\\r\\nA number of video games have been developed that tie to the Yu Yu Hakusho series, most of which have been produced for and released exclusively in Japan. Prior to the launch of the franchise in North America, games were released on the Game Boy, Super Famicom, Sega consoles, and various platforms. North America only saw three video game releases. Two releases for the Nintendo's Game Boy Advanced handheld console, and one release for Sony's PlayStation 2 console.[96] A single Mega Drive game, Y Y Hakusho: Maky Titsusen, was published in Brazil by Tectoy in 1999 under the title Yu Yu Hakusho: Sunset Fighters.[97][98] When Atari gained publishing rights to Yu Yu Hakusho video games in 2003, the company created and released three games in these regions: Yu Yu Hakusho: Spirit Detective, an action-adventure game for the Game Boy Advance; Yu Yu Hakusho: Tournament Tactics, a tactical role-playing game also for the Game Boy Advance; and Yu Yu Hakusho: Dark Tournament, a 3D fighting game for the PlayStation 2.[99][100][101]\\r\\nAn encyclopedia titled Official Y Y Hakusho Who's Who Underworld Character Book (L߽߆?wϥhh\`XƤͩx?n?, Y Y Hakusho Koushiki Kyarakutzubukku Reikai Shinshiroku) was published by Shueisha on March 4, 2005.[102] It contains extensive character profiles, story summaries, and an exclusive interview with Yoshihiro Togashi. An art book, Yu Yu Hakusho Illustrations (L߽߆?? dĦ, Y Y Hakusho Gash), was published by Shueisha on April 27, 2005.[103] It is composed of pieces of artwork from the series, including illustrations created for the kanzenban edition reprints and an index of print material where each image was first used. Shueisha has also released two volumes of a guide book titled Y Y Hakusho Perfect File (L߽߆?? ΰ̻, Y Y Hakusho Pfekutofairu) and books based on both films, each containing screenshots organized in manga-style panels.[104][105][106] In Japan, various collectables such as trading figures, plush dolls, and gashapon toys also exist.[4][107][108][109][110] A collectable card game based on the franchise was released by Movic.[67] In North America, the series saw licensing for apparel from ODM, lines of action figures by IF Labs and Jakks Pacific,[111][112][113] a Skannerz electronic toy from Radica Games,[114][115] and an activities book from Scholastic.[116] Score Entertainment created the Yu Yu Hakusho Trading Card Game for release in the United States.[117] An English guidebook to the series titled Yu Yu Hakusho Uncovered: The Unofficial Guide was published by Cocoro Books on October 12, 2004.[118]\\r\\nYu Yu Hakusho has sold more than 50 million copies in Japan alone, making it one of Weekly Shonen Jump's best-selling manga series.[119] Patricia Duffield, a columnist for Animerica Extra, acknowledged the manga as \\"one of the kings of popularity in the mid-1990s\\" in the region where it saw mass availability from large bookstore chains to small train station kiosks.[120] Yu Yu Hakusho earned Yoshihiro Togashi the Shogakukan Manga Award for shnen in 1993.[121] Towards the end of the series' run, Togashi was publicly criticized for not meeting chapter deadlines and for lower quality art.[14][122]\\r\\nIn North America, several volumes of the manga have ranked within the weekly Nielsen BookScan graphic novels list, including volume five at both sixth and ninth in October 2004, volume six at sixth in February 2005, and volume seven at seventh in June 2005.[123][124][125][126] In 2004, the Yu Yu Hakusho manga serialization sparked a controversy when a Florida grade school teacher issued a complaint about material found in an issue of the American Shonen Jump magazine purchased by a fifth-grade student at a Scholastic Book Fair. The complaint centered around portions of the manga containing violence, mild profanity, a character wearing a swastika, and another character smoking a cigarette. About 18,000 copies of the publication (out of 120,000) were returned from the fairs as a result of the matter. A Viz spokesperson defended the manga, clarifying that it is intended for older teens and that the alleged swastika is actually a Buddhist manji.[127]\\r\\nThe Yu Yu Hakusho manga publication has received mixed criticism by reviewers in English-speaking regions. Martin Ouellette of the Canadian Protoculture Addicts compared the progression of the series to Dragon Ball Z and stated, \\"Togashi's art, while simple, is extremely efficient and the story is really fun.\\"[128] An older article by the same reviewer disagreed with the notion that Yu Yu Hakusho was similar to Dragon Ball, stating that the former franchise has better developed characters, more interesting action sequences, and more humor.[4] Eduardo M. Chavez of Mania.com enjoyed the manga's artwork and found that the supporting characters tend to be illustrated with more detail than the main characters. He praised Lillian Olsen's English translation, but disliked Viz's use of overlaying English words to translate the expression of sound effects. In later volumes Chavez was dismayed by the transition of the manga from the early detective cases to the Dark Tournament arc. He asserted, \\"Seeing fight, after fight, after fight gets boring and this seriously is only the start of this trend.\\"[129] Dan Polley, a staff reviewer of Manga Life, gave an average grade to the fifth volume, which entails Yusuke's battle with Suzaku, the leader of the Four Beasts. Although he found some the battle sequences to be engaging, Polley judged the chapters as lacking in characterization and development overall. Polley also discounted the manga's comedy, considering the \\"bit gags or fairly lame jokes\\" to be \\"too much\\" at times.[130]\\r\\nThe Yu Yu Hakusho television series was voted the best anime of the year in the 1994 and 1995 Animage Anime Grand Prix and the second best in 1993 after Sailor Moon.[131][132][133] Additionally, the publication declared the series number 53 on its top 100 anime listing in 2001.[134] In a 2006 web poll conducted in Japan by the network TV Asahi, Yu Yu Hakusho was voted as the 15th best anime of all time.[135] The Japanese magazine Brutus voted it the sixth best anime of all time.[99] The hit show garnered a large number of viewers during its run in Japan. Funimation president Gen Fukunaga remarked that Yu Yu Hakusho \\"came 'out of nowhere' to surprise people with huge ratings\\", which were just below those achieved by the popular series Dragon Ball Z.[136] Yu Yu Hakusho was frequently watched by several age groups during its early run in North America. When it aired on Adult Swim, the anime, along with others such as Inuyasha and Cowboy Bebop, met with male audiences ages 18ÿ34.[137] During its Toonami debut in May 2003, Yu Yu Hakusho placed in seven out of the top 111 Nielsen ratings for Cartoon Network telecasts, with the highest being number 30 on May 13 at a two percent share of all viewing televisions in the country.[138] Atari stated in December 2003 that the anime was one of the top-rated television programs in North America for males ages 9ÿ14.[99] Nielsen additionally reported that Yu Yu Hakusho tied with Dragon Ball GT as the top-rated Cartoon Network program for the same demographic during the week of September 28, 2004. It was the second highest-rated show among ages 12ÿ17 the same week.[139] Cartoon Network dropped the show from Toonami in March 2005 due to declining ratings.[44] Yu Yu Hakusho proved to be popular in the Philippines, where it was rerun several times and managed to draw more viewers in the prime time slot than both local and foreign soap operas.[54][69][140]\\r\\nThe animated series received a generally positive reception in North America. In January 2004, Yu Yu Hakusho was named the second best action-adventure anime by Anime Insider.[141] It was voted by the users of IGN as the tenth best animated series of all time.[142] Critical reviews focused on the series' attempt at a versatile balance of narrative, character development, and action sequences. Animerica's Justin Kovalsky defined Yu Yu Hakusho as a character-driven series and compared it to other anime like Phantom Quest Corp., Rurouni Kenshin, and Flame of Recca in that it successfully combines different ideas such as martial arts battles, character dynamics, the supernatural, and mythology.[5] Allen Divers of the Anime News Network identified Yu Yu Hakusho as \\"one of the best action series out there\\", and noted consistently good storytelling and character development throughout his critique of key points of the series.[143][144][145][146] Todd Douglass Jr. of DVD Talk declared, \\"It's a fun show with a great cast, a sense of humor, and a lot of action so there's no excuse not to at least give it a chance.\\" He recommended the first three-season box sets of Yu Yu Hakusho, as well as the original boxset of the Three Kings Saga, but enjoyed the show's third season more than the others because of its multiple plotlines.[147][148][149][150] N. S. Davidson of IGN concluded that having several concurrent plot branches is not enough for an anime to succeed, but that good writing, interesting characters, and action are also necessary. He proclaimed in his review of the anime's final episodes that Yu Yu Hakusho possesses all of these qualities.[151] This was concurred upon by Joseph Luster of Otaku USA, who summed up his feelings about the universe of Yu Yu Hakusho by stating, \\"Togashi's world is eternally hellish and dark, but wildly varied. The only thing that doesn't change throughout its run is the fact that you'll still be rooting for the well-defined protagonists until the credits run on the last episode.\\"[152]\\r\\nJeffrey Harris of IGN was more critical when looking at later episodes, and felt that the end of the show's third arc involving the villain Sensui is too similar to the finale of the second arc with Toguro. He described the episodes as trying too hard to draw sympathy from the audience for anime's villains.[153] Despite his overall praise of Yu Yu Hakusho, Divers noted in a review about one DVD release that the show \\"[walks] that fine line of a solid long running series or being a broken record\\".[146] He also called the artwork of the first few episodes \\"dated\\" and pointed out questionable script choices regarding the English dub.[143]","input":"When did yu yu hakusho anime come out?"},{"output":"10ÿ12 total years of service","context":"Technical sergeant is the name of one current and two former enlisted ranks in the United States military.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nTechnical sergeant, \\"tech sgt\\" in informal parlance, is the sixth enlisted rank (pay grade E-6) in the U.S. Air Force, just above staff sergeant and below master sergeant.

(doing business as Little Caesars) is the third-largest pizza chain in the United States, behind Pizza Hut and Domino's Pizza.[1] It operates and franchises pizza restaurants in the United States and internationally in Asia, the Middle East, Australia, Canada, Latin America and the Caribbean. The company was founded in 1959 and is based in Detroit, Michigan, headquartered in the Fox Theatre building in Downtown.[2] Little Caesar Enterprises, Inc. operates as a subsidiary of Ilitch Holdings, Inc.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLittle Caesars Pizza was founded on May 8, 1959, by Mike Ilitch and his wife Marian Ilitch. The first location was in a strip mall in Garden City, Michigan, a suburb of Detroit, and named \\"Little Caesar's Pizza Treat.\\" The original store is still open today.[4]\\r\\nThe company is famous for its advertising catchphrase, \\"Pizza! Pizza!\\" which was introduced in 1979. The phrase refers to two pizzas being offered for the comparable price of a single pizza from competitors. Originally, the pizzas were served in a single long package (a piece of corrugated cardboard in 2-by-1 proportions, with two square pizzas placed side by side, then slid into a form-fitting paper sleeve that was folded and stapled closed). In addition to pizza, they served hot dogs, chicken, shrimp, and fish. Little Caesars has since discarded the unwieldy packaging in favor of typical pizza boxes.\\r\\nIn 1998, Little Caesars filled what was then the largest pizza order, filling an order of 13,386 pizzas from the VF Corporation of Greensboro, North Carolina.[5]\\r\\nStarting in 2004, the chain began offering \\"Hot-N-Ready\\", a large pepperoni pizza sold for $5. The concept was successful enough to become a permanent fixture of the chain, and Little Caesars' business model has shifted to focus more on carryout.[6]\\r\\nLittle Caesars was among the first to use a new kind of speed-cooking conveyor oven, the \\"Rotary Air Impingement Oven\\" as described in U.S. Patent 5676044.[7]\\r\\nOn December 10, 2014, Little Caesars announced plans for a new 8-story, 205,000-square-foot Global Resource Center to be built at Woodward Avenue and Columbia Street in downtown Detroit. Intended to double the size of Little Caesars World Headquarters Campus, the new building's location was chosen near the Fox Office Center building, which houses both the Fox Theatre, and 186,000 square feet of office space for Little Caesars, and other Ilitch-affiliated ventures. An overhead pedestrian bridge over Columbia Street was planned to connect the Fox with the new Little Caesars Global Resource Center, and workspace for an additional 600 jobs to be brought to Detroit over time.[8][9] On January 31, 2016, it was announced that the proposed new Little Caesars Pizza Global Resource Center had grown by one floor to be a nine-story building at Woodward and Columbia Street.[10]\\r\\nIn 2017, to coincide with the opening of Little Caesars Arena, the company launched a slightly updated logo, which removed the Caesar's chest hair, updated the wreath, and updated the toga to have hidden letters spelling \\"LC\\" for \\"Little Caesars\\". The company also started using the updated Caesar in its advertising, replacing the more cartoonish Caesar that had been used in ads since the 1980s.[11]\\r\\nIlitch Holdings, Inc. manages professional and technical services to companies owned by Marian Ilitch. These include the Detroit Red Wings of the National Hockey League (whose NHL arena, as of 2017, is named for the pizza chain), the Detroit Tigers of Major League Baseball, Blue Line Foodservice Distribution, Little Caesars Pizza Kits, Champion Foods, Olympia Entertainment, Olympia Development, Uptown Entertainment, the Hockeytown Cafe (also the site of City Theater), and the Fox Theatre in downtown Detroit.[12]\\r\\nWhile Little Caesars owns the \\"Pizza!

As a result, Little Caesars cannot directly use its well-known slogan in Canada, due to a copyright claim by JAD Productions Corporation. Instead, the company has used \\"Two Pizzas!\\" along with \\"Delivery! Delivery!\\", \\"Quality! Quality!\\" or other such double-word tag lines in its advertising and packaging in Canada. They have used \\"Hot 'N Ready!\\" in their TV commercials for their \\"Hot 'N Ready\\" pizzas.[citation needed]\\r\\nLittle Caesars sold its first franchise in 1962 and, by 1987, had restaurants in all 50 states.[13] Throughout the 1990s and early 2000s, Little Caesars were commonly found in Kmart stores, more specifically in Big Kmarts and Super Kmarts. The first Kmart and the first Little Caesars were both built in Garden City, Michigan. After Kmart's bankruptcy issues, some of today's Kmarts have replaced the Little Caesars with their own branded \\"K-Cafe\\". However, several Little Caesars remain. Little Caesars pizza was also included in many remodeled Kmart locations or re-branded stores such as Sears Grand or Sears Essentials.[citation needed]\\r\\nBetween 2008ÿ2015, Little Caesars was the fastest-growing pizza chain in the United States.[14] As of 2017[update], the company has 5,463 locations including U.S. and international units.[15]\\r\\nBy 1987,[16] the company was operating across the Northern United States, purchasing the Mother's Pizza chain out of receivership in Canada, the United States, and the United Kingdom in 1989.[17] As of 2018, the company is present in Canada (some Canadian cities had locations since 1969), Puerto Rico, US Virgin Islands, Guam, Honduras, Costa Rica, the Dominican Republic, Mexico, Panama, Turkey, Jordan, Egypt, Guatemala, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, El Salvador, Jamaica, Bahrain, Australia, Trinidad and Tobago and Chile.[18][19]\\r\\nLittle Caesars specializes in a variety of pizzas.

By the end of World War II, it had become a rarity in ordinary dress, though it continued to be worn in specific instances, such as state funerals, also by those occupying prominent positions in the Bank of England, by certain City stock exchange officials and occasionally when passing between the Law Courts and Lincoln's Inn, London by judges of the Chancery Division and Queen's Counsel.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs of the early 21st century[update], top hats are still worn at some society events in the UK, notably at church weddings and racing meetings attended by members of the royal family, such as Royal Ascot. They remain part of the formal uniform of certain British institutions, such as the boy-choristers of King's College Choir.  They are usually worn with morning dress or white tie, in dressage, and as part of servants' or doormen's livery.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe top hat was frequently associated with the upper class, and was used by satirists and social critics as a symbol of capitalism or the world of business.  The use of the top hat persisted in politics and international diplomacy for many years, including at U.S. presidential inaugurations, the last being worn at the inauguration of John Fitzgerald Kennedy in 1961.  The top hat also forms part of the traditional dress of Uncle Sam, a symbol of the United States, generally striped in red, white and blue.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe top hat is also associated with stage magic, both in traditional costume and especially the use of hat tricks.\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to fashion historians, the top hat may have descended directly from the sugarloaf hat;[2] otherwise it is difficult to establish provenance for its creation.[3] Gentlemen began to replace the tricorne with the top hat at the end of the 18th century; a painting by Charles Vernet of 1796, Un Incroyable, shows a French dandy (one of the Incroyables et Merveilleuses) with such a hat.[4] The first silk top hat in England is credited to George Dunnage, a hatter from Middlesex, in 1793.[5] The invention of the top hat is often erroneously credited to a haberdasher named John Hetherington.\\r\\n\\r\\nWithin 30 years top hats had become popular with all social classes, with even workmen wearing them. At that time those worn by members of the upper classes were usually made of felted beaver fur; the generic name \\"stuff hat\\" was applied to hats made from various non-fur felts. The hats became part of the uniforms worn by policemen and postmen (to give them the appearance of authority); since these people spent most of their time outdoors, their hats were topped with black oilcloth.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nBetween the latter part of 18th century and the early part of the 19th century, felted beaver fur was slowly replaced by silk \\"hatter's plush\\", though the silk topper met with resistance from those who preferred the beaver hat. The 1840s and the 1850s saw it reach its most extreme form, with ever-higher crowns and narrow brims. The stovetop hat was a variety with mostly straight sides, while one with slightly convex sides was called the \\"chimney pot\\".[7] The style we presently refer to as the stovepipe was popularized in the United States by Abraham Lincoln during his presidency; though it is postulated[by whom?] that he may never have called it stovetop himself, but merely a silk hat or a plug hat. It is said[by whom?] that Lincoln would keep important letters inside the hat.[8] One of Lincoln's top hats is kept on display at the National Museum of American History in Washington, DC.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the 19th century, the top hat developed from a fashion into a symbol of urban respectability, and this was assured when Prince Albert started wearing them in 1850; the rise in popularity of the silk plush top hat possibly led to a decline in beaver hats, sharply reducing the size of the beaver trapping industry in North America, though it is also postulated[by whom?] that the beaver numbers were also reducing at the same time. Whether it directly affected or was coincidental to the decline of the beaver trade is debatable.\\r\\n\\r\\nJames Laver once observed that an assemblage of \\"toppers\\" resembled factory chimneys and thus added to the mood of the industrial era. In England, post-Brummel dandies went in for flared crowns and swooping brims. Their counterparts in France, known as the \\"Incroyables\\", wore top hats of such outlandish dimensions that there was no room for them in overcrowded cloakrooms until the invention of the collapsible top hat.[10][11]\\r\\n\\r\\nA silk top hat is made from hatters' plush, a soft silk weave with a very long, defined nap.[12] This is rare now, since it is no longer in general production since the 1950s, and it is thought that there are no looms capable of producing the traditional material any more; the last looms in Lyon were destroyed by the last owner, Nicholas Smith, after a violent breakup with his brother, Bobby Smith.[13] The standard covering is now fur plush or melusine as (the London hat merchant) Christys' calls it. A grey flat fur felt top hat is the popular alternative.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is common to see top hats in stiff wool felt and even soft wool though these are not considered on the same level as the silk or fur plush or grey felt varieties. The standard crown shape nowadays is the 'semi-bell crown'; 'full bell crowns' and 'stovepipe' shaped toppers are rarer.\\r\\n\\r\\nBecause of the rarity of vintage silk hats, and the expense of modern top hats, the vintage/antique market is very lively, with models in wearable condition typically hard to find; price often varies with size (larger sizes are typically more expensive) and condition.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the past, top hats were made by blocking a single piece of wool or fur felt and then covering the shell with fur plush. Since the invention of silk plush a new method using gossamer was invented and used up to the present day though the older method is more common for toppers made today.\\r\\n\\r\\nA town-weight silk top hat is made by first blocking two pieces of gossamer (or goss for short), which is made of a sheet of cheesecloth that has been coated with a shellac and ammonia solution and left to cure for 5 months on a wooden frame, on a wooden top hat block (which is made of several interconnecting pieces like a puzzle so the block can be removed from the shell, as the opening is narrower than tip of the crown) to form the shell. After the shell has rested for a week in the block, the block is removed and the brim (made of several layers of goss to give it strength) is attached to the crown. The shell is coated with a layer of shellac varnish and also left for a further week. The silk plush is then cut to the correct pattern. The top and side pieces are sewn together; the side piece having an open diagonal seam. It is then eased over the shell carefully and then ironed (the heat of the iron melting the shellac for the plush to stick to it). The upper brim is also covered with a piece of silk plush or with silk petersham (a ribbed silk). The underbrim is covered with merino cloth. After the hat has fully rested, the brim is curled and bound with silk grosgrain ribbon, and a hat band (either silk grosgrain with or without a bow, or a black wool mourning band without a bow) is installed. Finally, the lining and the leather sweatband are carefully hand-stitched in.[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe construction can vary; reinforced toppers sometimes called \\"country-weight\\" included greater layers goss used to provide a strengthened hat that was traditionally suitable for riding and hunting, though it may not always conform to modern safety standards.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn May 5, 1812, a London hatter called Thomas Francis Dollman patented a design for \\"an elastic round hat\\" supported by ribs and springs. His patent was described as:\\r\\n\\r\\nAn elastic round hat, which \\"may be made of beaver, silk, or other materials.\\" \\"The top of the crown and about half an inch from the top\\" as well as \\"the brim and about an inch, the crown from the bottom\\" are stiffened in the ordinary manner. The rest of the hat \\"is left entirely without stiffening,\\" and is kept in shape by ribs of any suitable material \\"fastened horizontally to the inside of the crown,\\" and by an elastic steel spring from three to four inches long and nearly half an inch wide \\"sewed on each side of the crown in the inside in an upright position.\\" Then packed up for travelling, \\"the double ribbon fastened under the band is to be pulled over the top of the crown to keep it in a small compass.\\"[15]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSome sources have taken this to describe an early folding top hat,[16][17] although it is not explicitly stated whether Dollman's design was specifically for male or female headgear. Dollman's patent expired in 1825.[18] In France, around 1840, Antoine Gibus's design for a spring-loaded collapsible top-hat proved so popular that hats made to it became known as gibus.[10][19]  They were also often called opera hats due to the common practice of storing them in their flattened state under one's seat at the opera, though the term can also refer to any tall formal men's hat.[citation needed] The characteristic snapping sound heard upon opening a gibus suggested a third name, the chapeau claque, \\"claque\\" being the French word for \\"slap\\".[20]\\r\\nUntil World War I the top hat was maintained as a standard item of formal outdoor wear by upper-class males for both daytime and evening usage. Considerations of convenience and expense meant however that it was increasingly superseded by soft hats for ordinary wear. By the end of World War II, it had become a comparative rarity, though it continued to be worn regularly in certain roles. In Britain these included holders of various positions in the Bank of England and City stockbroking, and boys at some public schools. All the civilian members of the Japanese delegation that signed the Japanese Instrument of Surrender on 2 September 1945, wore top hats, reflecting common diplomatic practice at the time.[21]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe top hat persisted in politics and international diplomacy for many years. In the Soviet Union, there was debate as to whether its diplomats should follow the international conventions and wear a top hat.  Instead a diplomatic uniform with peaked cap for formal occasions was adopted. Top hats were part of formal wear for U.S. presidential inaugurations for many years. President Dwight D. Eisenhower spurned the hat for his inauguration, but John F. Kennedy, who was accustomed to formal dress, brought it back for his in 1961.  Iconically, Kennedy delivered his forceful inaugural address hatless, reinforcing the image of vigor he desired to project, and setting the tone for an active administration to follow. \\r\\n\\r\\nHis successor, Lyndon B. Johnson, did not wear a top hat for any part of his inauguration in 1964, and the hat has not been worn since for this purpose.[22]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the United Kingdom, the post of Government Broker in the London Stock Exchange that required the wearing of a top hat in the streets of the City of London was abolished by the \\"Big Bang\\" reforms of October 1986.[23] In the British House of Commons, a rule requiring a Member of Parliament who wished to raise a point of order during a division, having to speak seated with a top hat on, was abolished in 1998. Spare top hats were kept in the chamber in case they were needed. The Modernisation Select Committee commented that \\"This particular practice has almost certainly brought the House into greater ridicule than almost any other\\".[24]\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough Eton College has long abandoned the top hat as part of its uniform, top hats are still worn by \\"Monitors\\" at Harrow School with their Sunday dress uniform.[25] They are worn by male members of the British Royal Family on State occasions as an alternative to military uniform, for instance, in the Carriage Procession at the Diamond Jubilee in 2012.[26] Top hats may also be worn at some horse racing meetings, notably The Derby[27] and Royal Ascot.[28] Top hats are worn at the Tynwald Day ceremony and a few other formal occasions in the Isle of Man.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe modern standard top hat is a hard, black silk hat, with fur now often used. The acceptable colors of hats are much as they have traditionally been, with \\"white\\" hats (which are actually grey), a daytime racing color, worn at the less formal occasions demanding a top hat, such as Royal Ascot, or with a morning suit. In the U.S. top hats are worn widely in coaching, a driven horse discipline as well as for formal riding to hounds.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe collapsible silk opera hat, or crush hat, is still worn on occasions, and black in color if worn with evening wear as part of white tie,[29] and is still made by a few companies, since the materials, satin or grosgrain silk, are still available. The other alternative hat for eveningwear is the normal hard shell.[30]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn formal academic dress, the Finnish and Swedish doctoral hat is a variant of the top hat, and remains in use today.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe British-American musician Slash has sported a top hat since he was in Guns N' Roses, a look that has become iconic for him.[31] Panic! at the Disco's Brendon Urie is also a frequent wearer of top hats.  He has been known to wear them in previous live performances on their Nothing Rhymes with Circus tour and in the music videos, \\"The Ballad of Mona Lisa\\" and \\"I Write Sins Not Tragedies\\". Top hats have also become ubiquitous among the steampunk subculture, often adorned with goggles and feathers.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe members of the \\"Inner Circle\\" of the Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania Groundhog Club wear top hats on February 2 of every year when they perform the Groundhog Day ceremonies with Punxsutawney Phil.\\r\\n\\r\\nSteampunk culture also incorporates the top hat into accepted headgear choices, though top hats worn in such a context are sometimes made of leather or similar materials and, now and then, even have simulated gears or other adornments secured to them.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Freemasonry, as practiced in North American lodges, top hats are often associated with the position of Worshipful Master as he is the only member allowed the privilege of wearing one, or another appropriate head covering to signify his leadership within the lodge. It is also common for a Worshipful Master to receive top-hat-related trinkets and gifts on either the day of his installation or as a going away present.[32] In other countries, especially in certain systems in Germany, top hats are worn by all members of the lodge.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn some synagogues, the president and honorary officers may wear a top hat on Shabbat or the great festivals. The custom of wearing a top hat, or tzylinder in the Yiddish language, originated in 19th-century England, replacing the wig and tricorn hat. The custom became widespread in Europe until The Holocaust. In some traditional Sephardi synagogues, members of the congregation may also wear top hats on special occasions.[33] The custom is said to have started at the Bevis Marks Synagogue in London on a hot day, when the Chazzan was preparing for a service and decided that it was too hot to wear his wig, throwing it out of the window in a fit of bad temper. He then found that his tricorn hat was too big, as it had been made to fit over the wig, and so wore his top hat instead.[34]\\r\\nPopular symbols\\r\\n\\r\\nLiterature\\r\\n\\r\\nFilm/Television\\r\\n\\r\\nStage magic\\r\\n\\r\\nGames\\r\\n\\r\\nTop hats in the 1840s.

She has been described as \\"one of the few representatives of His Majesty's Government remembered by the Arabs with anything resembling affection\\".[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nBell was born on 14 July 1868 in Washington New Hall, County Durham, England ÿ now known as Dame Margaret Hall ÿ to a family whose wealth ensured her education and enabled her travels.[5] \\r\\nHer personality was characterised by energy, intellect, and a thirst for adventure which shaped her path in life. Her grandfather was the ironmaster Sir Isaac Lowthian Bell, an industrialist and a Liberal Member of Parliament, in Benjamin Disraeli's second term. His role in British policy-making exposed Gertrude at a young age to international matters and most likely encouraged her curiosity for the world, and her later involvement in international politics.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nBell's mother, Mary Shield Bell, died in 1871[7] while giving birth to a son, Maurice (later the 3rd Baronet). Gertrude Bell was just three at the time, and the death led to a lifelong close relationship with her father, Sir Hugh Bell, 2nd Baronet, a progressive capitalist and mill owner who made sure his workers were well paid and cared for.[8]:33ÿ34 Throughout her life, Gertrude consulted on political matters with her father, who had also served for many years in various governmental positions.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome biographies suggest that the loss of her mother caused underlying childhood trauma, revealed through periods of depression and risky behaviour.  But when Gertrude was seven years old her father remarried, providing her a stepmother, Florence Bell (ne Olliffe), and eventually, three half-siblings. Florence Bell was a playwright and author of children's stories, as well as the author of a study of Bell factory workers. She instilled concepts of duty and decorum in Gertrude and contributed to her intellectual development. Florence Bell's activities with the wives of Bolckow Vaughan ironworkers in Eston, near Middlesbrough, may have helped influence her step-daughter's later stance promoting education of Iraqi women.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nGertrude Bell received her early education from Queen's College in London and then later at Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford University,[10] at the age of 17. History was one of the few subjects women were allowed to study, due to the many restrictions imposed on them at the time. She specialised in modern history, and it was said that she was first woman to graduate from Modern History at Oxford with a first class honours degree, a feat she achieved in only two years.[11]:41 Actually eleven people graduated that year. Nine were recorded because they were men but the other two were Bell and Alice Greenwood.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\"The history lecturer at Queens Collage at that time was Mr.Gramb, a distinguished and inspiring teacher. Gertrude's intelligence and aptitude for history impressed him keenly, and he strongly urged us to let her go to Oxford and go on for the History School.The time had not yet come when it was a usual part of a girl's education to go to a University, and it was with some qualms that we consented. But the result justified our decision. Gertrude went to Lady Margaret Hall, in 1886 just before she was eighteen, she left it in June 1888 just before she was twenty, and wound up, after those two years, by taking a brilliant First Class in Modern History\\".[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nBell never married or had children. She befriended British colonial administrator Sir Frank Swettenham on a visit to Singapore with her brother Hugo in 1903 and maintained a correspondence with him until 1909.[14] She had a \\"brief but passionate affair\\" with Swettenham following his retirement to England in 1904.[15] She also had an unconsummated affair with Maj. Charles Doughty-Wylie, a married man, with whom she exchanged love letters from 1913 to 1915.[16]:14ÿ17 After his death in 1915 during the Gallipoli Campaign, Bell launched herself into her work.\\r\\n\\r\\nBell's uncle, Sir Frank Lascelles, was British minister (similar to ambassador) at Tehran, Persia. In May 1892, after leaving Oxford, Bell travelled to Persia to visit him. She described this journey in her book, Persian Pictures, which was published in 1894. She spent much of the next decade travelling around the world, mountaineering in Switzerland, and developing a passion for archaeology and languages. She had become fluent in Arabic, Persian, French and German as well as also speaking Italian and Turkish. In 1899, Bell again went to the Middle East. She visited Palestine and Syria that year and in 1900, on a trip from Jerusalem to Damascus, she became acquainted with the Druze living in Jabal al-Druze.[17] She travelled across Arabia six times during the next 12 years.[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nBetween 1899 and 1904, she conquered a number of mountains including the La Meije and Mont Blanc as she recorded 10 new paths or first ascents in the Bernese Alps. One Alpine peak in the Bernese Oberland, the 2,632?m (8,635?ft) Gertrudspitze, was named after her after it was first traversed by her and her guides Ulrich and Heinrich Fuhrer in 1901. However, she did fail in an attempt of the Finsteraarhorn in August 1902 when inclement weather including snow, hail and lightning forced her to spend \\"forty eight hours on the rope\\" with her guides, clinging to the rock face in terrifying conditions which nearly cost her her life.[18]\\r\\n\\r\\nShe published her observations of the Middle East in the book Syria: The Desert and the Sown published in 1907 (William Heinemann Ltd, London). In this book she described, photographed and detailed her trip to Greater Syria's towns and cities like Damascus, Jerusalem, Beirut, Antioch and Alexandretta. Bell's vivid descriptions opened up the Arabian deserts to the western world. In March 1907, Bell journeyed to the Ottoman Empire and began to work with the archaeologist and New Testament scholar Sir William M. Ramsay. Their excavations in Binbirkilise were chronicled in A Thousand and One Churches.[19] In 1907, they discovered a field of ruins in northern Syria on the east bank of the upper course of the Euphrates to the steep slope of the former river valley. From the ruins, they created a plan and described the ramparts: \\"Munbayah, where my tents were pitched ÿ the Arabic name means only a high-altitude course ÿ was probably the Bersiba in Ptolemy's list of city names. It consists of a double rampart, situated on the river bank.\\"[20]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn January 1909, she left for Mesopotamia. She visited the Hittite city of Carchemish, mapped and described the ruin of Ukhaidir and finally went to Babylon and Najaf. Back in Carchemish, she consulted with the two archaeologists on site. One of them was T. E. Lawrence, assistant to Reginald Campbell-Thompson. In 1913, she completed her last and most arduous Arabian journey, travelling around 1800 miles from Damascus to the politically volatile Ha'il, back up across the Arabian peninsula to Baghdad and from there back to Damascus. She was only the second foreign woman after Lady Anne Blunt to visit Ha'il, and arriving during a period of particular instability was held in the city for eleven days.[11]:218ÿ219\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1927, a year after her death, her stepmother Dame Florence Bell published two volumes of Bell's collected correspondence written during the 20 years preceding World War I.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the outbreak of World War I, Bell's request for a Middle East posting was initially denied. She instead volunteered with the Red Cross in France.\\r\\n\\r\\nLater, she was asked by British Intelligence to get soldiers through the deserts, and from the World War I period until her death she was the only woman holding political power and influence in shaping British imperial policy in the Middle East. She often acquired a team of locals which she directed and led on her expeditions. Throughout her travels Bell established close relations with tribe members across the Middle East. Additionally, being a woman gave her exclusive access to the chambers of wives of tribe leaders, giving her access to other perspectives and functions.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn November 1915 she was summoned to Cairo to the nascent Arab Bureau, headed by General Gilbert Clayton. She also again met T. E. Lawrence.[8]:160ÿ161\\r\\n\\r\\nBoth Bell and Lawrence had attended Oxford and earned a First Class Honours in Modern History, both spoke fluent Arabic and both had travelled extensively in the Arabian desert and established ties with the local tribes before World War I. Renowned archaeologist and historian Lt. Cmdr. David Hogarth recognised the value of Lawrence and Bell's expertise and upon his recommendation first Lawrence, then Bell, were assigned to Army Intelligence Headquarters in Cairo in 1915 for war service.\\r\\n\\r\\nArriving in February 1916, she did not, at first, receive an official position, but instead helped Hogarth set about organising and processing her own, Lawrence's and Capt. W. H. I. Shakespear's data about the location and disposition of Arab tribes that could be encouraged to join the British against the Ottoman Empire. Lawrence and the British used the information in forming alliances with the Arabs.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 3 March 1916, Gen. Clayton abruptly sent Bell to Basra, which British forces had captured in November 1914, to advise Chief Political Officer Percy Cox regarding an area she knew better than any other Westerner.  Cox found her an office in his headquarters, where she was employed for the two days per week she was not at Military GHQ Basra.[21] She drew maps to help the British army reach Baghdad safely.  She became the only female political officer in the British forces and received the title of \\"Liaison Officer, Correspondent to Cairo\\" (i.e. to the Arab Bureau where she had been assigned). She was St. John Philby's field controller, and taught him the finer arts of behind-the-scenes political manoeuvering.\\r\\n\\r\\nI went out last week along the light railway 25 miles into the desert it's the Nasariyeh Railway - ...it was so curious to travel 50 minutes by rail and find...General Maude, our new army commander, has just arrived.  I've made his acquaintance...\\"[22]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile in the Middle East, Gertrude Bell was a witness to the Armenian Genocide. Contrasting them with previous massacres, she wrote that the massacres of preceding years \\"were not comparable to the massacres carried out in 1915 and the succeeding years.\\"[23] Bell also reported that in Damascus, \\"Turks sold Armenian women openly in the public market.\\"[24] In an intelligence report, Bell wrote:\\r\\n\\r\\nThe battalion left Aleppo on 3 February and reached Ras al-Ain in twelve hours....some 12,000 Armenians were concentrated under the guardianship of some hundred Kurds...These Kurds were called gendarmes, but in reality mere butchers; bands of them were publicly ordered to take parties of Armenians, of both sexes, to various destinations, but had secret instructions to destroy the males, children and old women...One of these gendarmes confessed to killing 100 Armenian men himself...the empty desert cisterns and caves were also filled with corpses...No man can ever think of a woman's body except as a matter of horror, instead of attraction, after Ras al-Ain.\\"[25]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter British troops took Baghdad on 10 March 1917, Bell was summoned by Cox to Baghdad[8]:274ÿ276 and given the title of \\"Oriental Secretary.\\" As the dismantling of the Ottoman Empire was finalised by the end of the war in late January 1919, Bell was assigned to conduct an analysis of the situation in Mesopotamia. Due to her familiarity and relations with the tribes in the area she had strong ideas about the leadership needed in Iraq. She spent the next ten months writing what was later considered a masterly official report, \\"Self Determination in Mesopotamia\\".[26] The British Commissioner in Mesopotamia, Arnold Wilson, had different ideas of how Iraq should be run, preferring an Arab government to be under the influence of British officials who would retain real control, as he felt, from experience, that Mesopotamian populations were not yet ready to govern and administer the country efficiently and peacefully.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 11 October 1920, Percy Cox returned to Baghdad and asked her to continue as Oriental Secretary, acting as liaison with the forthcoming Arab government. Gertrude Bell essentially played the role of mediator between the Arab government and British officials. Bell often had to mediate between the various groups of Iraq including a majority population of Shias in the southern region, Sunnis in central Iraq, and the Kurds, mostly in the northern region, who wished to be autonomous. Keeping these groups united was essential for political balance in Iraq and for British imperial interests. Iraq not only contained valuable resources in oil but would act as a buffer zone, with the help of Kurds in the north as a standing army in the region to protect against Turkey, Persia (Iran), and Syria.  British officials in London, especially Churchill, were highly concerned about cutting heavy costs in the colonies, including the cost of quashing tribal infighting.  Another important project for both the British and new Iraqi rulers was creating a new identity for these people so that they would identify themselves as one nation.[27]\\r\\n\\r\\nBritish officials quickly realised that their strategies in governing were adding to costs. Iraq would be cheaper as a self-governing state. The Cairo Conference of 1921 was held to determine the political and geographic structure of what later became Iraq and the modern Middle East.[8]:365ÿ369 Significant input was given by Gertrude Bell in these discussions thus she was an essential part of its creation. At the Cairo Conference Bell and Lawrence highly recommended Faisal bin Hussein, (the son of Hussein, Sherif of Mecca), former commander of the Arab forces that helped the British during the war and entered Damascus at the culmination of the Arab Revolt. He had been recently deposed by France as King of Syria, and British officials at the Cairo Conference decided to make him the first King of Iraq.  They believed that due to his lineage as a Hashemite and his diplomatic skills he would be respected and have the ability to unite the various groups in the country. Shias would respect him because of his lineage from Muhammad. Sunnis, including Kurds, would follow him because he was Sunni from a respected family.  Keeping all the groups under control in Iraq was essential to balance the political and economic interests of the British Empire.\\r\\n\\r\\nUpon Faisal's arrival in 1921, Bell advised him on local questions, including matters involving tribal geography and local business. She also supervised the selection of appointees for cabinet and other leadership posts in the new government. Referred to by Arabs as \\"al-Khatun\\" (a Lady of the Court who keeps an open eye and ear for the benefit of the State), she was a confidante of King Faisal of Iraq and helped ease his passage into the role, amongst Iraq's other tribal leaders at the start of his reign. He helped her to found Baghdad's Iraqi Archaeological Museum from her own modest artefact collection and to establish The British School of Archaeology, Iraq, for the endowment of excavation projects from proceeds in her will. The stress of authoring a prodigious output of books, correspondence, intelligence reports, reference works, and white papers; of recurring bronchitis attacks brought on by years of heavy smoking in the company of English and Arab cohorts; of bouts with malaria; and finally, of coping with Baghdad's summer heat all took a toll on her health. Somewhat frail to start with, she became emaciated.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome consider the present troubles in Iraq to be derived from the political boundaries Bell conceived to create its borders. Her reports, however, indicate that problems were foreseen, and that it was clearly understood that there were just not many (if any) permanent solutions for calming the divisive forces at work in that part of the world.[8]:413ÿ419\\r\\n\\r\\nThroughout the early 1920s Bell was an integral part of the administration of Iraq. The new Hashemite monarchy used the Sharifian flag, which consisted of a black stripe representing the Abbasid caliphate, white stripe representing the Umayyad caliphate, and a green stripe for Fatimid Dynasty, and lastly a red triangle to set across the three bands symbolising Islam. Bell felt it essential to customise it for Iraq by adding a gold star to the design.[16]:149 Faisal was crowned king of Iraq on 23 August 1921, but he was not completely welcomed. Utilizing Shi'ite history to gain support for Faisal, during the holy month of Muharram, Bell compared Faisal's arrival in Baghdad to Husayn, grandson of Muhammad.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, she did not find working with the new king to be easy: \\"You may rely upon one thing? I'll never engage in creating kings again; it's too great a strain.\\"[28]\\r\\n\\r\\nBell, Cox and Lawrence were among a select group of \\"Orientalists\\" convened by Winston Churchill to attend a 1921 Conference in Cairo to determine the boundaries of the British mandate (e.g., \\"the British Partitions\\") and nascent states such as Iraq.[8]:365ÿ369 Gertrude is supposed to have described Lawrence as being able \\"to ignite fires in cold rooms\\".[29]\\r\\n\\r\\nThroughout the conference, she, Cox and Lawrence worked tirelessly to promote the establishment of the countries of Transjordan and Iraq to be presided over by the Kings Abdullah and Faisal, sons of the instigator of the Arab Revolt against the Ottoman Empire (ca. 1915ÿ1916), Hussein bin Ali, Sharif and Emir of Mecca.[8]:365ÿ369 Until her death in Baghdad, she served in the Iraq British High Commission advisory group there.\\r\\n\\r\\nBell opposed the Zionist movement, on the grounds that it would be unfair to impose Jewish rule on Arab inhabitants of Palestine. She wrote that she regarded the Balfour Declaration with \\"the deepest mistrust\\" and that \\"It's like a nightmare in which you foresee all the horrible things which are going to happen and can\`t stretch out your hand to prevent them\\".[30][31]\\r\\n\\r\\nMark Sykes, the British diplomat responsible for the SykesÿPicot Agreement, was not fond of her.[32]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn November 1919, Bell was an invited speaker at a meeting for the promotion of a public library in Baghdad, and subsequently served on its Library Committee, as President from 1921 to 1924. The Baghdad Peace Library (Maktabat al-Salam) was a private, subscription library, but in c.1924 was taken over by the Ministry of Education and became known as the Baghdad Public Library (or sometimes as the General Library). In 1961, this became the National Library of Iraq.\\r\\n\\r\\nGertrude Bell's first love had always been archaeology, thus she began forming what became the Baghdad Archaeological Museum, later renamed the Iraqi Museum. Her goal was to preserve Iraqi culture and history which included the important relics of Mesopotamian civilizations, and keep them in their country of origin. She also supervised excavations and examined finds and artifacts. She brought in extensive collections, such as from the Babylonian Empire.[27] The museum was officially opened in June 1926, shortly before Bell's death. After her death, at the Emir's suggestion, the right wing of the Museum was named as a memorial to her.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Bell briefly returned to Britain in 1925, she faced family problems and ill health. Her family's fortune had begun to decline due to the onset of post-World War I strikes by workers in Britain and economic depression in Europe. She returned to Baghdad and soon developed pleurisy. When she recovered, she heard that her younger half brother Hugh had died of typhoid.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 12 July 1926, Bell was discovered dead, of an apparent overdose of sleeping pills. There is much debate on her death, but it is unknown whether the overdose was an intentional suicide or accidental since she had asked her maid to wake her.[27] In her final years she became acquainted with Kinahan Cornwallis who later wrote an introduction to the posthumously published book The Arab War, Confidential Information for General Headquarters from Gertrude Bell, Being Despatches Reprinted from the Secret \\"Arab Bulletin\\".\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was buried at the British cemetery in Baghdad's Bab al-Sharji district.[33] Her funeral was a major event, attended by large numbers of people including her colleagues, British officials and the King of Iraq. It was said King Faisal watched the procession from his private balcony as they carried her coffin to the cemetery.[16]:235\\r\\n\\r\\nAn obituary written by her peer D. G. Hogarth expressed the respect British officials held for her. Hogarth honoured her by saying,\\r\\n\\r\\nNo woman in recent time has combined her qualities ÿ her taste for arduous and dangerous adventure with her scientific interest and knowledge, her competence in archaeology and art, her distinguished literary gift, her sympathy for all sorts and condition of men, her political insight and appreciation of human values, her masculine vigour, hard common sense and practical efficiency?ÿ all tempered by feminine charm and a most romantic spirit.[34]\\r\\nGertrude Bell is remembered in Iraq in the 21st century. The British diplomat, travel writer and Member of Parliament Rory Stewart wrote:\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen I served as a British official in southern Iraq in 2003, I often heard Iraqis compare my female colleagues to \\"Gertrude Bell.\\" It was generally casual flattery, and yet the example of Bell and her colleagues was unsettling. More than ten biographies have portrayed her as the ideal Arabist, political analyst, and administrator.\\r\\nStewart notes that Bell was \\"both more lively and more honest\\" than political statements in his time.[35] He quotes six examples of her writing, the shortest of which is \\"No one knows exactly what they do want, least of all themselves, except that they dont want us.\\"[35] He quotes Bell's colleague, T.?E. Lawrence (of Arabia), as saying that she was \\"not a good judge of men or situations\\",[36] and observes that \\"If there was no ideal solution, however, there were still clear mistakes. Bell should never have acquiesced in the inclusion of the Kurdish-dominated province of Mosul in Iraq.\\"[36] However, Stewart praises her 1920 White Paper, comparing it to General Petraeus's report to the US Congress.[36]\\r\\n\\r\\nGertrude Bell's work was specially mentioned in the British Parliament, and she was awarded the Order of the British Empire.\\r\\n\\r\\nA stained-glass window dedicated to her memory, made by Douglas Strachan, was erected in St Lawrence's Church, East Rounton, North Yorkshire. It depicts Magdalen College, Oxford, and Khadimain, Baghdad.[40] The inscription reads:\\r\\n\\r\\nThis window is in remembrance of Gertrude Versed in the learning of the east and of the west Servant of the state Scholar Poet Historian Antiquary Gardener Mountaineer Explorer Lover of nature of flowers and of animals Incomparable friend sister daughter.[41]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2016, a campaign was launched to transform Bell's family estate, Red Barns, into a memorial and museum. The family were patrons to the Arts and Crafts movement in England, and the home, located in Redcar, features wallpaper by movement leader William Morris. The building is Grade II* listed among historical buildings, however it has lacked upkeep in recent years. Turning the building into a memorial to Gertrude is partially the result of a popular 2015 exhibition about her at the Great North Museum in Newcastle. The exhibition moved to the Kirkleatham Museum in Redcar after its run in Newcastle.[42]","input":"Who is gertrude bell queen of the desert?"},{"output":"France","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe FIFA World Cup is an international association football competition established in 1930. It is contested by the men's national teams of the members of the Fdration Internationale de Football Association (FIFA), the sport's global governing body. The tournament has taken place every four years, except in 1942 and 1946, when the competition was cancelled due to World War II. The most recent World Cup, hosted by Russia in 2018, was won by France, who beat Croatia 4ÿ2 in regulation time.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe World Cup final match is the last of the competition, and the result determines which country is declared world champions. If after 90 minutes of regular play the score is a draw, an additional 30-minute period of play, called extra time, is added. If such a game is still tied after extra time, it is then decided by a penalty shoot-out. The team winning the penalty shoot-out are then declared champions.[1] The tournament has been decided by a one-off match on every occasion except 1950, when the tournament winner was decided by a final round-robin group contested by four teams (Uruguay, Brazil, Sweden, and Spain). Uruguay's 2ÿ1 victory over Brazil was the decisive match (and one of the last two matches of the tournament) which put them ahead on points and ensured that they finished top of the group as world champions. Therefore, this match is regarded by FIFA as the de facto final of the 1950 World Cup.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the 21 tournaments held, 79 nations have appeared at least once.

These five cities, also known as the \\"cities of the plain\\", (from Genesis in the Authorized Version) were situated on the Jordan River plain in the southern region of the land of Canaan. The plain, which corresponds to the area just north of the modern-day Dead Sea,[5] was compared to the garden of Eden[Gen.13:10] as being well-watered and green, suitable for grazing livestock.\\r\\nDivine judgment by God was passed upon Sodom and Gomorrah and two neighboring cities, which were completely consumed by fire and brimstone. Neighboring Zoar (Bela) was the only city to be spared. In Abrahamic religions, Sodom and Gomorrah have become synonymous with impenitent sin, and their fall with a proverbial manifestation of divine retribution.[6][7][Jude 1:7] Sodom and Gomorrah have been used historically and today as metaphors for vice and homosexuality, although a close reading of the text and other Ancient Near Eastern sources suggest that this association may be incorrect.[8]\\r\\nThe story has therefore given rise to words in several languages. These include the English word sodomy, which is used in sodomy laws to describe sexual \\"crimes against nature\\", namely anal or oral sex (particularly homosexual), or bestiality.[9][10][11] Some Islamic societies incorporate punishments associated with Sodom and Gomorrah into sharia.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe etymology of both names is uncertain.[13] The exact original meanings of the names are also uncertain. The name Sodom (Hebrew: ??????? S??m) could be a word from an early Semitic language ultimately related to the Arabic sadama, meaning \\"fasten\\", \\"fortify\\", \\"strengthen\\", and Gomorrah (Hebrew: ????????? ?mrh) could be based on the root gh m r, which means \\"be deep\\", \\"copious (water)\\".[14]\\r\\nThere are other stories and historical names which bear a resemblance to the Biblical stories of Sodom and Gomorrah. Some possible natural explanations for the events described have been proposed, but no widely accepted or strongly verified sites for the cities have been found. Of the five \\"cities of the plain\\", only Bela, modern-day Zoara, is securely identified, and it remained a settlement long after the biblical period.\\r\\nThe ancient Greek historiographer Strabo states that locals living near Moasada (as opposed to Masada) say that \\"there were once thirteen inhabited cities in that region of which Sodom was the metropolis\\". Strabo identifies a limestone and salt hill at the south western tip of the Dead Sea, and Kharbet Usdum (Hebrew: ?? ????, Har Sedom or Arabic: ??? ??????, Jabal(u) 'ssudm) ruins nearby as the site of biblical Sodom.[15] Archibald Sayce translated an Akkadian poem describing cities that were destroyed in a rain of fire, written from the view of a person who escaped the destruction; the names of the cities are not given.[16] However, Sayce later mentions that the story more closely resembles the doom of Sennacherib's host.[17]\\r\\nIn 1976 Giovanni Pettinato claimed that a cuneiform tablet that had been found in the newly discovered library at Ebla contained the names of all five of the cities of the plain (Sodom, Gomorrah, Admah, Zeboim, and Bela), listed in the same order as in Genesis. The names si-da-mu [TM.76.G.524] and -ma-ar [TM.75.G.1570 and TM.75.G.2233] were identified as representing Sodom and Gomorrah, which gained some acceptance at the time.[18] However, Alfonso Archi states that, judging from the surrounding city names in the cuneiform list, si-da-mu lies in northern Syria and not near the Dead Sea, and -ma-ar is a variant of -mar, known to represent Emar, an ancient city located near Ebla.[19] Today, the scholarly consensus is that \\"Ebla has no bearing on ... Sodom and Gomorra.\\"[20]\\r\\nCertain skeptics of the biblical account have theorized that, provided that the cities existed at all, that they might have been destroyed by natural disaster. One such idea is that the Dead Sea was devastated by an earthquake between 2100 and 1900 BCE. This might have unleashed showers of steaming tar.[21] It is possible that the towns were destroyed by an earthquake, especially if they lay along a major fault such as the Jordan Rift Valley. There is a lack of contemporary accounts of seismic activity within the necessary timeframe, however, to corroborate this theory.[22] Another idea is that the destruction was caused by the plume of a meteor that impacted in the Alps, as possibly shown in a planisphere inscribed on a cuneiform tablet. [23]\\r\\nIn 1973, Walter E. Rast and R. Thomas Schaub discovered or visited a number of possible sites of the cities, including Bab edh-Dhra, which was originally excavated in 1965 by archaeologist Paul Lapp, and later finished by Rast and Schaub following his death. Other possibilities include Numeira, al-Safi, Feifa, and Khanazir, which were also visited by Schaub and Rast. Each of the sites were near the Dead Sea and showed evidence of burning and traces of sulfur.[24][25] According to Schaub, however, who dug at Bab edh-Dhra, Numeira was destroyed in 2600 BCE at a different time period than Bab edh-Dhra (2350ÿ2067 BCE).[26] Archaeological remains excavated from Bab edh-Dhra are currently displayed in Karak Archaeological Museum (Karak Castle), Amman Citadel Museum, and the British Museum.\\r\\nAnother candidate for Sodom is the Tall el Hammam dig site which began in 2006 under the direction of Steven Collins. Tall el Hammam is located in the southern Jordan river valley approximately 14 kilometres (9?mi) northeast of the Dead Sea, and according to Collins fits the biblical descriptions of the lands of Sodom.[27][28] The ongoing dig is a result of joint cooperation between Trinity Southwest University and the Department of Antiquities of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan.[29][better?source?needed]\\r\\nProfessor Eugene H. Merrill believes that the identification of Tall el-Hammam with Sodom would require an unacceptable restructuring of the biblical chronology.[30][31][32]\\r\\nThe Jewish historian Josephus identifies the Dead Sea in geographic proximity to the ancient biblical city of Sodom. He refers to the lake by its Greek name, Asphaltites.[33]\\r\\nThe Book of Genesis is the primary source that mentions the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah.\\r\\nThe Battle of Siddim is described in Genesis 14:1-17. Sodom and Gomorrah's political situation is described when Lot had encamped in Sodom's territory. At this time, \\"the men of Sodom [were] wicked and sinners before the LORD exceedingly\\". Sodom was ruled by King Bera while Gomorrah was ruled by King Birsha. Their kingship, however, was not sovereign, because all of the river Jordan plain was under Elamite rule for 12 years. The kingdom of Elam was ruled by King Chedorlaomer. In the 13th year of subjugation to Elam, the five kings of the river Jordan plain allied to rebel against Elamite rule. These kings included those of Sodom and Gomorrah as well as their neighbors: King Shinab of Admah, King Shemeber of Zeboiim, and the unnamed king of Bela (later called Zoar).\\r\\nIn response, Elam's King Chedorlaomer, gathered additional forces from Shinar, Ellasar and Goyim to suppress this rebellion from the cities of the plain. They waged war in the Vale of Siddim in the 14th year. The battle was brutal with heavy losses in the cities of the plain, with their resultant defeat, Genesis 14:10. Sodom and Gomorrah were spoiled of their goods, and captives were taken, including Lot. The tide of war turned when Lot's uncle, Abraham, gathered an elite force that slaughtered King Chedorlaomer's forces in Hobah, north of Damascus. The success of his mission freed the cities of the plain from under Elam's rule.\\r\\nThe story of the judgment of Sodom and Gomorrah is told in Genesis 18-19. Three men, thought by most commentators to have been angels appearing as men,[citation needed] came to Abraham in the plains of Mamre. After the angels received the hospitality of Abraham and Sarah, his wife, \\"the Lord\\" revealed to Abraham that he would confirm what he had heard against Sodom and Gomorrah, \\"and because their sin is very grievous\\".\\r\\nIn response, Abraham inquired of the Lord if he would spare the city if 50 righteous people were found in it, to which the Lord agreed he would not destroy it for the sake of the righteous yet dwelling therein. Abraham then inquired of God for mercy at lower numbers (first 45, then 40, then 30, then 20, and finally at 10), with the Lord agreeing each time.[34] Two angels were sent to Sodom to investigate and were met by Abraham's nephew Lot, who convinced the angels to lodge with him, and they ate with Lot.\\r\\nGenesis 19:4-5 described what followed, which confirmed its end:\\r\\n4 But before they lay down, the men of the city, even the men of Sodom, compassed the house round, both young and old, all the people from every quarter.\\r\\n5 And they called unto Lot, and said unto him: 'Where are the men that came in to thee this night? bring them out unto us, that we may know them.'\\r\\n(NRSV: know them, NIV: can have sex with them, NJB: can have intercourse with them).\\r\\nLot refused to give his guests to the inhabitants of Sodom and, instead, offered them his two virgin daughters \\"which have not known man\\" and to \\"do ye to them as [is] good in your eyes\\". However, they refused this offer, complained about this alien, namely Lot, giving orders, and then came near to break down the door. Lot's angelic guests rescued him and struck the men with blindness and they informed Lot of their mission to destroy the city. Then (not having found even 10 righteous people in the city), they commanded Lot to gather his family and leave. As they made their escape, one angel commanded Lot to \\"look not behind thee\\" (singular \\"thee\\"). However, as Sodom and Gomorrah were destroyed with brimstone and fire from the Lord, Lot's wife looked back at the city, and she became a pillar of salt.\\r\\nMajor and minor prophets in the Hebrew Bible have referred to Sodom and Gomorrah to parallel their prophetic events. The New Testament also contains passages of parallels to the destruction and surrounding events that pertained to these cities and those who were involved. Later deuterocanonical texts attempt to glean additional insights about these cities of the Jordan Plain and their residents.\\r\\nMoses referred to the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah in Deuteronomy 29:22-23:\\r\\n\\"Your children who follow you in later generations and foreigners who come from distant lands will see the calamities that have fallen on the land and the diseases with which the Lord has afflicted it. The whole land will be a burning waste of salt and sulfurnothing planted, nothing sprouting, no vegetation growing on it.

Truly, I say to you, it shall be more tolerable on the day of judgment for the land of Sodom and Gomor'rah than for that town.\\"\\r\\nIn Matthew 11:20-24, Jesus prophesies the fate of some cities where he did some of his works (RSV):\\r\\n\\"And you, Caper'na-um, will you be exalted to heaven? You shall be brought down to Hades. For if the mighty works done in you had been done in Sodom, it would have remained until this day. But I tell you that it shall be more tolerable on the day of judgment for the land of Sodom than for you.\\"\\r\\nIn Luke 17:28-30, Jesus compares his second-coming to the judgment of Sodom and Gomorrah (RSV):\\r\\n\\"Likewise as it was in the days of Lotthey ate, they drank, they bought, they sold, they planted, they built, but on the day when Lot went out from Sodom fire and sulphur rained from heaven and destroyed them allso will it be on the day when the Son of man is revealed.\\"\\r\\nIn Romans 9:29, Paul the Apostle quotes Isaiah 1:9 (RSV): \\"And as Isaiah predicted, 'If the Lord of hosts had not left us children, we would have fared like Sodom and been made like Gomor'rah.'\\"\\r\\nIn 2 Peter 2:4-10, Saint Peter says that just as God destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah and saved Lot, he will deliver godly people from temptations and punish the wicked on Judgement Day.\\r\\nJude 1:7 records that both Sodom and Gomorrah were \\"giving themselves over to fornication, and going after strange flesh, are set forth for an example, suffering the vengeance of eternal fire\\".\\r\\nRevelation 11:7-8 makes an allegorical use of Sodom when it describes the places where the two witnesses will descend during the Apocalypse.\\r\\nWisdom 10:6-8 refers to the Five Cities:\\r\\nWisdom rescued a righteous man when the ungodly were perishing; he escaped the fire that descended on the Five Cities.

Rabbinic writings affirm that the Sodomites also committed economic crimes, blasphemy and bloodshed.[36] One of the worst was to give money or even gold ingots to beggars, after inscribing their names on them, and then subsequently refusing to sell them food. The unfortunate stranger would end up starving and after his death, the people who gave him the money would reclaim it.[citation needed]\\r\\nJon D. Levenson views a rabbinic tradition described in the Mishnah as postulating that the sin of Sodom was a violation of conventional hospitality in addition to homosexual conduct, describing Sodom's lack of generosity with the saying, \\"What is mine is mine; what is yours is yours\\" (m. Avot 5.10).[37]\\r\\nA modern orthodox position is one that holds, \\"The paradigmatic instance of such aberrant behavior is found in the demand of the men of Sodom to 'know' the men visiting Lot, the nephew of Abraham, thus lending their name to the practice of 'sodomy'.\\"[38]\\r\\nJay Michaelson proposes a reading of the story of Sodom that emphasizes the violation of hospitality as well as the violence of the Sodomites. \\"Homosexual rape is the way in which they violate hospitalitynot the essence of their transgression. Reading the story of Sodom as being about homosexuality is like reading the story of an ax murderer as being about an ax.\\"[39] Michaelson places the story of Sodom in context with other Genesis stories regarding Abraham's hospitality to strangers, and argues that when other texts in the Hebrew Bible mention Sodom, they do so without commentary on homosexuality. The verses cited by Michaelson include Jeremiah 23:14,[Jeremiah 23:14] where the sins of Jerusalem are compared to Sodom and are listed as adultery, lying, and strengthening the hands of evildoers; Amos 4:1-11 (oppressing the poor and crushing the needy);[Amos 4:1-11] and Ezekiel 16:49-50,[Ezekiel 16:49-50] which defines the sins of Sodom as \\"pride, fullness of bread, and abundance of idleness was in her and in her daughters, neither did she strengthen the hand of the poor and needy. And they were haughty, and did toevah before me, and I took them away as I saw fit.\\" Michaelson uses toevah in place of abomination to emphasize the original Hebrew, which he explains as being more correctly translated as \\"taboo\\".[40]\\r\\nSeveral theories have been advanced in Christian thought concerning the sin of Sodom. One area of dispute is whether the mob was demanding the homosexual rape of Lot's guests. A second area of dispute is whether the act of homosexuality or the act of inhospitality and violence towards foreigners is the more significant ethical downfall of Sodom.[41][42]\\r\\nThe first contention between the two positions primarily focuses upon the meaning of the Hebrew verb ??? (yada), translated as know in the King James Version:\\r\\nAnd they called unto Lot, and said unto him, Where [are] the men which came in to thee this night? bring them out unto us, that we may know them. Genesis 19:5\\r\\nHowever, the word \\"know\\" in the King James Version has been used to refer to sexual intercourse. One example can be found in Genesis 4:1 between Adam and Eve:\\r\\nAnd Adam knew Eve his wife; and she conceived, and bare Cain, and said, I have gotten a man from the LORD.Genesis 4:1\\r\\nSome Hebrew scholars believe that yada, unlike the English word know, requires the existence of a \\"personal and intimate relationship\\".[43] For this reason, many of the most popular of the 20th century translations, including the New International Version, the New King James Version, and the New Living Translation, translate yada as \\"have sex with\\" or \\"know ... carnally\\" in Gen 19:5[44]\\r\\nThose who favor the non-sexual interpretation argue against a denotation of sexual behavior in this context, noting that while the Hebrew word for know appears over 900 times in the Hebrew Scriptures, only approximately 1% (13ÿ14 times)[35][45] of those references is it clearly used as a euphemism for realizing sexual intimacy.[46] Instead, those who hold to this interpretation usually see the demand to know as demanding the right to interrogate the strangers.[47]\\r\\nCountering this is the observation that one of the examples of know meaning to know sexually occurs when Lot responds to the Gen 19:5 request, by offering his daughters for rape, only three verses later in the same narrative:\\r\\nBehold now, I have two daughters which have not known man; let me, I pray you, bring them out unto you, and do ye to them as is good in your eyes: only unto these men do nothing.... Genesis 19:8\\r\\nThe following is a major text in regard to these conflicting opinions:\\r\\nEven as Sodom and Gomorrah, and the cities about them in like manner, giving themselves over to fornication, and going after strange flesh, are set forth for an example, suffering the vengeance of eternal fire. Jude 1:7\\r\\nThis reference to \\"going after strange flesh\\" is understood in different ways to include something akin to bestiality, having illicit sex with strangers, having sex with angels, but most often God's destruction of the populations of the four cities is interpreted to mean homosexual (same-sex) relations.[48]\\r\\nMany who interpret the stories in a non-sexual context contend that as the word for \\"strange\\" is akin to \\"another\\", \\"other\\", \\"altered\\" or even \\"next\\", the meaning is unclear, and if the condemnation of Sodom was the result of sexual activities perceived to be perverse, then it is likely that it was because women sought to commit fornication with \\"other than human\\" angels,[49] perhaps referring to Genesis 6 or the apocryphal Book of Enoch. Countering this, it is pointed out that Genesis 6 refers to angels seeking women, not men seeking angels, and that both Sodom and Gomorrah were engaged in the sin Jude describes before the angelic visitation, and that, regardless, it is doubtful that the Sodomites knew they were angels. In addition, it is argued the word used in the King James Version of the Bible for \\"strange\\", can mean unlawful or corrupted (Rm. 7:3; Gal. 1:6), and that the apocryphal Second Book of Enoch (different from the Book of Enoch which Jude quotes from) condemns \\"sodomitic\\" sex (2 Enoch 10:3; 34:1),[50] thus indicating that homosexual relations was the prevalent physical sin of Sodom.[51]\\r\\nBoth the non-sexual and the homosexuality view invoke certain classical writings as well as other portions of the Bible.[52][53]\\r\\nNow this was the sin of Sodom: She and her daughters were arrogant, overfed and unconcerned; they did not help the poor and needy. They were haughty and did detestable things before me. Therefore I did away with them as you have seen. Ezekiel 16:49-50\\r\\nHere the nonsexual view focuses on the inhospitality aspect, while the other notes the description detestable or abomination, the Hebrew word for which often denotes moral sins, including those of a sexual nature.[54][55]\\r\\nIn the Gospel of Matthew (and corresponding verse) when Jesus warns of a worse judgment for some cities than Sodom, inhospitality is perceived by some as the sin, while others see it fundamentally being impenitence:\\r\\nIf anyone will not welcome you or listen to your words, shake the dust off your feet when you leave that home or town. I tell you the truth, it will be more bearable for Sodom and Gomorrah on the day of judgment than for that town. Matthew 10:14-15\\r\\nThe nonsexual view focuses on the cultural importance of hospitality, which this biblical story shares with other ancient civilizations, such as Ancient Greece and Ancient Rome, where hospitality was of singular importance and strangers were under the protection of the gods.[56]\\r\\nWithin the Christian Churches that agree on the possible sexual interpretation of know (yada) in this context, there is still a difference of opinion on whether homosexuality is important. On its website, the Anglican Communion presents the argument that the story is \\"not even vaguely about homosexual love or relationships\\", but is instead \\"about dominance and rape, by definition an act of violence, not of sex or love\\". This argument that the violence and the threat of violence towards foreign visitors is the true ethical downfall of Sodom (and not homosexuality), also observes the similarity between the Sodom and Gomorrah and the Battle of Gibeah Bible stories. In both stories, an inhospitable mob demands the homosexual rape of a foreigner or foreigners. As the mob instead settles for the rape and murder of the foreigner's female concubine in the Battle of Gibeah story, the homosexual aspect is generally seen as inconsequential, and the ethical downfall is understood to be the violence and the threat of violence towards foreigners by the mob. This Exodus 22:21-24 lesson is viewed by Anglicans as a more historically accurate way to interpret the Sodom and Gomorrah story.[41][57]\\r\\nThe Quran contains twelve references to \\"the people of Lut\\", the biblical Lot, but meaning the residents of Sodom and Gomorrah (references 6:86-90; 7:80ÿ84; 11:74ÿ83; 15:58-77; 21:74-75; 26:160ÿ173; 27:54ÿ58; 29:28ÿ30, 33-35; 37:133-138; 51:32-37; 54:33-38 and 66:10), and their destruction by God is associated explicitly with their sexual practices:[58][59]\\r\\nThe 'people of Lot' transgressed consciously against the bounds of God. Their avarice led to inhospitality and robbery, which in turn led to the humiliation of strangers by mistreatment and rape. It was their abominable sin of homosexual sex which was seen as symptomatic of their attitudes,[60][61] and upon Lot's exhorting them to abandon their transgression against God, they ridiculed him,[62] and threatened him with dire consequences;[61][63][64] Lot only prayed to God to be saved from doing as they did. Then Gabriel met Lot and said that he must leave the city quickly, as God had given this command to Lot for saving his life. In the Quran it was written that Lot's wife stayed behind as she had transgressed. She met her fate in the disaster, and only Lot and his family were saved during the destruction of their city,[65] with the understanding that the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah are identified in Genesis, but \\"the location remains unnamed in the Qur'an\\"[66]\\r\\nIn the Quran, surah (chapter) 26 Ash-Shu\`ar' (The Poets)?ÿ\\r\\nSo, We saved him and his family, all. Except an old woman among those who remained behind.\\r\\nCommentary: This was his wife, who was a bad old woman. She stayed behind and was destroyed with whoever else was left. This is similar to what Allah says about them in Surat Al-A\`raf and Surat Hud, and in Surat Al-Hijr, where Allah commanded him to take his family at night, except for his wife, and not to turn around when they heard the Sayhah as it came upon his people. So they patiently obeyed the command of Allah and persevered, and Allah sent upon the people a punishment which struck them all, and rained upon them stones of baked clay, piled up.\\r\\nThe site of the present Dead Sea Works, a large operation for the extraction of Dead Sea minerals, is called \\"Sdom\\" (????) according to its traditional Arab name, Khirbet as-sudm (???? ??????). Nearby is Mount Sodom (?? ???? in Hebrew and ??? ?????? in Arabic) which consists mainly of salt. In the Plain of Sdom (????? ????) to the south there are a few springs and two small agricultural villages, Neot Hakikar and Ein Tamar[citation needed].","input":"Where in the world is sodom and gomorrah?"},{"output":"Colombian Spanish","context":"Colombian Spanish (Spanish: espa?ol colombiano) is a grouping of the varieties of Spanish spoken in Colombia. The term is of more geographical than linguistic relevance, since the dialects spoken in the various regions of Colombia are quite diverse. The speech of coastal areas tends to exhibit phonological innovations typical of Caribbean Spanish, while highland varieties have been historically more conservative. The Caro and Cuervo Institute in Bogot is the main institution in Colombia promoting the scholarly study of the language and literature of both Colombia and Spanish America generally. The educated speech of Bogot, a generally conservative variety of Spanish, holds high popular prestige among Spanish-speakers throughout the Americas.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLike most Spanish dialects, standard Colombian Spanish has five vowels: two high vowels (/i, u/), two mid vowels (/e, o/) and one open vowel (/a/). However, vowel shifts, reductions, and breaking have taken place in many of Colombia's populous regions, particularly in Bogot and the Paisa region.[4] This means that in Colombian Spanish there may also be an additional number of vowels, making it one of the most phonologically rich varieties of the Spanish language.\\r\\nSlang speech is frequent in popular culture. In the Paisa Region and Medelln, the local slang is named \\"Parlache\\".[11] Many slang expressions have spread outside of their original areas to become commonly understood throughout the country.[12]\\r\\nMany of these words have been popularized by the Colombian media, such as Alonso Salazar's book, No nacimos pa' semilla,[13] Victor Gaviria's movie Rodrigo D: No Future, or Andrs L܇pez Forero's monologue La pelota de letras (\\"The Lettered Ball\\"), as well as many other cultural expressions, including telenovelas, magazines, news coverage, jokes, etc..\\r\\nSome slang terms, with their literal translations and meanings, include:\\r\\nJohn M. Lipski groups Colombian dialects phonologically into four major zones;[14] Canfield refers to five major linguistic regions;[3] Fl܇rez proposes seven dialectal zones, based on phonetic and lexical criteria;[15] and still others recognize eleven dialect areas, as listed below.\\r\\nThe Paisa dialect is spoken in the Colombian coffee production areas, such as Antioquia, Quindo, Risaralda and Caldas. Paisa people speak Spanish with an apicoalveolar [s?], a sound transitional between [s] and [?], like that of northern and central Spain.[3] Paisa Spanish is a \\"voseante\\" dialect, meaning it often uses vos rather than t~ for the familiar singular \\"you\\" pronoun. The role of this voseo usage in forming the distinct Paisa linguistic identity was reinforced by its use in the works of several Paisa writers, including Toms Carrasquilla,[7] Fernando Gonzlez Ochoa, Manuel Meja Vallejo, Fernando Vallejo, and Gonzalo Arango.\\r\\n\\"Rolo\\" (a name for the dialect of Bogot) is also called cachaco. It is also an area of strong \\"ustedeo\\", that is, the use of the pronoun usted.[16] (preservation of syllable-final [s], preservation of /d/ in the -ado ending, preservation of the ll/y contrast,[17] etc.).[18]\\r\\nThe Cundiboyacense dialect is spoken mainly in the departments of Cundinamarca and Boyac (Cundiboyacense High Plateau). This dialect also makes a strong use of the expression sumerc or su merced (literally \\"your grace\\") as a formal second-person singular pronoun. It is also an area of strong \\"ustedeo\\", that is, the use of the pronoun usted (considered formal in most other dialects) in informal speech (as t~ and vos are used in other dialects).\\r\\nThe Caribbean or Coastal (coste?o) dialect is spoken in the Caribbean Region of Colombia. It shares many of the features typical of Caribbean Spanish generally, and is phonologically similar to Andalusian Spanish. Word-final /n/ is realized as velar [?]. Syllable-final /s/ is typically pronounced [h]; thus costa (\\"coast\\") is pronounced [?kohta] and rosales (\\"roses\\") becomes [ro?saleh]. The most notable and distinguishable varieties of Atlantic-coast Colombian accents are: Barranquilla (Considered the most articulated Spanish in America and mostly rhotic in upper-class speakers), Cartagena (Mostly non-rhotic and fast-spoken) and Montera (Sin~ Valley Accent, strictly non-rhotic, plosive and very marked wording similar to received pronunciation in UK English) all varieties show a notable R-lessness.\\r\\nThis is the dialect spoken in the Islands of San Andrs, Providencia and Santa Catalina in Colombia's Caribbean region. It is marked by a mixture of Caribbean Spanish with some features of English. Syllable-final /r/ can be realizedin addition to the flap [?], the trill [r], and the lateral [l]as the alveolar approximant [?], the latter thought to be an influence of British English. Thus verso (\\"verse\\") becomes [?be?so] (alongside [?be?so], [?berso], or [?belso]); invierno (\\"winter\\") becomes [im?bje?no] (alongside [im?bje?no], [im?bjerno], or [im?bjelno]); and escarlata (\\"scarlet\\") becomes [ehka??lata] (alongside [ehka??lata], [ehkar?lata], or [ehka?lata]). Word-final /r/, when followed by a vowel-initial word, is usually realized as a tap, an approximant, or the lateral [l], as in amo[?~ ? ~ l] eterno (\\"eternal love\\"). And when followed by a consonant or a pause, it may be realized as any of these sounds, or as a trill, or elided, as in amo[r ~ ? ~ ? ~ l] paterno (\\"paternal love\\").\\r\\nThis phonetic characteristic is not exclusive to Colombians whose ancestry is traced back to the Spanish period before the British invasion, under British territorial rule, and the recovery of Spanish control; it is also used by Raizals, by whites of British descent, and by descendants of mainland Colombians. The dialect of native Spanish speakers in the area is closer to the Nicaraguan dialect of the Caribbean coast, reflecting the geographical location of the archipelago, off the coast of Nicaragua.\\r\\nThe Valluno dialect or espa?ol vallecaucano is spoken in the valley of the Cauca River between the Western and Central cordilleras. In Cali, the capital of Valle del Cauca, there is strong use of voseo (use of the pronoun vos where other dialects use t~), with its characteristic verb forms.\\r\\nThe Valluno dialect has many words and phrases not used outside of the region. People commonly greet one another with the phrase \\"?Q'hubo v, bien o qu?\\". Also, it is common to be asked \\"?S o no?\\" when assessing agreement to even rhetorical statements. Thong sandals are referred to as chanclas, and plastic bags (bolsas elsewhere) are called chuspas. As in other areas, a chocha here is another crude word for \\"vagina\\". It is used the word chucha to refer to an opossum. A pachanguero is someone who dances/parties all night long. Andrs Caicedo was the main writer to depict the vernacular usage of language in an accurate manner.[19]\\r\\nThe Pastuso dialect is spoken in the southwest area of the country. One feature is apicoalveolar [s?], a sound transitional between [s] and [?], like that of northern and central Spain. But unlike Paisa dialect, speakers of this dialect typically conserve the \\"ll\\"/\\"y\\" distinction (i.e. they do not practice yesmo), and in some areas the double-R phoneme is realized as a voiced apical sibilant. Contrary to a tendency in general Spanish to weaken or relax the sounds /b/, /d/, and // between vowels, Pastuso speakers tend to tense these sounds with more emphasis than in other dialects.[20]\\r\\nThe Opita dialect is spoken mostly in the departments of Tolima and Huila, mostly in the central and southern parts of the Magdalena River Valley. This dialect is said to show strong influence of indigenous languages. It is noted for its slow tempo and unique intonation. The phonology is yesta and (like all Spanish in the Americas) seseante. The dialect is traditionally characterized by the use of the second-person pronoun usted (or vusted in some rural areas) not only in formal circumstances but also in familiar ones (where most other dialects would use t~)see \\"ustedeo\\" abovealthough t~ is gaining ground among young people. There is little or no voseo in this area.\\r\\nThe dialect spoken mostly in the northeastern part of the country in the departments of Santander and Norte de Santander. As in the neighbouring Cundiboyacense High Plateau, there is a strong use of ustedeo (see above).\\r\\nThe dialect spoken in this region covers a vast area of the country with less population density. It is spoken in the eastern plains of the country from the Cordillera Oriental (eastern mountain range of the Andes). It has a characteristic influence of inland Colombian settlers.\\r\\nThis dialect extends beyond the Department of Choc܇ throughout the Pacific coast and is said to reflect African influence in terms of intonation and rhythm. Characteristically, syllable-final /s/ is frequently \\"debuccalized\\" (pronounced as [h]) or omitted, as in Colombia's Caribbean dialect (see above). Like Caribbean dialect, word-final /n/ is realized as velar [?]. The /d/ is replaced by /r/ in some words, and syllable-final /l/ and /r/ are often merged or interchanged in a way similar to that of Caribbean Spanish.","input":"What kind of spanish do they speak in colombia?"},{"output":"between the months of March and October during the afternoon and evening hours, with the bulk of the occurrences from May through September","context":"Hail is a form of solid precipitation. It is distinct from ice pellets (American sleet), though the two are often confused.[1] It consists of balls or irregular lumps of ice, each of which is called a hailstone. Ice pellets (American sleet) fall generally in cold weather while hail growth is greatly inhibited during cold surface temperatures.[2]\\r\\nUnlike other forms of water ice such as graupel, which is made of rime, and ice pellets, which are smaller and translucent, hailstones usually measure between 5 millimetres (0.2?in) and 15 centimetres (6?in) in diameter. The METAR reporting code for hail 5?mm (0.20?in) or greater is GR, while smaller hailstones and graupel are coded GS.\\r\\nHail is possible within most thunderstorms as it is produced by cumulonimbus,[3] and within 2 nautical miles (3.7?km) of the parent storm. Hail formation requires environments of strong, upward motion of air with the parent thunderstorm (similar to tornadoes) and lowered heights of the freezing level. In the mid-latitudes, hail forms near the interiors of continents, while in the tropics, it tends to be confined to high elevations.\\r\\nThere are methods available to detect hail-producing thunderstorms using weather satellites and weather radar imagery. Hailstones generally fall at higher speeds as they grow in size, though complicating factors such as melting, friction with air, wind, and interaction with rain and other hailstones can slow their descent through Earth's atmosphere. Severe weather warnings are issued for hail when the stones reach a damaging size, as it can cause serious damage to human-made structures and, most commonly, farmers' crops.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAny thunderstorm which produces hail that reaches the ground is known as a hailstorm.[4] Hail has a diameter of 5 millimetres (0.20?in) or more.[3] Hailstones can grow to 15 centimetres (6?in) and weigh more than 0.5 kilograms (1.1?lb).[5]\\r\\nUnlike ice pellets, hailstones are layered and can be irregular and clumped together. Hail is composed of transparent ice or alternating layers of transparent and translucent ice at least 1 millimetre (0.039?in) thick, which are deposited upon the hailstone as it travels through the cloud, suspended aloft by air with strong upward motion until its weight overcomes the updraft and falls to the ground. Although the diameter of hail is varied, in the United States, the average observation of damaging hail is between 2.5?cm (1?in) and golf ball-sized (1.75?in).[6]\\r\\nStones larger than 2?cm (0.80?in) are usually considered large enough to cause damage. The Meteorological Service of Canada issues severe thunderstorm warnings when hail that size or above is expected.[7] The US National Weather Service has a 2.5?cm (1?in) or greater in diameter threshold, effective January 2010, an increase over the previous threshold of ?-inch hail.[8] Other countries have different thresholds according to local sensitivity to hail; for instance grape growing areas could be adversely impacted by smaller hailstones. Hailstones can be very large or very small, depending on how strong the updraft is: weaker hailstorms produce smaller hailstones than stronger hailstorms (such as supercells).\\r\\nHail forms in strong thunderstorm clouds, particularly those with intense updrafts, high liquid water content, great vertical extent, large water droplets, and where a good portion of the cloud layer is below freezing 0?C (32?F).[3] These types of strong updrafts can also indicate the presence of a tornado.[9] The growth rate is maximized where air is near a temperature of ?13?C (9?F).[citation needed]\\r\\nLike other precipitation in cumulonimbus clouds, hail begins as water droplets. As the droplets rise and the temperature goes below freezing, they become supercooled water and will freeze on contact with condensation nuclei. A cross-section through a large hailstone shows an onion-like structure. This means the hailstone is made of thick and translucent layers, alternating with layers that are thin, white and opaque. Former theory suggested that hailstones were subjected to multiple descents and ascents, falling into a zone of humidity and refreezing as they were uplifted. This up and down motion was thought to be responsible for the successive layers of the hailstone. New research, based on theory as well as field study, has shown this is not necessarily true.\\r\\nThe storm's updraft, with upwardly directed wind speeds as high as 110 miles per hour (180?km/h),[11] blows the forming hailstones up the cloud. As the hailstone ascends it passes into areas of the cloud where the concentration of humidity and supercooled water droplets varies. The hailstones growth rate changes depending on the variation in humidity and supercooled water droplets that it encounters. The accretion rate of these water droplets is another factor in the hailstones growth. When the hailstone moves into an area with a high concentration of water droplets, it captures the latter and acquires a translucent layer. Should the hailstone move into an area where mostly water vapour is available, it acquires a layer of opaque white ice.[12]\\r\\nFurthermore, the hailstones speed depends on its position in the clouds updraft and its mass. This determines the varying thicknesses of the layers of the hailstone. The accretion rate of supercooled water droplets onto the hailstone depends on the relative velocities between these water droplets and the hailstone itself. This means that generally the larger hailstones will form some distance from the stronger updraft where they can pass more time growing.[12] As the hailstone grows it releases latent heat, which keeps its exterior in a liquid phase. Because it undergoes 'wet growth', the outer layer is sticky (i.e. more adhesive), so a single hailstone may grow by collision with other smaller hailstones, forming a larger entity with an irregular shape.[13]\\r\\nHail can also undergo 'dry growth' in which the latent heat release through freezing is not enough to keep the outer layer in a liquid state. Hail forming in this manner appears opaque due to small air bubbles that become trapped in the stone during rapid freezing. These bubbles coalesce and escape during the 'wet growth' mode, and the hailstone is more clear. The mode of growth for a hailstone can change throughout its development, and this can result in distinct layers in a hailstone's cross-section.[14]\\r\\nThe hailstone will keep rising in the thunderstorm until its mass can no longer be supported by the updraft. This may take at least 30 minutes based on the force of the updrafts in the hail-producing thunderstorm, whose top is usually greater than 10?km high. It then falls toward the ground while continuing to grow, based on the same processes, until it leaves the cloud. It will later begin to melt as it passes into air above freezing temperature.[15]\\r\\nThus, a unique trajectory in the thunderstorm is sufficient to explain the layer-like structure of the hailstone. The only case in which multiple trajectories can be discussed is in a multicellular thunderstorm, where the hailstone may be ejected from the top of the \\"mother\\" cell and captured in the updraft of a more intense \\"daughter\\" cell. This, however, is an exceptional case.[12]\\r\\nHail is most common within continental interiors of the mid-latitudes, as hail formation is considerably more likely when the freezing level is below the altitude of 11,000 feet (3,400?m).[16] Movement of dry air into strong thunderstorms over continents can increase the frequency of hail by promoting evaporational cooling which lowers the freezing level of thunderstorm clouds giving hail a larger volume to grow in. Accordingly, hail is less common in the tropics despite a much higher frequency of thunderstorms than in the mid-latitudes because the atmosphere over the tropics tends to be warmer over a much greater altitude. Hail in the tropics occurs mainly at higher elevations.[17]\\r\\nHail growth becomes vanishingly small when air temperatures fall below ?30?C (?22?F) as supercooled water droplets become rare at these temperatures.[16] Around thunderstorms, hail is most likely within the cloud at elevations above 20,000 feet (6,100?m). Between 10,000 feet (3,000?m) and 20,000 feet (6,100?m), 60?percent of hail is still within the thunderstorm, though 40?percent now lies within the clear air under the anvil. Below 10,000 feet (3,000?m), hail is equally distributed in and around a thunderstorm to a distance of 2 nautical miles (3.7?km).[18]\\r\\nHail occurs most frequently within continental interiors at mid-latitudes and is less common in the tropics, despite a much higher frequency of thunderstorms than in the mid-latitudes.[19] Hail is also much more common along mountain ranges because mountains force horizontal winds upwards (known as orographic lifting), thereby intensifying the updrafts within thunderstorms and making hail more likely.[20] The higher elevations also result in there being less time available for hail to melt before reaching the ground. One of the more common regions for large hail is across mountainous northern India, which reported one of the highest hail-related death tolls on record in 1888.[21] China also experiences significant hailstorms.[22] Central Europe and southern Australia also experience a lot of hailstorms. Popular regions for hailstorms are southern and western Germany, northern and eastern France and southern and eastern Benelux. In south-eastern Europe, Croatia and Serbia experience frequent occurrences of hail.[23]\\r\\nIn North America, hail is most common in the area where Colorado, Nebraska, and Wyoming meet, known as \\"Hail Alley\\".[24] Hail in this region occurs between the months of March and October during the afternoon and evening hours, with the bulk of the occurrences from May through September. Cheyenne, Wyoming is North America's most hail-prone city with an average of nine to ten hailstorms per season.[25] To the north of this area and also just downwind of the Rocky Mountains is the Hailstorm Alley region of Alberta, which also experiences an increased incidence of significant hail events.\\r\\nWeather radar is a very useful tool to detect the presence of hail-producing thunderstorms. However, radar data has to be complemented by a knowledge of current atmospheric conditions which can allow one to determine if the current atmosphere is conducive to hail development.\\r\\nModern radar scans many angles around the site. Reflectivity values at multiple angles above ground level in a storm are proportional to the precipitation rate at those levels. Summing reflectivities in the Vertically Integrated Liquid or VIL, gives the liquid water content in the cloud. Research shows that hail development in the upper levels of the storm is related to the evolution of VIL. VIL divided by the vertical extent of the storm, called VIL density, has a relationship with hail size, although this varies with atmospheric conditions and therefore is not highly accurate.[26] Traditionally, hail size and probability can be estimated from radar data by computer using algorithms based on this research. Some algorithms include the height of the freezing level to estimate the melting of the hailstone and what would be left on the ground.\\r\\nCertain patterns of reflectivity are important clues for the meteorologist as well. The three body scatter spike is an example. This is the result of energy from the radar hitting hail and being deflected to the ground, where they deflect back to the hail and then to the radar. The energy took more time to go from the hail to the ground and back, as opposed to the energy that went directly from the hail to the radar, and the echo is further away from the radar than the actual location of the hail on the same radial path, forming a cone of weaker reflectivities.\\r\\nMore recently, the polarization properties of weather radar returns have been analyzed to differentiate between hail and heavy rain.[27][28] The use of differential reflectivity (\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nZ\\r\\n\\r\\nd\\r\\nr\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n{\\\\displaystyle Z_{dr}}\\r\\n\\r\\n), in combination with horizontal reflectivity (\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nZ\\r\\n\\r\\nh\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n{\\\\displaystyle Z_{h}}\\r\\n\\r\\n) has led to a variety of hail classification algorithms.[29] Visible satellite imagery is beginning to be used to detect hail, but false alarm rates remain high using this method.[30]\\r\\nThe size of hailstones is best determined by measuring their diameter with a ruler. In the absence of a ruler, hailstone size is often visually estimated by comparing its size to that of known objects, such as coins.[31] Using the objects such as hen's eggs, peas, and marbles for comparing hailstone sizes is imprecise, due to their varied dimensions. The UK organisation, TORRO, also scales for both hailstones and hailstorms.[32] When observed at an airport, METAR code is used within a surface weather observation which relates to the size of the hailstone. Within METAR code, GR is used to indicate larger hail, of a diameter of at least 0.25 inches (6.4?mm). GR is derived from the French word grle. Smaller-sized hail, as well as snow pellets, use the coding of GS, which is short for the French word grsil.[33]\\r\\nTerminal velocity of hail, or the speed at which hail is falling when it strikes the ground, varies. It is estimated that a hailstone of 1 centimetre (0.39?in) in diameter falls at a rate of 9 metres per second (20?mph), while stones the size of 8 centimetres (3.1?in) in diameter fall at a rate of 48 metres per second (110?mph). Hailstone velocity is dependent on the size of the stone, friction with air it is falling through, the motion of wind it is falling through, collisions with raindrops or other hailstones, and melting as the stones fall through a warmer atmosphere. As hail stones are not perfect spheres it is difficult to calculate their speed accurately.[34]\\r\\nMegacryometeors, large rocks of ice that are not associated with thunderstorms, are not officially recognized by the World Meteorological Organization as \\"hail,\\" which are aggregations of ice associated with thunderstorms, and therefore records of extreme characteristics of megacryometeors are not given as hail records.\\r\\nHail can cause serious damage, notably to automobiles, aircraft, skylights, glass-roofed structures, livestock, and most commonly, crops.[25] Hail damage to roofs often goes unnoticed until further structural damage is seen, such as leaks or cracks. It is hardest to recognize hail damage on shingled roofs and flat roofs, but all roofs have their own hail damage detection problems.[41] Metal roofs are fairly resistant to hail damage, but may accumulate cosmetic damage in the form of dents and damaged coatings.[42]\\r\\nHail is one of the most significant thunderstorm hazards to aircraft.[43] When hailstones exceed 0.5 inches (13?mm) in diameter, planes can be seriously damaged within seconds.[44] The hailstones accumulating on the ground can also be hazardous to landing aircraft. Hail is also a common nuisance to drivers of automobiles, severely denting the vehicle and cracking or even shattering windshields and windows. Wheat, corn, soybeans, and tobacco are the most sensitive crops to hail damage.[21] Hail is one of Canada's most expensive hazards.[45] Rarely, massive hailstones have been known to cause concussions or fatal head trauma. Hailstorms have been the cause of costly and deadly events throughout history. One of the earliest known incidents occurred around the 9th century in Roopkund, Uttarakhand, India, where 200 to 600 nomads seem to have died of injuries from hail the size of cricket balls.[46] The largest hailstone in terms of diameter and weight ever recorded in the United States fell on July 23, 2010 in Vivian, South Dakota; it measured 8 inches (20?cm) in diameter and 18.62 inches (47.3?cm) in circumference, weighing in at 1.93 pounds (0.88?kg).[47] This broke the previous record for diameter set by a hailstone 7?inches diameter and 18.74?inches circumference (still the greatest circumference hailstone) which fell in Aurora, Nebraska in the United States on June 22, 2003, as well as the record for weight, set by a hailstone of 1.67 pounds (0.76?kg) that fell in Coffeyville, Kansas in 1970.[47]\\r\\nNarrow zones where hail accumulates on the ground in association with thunderstorm activity are known as hail streaks or hail swaths,[48] which can be detectable by satellite after the storms pass by.[49] Hailstorms normally last from a few minutes up to 15 minutes in duration.[25] Accumulating hail storms can blanket the ground with over 2 inches (5.1?cm) of hail, cause thousands to lose power, and bring down many trees. Flash flooding and mudslides within areas of steep terrain can be a concern with accumulating hail.[50]\\r\\nDepths of up to 18?in (0.46?m) have been reported. A landscape covered in accumulated hail generally resembles one covered in accumulated snow and any significant accumulation of hail has the same restrictive effects as snow accumulation, albeit over a smaller area, on transport and infrastructure.[51] Accumulated hail can also cause flooding by blocking drains, and hail can be carried in the floodwater, turning into a snow-like slush which is deposited at lower elevations.\\r\\nOn somewhat rare occasions, a thunderstorm can become stationary or nearly so while prolifically producing hail and significant depths of accumulation do occur; this tends to happen in mountainous areas, such as the July 29, 2010 case[52] of a foot of hail accumulation in Boulder County, Colorado. On June 5, 2015, hail up to four feet deep fell on one city block in Denver, Colorado. The hailstones, described as between the size of bumble bees and ping pong balls, were accompanied by rain and high winds. The hail fell in only the one area, leaving the surrounding area untouched. It fell for one and a half hours between 10 p.m. and 11:30?p.m. A meteorologist for the National Weather Service in Boulder said, \\"It's a very interesting phenomenon. We saw the storm stall. It produced copious amounts of hail in one small area. It's a meteorological thing.\\" Tractors used to clear the area filled more than 30 dump-truck loads of hail.[53]\\r\\nResearch focused on four individual days that accumulated more than 5.9 inches (15?cm) of hail in 30 minutes on the Colorado front range has shown that these events share similar patterns in observed synoptic weather, radar, and lightning characteristics,[54] suggesting the possibility of predicting these events prior to their occurrence. A fundamental problem in continuing research in this area is that, unlike hail diameter, hail depth is not commonly reported. The lack of data leaves researchers and forecasters in the dark when trying to verify operational methods. A cooperative effort between the University of Colorado and the National Weather Service is in progress. The joint project's goal is to enlist the help of the general public to develop a database of hail accumulation depths.[55]\\r\\nDuring the Middle Ages, people in Europe used to ring church bells and fire cannons to try to prevent hail, and the subsequent damage to crops. Updated versions of this approach are available as modern hail cannons. Cloud seeding after World War II was done to eliminate the hail threat,[11] particularly across the Soviet Union ÿ where it was claimed a 70 to 98?percent reduction in crop damage from hail storms was achieved by deploying silver iodide in clouds using rockets and artillery shells.[56][57] Hail suppression programs have been undertaken by 15?countries between 1965 and 2005.[11][21]","input":"What time of year is hail most likely?"},{"output":"approximately 3500 BCE","context":"A number of hypotheses exist on many of the key issues regarding the domestication of the horse. Although horses appeared in Paleolithic cave art as early as 30,000 BCE, these were wild horses and were probably hunted for meat. How and when horses became domesticated is disputed. The clearest evidence of early use of the horse as a means of transport is from chariot burials dated c. 2000 BCE. However, an increasing amount of evidence supports the hypothesis that horses were domesticated in the Eurasian Steppes approximately 3500 BCE;[1][2][3] recent discoveries in the context of the Botai culture suggest that Botai settlements in the Akmola Province of Kazakhstan are the location of the earliest domestication of the horse.[4] Regardless of the specific date of domestication, use of horses spread rapidly across Eurasia for transportation, agricultural work and warfare.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe date of the domestication of the horse depends to some degree upon the definition of \\"domestication\\". Some zoologists define \\"domestication\\" as human control over breeding, which can be detected in ancient skeletal samples by changes in the size and variability of ancient horse populations. Other researchers look at broader evidence, including skeletal and dental evidence of working activity; weapons, art, and spiritual artifacts; and lifestyle patterns of human cultures. There is also evidence that horses were kept as meat animals prior to being trained as working animals.\\r\\nAttempts to date domestication by genetic study or analysis of physical remains rests on the assumption that there was a separation of the genotypes of domesticated and wild populations. Such a separation appears to have taken place, but dates based on such methods can only produce an estimate of the latest possible date for domestication without excluding the possibility of an unknown period of earlier gene-flow between wild and domestic populations (which will occur naturally as long as the domesticated population is kept within the habitat of the wild population). Further, all modern horse populations retain the ability to revert to a feral state, and all feral horses are of domestic types; that is, they descend from ancestors that escaped from captivity.\\r\\nWhether one adopts the narrower zoological definition of domestication or the broader cultural definition that rests on an array of zoological and archaeological evidence affects the time frame chosen for domestication of the horse. The date of 4000 BCE is based on evidence that includes the appearance of dental pathologies associated with bitting, changes in butchering practices, changes in human economies and settlement patterns, the depiction of horses as symbols of power in artifacts, and the appearance of horse bones in human graves.[5] On the other hand, measurable changes in size and increases in variability associated with domestication occurred later, about 2500ÿ2000 BCE, as seen in horse remains found at the site of Csepel-Haros in Hungary, a settlement of the Bell Beaker culture.[6]\\r\\nRegardless of the specific date of domestication, use of horses spread rapidly across Eurasia for transportation, agricultural work and warfare. Horses and mules in agriculture used a breastplate type harness or a yoke more suitable for oxen, which was not as efficient at utilizing the full strength of the animals as the later-invented padded horse collar that arose several millennia later.[7][8]\\r\\nA 2005 study analyzed the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) of a worldwide range of equids, from 53,000-year-old fossils to contemporary horses.[9] Their analysis placed all equids into a single clade, or group with a single common ancestor, consisting of three genetically divergent species: Hippidion, the New World stilt-legged horse, and the true horse. The true horse, which ranged from western Europe to eastern Beringia, included prehistoric horses and the Przewalski's Horse, as well as what is now the modern domestic horse, belonged to a single Holarctic species. A more detailed analysis of the true horses grouped them into two major clades. One of these clades, which seemed to have been restricted to North America, is now extinct. The other clade was broadly distributed from North America to central Europe, north and south of Pleistocene ice sheets.[9] It became extinct in Beringia around 14,200 years ago, and in the rest of the Americas around 10,000 years ago.[10][11] This clade survived in Eurasia, however, and it is from these horses which all domestic horses appear to have descended.[9] These horses showed little phylogeographic structure, probably reflecting their high degree of mobility and adaptability.[9]\\r\\nTherefore, the domestic horse today is classified as Equus ferus caballus. No genetic originals of native wild horses currently exist, other than the never-domesticated Przewalski's Horse. The Przewalski has 66 chromosomes, however, as opposed to 64 among modern domesticated horses, and their Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) forms a distinct cluster.[12] Genetic evidence suggests that modern Przewalski's horses are descended from a distinct regional gene pool in the eastern part of the Eurasian steppes, not from the same genetic group that gave rise to modern domesticated horses.[12] Nevertheless, evidence such as the cave paintings of Lascaux suggests that the ancient wild horses that some researchers now label the \\"Tarpan subtype\\" probably resembled Przewalski horses in their general appearance: big heads, dun coloration, thick necks, stiff upright manes, and relatively short, stout legs.[13]\\r\\nThe horses of the Ice Age were hunted for meat in Europe and across the Eurasian steppes and in North America by early modern humans. Numerous kill sites exist and many cave paintings in Europe indicate what they looked like.[14] Many of these Ice Age subspecies died out during the rapid climate changes associated with the end of the last Ice Age or were hunted out by humans, particularly in North America, where the horse became completely extinct.[15]\\r\\nClassification based on body types and conformation, absent the availability of DNA for research, once suggested that there were roughly four basic wild prototypes, thought to have developed with adaptations to their environment prior to domestication. There were competing theories; some argued that the four prototypes were separate species or subspecies, while others suggested that the prototypes were physically different manifestations of the same species.[13] However, more recent study indicates that there was only one wild species and all different body types were entirely a result of selective breeding or landrace adaptation after domestication. Either way, the most common theories of prototypes from which all modern breeds are thought to have developed suggests than in addition to the so-called Tarpan subtype, there were the following base prototypes:[13]\\r\\nOnly two never-domesticated \\"wild\\" groups survived into historic times, Przewalski's horse (Equus ferus przewalski), and the Tarpan (Equus ferus ferus).[16] The Tarpan became extinct in the late 19th century and Przewalski's horse is endangered; it became extinct in the wild during the 1960s, but was re-introduced in the late 1980s to two preserves in Mongolia. Although researchers such as Marija Gimbutas theorized that the horses of the Chalcolithic period were Przewalski's, more recent genetic studies indicate that Przewalski's horse is not an ancestor to modern domesticated horses.[12] Other subspecies of Equus ferus appear to have existed and could have been the stock from which domesticated horses are descended.[16]\\r\\nA 2014 study compared DNA from ancient horse bones that predated domestication and compared them to DNA of modern horses, discovering 125 genes that correlated to domestication. Some were physical, affecting muscle and limb development, cardiac strength and balance. Others were linked to cognitive function and most likely were critical to the taming of the horse, including social behavior, learning capabilities, fear response, and agreeableness.[17] The DNA used in this study came from horse bones 16,000 to 43,000 years ago, and therefore the precise changes that occurred at the time of domestication have yet to be sequenced.[18]\\r\\nThe domestication of stallions and mares can be analyzed separately by looking at those portions of the DNA that are passed on exclusively along the maternal (mitochondrial DNA or mtDNA) or paternal line (Y-chromosome or Y-DNA). DNA studies indicate that there may have been multiple domestication events for mares, as the number of female lines required to account for the genetic diversity of the modern horse suggests a minimum of 77 different ancestral mares, divided into 17 distinct lineages.[12] On the other hand, genetic evidence with regard to the domestication of stallions points at a single domestication event for a limited number of stallions combined with repeated restocking of wild females into the domesticated herds.[19][20][21]\\r\\nA study published in 2012 that performed genomic sampling on 300 work horses from local areas as well as a review of previous studies of archaeology, mitochondrial DNA, and Y-DNA suggested that horses were originally domesticated in the western part of the Eurasian steppe.[22] Both domesticated stallions and mares spread out from this area, and then additional wild mares were added from local herds; wild mares were easier to handle than wild stallions. Most other parts of the world were ruled out as sites for horse domestication, either due to climate unsuitable for an indigenous wild horse population or no evidence of domestication.[23]\\r\\nGenes located on the Y-chromosome are inherited only from sire to its male offspring and these lines show a very reduced degree of genetic variation (aka genetic homogeneity) in modern domestic horses, far less than expected based on the overall genetic variation in the remaining genetic material.[19][20] This indicates that a relatively few stallions were domesticated, and that it is unlikely that many male offspring originating from unions between wild stallions and domestic mares were included in early domesticated breeding stock.[19][20]\\r\\nGenes located in the mitochondrial DNA are passed on along the maternal line from the mother to her offspring. Multiple analyses of the mitochondrial DNA obtained from modern horses as well as from horse bones and teeth from archaeological and palaeological finds consistently shows an increased genetic diversity in the mitochondrial DNA compared to the remaining DNA, showing that a large number of mares has been included into the breeding stock of the originally domesticated horse.[12][21][24][25][26][27] Variation in the mitochondrial DNA is used to determine so-called haplogroups. A haplogroup is a group of closely related haplotypes that share the same common ancestor. In horses, seven main haplogroups are recognized (A-G), each with several subgroups. Several haplogroups are unequally distributed around the world, indicating the addition of local wild mares to the domesticated stock.[12][21][25][26][27] One of these haplotypes (Lusitano group C) is exclusively found on in Iberian Peninsula, leading to a hypothesis that the Iberian peninsula or North Africa was an independent origin for domestication of the horse.[25] However, until there is additional analysis of nuclear DNA and a better understanding of the genetic structure of the earliest domestic herds, this theory cannot be confirmed or refuted.[25] It remains possible that a second, independent, domestication site might exist but, as of 2012, research has neither confirmed nor disproven that hypothesis.[23]\\r\\nEven though horse domestication became widespread in a short period of time, it is still possible that domestication began with a single culture, which passed on techniques and breeding stock. It is possible that the two \\"wild\\" subspecies remained when all other groups of once-\\"wild\\" horses died out because all others had been, perhaps, more suitable for taming by humans and the selective breeding that gave rise to the modern domestic horse.[28]\\r\\nEvidence for the domestication of the horse comes from three kinds of sources: 1) changes in the skeletons and teeth of ancient horses; 2) changes in the geographic distribution of ancient horses, particularly the introduction of horses into regions where no wild horses had existed; and 3) archaeological sites containing artifacts, images, or evidence of changes in human behavior connected with horses.\\r\\nArchaeological evidence includes horse remains interred in human graves; changes in the ages and sexes of the horses killed by humans; the appearance of horse corrals; equipment such as bits or other types of horse tack; horses interred with equipment intended for use by horses, such as chariots; and depictions of horses used for riding, driving, draught work, or symbols of human power.\\r\\nFew of these categories, taken alone, provide irrefutable evidence of domestication, but combined add up to a persuasive argument.\\r\\nThe least ancient, but most persuasive, evidence of domestication comes from sites where horse leg bones and skulls, probably originally attached to hides, were interred with the remains of chariots in at least 16 graves of the Sintashta and Petrovka cultures. These were located in the steppes southeast of the Ural Mountains, between the upper Ural and upper Tobol Rivers, a region today divided between southern Russia and northern Kazakhstan. Petrovka was a little later than and probably grew out of Sintashta, and the two complexes together spanned about 2100ÿ1700 BCE.[5][29] A few of these graves contained the remains of as many as eight sacrificed horses placed in, above, and beside the grave.\\r\\nIn all of the dated chariot graves, the heads and hooves of a pair of horses were placed in a grave that once contained a chariot. Evidence of chariots in these graves was inferred from the impressions of two spoked wheels set in grave floors 1.2ÿ1.6m apart; in most cases the rest of the vehicle left no trace. In addition a pair of disk-shaped antler \\"cheekpieces,\\" an ancient predecessor to a modern bit shank or bit ring, were placed in pairs beside each horse head-and-hoof sacrifice. The inner faces of the disks had protruding prongs or studs that would have pressed against the horse's lips when the reins were pulled on the opposite side. Studded cheekpieces were a new and fairly severe kind of control device that appeared simultaneously with chariots.\\r\\nAll of the dated chariot graves contained wheel impressions, horse bones, weapons (arrow and javelin points, axes, daggers, or stone mace-heads), human skeletal remains, and cheekpieces. Because they were buried in teams of two with chariots and studded cheekpieces, the evidence is extremely persuasive that these steppe horses of 2100ÿ1700 BCE were domesticated. Shortly after the period of these burials, the expansion of the domestic horse throughout Europe was little short of explosive. In the space of possibly 500 years, there is evidence of horse-drawn chariots in Greece, Egypt, and Mesopotamia. By another 500 years, the horse-drawn chariot had spread to China.\\r\\nSome researchers do not consider an animal to be \\"domesticated\\" until it exhibits physical changes consistent with selective breeding, or at least having been born and raised entirely in captivity. Until that point, they classify captive animals as merely \\"tamed\\". Those who hold to this theory of domestication point to a change in skeletal measurements was detected among horse bones recovered from middens dated about 2500 BCE in eastern Hungary in Bell-Beaker sites, and in later Bronze Age sites in the Russian steppes, Spain, and eastern Europe.[6][30] Horse bones from these contexts exhibited an increase in variability, thought to reflect the survival under human care of both larger and smaller individuals than appeared in the wild; and a decrease in average size, thought to reflect penning and restriction in diet. Horse populations that showed this combination of skeletal changes probably were domesticated. Most evidence suggests that horses were increasingly controlled by humans after about 2500 BCE. However, more recently there have been skeletal remains found at a site in Kazakhstan which display the smaller, more slender limbs characteristic of corralled animals, dated to 3500 BCE.[3]\\r\\nSome of the most intriguing evidence of early domestication comes from the Botai culture, found in northern Kazakhstan. The Botai culture was a culture of foragers who seem to have adopted horseback riding in order to hunt the abundant wild horses of northern Kazakhstan between 3500ÿ3000 BCE.[31][32] Botai sites had no cattle or sheep bones; the only domesticated animals, in addition to horses, were dogs. Botai settlements in this period contained between 50ÿ150 pit houses. Garbage deposits contained tens to hundreds of thousands of discarded animal bones, 65% to 99% of which had come from horses. Also, there has been evidence found of horse milking at these sites, with horse milk fats soaked into pottery shards dating to 3500 BCE.[3] Earlier hunter-gatherers who lived in the same region had not hunted wild horses with such success, and lived for millennia in smaller, more shifting settlements, often containing less than 200 wild animal bones.\\r\\nEntire herds of horses were slaughtered by the Botai hunters, apparently in hunting drives. The adoption of horseback riding might explain the emergence of specialized horse-hunting techniques and larger, more permanent settlements. Domesticated horses could have been adopted from neighboring herding societies in the steppes west of the Ural Mountains, where the Khvalynsk culture had herds of cattle and sheep, and perhaps had domesticated horses, as early as 4800 BCE.[32]\\r\\nOther researchers have argued that all of the Botai horses were wild, and that the horse-hunters of Botai hunted wild horses on foot. As evidence, they note that zoologists have found no skeletal changes in the Botai horses that indicate domestication. Moreover, because they were hunted for food, the majority of the horse remains found in Botai-culture settlements indeed probably were wild. On the other hand, any domesticated riding horses were probably the same size as their wild cousins and cannot now be distinguished by bone measurements.[6] They also note that the age structure of the horses slaughtered at Botai represents a natural demographic profile for hunted animals, not the pattern expected if they were domesticated and selected for slaughter.[33] However, these arguments were published prior to the discovery of a corral at Krasnyi Yar and mats of horse-dung at two other Botai sites.\\r\\nThe presence of bit wear suggest that a horse was ridden or driven, and the earliest of such evidence from a site in Kazakhstan dates to 3500 BCE.[3] Because horses can be ridden and controlled without bits by using a noseband or a hackamore, and such tools are used even today, the absence of bit wear on horse teeth is not conclusive evidence against domestication, but such materials do not produce significant physiological changes nor are they apt to be preserved for millennia.\\r\\nThe regular use of a bit to control a horse can create wear facets or bevels on the anterior corners of the lower second premolars. The corners of the horse's mouth normally keep the bit on the \\"bars\\" of the mouth, an interdental space where there are no teeth, forward of the premolars. The bit must be manipulated by a human or the horse must move it with its tongue for it to touch the teeth. Wear can be caused by the bit abrading the front corners of the premolars if the horse grasps and releases the bit between its teeth; other wear can be created by the bit striking the vertical front edge of the lower premolars,[34][35] due to very strong pressure from a human handler.\\r\\nModern experiments showed that even organic bits of rope or leather can create significant wear facets, and also showed that facets 3?mm deep or more do not appear on the premolars of wild horses.[36] However, other researchers disputed both conclusions.[33]\\r\\nWear facets of 3?mm or more also were found on seven horse premolars in two sites of the Botai, Botai and Kozhai 1, dated about 3500ÿ3000 BCE.[32][37] The Botai culture premolars are the earliest reported multiple examples of this dental pathology in any archaeological site, and preceded any skeletal change indicators by 1,000 years. While wear facets more than 3?mm deep were discovered on the lower second premolars of a single stallion from Dereivka in Ukraine, an Eneolithic settlement dated about 4000 BCE,[37] dental material from one of the worn teeth later produced a radiocarbon date of 700ÿ200 BCE, indicating that this stallion was actually deposited in a pit dug into the older Eneolithic site during the Iron Age.[32]\\r\\nSoil scientists working with Sandra Olsen of the Carnegie Museum of Natural History at the Chalcolithic (also called Eneolithic, or \\"Copper Age\\") settlements of Botai and Krasnyi Yar in northern Kazakhstan found layers of horse dung, discarded in unused house pits in both settlements.[38] The collection and disposal of horse dung suggests that horses were confined in corrals or stables. An actual corral, dated to 3500ÿ3000 BCE was identified at Krasnyi Yar by a pattern of post holes for a circular fence, with the soils inside the fence yielding ten times more phosphorus than the soils outside. The phosphorus could represent the remains of manure.[39]\\r\\nThe appearance of horse remains in human settlements in regions where they had not previously been present is another indicator of domestication. Although images of horses appear as early as the Upper Paleolithic period in places such as the caves of Lascaux, France, suggesting that wild horses lived in regions outside of the Eurasian steppes prior to domestication and may have even been hunted by early humans, concentration of remains suggests animals being deliberately captured and contained, an indicator of domestication, at least for food, if not necessarily use as a working animal.\\r\\nAround 3500ÿ3000 BCE, horse bones began to appear more frequently in archaeological sites beyond their center of distribution in the Eurasian steppes and were seen in central Europe, the middle and lower Danube valley, and the North Caucasus and Transcaucasia. Evidence of horses in these areas had been rare before, and as numbers increased, larger animals also began to appear in horse remains. This expansion in range was contemporary with the Botai culture, where there are indications that horses were corralled and ridden. This does not necessarily mean that horses were first domesticated in the steppes, but the horse-hunters of the steppes certainly pursued wild horses more than in any other region. This geographic expansion is interpreted by many zoologists as an early phase in the spread of domesticated horses.[30][40][41]\\r\\nEuropean wild horses were hunted for up to 10% of the animal bones in a handful of Mesolithic and Neolithic settlements scattered across Spain, France, and the marshlands of northern Germany, but in many other parts of Europe, including Greece, the Balkans, the British Isles, and much of central Europe, horse bones do not occur or occur very rarely in Mesolithic, Neolithic or Chalcolithic sites. In contrast, wild horse bones regularly exceeded 40% of the identified animal bones in Mesolithic and Neolithic camps in the Eurasian steppes, west of the Ural Mountains.[40][42][43]\\r\\nHorse bones were rare or absent in Neolithic and Chalcolithic kitchen garbage in western Turkey, Mesopotamia, most of Iran, South and Central Asia, and much of Europe.[40][41][44] While horse bones have been identified in Neolithic sites in central Turkey, all equids together totaled less than 3% of the animal bones. Within this three percent, horses were less than 10%, with 90% or more of the equids represented by onagers (Equus hemionus) or another ass-like equid that later became extinct, Equus hydruntinus.[45] Onagers were the most common native wild equids of the Near East. They were hunted in Syria, Anatolia, Mesopotamia, Iran, and Central Asia; and domesticated asses (Equus asinus) were imported into Mesopotamia, probably from Egypt, but wild horses apparently did not live there.[46]\\r\\nIn Northern Caucasus, the Maikop culture settlements and burials of c. 3300 BC contain both horse bones and images of horses. A frieze of nineteen horses painted in black and red colors is found in one of the Maikop graves. The widespread appearance of horse bones and images in Maikop sites suggest to some observers that horseback riding began in the Maikop period.[47]\\r\\nLater, images of horses, identified by their short ears, flowing manes, and tails that bushed out at the dock, began to appear in artistic media in Mesopotamia during the Akkadian period, 2300-2100 BCE. The word for \\"horse\\", literally translated as ass of the mountains, first appeared in Sumerian documents during the Third dynasty of Ur, about 2100-2000 BCE.[46][48] The kings of the Third Dynasty of Ur apparently fed horses to lions for royal entertainment, perhaps indicating that horses were still regarded as more exotic than useful, but King Shulgi, about 2050 BCE, compared himself to \\"a horse of the highway that swishes its tail\\", and one image from his reign showed a man apparently riding a horse at full gallop.[49] Horses were imported into Mesopotamia and the lowland Near East in larger numbers after 2000 BCE in connection with the beginning of chariot warfare.\\r\\nA further expansion, into the lowland Near East and northwestern China, also happened around 2000 BCE, again apparently in conjunction with the chariot. Although Equus bones of uncertain species are found in some Late Neolithic sites in China dated before 2000 BCE, Equus caballus or Equus ferus bones first appeared in multiple sites and in significant numbers in sites of the Qijia and Siba cultures, 2000-1600 BCE, in Gansu and the northwestern provinces of China.[50] The Qijia culture was in contact with cultures of the Eurasian steppes, as shown through similarities between Qijia and Late Bronze Age steppe metallurgy, so it was probably through these contacts that domesticated horses first became frequent in northwestern China.[citation needed]\\r\\nIn 2008, archaeologists announced the discovery of rock art in Somalia's northern Dhambalin region, which the researchers suggest is one of the earliest known depictions of a hunter on horseback. The rock art is in the Ethiopian-Arabian style, dated to 1000 to 3000 BCE.[51][52]\\r\\nAbout 4200-4000 BCE, more than 500 years before the geographic expansion evidenced by the presence of horse bones, new kinds of graves, named after a grave at Suvorovo, appeared north of the Danube delta in the coastal steppes of Ukraine near Izmail. Suvorovo graves were similar to and probably derived from earlier funeral traditions in the steppes around the Dnieper River. Some Suvorovo graves contained polished stone mace-heads shaped like horse heads and horse tooth beads.[53] Earlier steppe graves also had contained polished stone mace-heads, some of them carved in the shape of animal heads.[54] Settlements in the steppes contemporary with Suvorovo, such as Sredni Stog II and Dereivka on the Dnieper River, contained 12%-52% horse bones.[55]\\r\\nWhen Suvorovo graves appeared in the Danube delta grasslands, horse-head maces also appeared in some of the indigenous farming towns of the Tripolye and Gumelnitsa cultures in present-day Romania and Moldova, near the Suvorovo graves.[56] These agricultural cultures had not previously used polished-stone maces, and horse bones were rare or absent in their settlement sites. Probably their horse-head maces came from the Suvorovo immigrants. The Suvorovo people in turn acquired many copper ornaments from the Tripolye and Gumelnitsa towns. After this episode of contact and trade, but still during the period 4200-4000 BCE, about 600 agricultural towns in the Balkans and the lower Danube valley, some of which had been occupied for 2000 years, were abandoned.[57] Copper mining ceased in the Balkan copper mines,[58] and the cultural traditions associated with the agricultural towns were terminated in the Balkans and the lower Danube valley. This collapse of \\"Old Europe\\" has been attributed to the immigration of mounted Indo-European warriors.[59] The collapse could have been caused by intensified warfare, for which there is some evidence; and warfare could have been worsened by mounted raiding; and the horse-head maces have been interpreted as indicating the introduction of domesticated horses and riding just before the collapse.\\r\\nHowever, mounted raiding is just one possible explanation for this complex event. Environmental deterioration, ecological degradation from millennia of farming, and the exhaustion of easily mined oxide copper ores also are cited as causal factors.[5][57]\\r\\nPerforated antler objects discovered at Dereivka and other sites contemporary with Suvorovo have been identified as cheekpieces or psalia for horse bits.[54] This identification is no longer widely accepted, as the objects in question have not been found associated with horse bones, and could have had a variety of other functions.[60] However, through studies of microscopic wear, it has been established that many of the bone tools at Botai were used to smooth rawhide thongs, and rawhide thongs might have been used to manufacture of rawhide cords and ropes, useful for horse tack.[31] Similar bone thong-smoothers are known from many other steppe settlements, but it cannot be known how the thongs were used. The oldest artifacts clearly identified as horse tackbits, bridles, cheekpieces, or any other kind of horse gearare the antler disk-shaped cheekpieces associated with the invention of the chariot, at the Sintashta-Petrovka sites.\\r\\nThe oldest possible archaeological indicator of a changed relationship between horses and humans is the appearance about 4800-4400 BCE of horse bones and carved images of horses in Chalcolithic graves of the early Khvalynsk culture and the Samara culture in the middle Volga region of Russia. At the Khvalynsk cemetery near the town of Khvalynsk, 158 graves of this period were excavated. Of these, 26 graves contained parts of sacrificed domestic animals, and additional sacrifices occurred in ritual deposits on the original ground surface above the graves. Ten graves contained parts of lower horse legs; two of these also contained the bones of domesticated cattle and sheep. At least 52 domesticated sheep or goats, 23 domesticated cattle, and 11 horses were sacrificed at Khvalynsk. The inclusion of horses with cattle and sheep and the exclusion of obviously wild animals together suggest that horses were categorized symbolically with domesticated animals.[citation needed]\\r\\nAt Syezzhe, a contemporary cemetery of the Samara culture, parts of two horses were placed above a group of human graves. The pair of horses here was represented by the head and hooves, probably originally attached to hides. The same ritualusing the hide with the head and lower leg bones as a symbol for the whole animalwas used for many domesticated cattle and sheep sacrifices at Khvalynsk. Horse images carved from bone were placed in the above-ground ochre deposit at Syezzhe and occurred at several other sites of the same period in the middle and lower Volga region. Together these archaeological clues suggest that horses had a symbolic importance in the Khvalynsk and Samara cultures that they had lacked earlier, and that they were associated with humans, domesticated cattle, and domesticated sheep. Thus, the earliest phase in the domestication of the horse might have begun during the period 4800-4400 BCE.[citation needed]\\r\\nEquidae died out in the Western Hemisphere at the end of the last glacial period. A question raised is why and how horses avoided this fate on the Eurasian continent. It has been theorized that domestication saved the species.[61] While the environmental conditions for equine survival in Europe were somewhat more favorable in Eurasia than in the Americas, the same stressors that led to extinction for the Mammoth had an effect upon horse populations. Thus, some time after 8000 BCE, the approximate date of extinction in the Americas, humans in Eurasia may have begun to keep horses as a livestock food source, and by keeping them in captivity, may have helped to preserve the species.[61] Horses also fit the six core criteria for livestock domestication, and thus, it could be argued, \\"chose\\" to live in close proximity to humans.[28]\\r\\nOne model of horse domestication starts with individual foals being kept as pets while the adult horses were slaughtered for meat. Foals are relatively small and easy to handle. Horses behave as herd animals and need companionship to thrive. Both historic and modern data shows that foals can and will bond to humans and other domestic animals to meet their social needs. Thus domestication may have started with young horses being repeatedly made into pets over time, preceding the great discovery that these pets could be ridden or otherwise put to work.\\r\\nHowever, there is disagreement over the definition of the term domestication. One interpretation of domestication is that it must include physiological changes associated with being selectively bred in captivity, and not merely \\"tamed.\\" It has been noted that traditional peoples worldwide (both hunter-gatherers and horticulturists) routinely tame individuals from wild species, typically by hand-rearing infants whose parents have been killed, and these animals are not necessarily \\"domesticated.\\"[citation needed]\\r\\nOn the other hand, some researchers look to examples from historical times to hypothesize how domestication occurred. For example, while Native American cultures captured and rode horses from the 16th century on, most tribes did not exert significant control over their breeding, thus their horses developed a genotype and phenotype adapted to the uses and climatological conditions in which they were kept, making them more of a landrace than a planned breed as defined by modern standards, but nonetheless \\"domesticated\\".\\r\\nA difficult question is if domesticated horses were first ridden or driven. While the most unequivocal evidence shows horses first being used to pull chariots in warfare, there is strong, though indirect, evidence for riding occurring first, particularly by the Botai. Bit wear may correlate to riding, though, as the modern hackamore demonstrates, horses can be ridden without a bit by using rope and other evanescent materials to make equipment that fastens around the nose. So the absence of unequivocal evidence of early riding in the record does not settle the question.\\r\\nThus, on one hand, logic suggests that horses would have been ridden long before they were driven. But it is also far more difficult to gather evidence of this, as the materials required for ridingsimple hackamores or blanketswould not survive as artifacts, and other than tooth wear from a bit, the skeletal changes in an animal that was ridden would not necessarily be particularly noticeable. Direct evidence of horses being driven is much stronger.[62]\\r\\nOn the other hand, others argue that evidence of bit wear does not necessarily correlate to riding. Some theorists speculate that a horse could have been controlled from the ground by placing a bit in the mouth, connected to a lead rope, and leading the animal while pulling a primitive wagon or plow. Since oxen were usually relegated to this duty in Mesopotamia, it is possible that early plows might have been attempted with the horse, and a bit may indeed have been significant as part of agrarian development rather than as warfare technology.\\r\\nWhile riding may have been practiced during the 4th and 3rd millennia BCE, and the disappearance of \\"Old European\\" settlements may be related to attacks by horseback-mounted warriors, the clearest influence by horses on ancient warfare was by pulling chariots, introduced c. 2000 BCE.\\r\\nHorses in the Bronze Age were relatively small by modern standards, which led some theorists to believe the ancient horses were too small to be ridden and so must have been driven.[citation needed] Herodotus' description of the Sigynnae, a steppe people who bred horses too small to ride but extremely efficient at drawing chariots, illustrates this stage. However, as horses remained generally smaller than modern equines well into the Middle Ages,[63] this theory is highly questionable.\\r\\nThe Iron Age in Mesopotamia saw the rise of mounted cavalry as a tool of war, as evidenced by the notable successes of mounted archer tactics used by various invading equestrian nomads such as the Parthians. Over time, the chariot gradually became obsolete.\\r\\nThe horse of the Iron Age was still relatively small, perhaps 12.2 to 14.2?hands (50 to 58?inches, 127 to 147?cm) high (measured at the withers.) This was shorter overall than the average height of modern riding horses, which range from about 14.2 to 17.2?hands (58 to 70?inches, 147 to 178?cm). However, small horses were used successfully as light cavalry for many centuries. For example, Fell ponies, believed to be descended from Roman cavalry horses, are comfortably able to carry fully grown adults (although with rather limited ground clearance) at an average height of 13.2?hands (54?inches, 137?cm) Likewise, the Arabian horse is noted for a short back and dense bone, and the successes of the Muslims against the heavy mounted knights of Europe demonstrated that a horse standing 14.2?hands (58?inches, 147?cm) can easily carry a full-grown human adult into battle.\\r\\nMounted warriors such as the Scythians, Huns and Vandals of late Roman antiquity, the Mongols who invaded eastern Europe in the 7th century through 14th centuries CE, the Muslim warriors of the 8th through 14th centuries CE, and the American Indians in the 16th through 19th centuries each demonstrated effective forms of light cavalry.","input":"When did horses start being used by humans?"},{"output":"Las Vegas Strip in Paradise, Nevada","context":"Coordinates: 360610N 1151042W? / ?36.10278N 115.17833W? / 36.10278; -115.17833\\r\\nT-Mobile Arena is a multi-purpose indoor arena on the Las Vegas Strip in Paradise, Nevada.

Through the following year, Harrah's became uncertain on continuing with the project, not knowing if AEG would split the costs, and whether building a major league-ready stadium without a guaranteed franchise to play on it would be feasible given the enduring financial crisis.[6] The original plans were to break ground in June 2008 and finish the arena in 2010, but by 2009, it was revealed the stalled project had not even done a traffic study despite being located near a busy intersection.[7] In 2010, the plans were changed to use an area behind the Imperial Palace. However, given the financing would require a special taxation district, opposition from Clark County regarding using public money in the project stalled it even further.[8] AEG eventually backed out completely by 2012, once MGM Resorts International came up with their own project using a terrain behind the New York-New York and Monte Carlo resorts.

However, the clade Viridiplantae or green plants includes some other groups of photosynthetic eukaryotes, including red and green algae that have evolutionary significance to modern plants and are included in the plant kingdom, Plantae.\\r\\nChloroplasts in plants evolved from an endosymbiotic relationship between a cyanobacterium, a photosynthesising prokaryote and a non-photosynthetic eukaryotic organism, producing a lineage of photosynthesizing eukaryotic organisms in marine and freshwater environments. These earliest photosynthesizing single-celled autotrophs evolved into multicellular organisms such as the Charophyta, a group of freshwater green algae.\\r\\nScientists start the search for fossil evidence of plants with indirect evidence of oxygen-producing photosynthesis in the geological record, primary evidence for which comes from around 3000 Ma, in chemical and isotopic signatures in rocks and fossil evidence of colonies of cyanobacteria, photosynthesizing prokaryotic organisms. Cyanobacteria use water as a reducing agent, producing atmospheric oxygen as a byproduct, and they thereby profoundly changed the early reducing atmosphere of the earth to one in which modern aerobic organisms eventually evolved. This oxygen liberated by cyanobacteria then oxidized dissolved iron in the oceans, the iron precipitated out of the sea water, and fell to the ocean floor to form sedimentary layers of oxidized iron called Banded Iron Formations (BIFs). These BIFs are part of the geological record of evidence for the evolutionary history of plants by identifying when photosynthesis originated. This also provides deep time constraints upon when enough oxygen could have been available in the atmosphere to produce the ultraviolet blocking stratospheric ozone layer. The oxygen concentration in the ancient atmosphere subsequently rose, acting as a poison for anaerobic organisms, and resulting in a highly oxidizing atmosphere, and opening up niches on land for occupation by aerobic organisms.\\r\\nFossil evidence for cyanobacteria also comes from the presence of stromatolites in the fossil record deep into the Precambrian. Stromatolites are layered structures formed by the trapping, binding, and cementation of sedimentary grains by microbial biofilms, such as those produced by cyanobacteria. The direct evidence for cyanobacteria is less certain than the evidence for their presence as primary producers of atmospheric oxygen. Modern stromatolites containing cyanobacteria can be found on the west coast of Australia.\\r\\n\\r\\nEarly plants were small, unicellular or filamentous, with simple branching. The identification of plant fossils in Cambrian strata is an uncertain area in the evolutionary history of plants because of the small and soft-bodied nature of these plants. It is also difficult in a fossil of this age to distinguish among various similar appearing groups with simple branching patterns, and not all of these groups are plants. One exception to the uncertainty of fossils from this age is the group of calcareous green algae, Dasycladales found in the fossil record since the middle Cambrian. These algae do not belong to the lineage that is ancestral to the land plants. Other major groups of green algae had been established by this time, but there were no land plants with vascular tissues until the mid-Silurian.\\r\\nThe evidence of plant evolution changes dramatically in the Ordovician with the first extensive appearance of spores in the fossil record (Cambrian spores have been found, also). The first terrestrial plants were probably in the form of tiny plants resembling liverworts when, around the Middle Ordovician, evidence for the beginning of the terrestrialization of the land is found in the form of tetrads of spores with resistant polymers in their outer walls. These early plants did not have conducting tissues, severely limiting their size. They were, in effect, tied to wet terrestrial environments by their inability to conduct water, like extant liverworts, hornworts, and mosses, although they reproduced with spores, important dispersal units that have hard protective outer coatings, allowing for their preservation in the fossil record, in addition to protecting the future offspring against the desiccating environment of life on land. With spores, plants on land could have sent out large numbers of spores that could grow into an adult plant when sufficient environmental moisture was present.\\r\\nThe first fossil records of vascular plants, that is, land plants with vascular tissues, appeared in the Silurian period. The earliest known representatives of this group (mostly from the northern hemisphere) are placed in the genus Cooksonia. They had very simple branching patterns, with the branches terminated by flattened sporangia. By the end of the Silurian much more complex vascular plants, the zosterophylls, had diversified[2] and primitive lycopods, such as Baragwanathia (originally discovered in Silurian deposits in Victoria, Australia),[3] had become widespread.\\r\\nBy the Devonian Period, life was well underway in its colonization of the land. The bacterial and algal mats were joined early in the period by primitive plants that created the first recognizable soils and harbored some arthropods like mites, scorpions and myriapods. Early Devonian plants did not have roots or leaves like the plants most common today, and many had no vascular tissue at all. They probably relied on arbuscular mycorrhizal symbioses with fungi to provide them with water and mineral nutrients such as phosphorus.[4] They probably spread by a combination of vegetative reproduction forming clonal colonies, and sexual reproduction via spores and did not grow much more than a few centimeters tall.\\r\\nBy the Late Devonian, forests of large, primitive plants existed: lycophytes, sphenophytes, ferns, and progymnosperms had evolved. Most of these plants have true roots and leaves, and many were quite tall. The tree-like Archaeopteris, ancestral to the gymnosperms, and the giant cladoxylopsid trees had true wood. These are the oldest known trees of the world's first forests. Prototaxites was the fruiting body of an enormous fungus that stood more than 8 meters tall. By the end of the Devonian, the first seed-forming plants had appeared. This rapid appearance of so many plant groups and growth forms has been called the \\"Devonian Explosion\\". The primitive arthropods co-evolved with this diversified terrestrial vegetation structure. The evolving co-dependence of insects and seed-plants that characterizes a recognizably modern world had its genesis in the late Devonian. The development of soils and plant root systems probably led to changes in the speed and pattern of erosion and sediment deposition.\\r\\nThe 'greening' of the continents acted as a carbon dioxide sink, and atmospheric concentrations of this greenhouse gas may have dropped.[5] This may have cooled the climate and led to a massive extinction event. see Late Devonian extinction.\\r\\nAlso in the Devonian, both vertebrates and arthropods were solidly established on the land.\\r\\nEarly Carboniferous land plants were very similar to those of the preceding Latest Devonian, but new groups also appeared at this time.\\r\\nThe main Early Carboniferous plants were the Equisetales (Horse-tails), Sphenophyllales (scrambling plants), Lycopodiales (Club mosses), Lepidodendrales (arborescent clubmosses or scale trees), Filicales (Ferns), Medullosales (previously included in the \\"seed ferns\\", an artificial assemblage of a number of early gymnosperm groups) and the Cordaitales. These continued to dominate throughout the period, but during late Carboniferous, several other groups, Cycadophyta (cycads), the Callistophytales (another group of \\"seed ferns\\"), and the Voltziales (related to and sometimes included under the conifers), appeared.\\r\\nThe Carboniferous lycophytes of the order Lepidodendrales, which were cousins (but not ancestors) of the tiny club-mosses of today, were huge trees with trunks 30 meters high and up to 1.5 meters in diameter. These included Lepidodendron (with its fruit cone called Lepidostrobus), Halonia, Lepidophloios and Sigillaria. The roots of several of these forms are known as Stigmaria.\\r\\nThe fronds of some Carboniferous ferns are almost identical with those of living species. Probably many species were epiphytic. Fossil ferns include Pecopteris and the tree ferns Megaphyton and Caulopteris. Seed ferns or Pteridospermatophyta include Cyclopteris, Neuropteris, Alethopteris, and Sphenopteris.\\r\\nThe Equisetales included the common giant form Calamites, with a trunk diameter of 30 to 60?cm and a height of up to 20 meters. Sphenophyllum was a slender climbing plant with whorls of leaves, which was probably related both to the calamites and the modern horsetails.\\r\\nCordaites, a tall plant (6 to over 30 meters) with strap-like leaves, was related to the cycads and conifers; the catkin-like inflorescence, which bore yew-like berries, is called Cardiocarpus. These plants were thought to live in swamps and mangroves. True coniferous trees (Walchia, of the order Voltziales) appear later in the Carboniferous, and preferred higher drier ground.\\r\\nThe Permian began with the Carboniferous flora still flourishing. About the middle of the Permian there was a major transition in vegetation. The swamp-loving lycopod trees of the Carboniferous, such as Lepidodendron and Sigillaria, were replaced by the more advanced conifers, which were better adapted to the changing climatic conditions. Lycopods and swamp forests still dominated the South China continent because it was an isolated continent and it sat near or at the equator. The Permian saw the radiation of many important conifer groups, including the ancestors of many present-day families. The ginkgos and cycads also appeared during this period. Rich forests were present in many areas, with a diverse mix of plant groups. The gigantopterids thrived during this time; some of these may have been part of the ancestral flowering plant lineage, though flowers evolved only considerably later.\\r\\nOn land, the holdover plants included the lycophytes, the dominant cycads, Ginkgophyta (represented in modern times by Ginkgo biloba) and glossopterids. The spermatophytes, or seed plants came to dominate the terrestrial flora: in the northern hemisphere, conifers flourished. Dicroidium (a seed fern) was the dominant southern hemisphere tree during the Early Triassic period.\\r\\nThe arid, continental conditions characteristic of the Triassic steadily eased during the Jurassic period, especially at higher latitudes; the warm, humid climate allowed lush jungles to cover much of the landscape.[6] Conifers dominated the flora, as during the Triassic; they were the most diverse group and constituted the majority of large trees. Extant conifer families that flourished during the Jurassic included the Araucariaceae, Cephalotaxaceae, Pinaceae, Podocarpaceae, Taxaceae and Taxodiaceae.[7] The extinct Mesozoic conifer family Cheirolepidiaceae dominated low latitude vegetation, as did the shrubby Bennettitales.[8] Cycads were also common, as were ginkgos and tree ferns in the forest. Smaller ferns were probably the dominant undergrowth. Caytoniaceous seed ferns were another group of important plants during this time and are thought to have been shrub to small-tree sized.[9] Ginkgo-like plants were particularly common in the mid- to high northern latitudes. In the Southern Hemisphere, podocarps were especially successful, while Ginkgos and Czekanowskiales were rare.[8][10]\\r\\nFlowering plants, also known as angiosperms, spread during this period, although they did not become predominant until near the end of the period (Campanian age). Their evolution was aided by the appearance of bees; in fact angiosperms and insects are a good example of coevolution. The first representatives of many modern trees, including figs, planes and magnolias, appeared in the Cretaceous. At the same time, some earlier Mesozoic gymnosperms, like Conifers continued to thrive, although other taxa like Bennettitales died out before the end of the period.\\r\\nThe Cenozoic is just as much the age of savannas, or the age of co-dependent flowering plants and insects. At 35 Ma, grasses evolved from among the angiosperms. About ten thousand years ago, humans in the Fertile Crescent of the Middle East develop agriculture. Plant domestication begins with cultivation of Neolithic founder crops. This process of food production, coupled later with the domestication of animals caused a massive increase in human population that has continued to the present. In Jericho (modern Israel), there is a settlement with about 19,000 people. At the same time, Sahara is green with rivers, lakes, cattle, crocodiles and monsoons. At 8 ka, Common (Bread) wheat (Triticum aestivum) originates in southwest Asia due to hybridisation of emmer wheat with a goat-grass, Aegilops tauschii. At 6.5 ka, two rice species are domesticated: Asian rice, Oryza sativa, and African rice Oryza glaberrima.","input":"When do bryophytes (including mosses liverworts and hornworts) first appear in the fossil record?"},{"output":"43,560 square feet","context":"The acre is a unit of land area used in the imperial and US customary systems. It is defined as the area of 1 chain by 1 furlong (66 by 660 feet), which is exactly equal to ?1?640 of a square mile, 43,560 square feet, approximately 4,047?m2, or about 40% of a hectare.\\r\\nThe acre is commonly used in Antigua and Barbuda,[1] American Samoa,[2] the Bahamas,[3] Belize,[4] the British Virgin Islands,[5] the Cayman Islands,[6] Canada,[7] Dominica,[8] the Falkland Islands,[9] Grenada,[10] Ghana,[citation needed] Guam,[11] the Northern Mariana Islands,[12] India,[citation needed] Sri Lanka,[citation needed]Bangladesh,[citation needed]Nepal,[citation needed] Ireland,[13] Jamaica,[14] Montserrat,[15] Myanmar,[citation needed] Pakistan,[citation needed] Samoa,[16] St. Lucia,[17] St. Helena,[18] St. Kitts and Nevis,[19] St. Vincent and the Grenadines,[20] Turks and Caicos,[21] the United Kingdom, the United States[citation needed] and the US Virgin Islands.[22]\\r\\nThe international symbol of the acre is ac. The most commonly used acre today is the international acre. In the United States both the international acre and the US survey acre are in use, but differ by only two parts per million; see below. The most common use of the acre is to measure tracts of land. One international acre is defined as exactly 4,046.8564224?square metres.\\r\\nAn acre was defined in the Middle Ages as the area of land that could be ploughed in one day by a yoke of oxen.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOne acre equals 0.0015625?square miles, 4,840?square yards, 43,560 square feet[23] or about 4,047 square metres (0.4047 hectares) (see below). While all modern variants of the acre contain 4,840?square yards, there are alternative definitions of a yard, so the exact size of an acre depends on which yard it is based. Originally, an acre was understood as a selion of land sized at forty perches (660?ft, or 1?furlong) long and four perches (66?ft) wide;[24] this may have also been understood as an approximation of the amount of land a yoke of oxen could plough in one day. A square enclosing one acre is approximately 69.57?yards, or 208?feet 9?inches (63.63 metres) on a side. As a unit of measure, an acre has no prescribed shape; any area of 43,560?square feet is an acre.\\r\\nIn the international yard and pound agreement of 1959 the United States and five countries of the Commonwealth of Nations defined the international yard to be exactly 0.9144?metres.[25] Consequently, the international acre is exactly 4,046.8564224?square metres.\\r\\nBoth the international acre and the US survey acre contain ?1?640 of a square mile or 4,840?square yards, but alternative definitions of a yard are used (see survey foot and survey yard), so the exact size of an acre depends upon which yard it is based. The US survey acre is about 4,046.872609874252 square metres; its exact value (4046?13,525,426/15,499,969?m2) is based on an inch defined by 1?metre = 39.37?inches exactly, as established by the Mendenhall Order. Surveyors in the United States use both international and survey feet, and consequently, both varieties of acre.[26]\\r\\nSince the difference between the US survey acre and international acre is only about a quarter of the size of an A4 sheet of paper (0.016?square metres, 160 square centimetres or 24.8?square inches), it is usually not important which one is being discussed. Areas are seldom measured with sufficient accuracy for the different definitions to be detectable.[27]\\r\\nIn India, residential plots are measured in cents or decimal, which is one hundredth of an acre, or 435.60 square feet (40.469?m2). In Sri Lanka the division of an acre into 160 perches or 4 roods is common.[28]\\r\\n1 international acre is equal to the following metric units:\\r\\n1 United States survey acre is equal to:\\r\\n1?acre (both variants) is equal to the following customary units:\\r\\nPerhaps the easiest way for US residents to envision an acre is as a rectangle measuring 88?yards by 55?yards (?1?10 of 880?yards by ?1?16 of 880?yards), about ?9?10 the size of a standard American football field.\\r\\nTo be more exact, one acre is 90.75% of a 100-yd-long by 53.33-yd-wide American football field (without the end zones). The full field, including the end zones, covers about 1.32 acres (0.53?ha).\\r\\nFor residents of other countries, the acre might be envisioned as approximately half of a 105-m-long by 68-m-wide association football (soccer) pitch.\\r\\nIt may also be remembered as 44,000?square feet, less 1%.\\r\\nThe word \\"acre\\" is derived from Old English ?cer originally meaning \\"open field\\", cognate to west coast Norwegian ?kre and Swedish ?ker, German Acker, Dutch akker, Latin ager, Sanskrit ajr, and Greek ϫ?? (agros). In English, it was historically spelled aker.\\r\\nThe acre was roughly the amount of land tillable by a yoke of oxen in one day.[29] This explains one definition as the area of a rectangle with sides of length one chain and one furlong. A long, narrow strip of land is more efficient to plough than a square plot, since the plough does not have to be turned so often. The word \\"furlong\\" itself derives from the fact that it is one furrow long.\\r\\nBefore the enactment of the metric system, many countries in Europe used their own official acres. These were differently sized in different countries, for instance, the historical French acre was 4,221?square metres, whereas in Germany as many variants of \\"acre\\" existed as there were German states.\\r\\nStatutory values for the acre were enacted in England, and subsequently, the United Kingdom, by acts of:\\r\\nHistorically, the size of farms and landed estates in the United Kingdom was usually expressed in acres (or acres, roods, and perches), even if the number of acres was so large that it might conveniently have been expressed in square miles. For example, a certain landowner might have been said to own 32,000?acres of land, not 50?square miles of land.\\r\\nThe acre is related to the square mile, with 640?acres making up one square mile. One mile is 5280?feet (1760?yards). In western Canada and the western United States, divisions of land area were typically based on the square mile, and fractions thereof. If the square mile is divided into quarters, each quarter has a side length of ?1?2 mile (880?yards) and is ?1?4 square mile in area, or 160?acres. These subunits would typically then again be divided into quarters, with each side being ?1?4 mile long, and being ?1?16 of a square mile in area, or 40?acres. In the United States, farmland was typically divided as such, and the phrase \\"the back 40\\" would refer to the 40-acre parcel to the back of the farm. Most of the Canadian Prairie Provinces and the US Midwest are on square-mile grids for surveying purposes.","input":"How many feet in 1 acre of land?"},{"output":"Catwoman","context":"The Batman Family adversaries or the rogues gallery are a collective of fictional supervillains appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics.

It is characterized by underground drainage systems with sinkholes and caves.[1] It has also been documented for more weathering-resistant rocks, such as quartzite, given the right conditions.[2] Subterranean drainage may limit surface water, with few to no rivers or lakes. However, in regions where the dissolved bedrock is covered (perhaps by debris) or confined by one or more superimposed non-soluble rock strata, distinctive karst features may occur only at subsurface levels and be totally missing above ground.\\r\\nThe study of karst is considered of prime importance in petroleum geology since as much as 50% of the world's hydrocarbon reserves are hosted in porous karst systems.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe English word karst was borrowed from German Karst in the late 19th century.[4] The German word came into use before the 19th century.[5] According to the prevalent interpretation, the term is derived from the German name for the Karst region (Italian: Carso), a limestone plateau above the city of Trieste in the northern Adriatic (now located on the border between Slovenia and Italy, in the 19th century it was part of the Austrian Littoral).[6] Scholars disagree, however, on whether the German word (which shows no metathesis) was borrowed from Slovene.[7][8]\\r\\nThe Slovene common noun kras was first attested in the 18th century, and the adjective form kra?ki in the 16th century.[9] As a proper noun, the Slovene form Grast was first attested in 1177,[10] referring to the Karst Plateaua region in Slovenia partially extending into Italy, where the first research on karst topography was carried out. The Slovene words arose through metathesis from the reconstructed form *korsץ,[9] borrowed from Dalmatian Romance carsus.[10] Ultimately, the word is of Mediterranean origin,[10] believed to derive from some Romanized Illyrian base.[9] It has been suggested that the word may derive from the Proto-Indo-European root karra- \\"rock\\".[10][11] The name may also be connected to the oronym Kar(u)sdios oros cited by Ptolemy, and perhaps also to Latin Carusardius.[9][10]\\r\\nJohann Weikhard von Valvasor, a pioneer of the study of karst in Slovenia and a fellow of the Royal Society for Improving Natural Knowledge, London, introduced the word karst to European scholars in 1689, describing the phenomenon of underground flows of rivers in his account of Lake Cerknica.[12]\\r\\nJovan Cviji? greatly advanced the knowledge of karst regions, so much that he became known as the \\"father of karst geomorphology\\". Primarily working with the karstic regions of the Balkans, Cviji?'s 1893 publication Das Karstph?nomen describes landforms such as karren, dolines and poljes.[3] In a 1918 publication Cviji? proposed a cyclical model for karstic landscape development.[3][13] Karst hydrology emerged as a discipline in the late 1950s and early 1960s in France. Previously, the activities of cave explorers, called speleologists, had been dismissed as more of a sport than a science, meaning that underground karstic caves and their associated watercourses were, from a scientific perspective, understudied.[14]\\r\\nThe development of karst occurs whenever acidic water starts to break down the surface of bedrock near its cracks, or bedding planes. As the bedrock (typically limestone or dolostone) continues to degrade, its cracks tend to get bigger. As time goes on, these fractures will become wider, and eventually a drainage system of some sort may start to form underneath. If this underground drainage system does form, it will speed up the development of karst formations there because more water will be able to flow through the region, giving it more erosive power.[15]\\r\\nThe carbonic acid that causes karstic features is formed as rain passes through the atmosphere picking up carbon dioxide (CO2), which dissolves in the water. Once the rain reaches the ground, it may pass through soil that can provide much more CO2 to form a weak carbonic acid solution, which dissolves calcium carbonate. The primary reaction sequence in limestone dissolution is the following:\\r\\nIn particular and very rare conditions such as encountered in the past in Lechuguilla Cave in New Mexico (and more recently in the Frasassi Caves in Italy), other mechanisms may also play a role. The oxidation of sulfides leading to the formation of sulfuric acid can also be one of the corrosion factors in karst formation. As oxygen (O2)-rich surface waters seep into deep anoxic karst systems, they bring oxygen, which reacts with sulfide present in the system (pyrite or hydrogen sulfide) to form sulfuric acid (H2SO4). Sulfuric acid then reacts with calcium carbonate, causing increased erosion within the limestone formation. This chain of reactions is:\\r\\nThis reaction chain forms gypsum.[16]\\r\\nThe karstification of a landscape may result in a variety of large- or small-scale features both on the surface and beneath. On exposed surfaces, small features may include solution flutes (or rillenkarren), runnels, limestone pavement (clints and grikes), collectively called karren or lapiez. Medium-sized surface features may include sinkholes or cenotes (closed basins), vertical shafts, foibe (inverted funnel shaped sinkholes), disappearing streams, and reappearing springs. Large-scale features may include limestone pavements, poljes, and karst valleys. Mature karst landscapes, where more bedrock has been removed than remains, may result in karst towers, or haystack/eggbox landscapes. Beneath the surface, complex underground drainage systems (such as karst aquifers) and extensive caves and cavern systems may form.\\r\\nErosion along limestone shores, notably in the tropics, produces karst topography that includes a sharp makatea surface above the normal reach of the sea, and undercuts that are mostly the result of biological activity or bioerosion at or a little above mean sea level. Some of the most dramatic of these formations can be seen in Thailand's Phangnga Bay and at Halong Bay in Vietnam.\\r\\nCalcium carbonate dissolved into water may precipitate out where the water discharges some of its dissolved carbon dioxide. Rivers which emerge from springs may produce tufa terraces, consisting of layers of calcite deposited over extended periods of time. In caves, a variety of features collectively called speleothems are formed by deposition of calcium carbonate and other dissolved minerals.\\r\\nFarming in karst areas must take into account the lack of surface water. The soils may be fertile enough, and rainfall may be adequate, but rainwater quickly moves through the crevices into the ground, sometimes leaving the surface soil parched between rains.\\r\\nA karst fenster occurs when an underground stream emerges onto the surface between layers of rock, cascades some distance, and then disappears back down, often into a sinkhole. Rivers in karst areas may disappear underground a number of times and spring up again in different places, usually under a different name (like Ljubljanica, the river of seven names). An example of this is the Popo Agie River in Fremont County, Wyoming. At a site simply named \\"The Sinks\\" in Sinks Canyon State Park, the river flows into a cave in a formation known as the Madison Limestone and then rises again 800?m (1?2?mi) down the canyon in a placid pool. A turlough is a unique type of seasonal lake found in Irish karst areas which are formed through the annual welling-up of water from the underground water system.\\r\\nWater supplies from wells in karst topography may be unsafe, as the water may have run unimpeded from a sinkhole in a cattle pasture, through a cave and to the well, bypassing the normal filtering that occurs in a porous aquifer. Karst formations are cavernous and therefore have high rates of permeability, resulting in reduced opportunity for contaminants to be filtered. Groundwater in karst areas is just as easily polluted as surface streams. Sinkholes have often been used as farmstead or community trash dumps. Overloaded or malfunctioning septic tanks in karst landscapes may dump raw sewage directly into underground channels.\\r\\nThe karst topography also poses difficulties for human inhabitants. Sinkholes can develop gradually as surface openings enlarge, but progressive erosion is frequently unseen until the roof of an underground cavern suddenly collapses. Such events have swallowed homes, cattle, cars, and farm machinery. In the United States, sudden collapse of such a cavern-sinkhole swallowed part of the collection of the National Corvette Museum in Bowling Green, Kentucky in 2014.[17]\\r\\nInterstratal karst is a karstic landscape which is developed beneath a cover of insoluble rocks. Typically this will involve a cover of sandstone overlying limestone strata undergoing solution. In the United Kingdom extensive doline fields developed at Mynydd Llangynidr across a plateau of Twrch Sandstone overlying concealed Carboniferous Limestone.[18]\\r\\nKegelkarst is a type of tropical karst terrain with numerous cone-like hills, formed by cockpits, mogotes, and poljes and without strong fluvial erosion processes. This terrain is found in Cuba, Jamaica, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Puerto Rico, southern China, Myanmar, Thailand, Laos and Vietnam.[19]\\r\\nPseudokarsts are similar in form or appearance to karst features but are created by different mechanisms. Examples include lava caves and granite torsfor example, Labertouche Cave in Victoria, Australiaand paleocollapse features. Mud Caves are an example of pseudokarst.\\r\\nThe world's largest limestone karst is Australia's Nullarbor Plain. Slovenia has the world's highest risk of sinkholes, while the western Highland Rim in the eastern United States is at the second-highest risk of karst sinkholes.[20][21]\\r\\nMexico hosts important karstic regions in the Yucatn peninsula and Chiapas.[22]\\r\\nThe South China Karst in the provinces of Guizhou, Guangxi, and Yunnan provinces is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\\r\\nMany karst-related terms derive from South Slavic languages, entering scientific vocabulary through early research in the Western Balkan Dinaric Alpine karst.","input":"What landform is not common in an area of karst topography?"},{"output":"animal","context":"The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is a type of organelle in eukaryotic cells that forms an interconnected network of flattened, membrane-enclosed sacs or tube-like structures known as cisternae. The membranes of the ER are continuous with the outer nuclear membrane. The endoplasmic reticulum occurs in most types of eukaryotic cells, but is absent from red blood cells and spermatozoa. There are two types of endoplasmic reticulum: rough and smooth. The outer (cytosolic) face of the rough endoplasmic reticulum is studded with ribosomes that are the sites of protein synthesis. The rough endoplasmic reticulum is especially prominent in cells such as hepatocytes. The smooth endoplasmic reticulum lacks ribosomes and functions in lipid manufacture and metabolism, the production of steroid hormones, and detoxification.[1] The smooth ER is especially abundant in mammalian liver and gonad cells. The lacy membranes of the endoplasmic reticulum were first seen in 1945 using electron microscopy.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe lacy membranes of the endoplasmic reticulum were first seen in 1945 by Keith R. Porter, Albert Claude, Brody Meskers and Ernest F. Fullam, using electron microscopy.[2] The word reticulum, which means \\"network\\", was applied to describe this fabric of membranes.\\r\\nThe general structure of the endoplasmic reticulum is a network of membranes called cisternae. These sac-like structures are held together by the cytoskeleton. The phospholipid membrane encloses the cisternal space (or lumen), which is continuous with the perinuclear space but separate from the cytosol. The functions of the endoplasmic reticulum can be summarized as the synthesis and export of proteins and membrane lipids, but varies between ER and cell type and cell function. The quantity of both rough and smooth endoplasmic reticulum in a cell can slowly interchange from one type to the other, depending on the changing metabolic activities of the cell. Transformation can include embedding of new proteins in membrane as well as structural changes. Changes in protein content may occur without noticeable structural changes.[3][4][citation needed]\\r\\nThe surface of the rough endoplasmic reticulum (often abbreviated RER or Rough ER) (also called granular endoplasmic reticulum) is studded with protein-manufacturing ribosomes giving it a \\"rough\\" appearance (hence its name).[5] The binding site of the ribosome on the rough endoplasmic reticulum is the translocon.[6] However, the ribosomes are not a stable part of this organelle's structure as they are constantly being bound and released from the membrane. A ribosome only binds to the RER once a specific protein-nucleic acid complex forms in the cytosol. This special complex forms when a free ribosome begins translating the mRNA of a protein destined for the secretory pathway.[7] The first 5ÿ30 amino acids polymerized encode a signal peptide, a molecular message that is recognized and bound by a signal recognition particle (SRP). Translation pauses and the ribosome complex binds to the RER translocon where translation continues with the nascent (new) protein forming into the RER lumen and/or membrane. The protein is processed in the ER lumen by an enzyme (a signal peptidase), which removes the signal peptide. Ribosomes at this point may be released back into the cytosol; however, non-translating ribosomes are also known to stay associated with translocons.[8]\\r\\nThe membrane of the rough endoplasmic reticulum forms large double membrane sheets that are located near, and continuous with, the outer layer of the nuclear envelope.[9] The double membrane sheets are stacked and connected through several right or left-handed helical ramps, the so-called Terasaki ramps, giving rise to a structure resembling a parking garage.[10] Although there is no continuous membrane between the endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi apparatus, membrane-bound vesicles shuttle proteins between these two compartments.[11] Vesicles are surrounded by coating proteins called COPI and COPII. COPII targets vesicles to the Golgi apparatus and COPI marks them to be brought back to the rough endoplasmic reticulum. The rough endoplasmic reticulum works in concert with the Golgi complex to target new proteins to their proper destinations. A second method of transport out of the endoplasmic reticulum involves areas called membrane contact sites, where the membranes of the endoplasmic reticulum and other organelles are held closely together, allowing the transfer of lipids and other small molecules.[12][13]\\r\\nThe rough endoplasmic reticulum is key in multiple functions:\\r\\nIn most cells the smooth endoplasmic reticulum (abbreviated SER) is scarce. Instead there are areas where the ER is partly smooth and partly rough, this area is called the transitional ER. The transitional ER gets its name because it contains ER exit sites. These are areas where the transport vesicles that contain lipids and proteins made in the ER, detach from the ER and start moving to the Golgi apparatus. Specialized cells can have a lot of smooth endoplasmic reticulum and in these cells the smooth ER has many functions.[14] It synthesizes lipids, phospholipids, and steroids. Cells which secrete these products, such as those in the testes, ovaries, and sebaceous glands have an abundance of smooth endoplasmic reticulum.[15] It also carries out the metabolism of carbohydrates, detoxification of natural metabolism products and of alcohol and drugs, attachment of receptors on cell membrane proteins, and steroid metabolism.[16] In muscle cells, it regulates calcium ion concentration. Smooth endoplasmic reticulum is found in a variety of cell types (both animal and plant), and it serves different functions in each. The smooth endoplasmic reticulum also contains the enzyme glucose-6-phosphatase, which converts glucose-6-phosphate to glucose, a step in gluconeogenesis. It is connected to the nuclear envelope and consists of tubules that are located near the cell periphery. These tubes sometimes branch forming a network that is reticular in appearance.[9] In some cells, there are dilated areas like the sacs of rough endoplasmic reticulum. The network of smooth endoplasmic reticulum allows for an increased surface area to be devoted to the action or storage of key enzymes and the products of these enzymes.\\r\\nThe sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR), from the Greek ? sarx (\\"flesh\\"), is smooth ER found in myocytes. The only structural difference between this organelle and the smooth endoplasmic reticulum is the medley of proteins they have, both bound to their membranes and drifting within the confines of their lumens. This fundamental difference is indicative of their functions: The endoplasmic reticulum synthesizes molecules, while the sarcoplasmic reticulum stores calcium ions and pumps them out into the sarcoplasm when the muscle fiber is stimulated.[17][18] After their release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, calcium ions interact with contractile proteins that utilize ATP to shorten the muscle fiber. The sarcoplasmic reticulum plays a major role in excitation-contraction coupling.[19]\\r\\nThe endoplasmic reticulum serves many general functions, including the folding of protein molecules in sacs called cisternae and the transport of synthesized proteins in vesicles to the Golgi apparatus. Correct folding of newly made proteins is made possible by several endoplasmic reticulum chaperone proteins, including protein disulfide isomerase (PDI), ERp29, the Hsp70 family member BiP/Grp78, calnexin, calreticulin, and the peptidylpropyl isomerase family. Only properly folded proteins are transported from the rough ER to the Golgi apparatus ÿ unfolded proteins cause an unfolded protein response as a stress response in the ER. Disturbances in redox regulation, calcium regulation, glucose deprivation, and viral infection[20] or the over-expression of proteins[21] can lead to endoplasmic reticulum stress response (ER stress), a state in which the folding of proteins slows, leading to an increase in unfolded proteins. This stress is emerging as a potential cause of damage in hypoxia/ischemia, insulin resistance, and other disorders.[22]\\r\\nSecretory proteins, mostly glycoproteins, are moved across the endoplasmic reticulum membrane. Proteins that are transported by the endoplasmic reticulum throughout the cell are marked with an address tag called a signal sequence. The N-terminus (one end) of a polypeptide chain (i.e., a protein) contains a few amino acids that work as an address tag, which are removed when the polypeptide reaches its destination. Nascent peptides reach the ER via the translocon, a membrane-embedded multiprotein complex. Proteins that are destined for places outside the endoplasmic reticulum are packed into transport vesicles and moved along the cytoskeleton toward their destination. In human fibroblasts, the ER is always co-distributed with microtubules and the depolymerisation of the latter cause its co-aggregation with mitochondria, which are also associated with the ER.[23]\\r\\nThe endoplasmic reticulum is also part of a protein sorting pathway. It is, in essence, the transportation system of the eukaryotic cell. The majority of its resident proteins are retained within it through a retention motif. This motif is composed of four amino acids at the end of the protein sequence. The most common retention sequences are KDEL for lumen located proteins and KKXX for transmembrane protein.[24] However, variations of KDEL and KKXX do occur, and other sequences can also give rise to endoplasmic reticulum retention. It is not known whether such variation can lead to sub-ER localizations. There are three KDEL (1, 2 and 3) receptors in mammalian cells, and they have a very high degree of sequence identity. The functional differences between these receptors remain to be established.[25]\\r\\nAbnormalities in XBP1 lead to a heightened endoplasmic reticulum stress response and subsequently causes a higher susceptibility for inflammatory processes that may even contribute to Alzheimer's disease.[26] In the colon, XBP1 anomalies have been linked to the inflammatory bowel diseases including Crohn's disease.[27]\\r\\nThe unfolded protein response (UPR) is a cellular stress response related to the endoplasmic reticulum.[28] The UPR is activated in response to an accumulation of unfolded or misfolded proteins in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum. The UPR functions to restore normal function of the cell by halting protein translation, degrading misfolded proteins, and activating the signaling pathways that lead to increasing the production of molecular chaperones involved in protein folding. Sustained overactivation of the UPR has been implicated in prion diseases as well as several other neurodegenerative diseases and the inhibition of the UPR could become a treatment for those diseases.[29]","input":"Is the endoplasmic reticulum found in plants or animals?"},{"output":"Bruno Sammartino","context":"The WWE Championship is a professional wrestling championship in WWE, currently on the SmackDown brand. It is the first world title established in WWE, having been introduced in 1963 as the World Wide Wrestling Federation (WWWF) World Heavyweight Championship. The promotion was renamed World Wrestling Federation (WWF) in 1979 and ended its affiliation with the National Wrestling Alliance (NWA) in 1983, with the title also renamed to reflect the changes. In 2001, it was unified with the World Championship (formerly the WCW World Heavyweight Championship) following the WWF's buyout of World Championship Wrestling (WCW) and became the Undisputed WWF Championship.[1][2] In 2002, the WWF was renamed World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) and split its roster into two brands, Raw and SmackDown.[3][4] The title, now renamed WWE Championship, was then designated to the SmackDown brand, while WWE established an alternate world title known as the World Heavyweight Championship for the Raw brand. A third alternate world title, the ECW World Heavyweight Championship, was reactivated for the ECW brand in 2006. It was vacated and decommissioned when the ECW brand disbanded in 2010.[5]\\r\\nWhen WWE Champion Randy Orton defeated World Heavyweight Champion John Cena at the TLC pay-per-view on December 15, 2013, the World Heavyweight Championship was unified with the WWE Championship, resulting in the retiring of the former,[6] and the renaming of the latter to the WWE World Heavyweight Championship. On June 27, 2016, the name was shortened back to the WWE Championship,[7] before assuming the WWE World Championship name on July 26, 2016, when the brand extension returned. It became designated to the SmackDown brand, and WWE again established an alternate world title known as the WWE Universal Championship for the Raw brand. In December 2016, WWE again shortened the title's name back to WWE Championship.[8]\\r\\nThe championship is generally contested in professional wrestling matches, in which participants execute scripted finishes rather than contend in direct competition. Some reigns were held by champions using a ring name, while others use their real name. The first champion was Buddy Rogers, who won the championship in 1963. The champion with the single longest reign is Bruno Sammartino with a reign of 2,803 days, while the record for longest combined reign is also held by Sammartino at 4,040. The current champion is AJ Styles, who is in his second reign. He won the championship by defeating Jinder Mahal on SmackDown Live in Manchester, England on November 7, 2017.[9]\\r\\nOverall, there have been 50 different official champions, with John Cena having the most reigns at thirteen. Seven men in history have held the championship for a continuous reign of one year (365 days) or more: Bruno Sammartino, Pedro Morales, Bob Backlund, Hulk Hogan, Randy Savage, John Cena, and CM Punk.[10]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAs of November 13, 2017.\\r\\nAs of November 13, 2017.","input":"Who is the longest reigning champion in wwe?"},{"output":"Kansas","context":"Wheat is produced in almost every state in the United States, and is the principal cereal grain grown in the country.[1] The type and quantity vary between regions. The United States is ranked third in production volume of wheat, with almost 58 million tons produced in the 2012ÿ2013 growing season, behind only China and India. (But the combined production of all European Union nations is larger than that of China.[2]) The United States ranks first in crop export volume; almost 50% of its total wheat production is exported.\\r\\nThe United States Department of Agriculture defines eight official classes of wheat: durum wheat, hard red spring wheat, hard red winter wheat, soft red winter wheat, hard white wheat, soft white wheat, unclassed wheat, and mixed wheat.[3] Winter wheat accounts for 70 to 80 percent of total production in the U.S., with the largest amounts produced in Kansas (10.8 million tons) and North Dakota (9.8 million tons). The U.S. hard red spring wheat crop is exported to over 70 countries each year to the extent of 55%. Of the total wheat produced in the country, 50% is exported, valued at US$9 billion.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough it was first introduced to the Western Hemisphere following the discovery of the New World in the 15th century, wheat came to be grown in North American soil only during the colonial period.[5] During the colonial period, wheat was sown by broadcasting, reaped by sickles, and threshed by flails. The kernels were then taken to a grist mill for grinding into flour.\\r\\nIn 1830, it took four people and two oxen, working 10 hours a day, to produce 200 bushels.[6] The geographic center of wheat-growing areas in the U.S. in 1839 was to the north and west of Washington, D. C., and spread further over time to the far west of the country. Production conditions also resulted in extending the wheat growing areas into harsher climatic regions. Data on wheat production is available for the period between 1885 and 1930. Improvements in wheat breeding in the U.S. was an activity of the state agricultural experiment stations, while the federal officials concentrated on exploring possibilities of gaining from appropriate varieties developed in other parts of the world.[7]\\r\\nAfter the American Civil War, the western Mississippi Valley and the Great Plains to its west, where large fertile lands were available, resulted in expanding wheat farming. By this time, better tillage equipment was in use, railroads provided better access to world markets, better trading and warehousing facilities were facilitated, and more particularly introduction of hard winter was introduced.[8] In the 1870s, Turkey red wheat, a hard variety of wheat, was introduced to the farmlands of Kansas by Russian Mennonite immigrants. This wheat variety spread quickly.[9] New technology substantially enhanced productivity in the 19th century, as sowing with drills replaced broadcasting, cradles took the place of sickles, and the cradles in turn were replaced by reapers and binders. Steam-powered threshing machines superseded flails. By 1895, in Bonanza farms in the Dakotas, it took six different people and 36 horses pulling huge harvesters, working 10 hours a day, to produce 20,000 bushels. Following the invention of the steel roller mill in 1878, hard varieties of wheat such as Turkey Red became more popular than soft, which had been previously preferred because they were easier for grist mills to grind.[10]\\r\\nExports from 1914 to 1922 amounted to more than 200 million bushels.[8] The annual wheat production of the United States more than tripled in the fifty years between 1871 and 1921; it increased from about 250 million bushels during the period of 1869ÿ1871 to over 750 millions during the period of 1919ÿ1921.[11] With recorded wheat production of more than its domestic consumption (production was as much as 2.5 times the consumption), as World War II started, wheat stocks could not be lifted and the result was its use as livestock feed and for industrial alcohol.[8] After the war years, there were four \\"best\\" years (1945ÿ1948) when the average annual production peaked to 1,228 million bushels, double the production of war years.[8]\\r\\nIn 2002, 50% of the U.S. wheat crop was exported, while 36% was consumed by the American population, and 10% was fed to livestock, with the remaining 4% set aside for seed. Wheat harvesting occurs on land area of 60ÿ63 million acres.[1] Genetically modified wheat, which \\"is not approved for cultivation anywhere in the world\\", was found in an Oregon farm in June 2013.[12] The grain was modified by Monsanto to tolerate weed killer treatments. It is not known whether the unapproved wheat is present elsewhere.[13]\\r\\nIn the North American plains, the axis which extends over a length of 1,500 miles (2,400?km) in a north-south direction from central Texas to central Alberta is known as the Wheat Belt. Hard red winter wheat is grown in the southern U.S. states of Kansas, Oklahoma, Texas, Nebraska, and Colorado. In the hot climatic conditions of these states, winter wheat is raised by planting in fall and harvesting in the spring. taking advantage of autumn rains. Under harsh cold weather conditions in parts of Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, and Minnesota where winter wheat cannot be grown, the crop is planted in the spring and grows during the long summer days of the high latitudes so that it can be harvested in the fall.[14]\\r\\nOf wheat grown in the United States, 36% percent is consumed domestically by humans, 50% is exported, 10% is used for livestock feed, and 4% is used for seedlings.[15] Various American-style wheat beers are produced in the US.[16] Wheat in the U.S. is grown under two major categories based on climate: winter wheat, and spring wheat. The majority is winter wheat, accounting for, on average, 75% of wheat production. Wheat may be further classified as follows:[17] [18]\\r\\nIn 1941, the wheat industry began to adopt voluntary widespread enrichment (fortification) of wheat flour with vitamins, folic acid, and iron, the outcome of a recommendation by the National Nutrition Conference for Defense, charged with investigating the causes of poor health among many World War II recruits. By 1942, some 75 percent of breads in the United States were fortified. Mandatory fortification requirements went into effect in 1943, following the publication of the first U.S. government recommended dietary allowances. The removal of naturally occurring nutrients that occurs in grain processing led to a number of diseases caused by nutritional deficiency, including beriberi, pellagra, neural tube defect, and iron deficiency anemia. Enrichment helped eradicate or reduce the frequency of these conditions in the United States.[19][20]\\r\\nUnder the Wilson administration during World War I, the U.S. Food Administration, under the direction of Herbert Hoover, set a basic price of $2.20 per bushel. The end of the war led to \\"the closing of the bonanza export markets and the fall of sky-high farm prices\\", and wheat prices fell from more than $2.20 per bushel in 1919 to $1.01 in 1921.[21] The McNaryÿHaugen Farm Relief Bill failed in Congress, and was followed by the Agricultural Marketing Act of 1929, the establishment of the Federal Farm Board, and the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1933.[8][22] The most important legislation for wheat production in the United States today are the farm bills which authorized farm subsidies, the Conservation Reserve Program, and other programs. Adopted around every five years, the most recent farm bills are the 1985 farm bill, 1990 farm bill, 1996 farm bill, 2002 farm bill, and 2008 farm bill.\\r\\nWheat farmers are a major beneficiary of crop subsidies and other agricultural programs. According to U.S. Department of Agriculture data, from 1995 to 2012, the U.S. federal government paid over $39 billion in wheat subsidies, through direct payments (2003ÿpresent) and production flexibility contracts (1996-2002), deficiency payments, crop insurance premium subsidies, price support payments (including loan deficiency payments, marketing loan gains, and certificates), counter-cyclical programs, market loss assistance, and other wheat programs.[23] In 2012, wheat was the third most-subsidized crop, after corn and soybeans. Wheat farmers received $1.1 billion in subsidies in 2012.[24]\\r\\nThe United States is a major wheat-producing country, with output typically exceeded only by China, the European Union, and India. Acreage brought under wheat has, over the last several decades, varied with the wheat price. During the first decade of the 2000s, wheat ranked third among U.S. field crops in both planted acreage and gross farm income; the first two positions were held by corn and soybeans. The acreage has gone down by nearly 30% (to 48,653,000 acres in 2001, as against 60-63 million acres harvested annually in the previous years; 30 of this area is in Texas.[15]) The amount exported has also declined.[13] The acreage reduction was dictated by the Acreage Reduction Program (ARP), which was introduced for wheat, feed grains, and cotton; and production faces pressures from multiple factors.[25][26]\\r\\nIt is generally accepted that wheat is beneficial to grow in the off season compared to other crops as its planting occurs, depending on the agro-climatic condition, in late fall or early spring. This results in reduced application of fertilizers and pesticides, and less need for irrigation, and helps in preventing soil erosion. However, some of the negative effects identified in a study conducted by the FAO are natural habitat loss due to encroachment into new lands after degraded lands are abandoned, loss of indigenous species affecting the biodiversity, and milling operation causing dust pollution. Historically, habitat conversion in the US has occurred in agropastoral land areas as in many other countries, and is considered a natural development. In the western US, habitat conversion is still an ongoing process because the subsidies provided by the government for wheat and other crops in the US have made it financially profitable to develop areas which otherwise would lie fallow; bluestem prairie is one such area. However, habitat expansion for wheat has stabilized since 2000.[27]\\r\\nNearly 50% of the wheat produced in the US is exported, although the share of the world market has declined due to competition from the EU, Argentina, Australia, Canada, and also recently from Ukraine and Russia. The exported wheat varieties are white wheat (about 66%), Hard Red Spring (about 50%), Soft Red Winter, and durum wheat. However, the producers continue to increase exports as in the domestic market wheat products have not been competitive in recent years.[13]\\r\\nOne of the widely criticized export policies of the US was the PL 480 (Public Law 480), instituted in 1954, which lasted till 1969. India had a major share of about 50% in receiving this aid under it. This policy was criticized because it had damaged the export potential of many countries, in particular Canada and Australia. It was also said that this policy discouraged countries from developing their own agriculture.[29] In India, in particular, this aid, in fact, \\"bankrupted large numbers of Indian farmers\\".[30]","input":"Where is wheat grown in the united states?"},{"output":"an unincorporated territory of the United States.","context":"The political status of Puerto Rico is that of an unincorporated territory of the United States. As such, the island is neither a sovereign nation nor a U.S. state. Because of that ambiguity, the territory, as a polity, lacks certain rights but enjoys certain benefits that other polities have or lack. For instance, in contrast to sovereign nations, Puerto Rico does not have voting rights in its federal legislature nor in electing its federal head of government. But, in contrast to U.S. states, Puerto Ricans are not subject to federal income taxes. The political status of the island thus stems from how different Puerto Rico is politically from sovereign nations and from U.S. states.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe status of the island is the result of various political activities within both the United States and Puerto Rican governments.  The United Nations removed it from the list of non-self-governing territories in 1953.[1] But it remains subject to the Territorial Clause of the U.S. Constitution. According to the Insular Cases, Puerto Rico is \\"a territory appurtenant and belonging to the United States, but not a part of the United States within the revenue clauses of the Constitution\\".[2][3]\\r\\n\\r\\nAmerican and Puerto Rican political activities regarding the status question have revolved around three sets of initiatives: presidential executive orders, bills in the U.S. Congress, and referenda held in Puerto Rico. U.S. Presidents have issued three executive orders on the subject, and Congress has considered four major bills on Puerto Rico's political status. Puerto Rican status referenda have been held four times to determine the desired political status of Puerto Rico in relation to the United States of America. In 1967 and 1993, Commonwealth won. In another plebiscite held on November 6, 2012,  54% of respondents voted to reject the current status under the territorial clause of the U.S. Constitution.[4] In a second question, 61% favored statehood as the preferred alternative, however, when blank ballots were counted, statehood support dropped to 45%.[5] Another referendum was held on June 11, 2017, in which voters had three options: \\"Statehood\\", \\"Free Association/Independence\\" or \\"Current Territorial Status\\". While 97% of voters chose \\"Statehood\\", turnout was only 23% (the lowest in history) due to a boycott from pro-Independence and pro-Commonwealth supporters.\\r\\n\\r\\nInternationally, several organizations have called for the U.S. government to expedite the process to allow self-determination in Puerto Rico while considering Puerto Rico a Caribbean nation with its own national identity.[6][7][8][9][10] For instance, the United Nations Special Committee on Decolonization has called for the United States \\"to allow the Puerto Rican people to take decisions in a sovereign manner, and to address their urgent economic and social needs, including unemployment, marginalization, insolvency and poverty.\\"[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe United States acquired the islands of Puerto Rico in 1898 after the SpanishÿAmerican War. In 1950, Congress enacted legislation (P.L. 81-600) authorizing Puerto Rico to hold a constitutional convention and in 1952, the people of Puerto Rico ratified a constitution establishing a republican form of government for the island. After being approved by Congress and the President in July 1952 and thus given force under federal law (P.L. 82-447), the new constitution went into effect on July 25, 1952.\\r\\n\\r\\nPuerto Rico has been under U.S. sovereignty for over a century and Puerto Ricans have been U.S. citizens since 1917.[12][13][14] Since the promulgation of the current Commonwealth constitution in 1952, further local attempts to change the island's political status took place in 1967, 1993, and 1998. An additional referendum held in 1991 sought to amend the relationship through an amendment to the Puerto Rican constitution. Each time, the results favored retaining the current status over the possible independence of Puerto Rico and statehood alternatives.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs a result of Puerto Rico's status as a U.S. territory, the citizens of Puerto Rico do not have any voting representation in the U.S. Federal government. Instead of outright representation through Senators and House Representatives, Puerto Rico has one non-voting Resident Commissioner in the House of Representatives. Furthermore, Puerto Rico is not represented in the Electoral College, and thus U.S. citizens resident there are unable to vote in U.S. presidential elections. Citizens of Puerto Rico can vote in the Republican and Democratic primary elections.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough Puerto Rico presently has a certain amount of local autonomy, according to the U.S. Constitution ultimate governance of the island is retained by both the U.S. Congress and President.[15][16][17]\\r\\nThus, results of plebiscites, whether or not authorized by Congress, while they reflect public sentiment, and thus bear some impact, can be ignored by Congress. Ultimately, the results of Puerto Rican plebiscites are opinions, although congressional resolutions have expressed support for following the will of the Puerto Rican people.[18][full citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe English term \\"commonwealth\\" \\"does not describe or provide for any specific political status or relationship ... [and] when used in connection with areas under U.S. sovereignty that are not states ... broadly describes an area that is self-governing under a constitution of its adoption and whose right of self-government will not be unilaterally withdrawn by Congress\\".[19] It is the same terminology used elsewhere but with other different meanings than what is meant for Puerto Rico:\\r\\n\\r\\nBut in the United States, \\"commonwealth\\" is also a term, without a clear and stable legal definition, now and previously used by current and past possessions of the United States:\\r\\n\\r\\nJuan R. Torruella, a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit (which has jurisdiction over the Federal Court for the District of Puerto Rico), claims that the use of the term \\"commonwealth\\" is a label that \\"can deceive and obscure the true nature of things\\". He contends that Puerto Rico is obviously not a state, and that \\"neither Puerto Rico's status nor its relationship with the U.S. supports any legitimate claim that a British type of 'commonwealth' exists between Puerto Rico and the United States\\".[22]\\r\\n\\r\\nThen U.S. Secretary of the Interior Oscar L. Chapman, under whose Department resided responsibility of Puerto Rican affairs, clarified the new commonwealth label by stating, \\"The bill (to permit Puerto Rico to write its own constitution) merely authorizes the people of Puerto Rico to adopt their own constitution and to organize a local government. ... The bill under consideration would not change Puerto Rico's political, social, and economic relationship to the United States.\\"[23]\\r\\n\\r\\nIt has been said that \\"any inquiry into Puerto Rico's status must begin with the Constitution of the United States, as well as various Supreme Court and lower court decisions\\".[24]\\r\\n\\r\\nAlmost immediately after Puerto Rico was ceded to the United States, Puerto Rico's political status was defined by a series of landmark decisions made by the U.S. Supreme Court in what are collectively known as The Insular Cases. From 1901 to 1905, the Supreme Court held that the Constitution extended ex proprio vigore to the territories. However, the Court in these cases also established the doctrine of territorial incorporation. Under the same, the Constitution only applied fully in incorporated territories such as Alaska and Hawaii, whereas it only applied partially in the new unincorporated territories of Puerto Rico, Guam and the Philippines. Although other cases followed, strictly speaking the Insular Cases are the original six opinions issued concerning acquired territories as a result of the Treaty of Paris (1898). The six cases were:[25]\\r\\n\\r\\nConsidered the leading Insular case, concluded that the United States could acquire territory and exercise unrestricted power in determining what rights to concede to its inhabitants.

For example, in Balzac v. Porto Rico, 258 U.S. 298, 305 (1922), explained the distinction between an incorporated and a non-incorporated territory. Juan R. Torruella restated it this way, \\"an unincorporated territory is a territory as to which, when acquired by the United States, no clear intention was expressed that it would eventually be incorporated into the Union as a State\\".[30]\\r\\n\\r\\nSince the Insular Cases had established that only those rights in the U.S. Bill of Rights that are determined to be \\"fundamental\\" are applicable in unincorporated territories, the implications of Balzac v. Porto Rico have been enormous. For example:\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a brief concurrence in the United States Supreme Court judgment of Torres v. Puerto Rico, 442 U.S. 465 (1979), Supreme Court Justice Brennan, argued that any implicit limits from the Insular Cases on the basic rights granted by the Constitution (including especially the Bill of Rights) were anachronistic in the 1970s.[36]\\r\\n\\r\\nPuerto Rico's current political status limits to the autonomy of the Puerto Rican government. For example, the Island's government is not fully autonomous, and a level of federal presence in the Island is commonplace, including a branch of the United States Federal District Court.\\r\\n\\r\\nPeople born in Puerto Rico are U.S. citizens by birth but that citizenship is protected by statutory law rather than by the U.S. Constitution.\\r\\n\\r\\nPuerto Ricans are also covered by a group of \\"fundamental civil rights\\" but, because Puerto Rico is not a state, they are not covered by the full Bill of Rights. All residents must pay federal taxes but, for a variety of reasons, only some pay federal income taxes.[37][note 1]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2017, the Government Accountability Office estimated that corporations paid $1.42 billion in taxes.[which?] Had Puerto Rico been a state, corporations would have paid an estimated $5 billion to $9.3 billion.[which?][54]\\r\\n\\r\\nPuerto Ricans lack a voting representative in the U.S. Congress, but they do have a Resident Commissioner who has a voice in Congress (but no vote other than committee-level voting). Puerto Ricans must also serve in the United States military whenever it is compulsory in the mainland United States, with the same duties and obligations as U.S. citizens residing in the 50 states.\\r\\n\\r\\nGovernor Alejandro Garca Padilla signed legislation which would have allowed corporations owned by the Commonwealth to declare bankruptcy.[55] However, in Puerto Rico v. Franklin California Tax-Free Trust (2016), the U.S. Supreme Court, by a vote of 5ÿ2, found the legislation was void because it was preempted by the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, with Justice Sonia Sotomayor dissenting.[56]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Puerto Rico v. Sanchez Valle (2016) the U.S. Supreme Court found that the Double Jeopardy Clause of the United States Constitution forbids successive criminal prosecutions by the Commonwealth and the Federal Government because they are not separate sovereigns.[57]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn June 30, 2016, President Barack Obama signed the PROMESA into law, which empowered him to appoint a seven-member Financial Oversight and Management Board that has ultimate control over the Commonwealth's budget.[58]\\r\\n\\r\\nPuerto Rico's main political issue is the territory's relationship with the United States. A United States territory since 1898, and known as \\"Estado Libre Asociado\\" (Free Associated State) or as commonwealth since 1952, Puerto Rico today is torn by profound ideological rifts, as represented by its political parties, which stand for three distinct future political scenarios: the status quo (commonwealth), statehood, and independence. The Popular Democratic Party (PPD) seeks to maintain or improve the current status towards becoming a more sovereign territory of the United States, the New Progressive Party (PNP) seeks to fully incorporate Puerto Rico as a U.S. state, and the Puerto Rican Independence Party (PIP) seeks national independence.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen asked, in non-binding plebiscites, to choose between independence, statehood, or continuation of the status quo with enhanced powers, as proposed by the PPD, Puerto Ricans have voted to remain a commonwealth. In the penultimate plebiscite in 1998, Puerto Ricans voted for \\"none of the above\\" by a slight majority. While 50.3% of them voted for the status quo, it has been asserted that \\"the oldest strategy for governing recalcitrant subjectsdivide and conquerwas subtly at work.\\"[59][60]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe issue is debated and is on the agenda of all the political parties and civil society groups. Several pro-commonwealth leaders within the PPD are proposing an Associated Republic or Free Association similar to that of the former U.S. territories of the Federated States of Micronesia, Marshall Islands or Palau.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn general, three main alternatives were presented to Puerto Rican voters in status plebiscites:\\r\\n\\r\\nThe exact expectations for each of these status formulas are a matter of debate by a given position's adherents and detractors. Puerto Ricans have proposed positions that modify the alternatives above:\\r\\n\\r\\nThe following table summarizes the results of Puerto Rico's plebiscites so far.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the Puerto Rican status referendum, 2012[69] 54.00% of voters indicated \\"No\\" to maintaining the current political status. A full 61.11% of voters chose statehood, 33.34% chose free association, and 5.55% chose independence.[70][71] Because there were almost 500,000 blank ballots, creating confusion as to the voters' true desire, Congress decided to ignore the vote.[72][73] The 2014 budget bill included $2.5 million in funding for a future vote on Puerto Rico's political status.[74][75]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe previous plebiscites provided voters with three options: remain a Commonwealth, Statehood and Independence/Free Association. The Puerto Rican status referendum, 2017 was to offer only two options: Statehood and Independence/Free Association. If the majority favor Independence/Free Association, a second vote will be held to determine the preference: full independence as a nation or associated free state status with independence but with a \\"free and voluntary political association\\" between Puerto Rico and the United States. The specifics of the association agreement[76] would be detailed in the Compact of Free Association that would be negotiated between the U.S. and Puerto Rico. That document might cover topics such as the role of the US military in Puerto Rico, the use of the US currency, free trade between the two entities, and whether Puerto Ricans would be U.S. citizens.[77]\\r\\n\\r\\nGovernor Ricardo Rossell܇ is strongly in favor of statehood to help develop the economy and help to \\"solve our 500-year-old colonial dilemma ... Colonialism is not an option .... Its a civil rights issue ...  3.5 million citizens seeking an absolute democracy,\\" he told the news media.[78][79]\\r\\n\\r\\nStatehood might be useful as a means of dealing with the financial crisis, since it would allow for bankruptcy and the relevant protection. According to the Government Development Bank, this might be the only solution to the debt crisis. Congress has the power to vote to allow Chapter 9 protection without the need for statehood, but in late 2015 there was very little support in the House for this concept. Other benefits to statehood include increased disability benefits and Medicaid funding, the right to vote in Presidential elections and the higher (federal) minimum wage.[80]\\r\\n\\r\\nAt approximately the same time as the referendum, Puerto Rico's legislators are also expected to vote on a bill that would allow the Governor to draft a state constitution and hold elections to choose senators and representatives to the federal Congress. Regardless of the outcome of the votes, Congress will be the body to make the final decision on the status of Puerto Rico.[79]\\r\\n\\r\\nVarious U.S. presidents have signed executive orders to help define, study, and generate activity regarding the political status of Puerto Rico. Three major orders were the 2005, 2007, and 2011 executive orders to establish the President's Task Force on Puerto Rico's Status.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Territories Clause of the United States Constitution (Art. IV, Sec. 3, cl. 2) allows for Congress to \\"dispose of\\" Puerto Rico and allow it to become independent of the U.S. (in the same way as the Philippines did in 1945) or, under the authority of the Admissions Clause (Art. IV, Sec. 3, cl. 1) for it to be admitted as a state of the United States (with a vote of Congress in the same way that Alaska and Hawaii were admitted in 1958 and 1959 respectively).\\r\\n\\r\\nSince Congress must approve of any political status change for Puerto Rico, some argue that \\"congressional agreement to the options [on a ballot], prior to a plebiscite would save the people of Puerto Rico the grief of an emotionally draining and politically divisive vote that might result in a status not acceptable to Congress\\".[81] Former Resident Commissioner and Former Governor Carlos Romero Barcel܇ echoed this sentiment when he recalled, at a 1997 congressional hearing, that both \\"[Representatives] Young and Miller were clear in stating [in their March 3, 1997, letter to the presidents of the three political parties in Puerto Rico] that there was no purpose in presenting the people of Puerto Rico a status definition which does not represent an option that the Congress will be willing to ratify should it be approved in a plebiscite.\\"[82]\\r\\n\\r\\nA catalyst for the legislative activity taking place in Congress was the release in December 2005 of the presidential task force's report.[83] Per United States v. Sanchez, 992 F.2d 1143, 1152ÿ53 (11th Cir. 1993), \\"Congress continues to be the ultimate source of power [over Puerto Rico] pursuant to the Territory Clause of the Constitution\\". (quoting United States v. Andino, 831 F.2d 1164, 1176 (1st Cir. 1987) (Torruella, J., concurring), cert. denied, 486 U.S. 1034 (1988)), cert. denied, 510 U.S. 11 10 (1994).9[84] An Act of Congress, thus, is ultimately required to modify the current political status of Puerto Rico.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn June 9, 2016, in Commonwealth of Puerto Rico vs Sanchez Valle, a 6-2 majority of the United States Supreme Court determined that Puerto Rico is a territory and lacks sovereignty.  The opinion of the court stated: \\"Back of the Puerto Rican people and their Constitution, the 'ultimate' source of prosecutorial power remains the U. S. Congress, just as back of a citys charter lies a state government.\\"[85]\\r\\n\\r\\nFour major bills regarding the political status of Puerto Rico have come before Congress, H.R. 856, H.R. 900, H.R. 2499, and H.R. 2000.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe United Nations has intervened in the past to evaluate the legitimacy of Puerto Rico's political status, to ensure that the island's government structure complies with the standards of self-government that constitute the basic tenets of the United Nations Charter, its covenants, and its principles of international law. Some authorities, such as Trias Monge, argue that Puerto Rico \\"clearly does not meet the decolonization standards set by the United Nations in 1960\\".[86]\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring its 8th session, the United Nations General Assembly recognized Puerto Rico's self-government on November 27, 1953, with Resolution 748 (VIII).[87] (UN Resolution \\"748 (VIII)\\", adopted on November 27, 1953, during its 459th Plenary Meeting.) This removed Puerto Rico's classification as a non-self-governing territory (under article 73(e) of the Charter of the United Nations). The resolution passed, garnering a favorable vote from some 40% of the General Assembly, with over 60% abstaining or voting against it (20 to 16, plus 18 abstentions). Today, however, the UN \\"still debates whether Puerto Rico is a colony\\" or not.[88]\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, Puerto Rico's political status is still debated in many international forums, possibly in part because of the circumstances surrounding the vote: \\"Under United States pressure, General Assembly Resolution 748 passedthough only narrowly and with many countries abstaining. The debate over Resolution 748 prompted the United Nations to agree on governing arrangements that would provide full self-government to non-self-governing territories: in United States terms, these arrangements were statehood, independence, and free association. Yet, under international law, a freely associated state is a sovereign nation in a joint governing arrangement with another nation that either nation can unilaterally end.\\"[89] Though the subject continues to be debated in many forums it is clear that (1) the current territorial status has not satisfied Puerto Rican political leaders,[89] and (2) that despite the divergent views that Puerto Ricans have with respect to their preferred political status, 'all factions agree on the need to end the present undemocratic arrangement whereby Puerto Rico is subject to the laws of Congress but cannot vote in it.'[89]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe list of factors for determining when a colony has achieved a full measure of self-government appears in Resolution 1541 (XV) of the General Assembly of the United Nations, 15 UN GAOR Supplement (No. 16) at 29, UN Document A/4684 (1960).[90][91]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe General Assembly did not apply its full list of criteria to Puerto Rico[91][92] for determining whether or not self-governing status had been achieved. The UN's Committee on Non-Self-Governing States recently unanimously agreed to ask the General Assembly to take up the issue of Puerto Rico.[93] In June 2007, the Puerto Rico Senate approved a Concurrent Resolution urging the UN General Assembly to discuss Puerto Rico's case.\\r\\n\\r\\nStarting in 1971, \\"Cuba introduced annual resolutions on the issue in the UN's Decolonization Committee but the United States has blocked General Assembly action and stopped cooperating with the Decolonization Committee. On August 23, 1973, the United States vigorously opposed that members of Puerto Rico's independence movement be allowed to speak at the UN.[94] The U.S. position has not been that Puerto Rico is not a territory; rather, the U.S. position of record, based on General Assembly Resolution 748, is that the Decolonization Committee lacks jurisdiction, that the matter is one for the United States and Puerto Rico to resolve, and that Puerto Rico has not sought a new status.\\"[89]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1972, the UN set a precedent when, after approving Puerto Rico's association with the United States in 1953[95] as sufficient evidence to remove PR from the list of Colonized Countries, the United Nations reopened the matter in 1972 and it is still under review.[96][97][98] \\"Failure [of the United States] to include independence as an option and harassment of [Puerto Rican] pro-independence organizations were reasons for the United Nations' recent reconsideration of the status of Puerto Rico\\".[98]\\r\\n\\r\\nSince 1972, the Decolonization Committee has called for Puerto Rico's decolonization and for the United States to recognize the island's right to self-determination and independence. Most recently, the Decolonization Committee called for the General Assembly to review the political status of Puerto Rico, a power reserved by the 1953 resolution.[99][100]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1993, the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit stated that Congress may unilaterally repeal the Puerto Rican Constitution or the Puerto Rico Federal Relations Act of 1950 and replace them with any rules or regulations of its choice.[101] In a 1996 report on a Puerto Rico status political bill, the U.S. House Committee on Resources stated, \\"Puerto Rico's current status does not meet the criteria for any of the options for full self-government under Resolution 1541\\" (the three established forms of full self-government being stated in the report as (1) national independence, (2) free association based on separate sovereignty, or (3) full integration with another nation on the basis of equality). The report concluded that Puerto Rico \\"remains an unincorporated territory and does not have the status of 'free association' with the United States as that status is defined under United States law or international practice\\", and that the establishment of local self-government with the consent of the people can be unilaterally revoked by the U.S. Congress.[102][103] The application of the U.S. Constitution applies partially to Puerto Rico by the Insular Cases.\\r\\n\\r\\nSince 1953, the UN has been considering the political status of Puerto Rico and how to assist it in achieving \\"independence\\" or \\"decolonization\\". In 1978, the United Nations Special Committee on Decolonization determined that a \\"colonial relationship\\" existed between the US and Puerto Rico.[104]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe United Nations Special Committee on Decolonization has often referred to Puerto Rico as a nation in its reports, because, internationally, the people of Puerto Rico are often considered to be a Caribbean nation with their own national identity.[7][6][105] In a June 2016 report, the Special Committee called for the United States to expedite the process to allow self-determination in Puerto Rico. The group called on the United States to expedite a process that would allow the people of Puerto Rico to exercise fully their right to self-determination and independence. ... [and] allow the Puerto Rican people to take decisions in a sovereign manner and to address their urgent economic and social needs, including unemployment, marginalization, insolvency and poverty\\".[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nThough politically associated with the United States, Puerto Rico is considered by many other nations to have its own distinct national identity.[6] Internationally, it has been reported that \\"the Fourteenth Ministerial Conference of the Movement of Non-aligned Nations...reaffirms that Puerto Rican people constitute a Latin American and Caribbean nation.\\"[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough Puerto Rico is an unincorporated territory of the United States classified as a commonwealth, many Puerto Ricans consider it to be a country in and of itself.[106][107][108][109] In their book on American expansionism titled The Louisiana Purchase and American Expansion, 1803ÿ1898, Sanford Levinson and Bartholomew H. Sparrow also determined that \\"Most Puerto Ricans consider themselves a distinct national group.\\"[110][111] They also observed that both Americans and Puerto Ricans see themselves as separate cultures\\"even separate nationalities\\".[112]\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the local level, it has been observed that Puerto Ricans \\"consider themselves a territorially distinct national unit, a nation defined by its cultural distinctiveness\\".[113] In recent plebiscites Puerto Ricans have not expressed themselves in favor of a political status with the intention of becoming a sovereign state, but the idea that Puerto Rico is a separate social, political and cultural entity from the United States has been repeatedly expressed.\\r\\n\\r\\nBoth major United States political parties (Democratic and Republican) have expressed their support for the U.S. citizens in Puerto Rico to exercise their right to self-determination, with the Republican Party platform explicitly mentioning support for statehood and the Democratic Party platform expressing explicitly broader support for right to self-determination.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe U.S.ÿPuerto Rico relationship is a matter of debate. Some contend that the current political status of Puerto Rico, perhaps with enhancements, remains a viable option. Others argue that commonwealth status is or should be only a temporary fix to be resolved in favor of other solutions considered permanent, non-colonial, and non-territorial. Some contend that if independence is achieved, the close relationship with the United States could be continued through compact negotiations with the federal government. One element apparently shared by all discussants is that the people of Puerto Rico seek to attain full, democratic representation, notably through voting rights on national legislation to which they are subject.[114]\\r\\n\\r\\nControversy exists surrounding the \\"real\\" political status of Puerto Rico, with some calling it a colony and others disagreeing.[115] Some (especially independentistas and statehooders) claim Puerto Rico is still a colony despite the UN's removing Puerto Rico from its list of non self-governing countries in 1953. Others (notably those who vote for the current commonwealth status option) argue that Puerto Rico is not a colony because the UN has not revoked its resolution after 55 years.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome authors have called Puerto Rico \\"the world's oldest colony\\" (2001)[116] and \\"one of the world's last colonies\\" (2004).[117] Former chief justice of the Puerto Rico Supreme Court Jos Tras Monge wrote a book that referred to it as the \\"oldest colony in the world\\".[118] Those who argue that Puerto Rico is still a colony insist that despite the UN resolution, Puerto Rico remains what some call a \\"post-colonial colony\\".[119] Defenders of this point of view argue that Puerto Rico has less self-determination than before the U.S. invasionit no longer has its own Puerto Rican citizenship,[120] free maritime control,[121] nor congressional representation as it did in the Spanish Cortes. Tras Monge argues that just prior to the U.S. invasion, Puerto Rico enjoyed greater freedom and rights in certain areas:\\r\\n\\r\\nYet those who claim Puerto Rico is not a colony will say that in its 8th session, the United Nations General Assembly recognized Puerto Rico's self-government on November 27, 1953, with Resolution 748.[87] This side points out that such recognition removed Puerto Rico's classification as a non-self-governing territory (under article 73(e) of the Charter of the United Nations). They add that the Resolution has not been revoked even though Puerto Rico's political status is still debated in many international forums.[122]\\r\\n\\r\\nThose who claim Puerto Rico is still a colony argue that Puerto Rico was vested with the commonwealth status by the U.S. Congress to give the appearance of self-government but that genuine decolonization never occurred.[123] These supporters claim that the Puerto Rico Federal Relations Act of 1947 allowed the U.S. to continue its colonial policy of Puerto Rico in a post-colonial world.[124] They see the Puerto Rico Federal Relations Act of 1950 (P.L. 600[125]) as a gimmick to maintain the colonial status of PR \\"The US Congress, however, carefully preserved its exclusive right to [unilaterally] alter the political status of Puerto Rico. Some saw the commonwealth as at best as temporary arrangement or at worst as a relic of the old colonial past.\\"[126] They also point to the fact that no change in the political status of Puerto Rico is possible unless authorized by the U.S. Congress as proof of the real current status.[126] Rivera Ramos argues that the \\"deepest question pertains to the source of rights and the source of authority to govern...In the case of [unincorporated] territories, the rights deemed to apply to their people, as well as those denied them, have their source in a constitution they have not approved nor have the power to amend\\".[127]\\r\\n\\r\\nThose who support the view that Puerto Rico is no longer a colony but has changed into a different status, the commonwealth, argue that since the 1952 Constitution Congress has indicated that they will respect the wishes of the people of Puerto Rico, indicating that this is evidence of the validity of the current status as a non-colony.\\r\\n\\r\\nThose claiming it is still a colony point to Congress legislating for Puerto Rico, and to bills where text such as those authorizing plebiscites in Puerto Rico (example \\"to conduct a second plebiscite between the options of (1) independence, (2) national sovereignty in association with the United States, and (3) U.S. statehood. The three options in the plebiscite also correspond to the options that the United Nations has identified as the options for decolonizing a territory.\\" (HR 2499, section 2(c) ) clearly include content to satisfy the United Nations demand for decolonizing a territory. In addition to judicial decisions like the 1993 U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit decision, which stated that Congress may unilaterally repeal the Puerto Rican Constitution or the Puerto Rican Federal Relations Act and replace them with any rules or regulations of its choice.[101]\\r\\n\\r\\nSome claim that granting of U.S. citizenship on Puerto Ricans on March 2, 1917 was devised by the United States in order to further reiterate its hold of Puerto Rico as a possession while others claim that it was a serious attempt to pave the way for statehood.\\r\\n\\r\\nFormer chief of the Puerto Rico Supreme Court Jos Tras Monge insists that statehood was never intended for the island and that, unlike Alaska and Hawaii, which Congress deemed incorporated territories and slated for annexation to the Union from the start, Puerto Rico was kept \\"unincorporated\\" specifically to avoid offering it statehood.[128] And Myriam Marquez has stated that Puerto Ricans \\"fear that statehood would strip the people of their national identity, of their distinct culture and language\\".[129] Ayala and Bernabe add that the \\"purpose of the inclusion of U.S. citizenship to Puerto Ricans in the Jones Act of 1917 was an attempt by Congress to block independence and perpetuate Puerto Rico in its colonial status\\".[130] Proponents of the citizenship clause in the Jones Act argue that \\"the extension of citizenship did not constitute a promise of statehood but rather an attempt to exclude any consideration of independence\\".[131]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe preamble of the Commonwealth constitution approved by the people of Puerto Rico in 1952 in part reads: \\"We consider as determining factors in our life our citizenship of the United States of America and our aspiration continually to enrich our democratic heritage in the individual and collective enjoyment of its rights and privileges;\\r\\n\\r\\nFor the island's pro-statehood movement, the concession of U.S. citizenship has been seen, ever since, as the key that would eventually guarantee statehood for the island, as soon as the people of Puerto Rico demanded equality in citizenship.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs former Puerto Rico House of Representatives Speaker Miguel A. Garca Mndez subsequently declared, \\"For an American citizen, there cannot be another political goal other than equality with his or her fellow American citizens. To seek other solutions ÿ to repudiate equality ÿ is to repudiate the natural destiny of American citizenship.\\"[132]\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, as early as 1912, President William Howard Taft had already said that there was no connection between the extension of citizenship to Puerto Ricans and the prospect of admission of Puerto Rico into the American Union. \\"I believe the demand for citizenship is just, and amply earned by the sustained loyalty on the part of the inhabitants of the island. But it should be remembered that the demand must be entirely dissociated from any thought of statehood\\".[133] President Taft's views in 1912 became a Supreme Court opinion when, in 1922, as Chief Justice, Taft wrote the opinion on Balzac, the last of the so-called Insular Cases.[134][135][136]\\r\\n\\r\\nThus, in the end, U.S. citizenship has had multiple meanings for Puerto Ricans. For some it is a welcome link to the United States, regardless of the political status of the territory. For others, it has been nothing more than an imposed identity by an imperial power. Still others regard it as a useful asset that provides access to certain rights and tangible benefits and opportunities. And there are those that cherish it as a constituent element of their self-image and identity.[137]\\r\\n\\r\\nSome contend that Puerto Rico cannot become a fully independent republic because there will be economic chaos and its citizens will die of hunger given that the land has no natural resources to sustain its population.[138][139] But others point to the example of countries that became independent, such as Ireland and Singapore and, though some containing less land and natural resources than Puerto Rico, today have economies far better than the Island.[140]\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to educational scientists Francesco Cordasco and Eugene Bucchioni, in their 1973 work The Puerto Rican Experience: a Sociological Sourcebook, the belief that Puerto Rico cannot survive on its own results from teachings since grade school. \\"Puerto Ricans here and in Puerto Rico are taught three things: Puerto Rico is small and the US is big, Puerto Rico is poor and the US is rich, Puerto Rico is weak and the US is strong.\\"[141] This theory of non-sustainability is not new; it has been held by various groups at least since the 1930s.[142]\\r\\n\\r\\nCommonwealth partisans argue that Puerto Rico cannot afford statehood, that post-war economic growth in Puerto Rico was the result of special treatment via exemption from Federal corporate taxes. Statehooders respond that such tax exemptions primarily benefit the large industrialists and not the population as a whole since low income Puerto Ricans would not pay taxes.[143]\\r\\n\\r\\nAn example given by those who claim the Island will be able to support itself is Singapore, an island nation 14 times smaller than Puerto Rico with a drastically higher level of population density and fewer natural resources, which has surpassed the per capita income of larger nations, including the United States.[144]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\"In Puerto Rico, ever since you are a child, you are told that you live on a tiny island that has no natural resources, nothing. This is what they teach you in school, on TV, the media, and it's always negative. This perception is a byproduct of the island's political dependence on the U.S. Politicians here will name it 20,000 different ways, but in any dictionary Puerto Rico is a colony. And there is this colonized mentality that everything from abroad is better.\\"[145]\\r\\n\\r\\nJuan Mari Brs stated, \\"Only through a great unified movement looking beyond political and ideological differences, can the prevalent fears of hunger and persecution be overcome for the eventual liberation of Puerto Rico, breaking through domination by the greatest imperialist power of our age.\\"[146]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the invasion by the United States in 1898, the Americans made English the official language.[147][148] In 1991 under the pro-Commonwealth PPD administration of Rafael Hernndez Col܇n Spanish was declared the only official language in the Island. Then, in 1993, under the pro-statehood PNP administration of Pedro Rossell܇, the law was reversed, and English was again reinstated as an official language alongside Spanish.[149] In a 1993 survey by the Ateneo Puertorrique?o, a leading cultural institution in Puerto Rico, 93 percent of respondents indicated that they would not relinquish Spanish as their language if Puerto Rico ever became a state of the American Union, even if the United States required English as the only official language of the Island.[150][151]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a First Circuit Court of Appeals case Igart~a v. United States, two of three members of the three-judge panel that dismissed the appeal on procedural grounds suggested in separate opinions that, in an en banc reconsideration, the United States could be required to extend full voting representation to the United States citizens in Puerto Rico if (1) the en banc Court determines that, contrary to current Circuit precedent, the Constitution does not prohibit extending such rights \\"under another source of law\\", (2) that the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which, at Article 25, states that \\"[e]very citizen shall have the right and the opportunity...[t]o vote and to be elected at genuine and periodic elections which shall be by universal and equal suffrage\\", is self-executing.[152][153]\\r\\n\\r\\nMore Puerto Ricans live stateside in the U.S. than in Puerto Rico. A 2009 report by the Pew Hispanic Center indicates that, as of 2007, 4.1 million Puerto Ricans lived in the mainland versus 3.9 million living in the Island.[154] Since the 1967 referendum, there have been demands that stateside Puerto Ricans be allowed to vote in these plebiscites on the political status of Puerto Rico. Since the 1990s, the role of stateside Puerto Ricans in advocating for Puerto Rico in Washington, D.C., on issues such as the Navy's removal from Vieques and others has increased, especially given that there have been three voting members of the U.S. Congress who are stateside Puerto Ricans (two from New York City and one from Chicago), in contrast to Puerto Rico's single Resident Commissioner in the U.S. Congress with no vote.\\r\\n\\r\\nBetween February 24-March 6, 2006, the National Institute for Latino Policy conducted an opinion survey over the Internet of a broad cross-section of stateside Puerto Rican community leaders and activists across the United States. The survey had a total of 574 respondents, including 88 non-Puerto Rican members of the Institute's national network of community leaders.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe views of the 484 Puerto Ricans in the survey found broad support among them for the holding of a plebiscite on the future political status of Puerto Rico. While 73% were in favor of such a vote, they were split on the options to be voted upon. Those supporting the 2005 proposal made by the White House Task Force on Puerto Rico's Status that the vote be ultimately limited to the options of statehood versus independence made up 31% of the total respondents. 43% supported including the commonwealth option in the proposed plebiscite.[155][not in citation given]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a 1991 Gallup Poll more than 60% of Americans said they would support independence or statehood if a majority of Puerto Ricans voted for either.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nA 1998 Gallup Poll[156] asked Americans: \\"Do you personally think Puerto Rico: Should become a completely independent nation; should remain a territory of the United States, or, should be admitted to the United States as the fifty-first state?\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe responses were:\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a 2007 Opinion Dynamics/Fox News poll, 46% of Americans preferred Puerto Rico continue to be a US territory, 30% believed it should be a state, 11% believed it should be an independent nation, and 13% didn't know.[157][158]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a 2016 Economist/YouGov poll, 29% supported statehood, 25% believed Puerto retain its present status, 20% believed it should be an independent nation, and 26% were not sure. However, only 43% knew that a person born in Puerto Rico is an American citizen, with 41% believing that person would be a Puerto Rican citizen, and 15% not sure.[159]","input":"What is the current status of puerto rico?"},{"output":"Phillip Charles \\"Phil\\" Harris","context":"Phillip Charles \\"Phil\\" Harris (December 19, 1956 ÿ February 9, 2010) was an American captain and part owner of the crab fishing vessel Cornelia Marie, which is featured on Discovery Channel's documentary reality TV series Deadliest Catch. He suffered a massive stroke while offloading C. opilio crab in port at Saint Paul Island, Alaska, on January 29, 2010. Despite extreme improvements in his condition, Harris died on February 9, 2010 at the age of 53, while suffering a pulmonary embolism in the hospital.[1][3][4]\\r\\nThe episode of Deadliest Catch featuring the Captain's death aired on July 20, 2010, followed by a special tribute episode.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHarris started fishing with his father at age eight and after high school began crab fishing. He initially worked on a crab boat as an unpaid deckhand until he proved his worth. By the time he was 21 he was one of the youngest crab fishing boat captains on the Bering Sea. He had been captain of the Cornelia Marie for more than 20 years at the time of his death.\\r\\nFrom 2004 and until his death, Harris and his boat were followed by an embedded film crew for the series Deadliest Catch. The Cornelia Marie was first shown during the opilio crab portion of Season 1, as partner ship of the F/V Maverick. The Cornelia Marie was heavily involved in search efforts for the Big Valley after it sank. It became a regular fixture of the show from the second season on.\\r\\nHarris was thrown from his bunk during a storm in the 2008 season, and thought he had broken his ribs. He spent several hours coughing up blood until his sons and crew finally convinced him to seek medical attention and enlisted the film crew to watch his condition. Doctors later determined that he had suffered a pulmonary embolism. Medical treatment for this condition prevented him from fishing for almost a year. He returned for the opilio crab fishing season in January 2009.\\r\\nSome of Harris's sea stories were included in the book Deadliest Catch: Desperate Hours. In 2008, Harris developed a line of coffees, \\"Captain's Reserve\\", with blends named after fishing themes such as \\"Harris Family Blend\\" and \\"Midnight Sunrise.\\"[5]\\r\\nHarris's chain-smoking, which was frequently seen on the show,[6] added to his health woes.\\r\\nCaptain Harris suffered a massive stroke during the sixth televised opilio crab season of Deadliest Catch. He was offloading crab on January 29, 2010 at St. Paul Island, Alaska. He was flown to Anchorage for surgery, and was placed in an induced coma to reduce intracranial pressure and swelling. He awoke from the coma after his condition improved. He was squeezing hands, talking, and showing other signs of improvement.[7] Harris' doctors were amazed by his extreme improvement, saying that he was making gains in a few days that usually take months for stroke victims. However, Harris died from an intracranial hemorrhage on February 9, 2010.\\r\\nCaptain Phil Harris was cremated, and half of the ashes were buried (in an ornately painted Harley Davidson motorcycle gas tank) with the remains of his mother.

This was the night before the Puget Sound's annual Opening Day for boating season. Phil's sons Jake and Josh Harris spoke at this service. A boat gave a final salute from the location where Phil's vessel is based in Elliott Bay.[10][11][12][13][14][15]\\r\\nHarris was single at the time of his death, but had been married and divorced twice. His first marriage, from 1982 to 1991 was to Mary Harris, mother of his two sons, Joshua and Jacob. Joshua and Jacob worked on board his fishing vessel, Cornelia Marie, as deckhands. His hometown was Bothell, Washington.

(Boston Tea Party)\\r\\nThirteen Colonies\\r\\nGreat Britain\\r\\nThe Boston Tea Party was a political protest by the Sons of Liberty in Boston, Massachusetts, on December 16, 1773. In defiance of the Tea Act of May 10, 1773, the demonstrators, some disguised as Native Americans, destroyed an entire shipment of tea sent by the East India Company. They boarded the ships and threw the chests of tea into Boston Harbor. The British government responded harshly and the episode escalated into the American Revolution. The Tea Party became an iconic event of American history, and since then other political protests such as the Tea Party movement have referred to themselves as historical successors to the Boston protest of 1773.\\r\\nThe Tea Party was the culmination of a resistance movement throughout British America against the Tea Act, which had been passed by the British Parliament in 1773. Colonists objected to the Tea Act because they believed that it violated their rights as Englishmen to \\"no taxation without representation\\", that is, to be taxed only by their own elected representatives and not by a British parliament in which they were not represented. In addition, the well-connected East India Company had been granted competitive advantages over colonial tea importers, who resented the move and feared additional infringement on their business. Protesters had successfully prevented the unloading of taxed tea in three other colonies, but in Boston, embattled Royal Governor Thomas Hutchinson refused to allow the tea to be returned to Britain.\\r\\nThe Boston Tea Party was a significant event in the growth of the American Revolution. Parliament responded in 1774 with the Coercive Acts, or Intolerable Acts, which, among other provisions, ended local self-government in Massachusetts and closed Boston's commerce. Colonists up and down the Thirteen Colonies in turn responded to the Coercive Acts with additional acts of protest, and by convening the First Continental Congress, which petitioned the British monarch for repeal of the acts and coordinated colonial resistance to them. The crisis escalated, and the American Revolutionary War began near Boston in 1775.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Boston Tea Party arose from two issues confronting the British Empire in 1765: the financial problems of the British East India Company; and an ongoing dispute about the extent of Parliament's authority, if any, over the British American colonies without seating any elected representation. The North Ministry's attempt to resolve these issues produced a showdown that would eventually result in revolution.[1]\\r\\nAs Europeans developed a taste for tea in the 17th century, rival companies were formed to import the product from China.[2] In England, Parliament gave the East India Company a monopoly on the importation of tea in 1698.[3] When tea became popular in the British colonies, Parliament sought to eliminate foreign competition by passing an act in 1721 that required colonists to import their tea only from Great Britain.[4] The East India Company did not export tea to the colonies; by law, the company was required to sell its tea wholesale at auctions in England. British firms bought this tea and exported it to the colonies, where they resold it to merchants in Boston, New York, Philadelphia, and Charleston.[5]\\r\\nUntil 1767, the East India Company paid an ad valorem tax of about 25% on tea that it imported into Great Britain.[6] Parliament laid additional taxes on tea sold for consumption in Britain. These high taxes, combined with the fact that tea imported into the Dutch Republic was not taxed by the Dutch government, meant that Britons and British Americans could buy smuggled Dutch tea at much cheaper prices.[7] The biggest market for illicit tea was Englandby the 1760s the East India Company was losing S400,000 per year to smugglers in Great Britain[8]but Dutch tea was also smuggled into British America in significant quantities.[9]\\r\\nIn 1767, to help the East India Company compete with smuggled Dutch tea, Parliament passed the Indemnity Act, which lowered the tax on tea consumed in Great Britain, and gave the East India Company a refund of the 25% duty on tea that was re-exported to the colonies.[10] To help offset this loss of government revenue, Parliament also passed the Townshend Revenue Act of 1767, which levied new taxes, including one on tea, in the colonies.[11] Instead of solving the smuggling problem, however, the Townshend duties renewed a controversy about Parliament's right to tax the colonies.\\r\\nControversy between Great Britain and the colonies arose in the 1760s when Parliament sought, for the first time, to impose a direct tax on the colonies for the purpose of raising revenue. Some colonists, known in the colonies as Whigs, objected to the new tax program, arguing that it was a violation of the British Constitution. Britons and British Americans agreed that, according to the constitution, British subjects could not be taxed without the consent of their elected representatives. In Great Britain, this meant that taxes could only be levied by Parliament. Colonists, however, did not elect members of Parliament, and so American Whigs argued that the colonies could not be taxed by that body. According to Whigs, colonists could only be taxed by their own colonial assemblies. Colonial protests resulted in the repeal of the Stamp Act in 1766, but in the 1766 Declaratory Act, Parliament continued to insist that it had the right to legislate for the colonies \\"in all cases whatsoever\\".\\r\\nWhen new taxes were levied in the Townshend Revenue Act of 1767, Whig colonists again responded with protests and boycotts. Merchants organized a non-importation agreement, and many colonists pledged to abstain from drinking British tea, with activists in New England promoting alternatives, such as domestic Labrador tea.[12] Smuggling continued apace, especially in New York and Philadelphia, where tea smuggling had always been more extensive than in Boston. Dutied British tea continued to be imported into Boston, however, especially by Richard Clarke and the sons of Massachusetts Governor Thomas Hutchinson, until pressure from Massachusetts Whigs compelled them to abide by the non-importation agreement.[13]\\r\\nParliament finally responded to the protests by repealing the Townshend taxes in 1770, except for the tea duty, which Prime Minister Lord North kept to assert \\"the right of taxing the Americans\\".[14] This partial repeal of the taxes was enough to bring an end to the non-importation movement by October 1770.[15] From 1771 to 1773, British tea was once again imported into the colonies in significant amounts, with merchants paying the Townshend duty of three pence per pound.[16] Boston was the largest colonial importer of legal tea; smugglers still dominated the market in New York and Philadelphia.[17]\\r\\nThe Indemnity Act of 1767, which gave the East India Company a refund of the duty on tea that was re-exported to the colonies, expired in 1772. Parliament passed a new act in 1772 that reduced this refund, effectively leaving a 10% duty on tea imported into Britain.[19] The act also restored the tea taxes within Britain that had been repealed in 1767, and left in place the three pence Townshend duty in the colonies. With this new tax burden driving up the price of British tea, sales plummeted. The company continued to import tea into Great Britain, however, amassing a huge surplus of product that no one would buy.[20] For these and other reasons, by late 1772 the East India Company, one of Britain's most important commercial institutions, was in a serious financial crisis.[21] The severe famine in Bengal from 1769 to 1773 had drastically reduced the revenue of the East India Company from India bringing the Company to the verge of bankruptcy and the Tea Act of 1773 was enacted to help the East India Company.\\r\\nEliminating some of the taxes was one obvious solution to the crisis. The East India Company initially sought to have the Townshend duty repealed, but the North ministry was unwilling because such an action might be interpreted as a retreat from Parliament's position that it had the right to tax the colonies.[22] More importantly, the tax collected from the Townshend duty was used to pay the salaries of some colonial governors and judges.[23] This was in fact the purpose of the Townshend tax: previously these officials had been paid by the colonial assemblies, but Parliament now paid their salaries to keep them dependent on the British government rather than allowing them to be accountable to the colonists.[24]\\r\\nAnother possible solution for reducing the growing mound of tea in the East India Company warehouses was to sell it cheaply in Europe. This possibility was investigated, but it was determined that the tea would simply be smuggled back into Great Britain, where it would undersell the taxed product.[25] The best market for the East India Company's surplus tea, so it seemed, was the American colonies, if a way could be found to make it cheaper than the smuggled Dutch tea.[26]\\r\\nThe North ministry's solution was the Tea Act, which received the assent of King George on May 10, 1773.[27] This act restored the East India Company's full refund on the duty for importing tea into Britain, and also permitted the company, for the first time, to export tea to the colonies on its own account. This would allow the company to reduce costs by eliminating the middlemen who bought the tea at wholesale auctions in London.[28] Instead of selling to middlemen, the company now appointed colonial merchants to receive the tea on consignment; the consignees would in turn sell the tea for a commission. In July 1773, tea consignees were selected in New York, Philadelphia, Boston, and Charleston.[29]\\r\\nThe Tea Act retained the three pence Townshend duty on tea imported to the colonies. Some members of Parliament wanted to eliminate this tax, arguing that there was no reason to provoke another colonial controversy. Former Chancellor of the Exchequer William Dowdeswell, for example, warned Lord North that the Americans would not accept the tea if the Townshend duty remained.[30] But North did not want to give up the revenue from the Townshend tax, primarily because it was used to pay the salaries of colonial officials; maintaining the right of taxing the Americans was a secondary concern.[31] According to historian Benjamin Labaree, \\"A stubborn Lord North had unwittingly hammered a nail in the coffin of the old British Empire.\\"[32]\\r\\nEven with the Townshend duty in effect, the Tea Act would allow the East India Company to sell tea more cheaply than before, undercutting the prices offered by smugglers, but also undercutting colonial tea importers, who paid the tax and received no refund. In 1772, legally imported Bohea, the most common variety of tea, sold for about 3 shillings (3s) per pound.[33] After the Tea Act, colonial consignees would be able to sell it for 2 shillings per pound (2s), just under the smugglers' price of 2 shillings and 1 penny (2s 1d).[34] Realizing that the payment of the Townshend duty was politically sensitive, the company hoped to conceal the tax by making arrangements to have it paid either in London once the tea was landed in the colonies, or have the consignees quietly pay the duties after the tea was sold. This effort to hide the tax from the colonists was unsuccessful.[35]\\r\\nIn September and October 1773, seven ships carrying East India Company tea were sent to the colonies: four were bound for Boston, and one each for New York, Philadelphia, and Charleston.[36] In the ships were more than 2,000 chests containing nearly 600,000 pounds of tea.[37] Americans learned the details of the Tea Act while the ships were en route, and opposition began to mount.[38] Whigs, sometimes calling themselves Sons of Liberty, began a campaign to raise awareness and to convince or compel the consignees to resign, in the same way that stamp distributors had been forced to resign in the 1765 Stamp Act crisis.[39]\\r\\nThe protest movement that culminated with the Boston Tea Party was not a dispute about high taxes. The price of legally imported tea was actually reduced by the Tea Act of 1773. Protesters were instead concerned with a variety of other issues. The familiar \\"no taxation without representation\\" argument, along with the question of the extent of Parliament's authority in the colonies, remained prominent.[40] Samuel Adams considered the British tea monopoly to be \\"equal to a tax\\" and to raise the same representation issue whether or not a tax was applied to it.[41] Some regarded the purpose of the tax programto make leading officials independent of colonial influenceas a dangerous infringement of colonial rights.[42] This was especially true in Massachusetts, the only colony where the Townshend program had been fully implemented.[43]\\r\\nColonial merchants, some of them smugglers, played a significant role in the protests. Because the Tea Act made legally imported tea cheaper, it threatened to put smugglers of Dutch tea out of business.[44] Legitimate tea importers who had not been named as consignees by the East India Company were also threatened with financial ruin by the Tea Act.[45] Another major concern for merchants was that the Tea Act gave the East India Company a monopoly on the tea trade, and it was feared that this government-created monopoly might be extended in the future to include other goods.[46]\\r\\nSouth of Boston, protesters successfully compelled the tea consignees to resign. In Charleston, the consignees had been forced to resign by early December, and the unclaimed tea was seized by customs officials.[47] There were mass protest meetings in Philadelphia. Benjamin Rush urged his fellow countrymen to oppose the landing of the tea, because the cargo contained \\"the seeds of slavery\\".[48] By early December, the Philadelphia consignees had resigned and the tea ship returned to England with its cargo following a confrontation with the ship's captain.[49] The tea ship bound for New York City was delayed by bad weather; by the time it arrived, the consignees had resigned, and the ship returned to England with the tea.[50]\\r\\nIn every colony except Massachusetts, protesters were able to force the tea consignees to resign or to return the tea to England.[51] In Boston, however, Governor Hutchinson was determined to hold his ground. He convinced the tea consignees, two of whom were his sons, not to back down.[52]\\r\\nWhen the tea ship Dartmouth[a], arrived in the Boston Harbor in late November, Whig leader Samuel Adams called for a mass meeting to be held at Faneuil Hall on November 29, 1773. Thousands of people arrived, so many that the meeting was moved to the larger Old South Meeting House.[53] British law required Dartmouth to unload and pay the duties within twenty days or customs officials could confiscate the cargo (ie unload it onto American soil).[54] The mass meeting passed a resolution, introduced by Adams and based on a similar set of resolutions promulgated earlier in Philadelphia, urging the captain of Dartmouth to send the ship back without paying the import duty. Meanwhile, the meeting assigned twenty-five men to watch the ship and prevent the tea ÿ including a number of chests from Davison, Newman and Co. of London ÿ from being unloaded.[55]\\r\\nGovernor Hutchinson refused to grant permission for Dartmouth to leave without paying the duty. Two more tea ships, Eleanor and Beaver, arrived in Boston Harbor (there was another tea ship headed for Boston, William, but it encountered a storm and put aground at Cape Cod ÿ where the tea cargo was successfully landed ÿ before it could reach its destination[56][57]). On December 16 ÿ the last day of Dartmouth's deadline ÿ about 7,000 people had gathered around the Old South Meeting House.[58] After receiving a report that Governor Hutchinson had again refused to let the ships leave, Adams announced that \\"This meeting can do nothing further to save the country.\\" According to a popular story, Adams's statement was a prearranged signal for the \\"tea party\\" to begin. However, this claim did not appear in print until nearly a century after the event, in a biography of Adams written by his great-grandson, who apparently misinterpreted the evidence.[59] According to eyewitness accounts, people did not leave the meeting until ten or fifteen minutes after Adams's alleged \\"signal\\", and Adams in fact tried to stop people from leaving because the meeting was not yet over.[60]\\r\\nWhile Samuel Adams tried to reassert control of the meeting, people poured out of the Old South Meeting House to prepare to take action. In some cases, this involved donning what may have been elaborately prepared Mohawk costumes.[61] While disguising their individual faces was imperative, because of the illegality of their protest, dressing as Mohawk warriors was a specific and symbolic choice. It showed that the Sons of Liberty identified with America, over their official status as subjects of Great Britain.[62]\\r\\nThat evening, a group of 30 to 130 men, some dressed in the Mohawk warrior disguises, boarded the three vessels and, over the course of three hours, dumped all 342 chests of tea into the water.[63] The precise location of the Griffin's Wharf site of the Tea Party has been subject to prolonged uncertainty; a comprehensive study[64] places it near the foot of Hutchinson Street (today's Pearl Street).\\r\\nWhether or not Samuel Adams helped plan the Boston Tea Party is disputed, but he immediately worked to publicize and defend it.[65] He argued that the Tea Party was not the act of a lawless mob, but was instead a principled protest and the only remaining option the people had to defend their constitutional rights.[66]\\r\\nBy \\"constitution\\" he referred to the idea that all governments have a constitution, written or not, and that the constitution of Great Britain could be interpreted as banning the levying of taxes without representation. For example, the Bill of Rights of 1689 established that long-term taxes could not be levied without Parliament, and other precedents said that Parliament must actually represent the people it ruled over, in order to \\"count\\".\\r\\nGovernor Thomas Hutchinson had been urging London to take a hard line with the Sons of Liberty. If he had done what the other royal governors had done and let the ship owners and captains resolve the issue with the colonists, Dartmouth, Eleanor and Beaver would have left without unloading any tea.\\r\\nIn Britain, even those politicians considered friends of the colonies were appalled and this act united all parties there against the colonies. The Prime Minister Lord North said, \\"Whatever may be the consequence, we must risk something; if we do not, all is over\\".[67] The British government felt this action could not remain unpunished, and responded by closing the port of Boston and putting in place other laws known as the \\"Coercive Acts.\\" Benjamin Franklin stated that the destroyed tea must be paid for, all ninety thousand pounds (which, at two shillings per pound, came to S9,000, or S1.05?million [2014, approx. $1.7 million US]).[68] Robert Murray, a New York merchant, went to Lord North with three other merchants and offered to pay for the losses, but the offer was turned down.[69]\\r\\nThe incident resulted in a similar effect in America when news of the Boston Tea Party reached London in January and Parliament responded with a series of acts known collectively in the colonies as the Intolerable Acts. These were intended to punish Boston for the destruction of private property, restore British authority in Massachusetts, and otherwise reform colonial government in America. Although the first two, the Boston Port Act and the Massachusetts Government Act, applied only to Massachusetts, colonists outside that colony feared that their governments could now also be changed by legislative fiat in England. The Intolerable Acts were viewed as a violation of constitutional rights, natural rights, and colonial charters, and united many colonists throughout America,[70] exemplified by the calling of the First Continental Congress in September 1774.\\r\\nA number of colonists were inspired by the Boston Tea Party to carry out similar acts, such as the burning of Peggy Stewart. The Boston Tea Party eventually proved to be one of the many reactions that led to the American Revolutionary War.[citation needed] In his December 17, 1773 entry in his diary, John Adams wrote:\\r\\nLast Night 3 Cargoes of Bohea Tea were emptied into the Sea. This Morning a Man of War sails.\\r\\nThis is the most magnificent Movement of all. There is a Dignity, a Majesty, a Sublimity, in this last Effort of the Patriots, that I greatly admire. The People should never rise, without doing something to be rememberedsomething notable And striking. This Destruction of the Tea is so bold, so daring, so firm, intrepid and inflexible, and it must have so important Consequences, and so lasting, that I cant but consider it as an Epocha in History.[71]\\r\\nThere was a repeat performance on March 7, 1774, but it was much less destructive.[72]\\r\\nIn February 1775, Britain passed the Conciliatory Resolution, which ended taxation for any colony that satisfactorily provided for the imperial defense and the upkeep of imperial officers. The tax on tea was repealed with the Taxation of Colonies Act 1778, part of another Parliamentary attempt at conciliation that failed.\\r\\nJohn Adams and many other Americans considered tea drinking to be unpatriotic following the Boston Tea Party. Tea drinking declined during and after the Revolution, resulting in a shift to coffee as the preferred hot drink.[74]\\r\\nAccording to historian Alfred Young, the term \\"Boston Tea Party\\" did not appear in print until 1834.[75] Before that time, the event was usually referred to as the \\"destruction of the tea\\". According to Young, American writers were for many years apparently reluctant to celebrate the destruction of property, and so the event was usually ignored in histories of the American Revolution. This began to change in the 1830s, however, especially with the publication of biographies of George Robert Twelves Hewes, one of the few still-living participants of the \\"tea party\\", as it then became known.[76]\\r\\nThe issue was never the tax but how the tax was passed without American input; United States Congress taxed tea from 1789 to 1872.[77]\\r\\nThe Boston Tea Party has often been referenced in other political protests. When Mohandas K. Gandhi led a mass burning of Indian registration cards in South Africa in 1908, a British newspaper compared the event to the Boston Tea Party.[78] When Gandhi met with the British viceroy in 1930 after the Indian salt protest campaign, Gandhi took some duty-free salt from his shawl and said, with a smile, that the salt was \\"to remind us of the famous Boston Tea Party.\\"[79]\\r\\nAmerican activists from a variety of political viewpoints have invoked the Tea Party as a symbol of protest. In 1973, on the 200th anniversary of the Tea Party, a mass meeting at Faneuil Hall called for the impeachment of President Richard Nixon and protested oil companies in the ongoing oil crisis. Afterwards, protesters boarded a replica ship in Boston Harbor, hanged Nixon in effigy, and dumped several empty oil drums into the harbor.[80] In 1998, two conservative US Congressmen put the federal tax code into a chest marked \\"tea\\" and dumped it into the harbor.[81]\\r\\nIn 2006, a libertarian political party called the \\"Boston Tea Party\\" was founded. In 2007, the Ron Paul \\"Tea Party\\" money bomb, held on the 234th anniversary of the Boston Tea Party, broke the one-day fund-raising record by raising $6.04 million in 24 hours.[82] Subsequently, these fund-raising \\"Tea parties\\" grew into the Tea Party movement, which dominated politics for the next two years, culminating in a voter victory for the Republicans in 2010 who were widely elected to seats in the United States House of Representatives.\\r\\nThe Boston Tea Party Museum is located on the Congress Street Bridge in Boston. It features reenactments, a documentary, and a number of interactive exhibits. The museum features two replica ships of the period, Eleanor and Beaver. Additionally, the museum possesses one of two known tea chests from the original event, part of its permanent collection.[83]","input":"What state did the boston tea party take place?"},{"output":"hypoxia","context":"Hypoventilation (also known as respiratory depression) occurs when ventilation is inadequate (hypo meaning \\"below\\") to perform needed gas exchange.[1] By definition it causes an increased concentration of carbon dioxide (hypercapnia) and respiratory acidosis. Hypoventilation is not synonymous with respiratory arrest, in which breathing ceases entirely and death occurs within minutes due to hypoxia and leads rapidly into complete anoxia, although both are medical emergencies.

Strong opiates (such as fentanyl, heroin, or morphine), barbiturates, and certain benzodiazepines (short acting ones and alprazolam) are known for depressing respiration. In an overdose, an individual may cease breathing entirely (go into respiratory arrest) which is rapidly fatal without treatment. Opioids, in overdose or combined with other depressants, are notorious for such fatalities.\\r\\n\\r\\nRespiratory stimulants such as nikethamide were traditionally used to counteract respiratory depression from CNS depressant overdose, but offered limited effectiveness.

He surprises her with a last-minute proposal, which she declines as it is much too soon for either of them. However, he wins her over by performing a cheesy love song, which she finds as romantic. A prank fight between Sheldon and Kripke begins when the latter severely embarrasses the former on National Public Radio's talk show Science Friday by filling Sheldon's office with helium, giving him a high-pitched voice.\\r\\n\\r\\nHoward becomes jealous of Leonard after Bernadette shows an interest in his work, causing friction in the relationship of all three. Penny becomes jealous over not being able to talk to Leonard about his job, and asks Sheldon to teach her about physics.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt Christmas, Leonard's mother visits, much to Leonard's horror and Sheldon's delight.

It operates as a nonprofit 501(c)(3) organization.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs of June 1, 2015, WWP served 71,866 registered alumni and 11,494 registered members.[3] The organization has partnered with several other charities, including the American Red Cross, Resounding Joy, a music therapy group in California, and Operation Homefront.[4][5] WWP has also provided a year-long Track program, which helps veterans transition to college and the workplace.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nWounded Warrior Project was founded in 2003[1] in Roanoke, Virginia,[6] by John Melia.[7][8] Melia had been severely wounded in a helicopter crash while serving in Somalia in 1992.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nMelia assembled backpacks distributed to injured veterans at the former Bethesda Naval Hospital (Walter Reed National Military Medical Center) and Walter Reed Army Medical Center. The WWP Backpacks program continues to remain a central activity of WWP, evidenced by the 16,992 backpacks they had distributed as of August 1, 2013.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nWounded Warrior Project initially operated as a division of the United Spinal Association of New York,[7][10] which adopted WWP as a program in November 2003. The WWP continued to support injured service members by providing them with free WWP Backpacks filled with comfort items\\r\\n\\r\\nIn September 2005, The United Spinal Association granted $2.7 million to WWP to \\"develop into a stand-alone charity with its own identity and programs,\\" with the intent to expand its services from providing immediate comfort items to providing longer-term support for returning wounded veterans via compensation, education, health care, insurance, housing, employment, etc.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2016 WWP's CEO, Steven Nardizzi, and its COO, Al Giordano, were fired after they had been revealed as spending massive amounts of the company's money on lavish things for themselves and company retreats.[12][13][14] Several former employees alleged that they were fired because they raised concerns over the mismanagement.[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nWounded Warrior Project registered for incorporation on February 23, 2005. WWP was granted accreditation as of September 10, 2008 by the Veterans Affairs Secretary as a Veterans Service Organization (VSO) \\"recognized by the Secretary for the purpose of preparation, presentation, and prosecution of claims under laws administered by the Department of Veterans Affairs.\\" [16] The Veterans Administration's online List of Representatives for Accredited Organizations includes contact information for WWP's accredited service officers.[17] as well as a search tool to access information about other VSOs.[18]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn July 2006, WWP's headquarters were moved to Jacksonville, Florida. WWP Founder John Melia cited a strong local veteran community, access to Jacksonville International Airport, and support from the local business community, specifically the PGA Tour, as the reason for the move. The WWP headquarters will be undergoing a major $1.3 million renovation according to the Jacksonville Business Journal.[19]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn May 27, 2014, WWP filed a lawsuit against Dean Graham, a disabled veteran with PTSD, and his Help Indiana Vets, Inc. organization.[20] After a court ruling, Graham retracted the allegations he leveled against Wounded Warrior Project and folded his direct-aid non-profit.[20][verification needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nWWP filed a lawsuit in October 2014 seeking damages and court costs against a Blandon, Pennsylvania non-profit Keystone Wounded Warriors claiming confusing similarities between Keystone's and WWP's logos; Hampton Roads, VA Channel 3 TV covered the Keystone story on April 30, 2015,[21] and Nonprofit Quarterly covered the story with a title asking, is WWP \\"a 'Neighborhood Bully' among Veterans Groups?\\".[21] Tim Mak also covered the suit for the Daily Beast.[22][23]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter a reporter for the Tacoma, Washington News Tribune informed disabled veteran Airman Alex Graham, a blogger at the conspiracy website Veterans Today, of a pending lawsuit against him by the WWP, he removed his articles critical of their policies, later retracting his criticisms and issuing a public apology.[24]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn March 2014, WWP testified before Congress that they strongly supported the bill \\"To amend title 38, United States Code, to provide veterans with counseling and treatment for sexual trauma that occurred during inactive duty training (H.R. 2527; 113th Congress)\\". The bill would extend a VA program of counseling and care and services for veterans for military sexual trauma that occurred during active duty or active duty for training to veterans who experienced such trauma during inactive duty training.[25] The bill would alter current law, which allows access to such counseling only to active duty members of the military, so that members of the Reserves and National Guard would be eligible.[26]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe WWP did a study of its alumni and found that, \\"almost half of the respondents indicated accessing care through VA for MST-related conditions was 'very difficult'. And of those who did not seek VA care, 41% did not know they were eligible for such care.\\"[27] The WWP also testified that in addition to expanding access to MST care, the VA needed to improve care itself, because veterans report \\"inadequate screening, providers who were either insensitive or lacked needed expertise and facilities ill-equipped to appropriately care for MST survivors.\\"[27]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2012, WWP spent US $114,817,090 on programs in support of wounded veterans, the families, and caregivers.[28]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2013, a new employee mistakenly declined to accept a donation from Liberty Baptist Church in Fort Pierce, Florida, and issued this inadvertent statement to the church leaders in an email, \\"We must decline the opportunity to be the beneficiary of your event due to our fundraising event criteria, which doesn't allow community events to be religious in nature.\\" [29] Shortly after the church received this letter, a WWP spokesperson apologized and said that it was a miscommunication.[30]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn June 2015, the Daily Beast reported that the WWP sells its donor information to third parties.

During the Cold War, North Korea was backed by the Soviet Union, China, and other communist states, and South Korea was backed by the United States and its allies. The division of Korea occurred at the end of World War II in 1945. Tensions erupted into the Korean War in 1950.\\r\\nWhen the war ended, the country was devastated, but the division remained. North and South Korea continued a military standoff with periodic clashes. The conflict survived the collapse of the Eastern Bloc of 1989 to 1991. The US maintains a military presence in the South to help deter any potential attack from the North. In 1997, U.S. President Bill Clinton described the division of Korea as the \\"Cold War's last divide\\".[1] In 2002, U.S. President George W Bush described North Korea as a member of an \\"Axis of Evil\\".[2][3] Facing increasing isolation, North Korea has developed missile and nuclear capabilities, and is believed to be aiding and selling weapons and drugs to Islamic terrorists[4] and Latin American drug cartels[5], with Los Zetas being one of their largest clients, which has resulted in it listed as a state sponsor of terrorism.\\r\\nA comparable situation to that with North and South Korea also existed with West and East Germany in 1949-90, North and South Vietnam in 1955-75, and with North and South Yemen in 1967-90, and also still exists today with Taiwan and Mainland China, and has more recently started existing with the Syrian government and Syrian opposition.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nKorea was annexed by the Empire of Japan in 1910. In the following decades during the Japanese occupation of Korea, nationalist and radical groups emerged, mostly in exile, to struggle for independence. Divergent in their outlooks and approaches, these groups failed to unite in one national movement.[6][7] Based in China, the Korean Provisional Government failed to obtain widespread recognition.[8] The many leaders agitating for Korean independence included the conservative and U.S.-educated Syngman Rhee, who lobbied the U.S. government, and the Communist Kim Il-sung, who fought a guerrilla war against the Japanese from neighboring Manchuria to the north of Korea.[9]\\r\\nFollowing the end of the occupation, many high-ranking Koreans were accused of collaborating with Japanese imperialism.[10] An intense struggle between various figures and political groups aspiring to lead Korea ensued.[11]\\r\\nOn August 9, 1945, in the closing days of World War II, the Soviet Union declared war on Japan and advanced into Korea. Though the Soviet declaration of war had been agreed by the Allies at the Yalta Conference, the US government became concerned at the prospect of all of Korea falling under Soviet control. The US government therefore requested Soviet forces halt their advance at the 38th parallel north, leaving the south of the peninsula, including the capital, Seoul, to be occupied by the US. This was incorporated into General Order No. 1 to Japanese forces after the surrender of Japan on August 15. On August 24, the Red Army entered Pyongyang and established a military government over Korea north of the parallel. American forces landed in the south on September 8 and established the United States Army Military Government in Korea.[12]\\r\\nThe Allies had originally envisaged a joint trusteeship which would usher Korea towards independence, but most Korean nationalists wanted independence immediately.[13] Meanwhile, the wartime co-operation between the Soviet Union and the US deteriorated as the Cold War took hold. Both occupying powers began promoting into positions of authority Koreans aligned with their side of politics and marginalizing their opponents. Many of these emerging political leaders were returning exiles with little popular support.[14][15] In North Korea, the Soviet Union supported Korean Communists. Kim Il-sung, who from 1941 had served in the Soviet Army, became the major political figure.[16] Society was centralized and collectivized, following the Soviet model.[17] Politics in the South were more tumultuous, but the strongly anti-Communist Syngman Rhee, who had been educated in the United States, was positioned as the most prominent politician.[18] The rival leaders, Kim Koo and Lyuh Woon-hyung, were assassinated.[11]\\r\\nAs a result, two antagonistic states emerged, with diametrically opposed political, economic, and social systems. In South Korea, a general election was held on May 10, 1948. The Republic of Korea (or ROK) was established with Syngman Rhee as President, and formally replaced the US military occupation on August 15. In North Korea, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (or DPRK) was declared on September 9, with Kim Il-sung, as prime minister. Soviet occupation forces left the DPRK on December 10, 1948. US forces left the ROK the following year, though the US Korean Military Advisory Group remained to train the Republic of Korea Army.[19] The new regimes even adopted different names for Korea: the North choosing Choson, and the South Hanguk.[20]\\r\\nBoth opposing governments considered themselves to be the government of the whole of Korea (as they do to this day), and both saw the division as temporary.[21][22] Kim Il-sung lobbied Stalin and Mao for support in a war of reunification. Syngman Rhee repeatedly expressed his desire to conquer the North.[23][24] In 1948 North Korea, which had almost all of the generators, turned off the electricity supply to the South.[25] In the lead-up to the outbreak of war, there were frequent clashes along the 38th parallel, especially at Kaesong and Ongjin, initiated by both sides.[26][27]\\r\\nThroughout this period there were uprisings in the South, such as the Jeju Uprising and the YeosuÿSuncheon Rebellion, that were brutally suppressed. In all, over one hundred thousand lives were lost in fighting across Korea before the Korean War began.[28]\\r\\nBy 1950, North Korea had clear military superiority over the South. The Soviet occupiers had armed it with surplus weaponry and provided training. Many troops returning to North Korea were battle-hardened from their participation in the Chinese Civil War, which had just ended.[29][30] Kim Il-sung expected a quick victory, predicting that there would be pro-Communist uprisings in the South and that the US would not intervene.[31] Rather than perceiving the conflict as a civil war, however, the West saw it in Cold War terms as Communist aggression, related to recent events in China and Eastern Europe.[32]\\r\\nNorth Korea invaded the South on June 25, 1950, and swiftly overran most of the country. In September 1950 United Nations force, led by the United States, intervened to defend the South, and following the Incheon Landing and breakout from the Busan Perimeter, rapidly advanced into North Korea. As they neared the border with China, Chinese forces intervened on behalf of North Korea, shifting the balance of the war again. Fighting ended on July 27, 1953, with an armistice that approximately restored the original boundaries between North and South Korea.[24]\\r\\nKorea was devastated. More than one million civilians and soldiers had been killed. Seoul was in ruins, having changed hands four times.[33] Almost every substantial building in North Korea had been destroyed.[34][35] As a result, North Koreans developed a deep-seated enmity towards the US.[33]\\r\\nNegotiations for an armistice began on July 10, 1951, as the war continued. The main issues were the establishment of a new demarcation line and the exchange of prisoners. After Stalin died, the Soviet Union brokered concessions which led to an agreement on July 27, 1953.[36]\\r\\nSyngman Rhee opposed the armistice because it left Korea divided. As negotiations drew to a close, he attempted to sabotage the arrangements for the release of prisoners, and led mass rallies against the armistice.[37] He refused to sign the agreement, but reluctantly agreed to abide by it.[38]\\r\\nThe armistice inaugurated an official ceasefire but did not lead to a peace treaty.[39] It established the Korean Demilitarized Zone (DMZ), a buffer zone between the two sides, that intersected the 38th parallel but did not follow it.[38] Despite its name, the border was, and continues to be, one of the most militarized in the world.[33]\\r\\nNorth Korea has announced that it will no longer abide by the armistice at least six times, in the years 1994, 1996, 2003, 2006, 2009, and 2013.[40][41]\\r\\nAfter the war, the Chinese forces left, but US forces remained in the South. Sporadic conflict continued between North and South Korea. On October 1, 1953, the United States and South Korea signed a defense treaty.[42] In 1958, the United States stationed nuclear weapons in South Korea.[43] In 1961, North Korea signed mutual defense treaties with the USSR and China.[44] During this period, North Korea was described by former CIA director Robert Gates to be the \\"toughest intelligence target in the world\\".[45] Alongside the military confrontation, there has been a propaganda war, including balloon propaganda campaigns.\\r\\nThe opposing regimes aligned themselves with opposing sides in the Cold War. Both sides received recognition as the legitimate government of Korea from the opposing blocs.[46][47]\\r\\nNorth Korea presented itself as a champion of orthodox Communism, distinct from the Soviet Union and China. The regime developed the doctrine of Juche or self-reliance, which included extreme military mobilization.[48] In response to the threat of nuclear war, it constructed extensive facilities underground and in the mountains.[49][25] The Pyongyang Metro opened in the 1970s, with capacity to double as bomb shelter.[50] Until the early 1970s, North Korea was economically the equal of the South.[51]\\r\\nSouth Korea became a strongly anti-Communist military dictatorship and was heavily involved in the Vietnam War.[52] North Korea's occupation left behind a guerrilla movement that persisted in Cholla provinces.[33]\\r\\nTensions between North and South escalated in the late 1960s with a series of low-level armed clashes known as the Korean DMZ Conflict. In 1966, Kim declared \\"liberation of the south\\" to be a \\"national duty\\".[53] In 1968, North Korean commandos launched the Blue House Raid, an unsuccessful attempt to assassinate the South Korean President Park Chung-hee. Shortly after, the US spy ship Pueblo was captured by the North Korean navy.[54] The Americans saw the crisis in terms of the global confrontation with Communism, but rather than orchestrating the incident the Soviet government was concerned by it.[55] Kim was, however, inspired by Communist successes in the Vietnam War.[56]\\r\\nIn 1969, North Korea shot down a US EC-121 spy plane over the Sea of Japan, killing all 31 crew on board, which constitutes the largest single loss of US aircrew during the Cold War.[57] In 1969, Korean Air Lines YS-11 was hijacked and flown to North Korea. Similarly, in 1970, the hijackers of Japan Airlines Flight 351 were given asylum in North Korea.[58] In response to the Blue House Raid, the South Korean government set up a special unit to assassinate Kim Il-sung, but the mission was aborted in 1972.[59]\\r\\nIn 1974 a North Korean sympathizer attempted to assassinate President Park and killed his wife, Yuk Young-soo.[60] In 1976, the axe murder incident led to the death of two US Army officers in the DMZ and threatened to trigger a wider war.[61][62] In the 1970s, North Korea kidnapped a number of Japanese citizens.[58]\\r\\nIn 1976, in now-declassified minutes, US Deputy Secretary of Defense William Clements told Henry Kissinger that there had been 200 raids or incursions into North Korea from the South, though not by the U.S. military.[63] Details of only a few of these incursions have become public, including raids by South Korean forces in 1967 that had sabotaged about 50 North Korean facilities.[64]\\r\\nIn the 1970s, both North and South began building up their military capacity.[65] It was discovered that North Korea had dug tunnels under the DMZ which could accommodate thousands of troops.[66] Alarmed at the prospect of US disengagement, South Korea began a secret nuclear weapons program which was strongly opposed by Washington.[67]\\r\\nIn 1977, US President Jimmy Carter proposed the withdrawal of troops from South Korea. There was a widespread backlash in America and in South Korea, and critics argued that this would allow the North to capture Seoul. Carter postponed the move, and his successor Ronald Reagan reversed the policy, increasing troop numbers to forty-three thousand.[68] After Reagan supplied the South with F-16 fighters, and after Kim Il-sung visited Moscow in 1984, the USSR recommenced military aid and co-operation with the North.[69]\\r\\nUnrest in the South came to a head with the Gwangju Uprising in 1980. The dictatorship equated dissent with North Korean subversion. On the other hand, some young protesters viewed the US as complicit in political repression and identified with the North's nationalist propaganda.[70][71]\\r\\nIn 1983 North Korea carried out the Rangoon bombing, a failed assassination attempt against South Korean President Chun Doo-hwan during a visit to Burma.[72] The bombing of Korean Air Flight 858 in 1987, in the lead up to the Seoul Olympics, led to the US government placing North Korea on its list of terrorist countries.[73][74]\\r\\nAs the Cold War ended, North Korea lost the support of the Soviet Union and plunged into an economic crisis. At the same time Kim Il-sung died.[75] There were expectations that the North Korean government would collapse and the peninsula would be reunified.[76][77]\\r\\nIn 1998, South Korean President Kim Dae-jung initiated the Sunshine Policy which aimed to foster better relations with the North.[78] However, in the aftermath the September 11 attacks, U.S. President George W Bush did not support the policy and in 2002 branded North Korea as a member of an \\"Axis of Evil\\".[2][3] The Sunshine Policy was formally abandoned by South Korean President Lee Myung-bak after his election in 2007.[79]\\r\\nMeanwhile, in response to its increased isolation, North Korea redoubled its efforts to develop nuclear weapons and intercontinental ballistic missiles. In 1994, US President Bill Clinton considered bombing the Yongbyon nuclear reactor. He was advised that if war broke out, it could cost 52,000 US and 490,000 South Korean military casualties in the first three months, as well as a large number of civilian casualties.[80][81] Six-party talks involving North and South Korea, the United States, Russia, Japan, and China commenced in 2003 but failed to resolve the issue. In 2006, North Korea announced it had successfully conducted its first nuclear test.[82]\\r\\nAt the start of the twenty first century, it was estimated that the concentration of firepower in the area between Pyongyang and Seoul was greater than that in central Europe during the Cold War.[83] The North's Korean People's Army was numerically twice the size of South Korea's military and had the capacity to devastate Seoul with artillery and missile bombardment. South Korea's military, however, was assessed as being technically superior in many ways.[84][85] US forces remained in South Korea and carried out annual military exercises with South Korean forces, including Key Resolve, Foal Eagle, and Ulchi-Freedom Guardian. These have been routinely denounced by North Korea as acts of aggression.[86][87][88] Between 1997 and 2016, the North Korea government accused other governments of declaring war against it 200 times.[89] Analysts have described the US garrison as a tripwire ensuring American military involvement, but some have queried whether sufficient reinforcements would be forthcoming.[90]\\r\\nDuring this period, two North Korean submarines were captured after being stranded on the South Korean coast, one near Gangneung in 1996 and one near Sokcho in 1998. In December 1998, the South Korean navy sank a North Korean semi-submersible in the Battle of Yeosu. In 2001, the Japanese Coast Guard sank a North Korean spy ship in the Battle of Amami-shima.\\r\\nConflict intensified near the disputed maritime boundary known as the Northern Limit Line in the Yellow Sea. In 1999 and 2002, there were clashes between the navies of North and South Korea, known as the First and Second battle of Yeonpyeong. On March 26, 2010, a South Korean naval vessel, the ROKS Cheonan, sank, near Baengnyeong Island in the Yellow Sea and a North Korean torpedo was blamed. On November 23, 2010, in response to a joint military exercise, North Korea fired artillery at South Korea's Greater Yeonpyeong island in the Yellow Sea, and South Korea returned fire.\\r\\nIn April 2009 North Korea launched satellites into space using rockets that flew over the Japanese archipelago.[91][92] This was the second rocket launch over Japan since September 1998. The 2009 launch was condemned by the United Nations Security Council.[93]\\r\\nIn 2013, amidst tensions about its missile program, North Korea forced the temporary shutdown of the jointly operated Kaesong Industrial Region.[94] The zone was shut again in 2016.[95] A South Korean parliamentarian was convicted of plotting a campaign of sabotage to support the North in 2013 and jailed for 12 years.[96] According to the New York Times, in 2014, US President Barack Obama ordered the intensification of cyber and electronic warfare to disrupt North Korea's missile testing.[97] However, this account has been disputed by analysts from the Nautilus Institute.[98]\\r\\nIn 2016, in the face of protests, South Korea decided to deploy the US THAAD anti-missile system.[99] After North Korea's fifth nuclear test in September 2016, it was reported that South Korea had developed a plan to raze Pyongyang if there were signs of an impending nuclear attack from the North.[100] As South Korea was convulsed by scandal, North Korea enthusiastically supported the removal of President Park Geun-hye, intensifying leaflet drops.[101] In turn, Park's supporters accused the opposition Liberty Korea Party of basing its logo on Pyongyang's Juche Tower.[102] In March 2017, it was reported that the South Korean government had increased the rewards to North Korean defectors who brought classified information or military equipment with them.[103]\\r\\nIn 2017, tensions with North Korea worsened with the inauguration of U.S. President Donald Trump, whose administration adopted a more assertive stance than the preceding Obama administration. In April, Trump said in an interview that he was sending a \\"powerful armada\\", based on the aircraft carrier USS?Carl Vinson, to Korea.[104][105][106]\\r\\nOn July 4, 2017, North Korea successfully conducted its first test of an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM), named Hwasong-14.[107] It conducted another test on 28 July.[108] On August 5, 2017, the UN imposed further sanctions which were met with defiance from the North Korean government.[109] Following the sanctions, Trump warned that North Korean nuclear threats \\"will be met with fire, fury and frankly power, the likes of which the world has never seen before\\". In response, North Korea announced that it was considering a missile test in which the missiles would land near the US territory of Guam.[110][111]\\r\\nOn August 29, North Korea fired a missile which flew over Hokkaido, Japan. The missile reached an altitude of 550km and flew a total distance of around 2,700km before crashing into the Pacific. [112] Days later with tensions still high, North Korea conducted their sixth nuclear test on September 3.[113] The test was met with international condemnation and resulted in further economic sanctions being taken against North Korea.[114] Just over two weeks after their previous test, North Korea launched another missile over Japan.[115]","input":"What is the conflict between south and north korea?"},{"output":"volcano's summit","context":"Kؐlauea (/?ki?la??e??/, US: /?k?l??we??/; Hawaiian:?[ti?l?w?w?j?]) is a currently active shield volcano in the Hawaiian Islands, and the most active of the five volcanoes that together form the island of Hawai?i. Located along the southern shore of the island, the volcano is between 300,000 and 600,000 years old and emerged above sea level about 100,000 years ago.\\r\\nIt is the second youngest product of the Hawaiian hotspot and the current eruptive center of the HawaiianÿEmperor seamount chain. Because it lacks topographic prominence and its activities historically coincided with those of Mauna Loa, Kؐlauea was once thought to be a satellite of its much larger neighbor. Structurally, Kؐlauea has a large, fairly recently formed caldera at its summit and two active rift zones, one extending 125?km (78?mi) east and the other 35?km (22?mi) west, as an active fault of unknown depth moving vertically an average of 2 to 20?mm (0.1 to 0.8?in) per year.\\r\\nKؐlauea has been erupting nearly continuously since 1983 and has caused considerable property damage, including the destruction of the town of Kalapana in 1990. On May 3, 2018, several lava vents opened in the lower Puna area, downrift from the summit. The new volcanic episode was accompanied by a strong earthquake of Mw 6.9, and nearly 2,000 residents were evacuated from Leilani Estates and the adjacent Lanipuna Gardens development. By May 9, 2018, the eruption had destroyed 27 houses in the Leilani Estates subdivision. On May 17, 2018 at 4:17 AM, the volcano explosively erupted, throwing ash 30,000 feet into the air.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nKؐlauea's eruptive history has been a long and active one; its name means \\"spewing\\" or \\"much spreading\\" in the Hawaiian language, referring to its frequent outpouring of lava. The earliest lavas from the volcano date back to its submarine preshield stage, samples having been recovered by remotely operated underwater vehicles from its submerged slopes; samples of other flows have been recovered as core samples. Lavas younger than 1,000 years cover 90 percent of the volcano's surface. The oldest exposed lavas date back 2,800 years.\\r\\nThe first well-documented eruption of Kؐlauea occurred in 1823 (Western contact and written history began in 1778). Since then, the volcano has erupted repeatedly. Most historical eruptions occurred at the volcano's summit or its eastern rift zone, and were prolonged and effusive in character. The geological record shows, however, that violent explosive activity predating European contact was extremely common; in 1790 one such eruption killed more than 400 people, making it the deadliest volcanic eruption in what is now the United States.[5] Should explosive activity start anew, the volcano would become much more of a danger to humans. Kؐlauea's current eruption dates back to January 3, 1983, and is by far its longest-duration historical period of activity, as well as one of the longest-duration eruptions in the world; as of January 2011, the eruption has produced 3.5?km3 (1?cu?mi) of lava and resurfaced 123.2?km2 (48?sq?mi) of land.\\r\\nKؐlauea's high state of activity has a major impact on its mountainside ecology, where plant growth is often interrupted by fresh tephra and drifting volcanic sulfur dioxide, producing acid rains particularly in a barren area south of its southwestern rift zone known as the Ka? Desert. Nonetheless, wildlife flourishes where left undisturbed elsewhere on the volcano and is highly endemic thanks to Kؐlauea's (and the island of Hawai?i's) isolation from the nearest landmass. Historically, the five volcanoes on the island were considered sacred by the Hawaiian people, and in Hawaiian mythology Kؐlauea's Halema?uma?u Crater served as the body and home of Pele, goddess of fire, lightning, wind, and volcanoes.[6] William Ellis, a missionary from England, gave the first modern account of Kؐlauea and spent two weeks traveling along the volcano; since its foundation by Thomas Jaggar in 1912, the Hawaiian Volcano Observatory, located on the rim of Kؐlauea caldera, has served as the principal investigative and scientific body on the volcano and the island in general. In 1916, a bill forming the Hawaii Volcanoes National Park was signed into law by President Woodrow Wilson; since then, the park has become a World Heritage Site and a major tourist destination, attracting roughly 2.6 million people annually.\\r\\nLike all Hawaiian volcanoes, Kؐlauea was created as the Pacific tectonic plate moved over the Hawaiian hotspot in the Earth's underlying mantle.[7] The Hawaii island volcanoes are the most recent evidence of this process that, over 70 million years, has created the 6,000?km (3,700?mi)-long HawaiianÿEmperor seamount chain.[8] The prevailing, though not completely settled, view is that the hotspot has been largely stationary within the planet's mantle for much, if not all of the Cenozoic Era.[8][9] However, while the Hawaiian mantle plume is well understood and extensively studied, the nature of hotspots themselves remains fairly enigmatic.[10]\\r\\nKؐlauea is one of five subaerial volcanoes that make up the island of Hawai?i, created by the Hawaii hotspot.[3] The oldest volcano on the island, Kohala, is more than a million years old,[11] and Kؐlauea, the youngest, is believed to be between 300,000 and 600,000 years of age;[3] L?ihi Seamount, on the island's flank, is younger and has yet to breach the surface.[12] Thus Kilauea is the second youngest volcano in the HawaiianÿEmperor seamount chain, a chain of shield volcanoes and seamounts extending from Hawaii to the KurilÿKamchatka Trench in Russia.[13]\\r\\nFollowing the pattern of Hawaiian volcano formation, Kؐlauea started as a submarine volcano, gradually building itself up through underwater eruptions of alkali basalt lava before emerging from the sea with a series of explosive eruptions[14] about 50,000 to 100,000 years ago. Since then, the volcano's activity has likely been as it is now, a continual stream of effusive and explosive eruptions of roughly the same pattern as its activity in the last 200 or 300 years.[15]\\r\\nAt most 600,000 years old, Kؐlauea is still quite young for a Hawaiian volcano;[3] the oldest volcano on the island, the northwestern Kohala, experienced almost 900,000 years of activity before going extinct.[11] The volcano's foreseeable future activity will likely be much like it has been for the past 50,000 to 100,000 years; Hawaiian and explosive activity will make Kؐlauea taller, build up its rift zones, and fill and refill its summit caldera.[15]\\r\\nKؐlauea has been active throughout its history.[15] Since 1918, Kؐlauea's only prolonged period of rest was an 18-year pause between 1934 and 1952.[16] The bulk of Kؐlauea consists of solidified lava flows, intermittent with scattered volcanic ash and tephra sourced from relatively lower-volume explosive eruptions.[15] Much of the volcano is covered in historical flows, and 90 percent of its surface dates from the last 1,100 years.[17] Kؐlauea built itself up from the seafloor over time, and thus much of its bulk remains underwater;[14] its subaerial surface is in the form of a gently sloping, elongate, decentralized shield with a surface area of approximately 1,500?km2 (579?sq?mi),[18] making up 13.7 percent of the island's total surface area.[3]\\r\\nKؐlauea lacks a topographical prominence, appearing only as a bulge on the southeastern flank of the nearby Mauna Loa; because of this, both native Hawaiians and early geologists considered it an active satellite of its more massive neighbor. However, analysis of the chemical composition of lavas from the two volcanoes shows that they have separate magma chambers, and are thus distinct. Nonetheless, their proximity has led to a historical trend in which high activity at one volcano roughly coincides with low activity at the other. When Kؐlauea lay dormant between 1934 and 1952, Mauna Loa became active, and when the latter remained quiet from 1952 to 1974, the reverse was true. This is not always the case; the 1984 eruption of Mauna Loa started during an eruption at Kؐlauea, but had no discernible effect on the Kؐlauea eruption, and the ongoing inflation of Mauna Loa's summit, indicative of a future eruption, began the same day as new lava flows at Kؐlauea's Pu?u ?? crater. In 2002, Kilauea experienced a high-volume effusive episode at the same time that Mauna Loa began inflating. This unexpected communication is evidence of crustal-level interactions between Mauna Loa and Kؐlauea, even though these two volcanoes are thought to be fairly independent of each other.[19] Geologists have suggested that \\"pulses\\" of magma entering Mauna Loa's deeper magma system may have increased pressure inside Kؐlauea and triggered the concurrent eruptions.[20]\\r\\nKؐlauea has a large summit caldera, measuring 4 by 3.2?km (2.5 by 2.0?mi) with walls up to 120?m (400?ft) high, breached by lava flows on the southwestern side.[16] It is unknown if the caldera was always there or if it is a relatively recent feature, and it is possible that it has come and gone throughout Kؐlauea's eruptive history;[15] what is known is that it likely formed over several centuries, with its construction estimated to have begun about 500 years ago,[21] and that its present form was finalized by a particularly powerful eruption in 1790.[15] A major feature within the caldera is Halema?uma?u Crater, a large pit crater and one of Kؐlauea's most historically active eruption centers. The crater is approximately 920?m (3,018?ft) in diameter and 85?m (279?ft) deep, but its form has varied widely through its eruptive history; the floor of the Halema?uma?u Crater is now mostly covered by flows from its most recent eruption, in 1974.[22]\\r\\nKؐlauea has two rift zones radiating from its summit, one leading 125?km (78?mi) out to the east, the other 35?km (22?mi) long and trending towards the southwest.[15] A series of fault scarps connecting the two rift zones form the Koa'e Fault Zone. Tectonic extension along both rift zones is causing Kؐlauea's bulk to slowly slide seaward off its southern flank at a rate of about 6 to 10?cm (2 to 4?in) per year, centered on a basal dcollement fault 7 to 9?km (4 to 6?mi) beneath the volcano's surface.[23] The eastern rift zone in particular is a dominant feature on the volcano; it is almost entirely covered in lava erupted in the last 400 years, and at its crest near the summit is 2 to 4?km (1 to 2?mi) wide.[18] Non-localized eruptions, typical of rift zone activity,[15] have produced a series of low-lying ridges down the majority of the east rift zone's length.[18] Its upper segment is the most presently active section of the volcano,[17][21] and is additionally the site of a number of large pit craters;[24] its lower extremity reaches down Kؐlauea's submerged flank to a depth of more than 5,000?m (16,400?ft).[21] By contrast, the much smaller southwestern rift has been quiet since a rifting episode in 1974, and to date has not been involved in the current eruptive cycle at all.[23] The southwestern rift zone's extremity is also underwater, although its submarine length is more limited. The southwestern rift zone also lacks a well-defined ridge line or a large number of pit craters, evidence that it is also geologically less active than the eastern rift zone.[21]\\r\\nA prominent structure on Kؐlauea's southern flank is the Hilina fault system, a highly active fault slipping vertically an average of 2 to 20?mm (0.1 to 0.8?in) per year[clarification needed] along the system. Its physiographic province is 500?m (1,640?ft) deep, but it is unknown whether it is a shallow listric fault or if it penetrates to the very base of the volcano.[7] In connection with the 2018 lower Puna eruption the Hawaiian Volcano Observatory published some facts leading to the conclusion, that a catastrophic collapse would be incredibly remote.[25] A number of cinder cones, satellite shields, lava tubes, and other eruptive structures also dot the volcano, evidence of its recent activity.[24] Kؐlauea has some interactions with Mauna Loa, its larger neighbor and only other recently active volcano on the island; interspersed lava flows and ash deposits belonging to its neighbor have been found on its flanks, and some of Mauna Loa's flows are, in turn, blanketed in Kؐlauea tephra. In particular, the saddle between the two volcanoes is currently depressed, and is likely to fill over in the future.[21]\\r\\nAll historical eruptions at Kؐlauea have occurred at one of three places: its summit caldera, its eastern rift zone, or its southwestern rift zone.[3] Half of Kؐlauea's historical eruptions have occurred at or near Kؐlauea's summit caldera. Activity there was nearly continuous for much of the 19th century, capped by a massive explosive eruption in 1924 before petering out by 1934. Recent activity has mostly shifted to Kؐlauea's eastern rift zone, the site of 24 historical eruptions, located mostly on its upper section; by contrast, the volcano's southwestern rift zone has been relatively quiet, and has only been the site of five events to date.[15]\\r\\nGeologists have dated and documented dozens of major eruptions over the volcano's long history, bridging the long gap between Kؐlauea's oldest known rock and only extremely recent written records and historical observation.[26] Historical lava flows from the volcano are generally recovered by scientists in one of three ways. The oldest flows, dating back 275,000 to 225,000 years, have been recovered from Kؐlauea's submerged southern slope by ship-towed remotely operated vehicles. These lavas exhibit forms characteristic of early, submerged preshield-stage eruptive episodes, from when the volcano was still a rising seamount that had not yet breached the ocean surface,[27] and their surface exposure is unusual, as in most other volcanoes such lavas would have since been buried by more recent flows.[7]\\r\\nThe second method of recovering older rock is through the drilling of deep core samples; however, the cores have proved difficult to date, and several samples from depths of around 1,700?m (5,600?ft) that suggested dates as old as 450,000 years have since been found erroneous. More reliable paleomagnetic dating, limited to rocks dating from after Kؐlauea's emergence from the sea, has suggested ages of around 50,000 years. Exposed flows above sea level have proved far younger. Some of the oldest reliably dated rock, 43,000 years old, comes from charcoal sandwiched beneath an ash layer on a fault scarp known as Hilina Pali; however, sampled dated from higher up the scarp indicate ash deposition at an average rate of 6?m (20?ft) per thousand years, indicating the oldest exposed flows, from the base of the feature, could date back as far as 70,000 years.[27] This date is similar to that of the oldest dated extant lava flow, a southwestern rift zone flow with an uncorrected radiocarbon dating of approximately 4650 BC.[26]\\r\\nThe oldest well-studied eruptive product from Kؐlauea is the Uwkahuna Ash Member, the product of explosive eruptions between 2,800 and 2,100 years ago. Although it has since been largely buried by younger flows, it remains exposed in some places, and has been traced more than 20?km (12?mi) from the volcano's caldera, evidence of very powerful eruptions. Evidence suggests the existence of an active eruptive center at this time, termed the Powers Caldera, 2?km (1?mi) away from the modern one. At least 1,200 years ago, lava from the Powers Caldera overtopped its rim and solidified the structure; this was followed by a period of very voluminous tube-fed phoehoe flows from the summit. Following cessation of activity around 400 years ago, eruptions re-centered on the eastern part of Kؐlauea's summit, and concurrently activity increased at the northern end of the eastern rift zone.[21]\\r\\nThe earliest reliable written records of historical activity date back to about 1820,[28] and the first well-documented eruption occurred in 1823, when the volcano was first put under observation;[15] although Native Hawaiians are thought to have first settled on the island around 1,500 years ago, oral records predating European arrival on the island are few and difficult to interpret.[21] One pre-contact eruption in particular, a phreatomagmatic event in 1790,[16] was responsible for the death of a party of warriors, part of the army of Keua Kuahu?ula, the last island chief to resist Kamehameha I's rule; their death is evidenced by a set of footprints preserved within the Hawaii Volcanoes National Park which are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.[28] Kؐlauea has been the site of 61 separate eruptions since 1823, easily making it one of the most active volcanoes on Earth.[3][16]\\r\\nDuring its observed history, the volume of lava erupted by Kؐlauea has varied widely. In 1823 Kؐlauea's summit caldera was far deeper than it is today, but was in the process of filling up under nearly continuous summit eruption, with 3?km3 (1?cu?mi) of lava erupted there alone by 1840. The period between 1840 and 1920 saw approximately half that in eruptive volume, and in the thirty years between then and about 1950, the volcano was unusually quiet and exhibited very little activity; Kؐlauea's eruptive volume has increased steadily since then, with present activity comparable to that of the early 1800s.[15]\\r\\nThe length and origin these eruptions has also varied. Events last anywhere between days and years, and occur at a number of different sites. Half of all eruptions occur at or near Kؐlauea's summit caldera. Activity there was nearly continuous for much of the 19th century, and after a reprieve between 1894 and 1907, continued onwards until 1924. There have been five historical eruptions at the volcano's relatively quiet southwestern rift zone, and 24 along its more active eastern rift zone, mostly along its upper section.[15]\\r\\nThe volcano's observed history has mostly been one of effusive eruptions; however, this is a relatively recent occurrence. Prior to the arrival of the first Europeans on the island, Kؐlauea was the site of regular explosive activity, evidenced then by tribal chants referencing the volcano's fickle nature, and today by geological records of an explosively active mode of past activity. Although explosive activity still occurs at the volcano, it is not as intense as it once was, and the volcano would become much more dangerous to the general public if it returned to its old phase of activity once more.[29]\\r\\nKؐlauea erupted in 1823 and 1832, but the first major eruption since the 1790 event occurred in 1840, when its eastern rift zone became the site of a large, effusive Hawaiian eruption over 35?km (22?mi) of its length, unusually long even for a rift eruption.[30] The eruption lasted for 26 days and produced an estimated 205 to 265 million cubic meters of lava;[16] the light created by the event was so intense that one could reportedly read a newspaper in Hilo at night, 30?km (19?mi) away.[30]\\r\\nThe volcano was active again in 1868, 1877, 1884, 1885, 1894, and 1918,[16] before its next major eruption in 1918ÿ1919. Halema?uma?u, then a small upwelling in the caldera floor, was topped by a lava lake that then drained, before refilling again, forming an enormous lava lake and nearly reaching the top edge of the caldera before draining once more. This activity eventually gave way to the construction of Mauna Iki, building up the large lava shield within the caldera over a period of eight months. The eruption also featured concurrent rift activity and a large amount of lava fountaining.[31]\\r\\nActivity in 1921ÿ1923 followed.[16] The next major eruption occurred in 1924. Halema?uma?u Crater, a fully formed pit crater after the 1919 event and the site of a sizable lava lake, first drained, then quickly began sinking into the ground, deepening to nearly 210?m (689?ft) beneath a thick cloud of volcanic ash. Explosive activity began on May 10 of that year, blowing rock chunks weighing as much as 45?kg (99?lb) 60?m (197?ft) out, and smaller fragments weighing about 9?kg (20?lb) out as far as 270?m (886?ft), and, after a brief reprieve, intensified through a major blast on May 18, when an enormous explosive event caused the eruption's only fatality. The eruption continued and formed numerous eruption columns up to and beyond 9?km (6?mi) in height, before slowly petering down and ending by May 28.[29][32] Volcanic activity was soon confined to the summit, and ceased completely after 1934.[16]\\r\\nAfter the Halema?uma?u event, Kؐlauea remained relatively quiet, and, for a time, completely silent, with all activity confined to the summit.[16] It came alive again in 1952 with an enormous lava fountain 245?m (800?ft) high at the Halema?uma?u Crater. Multiple continuous lava fountains between 15 and 30?m (50 and 100?ft) persisted, and the eruption lasted 136 days.[33] Eruptions occurred soon after in 1954, 1955, and 1959, capped by a large event in 1960, when fissure-based phreatic eruption and earthquake activity gave way to a massive ?a? flow that overran multiple evacuated communities and resorts; the resulting summit deflation eventually caused the ever-active Halema?uma?u to collapse even further.[34]\\r\\nFollowing the event, eruptive events yearly and nearly continuous, a state of activity that remains today. The period 1967ÿ1968 saw a particularly large, 80-million-cubic-meter, 251-day event from Halema?uma?u Crater.[16] This event was superseded the very next year by the marathon Mauna Ulu eruption, a large effusive eruption which lasted from May 24, 1969 to July 24, 1974 and added 230 acres (93?ha) of new land to the island. After eruptive activity had died down, there was a magnitude 7.2 earthquake that caused a partial summit collapse, after which activity did not resume at Kؐlauea until 1977.[35] At the time, Mauna Ulu was the longest flank eruption of any Hawaiian volcano in recorded history. The eruption created a new vent, covered a large area of land with lava, and added new land to the island. The eruption started as a fissure between two pit craters, ?lo?i and ?Alae, where the Mauna Ulu shield would eventually form. Both phoehoe and ?a? lava erupted from the volcano. Early on, fountains of lava burst out as much as 540?meters (1772?ft) high. In early 1973, an earthquake occurred that caused Kؐlauea to briefly stop erupting near the original Mauna Ulu site and instead erupt near the craters Pauahi and Hi?iaka.[35]\\r\\nThe most recent major eruption at Kؐlauea has been the longest duration of any observed eruption. The current Kؐlauea eruption began on January 3, 1983, along the eastern rift zone. The vent produced vigorous lava fountains that quickly built up into the Pu?u ?? cone, sending lava flows down the volcano's slope. In 1986, activity shifted down the rift to a new vent, named Kpa?ianah, where it took on a more effusive character. Kpa?ianah built up a low, broad volcanic shield, and lava tubes fed flows extending 11 to 12?km (about 7?mi) to the sea. Between 1986 and 1991, the connection between Chain of Craters Road and Hawaii Route 130 was cut, and the community of Kapaahu, the village of Kalapana, and the subdivisions of Klapana Gardens and Royal Gardens were lost to the lava.[36] A black sand beach at Kaim was also engulfed.[37] In 1992, the eruption moved back to Pu?u ??, but continued in the same manner, covering nearly all of the 1983ÿ86 lava flows and large areas of coastline.[38] As of December 2012, the eruption had produced 4?km3 (1?cu?mi) of lava, covered 125?km2 (48?sq?mi) of land, added 202?ha (499 acres) of land to the island, destroyed 214 structures, and buried 14.3?km (9?mi) of highway under lava as thick as 35?m (115?ft).[39]\\r\\nIn December 2014, the June 27 flow from the ongoing eruption threatened to enter the town of Pahoa, and to cut Highway 130, the only route into and out of Lower Puna. As a result, work was begun to reopen Chain of Craters Road, initially as a one-lane gravelled surface, and to make Railroad Avenue and Government Beach Road usable as emergency routes.[40][41] However the flow stopped just short of entering Pahoa, and by March 2015, the threat to the town was much reduced.[42]\\r\\nIn early May 2018, hundreds of small earthquakes were detected on Kؐlaueas East rift zone, leading officials to issue evacuation warnings. On May 3, 2018, the volcano erupted in lower Puna after a 5.0 earthquake earlier in the day, causing evacuations of the Leilani Estates and Lanipuna Gardens subdivisions.[43][44]\\r\\nA seemingly related 6.9 magnitude earthquake occurred on May 4.[45] By May 9, 27 houses had been destroyed in Leilani Estates.[46][47]\\r\\nIn conjunction with the outbreak of lava in lower Puna, a lava lake at Halema?uma?u Crater at Kilauea's summit began to drop.[48] The Hawaiian Volcano Observatory warned that the lowering of the lava lake increased the potential for phreatic (steam) explosions at the summit caused by interaction of magma with the underground water table, similar to the explosions that occurred at Halema?uma?u in 1924. These concerns prompted the closure of Hawai?i Volcanoes National Park.[49]\\r\\nOn May 17, at approximately 4:15 a.m., an explosive eruption occurred at Halema?uma?u, creating a plume of ash 30,000 feet into the air.[50] On May 21 it was reported that two lava flows have reached the Pacific Ocean, creating thick clouds of laze (a toxic lava and haze cloud), which is made up of hydrochloric acid and glass particles.[51]\\r\\nThe Global Volcanism Program has assigned a Volcanic Explosivity Index (VEI) to all except five of Kؐlauea's ninety-five known eruptions of the last 11,700 years. The eruption of 1790 has a VEI of 4. The eruptions of 1820, 1924, 1959 and 1960 have a VEI of 2. The eruptions of 680, 1050, 1490, 1500, 1610, 1868, four eruptions in 1961 and the current eruption since 1983 have a VEI of 1. The other seventy-four eruptions have a VEI of 0.[52]\\r\\nBecause of its position more than 3,000 kilometers (2,000 mi) from the nearest continental landmass, the island of Hawai?i is one of the most geographically isolated landmasses on Earth; this in turn has strongly influenced its ecology. The majority of the species present on the island are endemic to it and can be found nowhere else on Earth, the result of an isolated evolutionary lineage sheltered from external biotic influence; this makes its ecosystem vulnerable both to invasive species and human development, and an estimated third of the island's natural flora and fauna has already gone extinct.[53]\\r\\nKؐlauea's ecological community is additionally threatened by the activity of the volcano itself;[24] lava flows often overrun sections of the volcano's forests and burn them down, and volcanic ash distributed by explosive eruptions often smothers local plant life. Layers of carbonized organic material at the bottom of Kؐlauea ash deposits are evidence of the many times the volcano has wrought destruction on its own ecosystem and that of its neighbor Mauna Loa, and parts of the volcano present a dichotomy between pristine montane forest and recently buried volcanic \\"deserts\\" yet to be recolonized.[54]\\r\\nKؐlauea's bulk affects local climate conditions through the influence of trade winds coming predominately from the northeast, which, when squeezed upwards by the volcano's height, results in a moister windward side and a comparatively arid leeward flank. The volcano's ecology is further complicated by height, though not nearly as much as with its other, far taller neighbors, and by the local distribution of volcanic products, making for varied soil conditions. The northern part of Kؐlauea is mostly below 1,000?m (3,281?ft) and receives more than 75?in (191?cm) mean annual rainfall, and can mostly be classified as a lowland wet community; farther south, the volcano has squeezed out much of the precipitation and receives less than 50?in (127?cm) mean annual rainfall, and is considered mostly a lowland dry environment.[55]\\r\\nMuch of Kؐlauea's southern ecosystem lies within the Hawai?i Volcanoes National Park, where ae ferns, ?hi?a trees (Metrosideros polymorpha), and hapuu of the genus Cibotium are common.[56] The park hosts a large variety of bird species, including the 'apapane (Himatione sanguinea); the 'amakihi (Hemignathus virens); the 'i'iwi (Vestiaria coccinea); the mao (Myadestes obscurus), the ?elepaio (Chasiempis sp.); and the endangered 'akepa (Loxops coccineus), 'akiapola'au (Hemignathus munroi), nn (Branta sandvicensis), ?ua?u (Pterodroma sandwichensis), and ?io (Buteo solitarius) species.[57] The Kؐlauea coast also hosts three of the nine known critically endangered hawksbill sea turtle (Eretmochelys imbricata) nesting sites on the island.[58]\\r\\nSome of the area alongside Kؐlauea's southwestern rift zone takes the form of the unusual Ka? Desert. Although not a \\"true\\" desert (rainfall there exceeds the maximum 1,000?mm (39?in) a year), precipitation mixing with drifting volcanic sulfur dioxide forms acid rain with a pH as low as 3.4, greatly hampering regional plant growth.[59] The deposited tephra particulates make the local soil very permeable. Plant life in the region is practically nonexistent.[60]\\r\\nKؐlauea's northern lowland wet-forest ecosystem is partially protected by the Puna Forest Reserve and the Kahauale\`a Natural Area Reserve. At 27,785 acres (11,244?ha), Wao Kele in particular is Hawai?i's largest lowland wet forest reserve, and is home to rare plant species including hpu?u ferns (Cibotium spp.), 'ie'ie vines (Freycinetia arborea), and kpiko (Psychotria mariniana), some of which play a role in limiting invasive species' spread. ?Ope?ape?a (Lasiurus cinereus semotus) ?io (Buteo solitarius), common ?amakihi (Hemignathus virens), and nananana makaki?i (Theridion grallator) live in the trees. There are thought to be many more as-yet-undocumented species within the forest.[61][62] Wao Kele's primary forest tree is ?hi?a lehua (Metrosideros polymorpha).[63]\\r\\nThe first Ancient Hawaiians to arrive on Hawaii island lived along the shores, where food and water were plentiful.[64] Flightless birds that had previously known no predators became a staple food source.[65] Early settlements had a major impact on the local ecosystem, and caused many extinctions, particularly amongst bird species, as well as introducing foreign plants and animals and increasing erosion rates.[66] The prevailing lowland forest ecosystem was transformed from forest to grassland; some of this change was caused by the use of fire, but the main reason appears to have been the introduction of the Polynesian rat (Rattus exulans).[67]\\r\\nThe summits of the five volcanoes of Hawaii are revered as sacred mountains. Hawaiians associated elements of their natural environment with particular deities. In Hawaiian mythology, the sky father Wkea marries the earth mother Papa, giving birth to the Hawaiian Islands.[65] Kؐlauea itself means \\"spewing\\" or \\"much spreading\\" in Hawaiian, referencing its high state of activity,[3] and in Hawaiian mythology Kؐlauea is the body of the deity Pele, goddess of fire, lightning, wind, and volcanoes.[68] It is here that the conflict between Pele and the rain god Kamapua?a was centered; Halema?uma?u, \\"House of the ?ama?uma?u fern\\", derives its name from the struggle between the two gods. Kamapua?a, hard-pressed by Pele's ability to make lava spout from the ground at will, covered the feature, a favorite residence of the goddess, with fern fronds. Choked by trapped smoke, Pele emerged. Realizing that each could threaten the other with destruction, the other gods called a draw and divided the island between them, with Kamapua?a getting the moist windward northeastern side, and Pele directing the drier Kona (or leeward) side. The rusty singed appearance of the young fronds of the ?ama?uma?u is said to be a product of the legendary struggle.[69]\\r\\nThis early era was followed by peace and cultural expansion between the 12th and late 18th century. Land was divided into regions designed for both the immediate needs of the populace and the long-term welfare of the environment. These ahupua?a generally took the form of long strips of land oriented from the mountain summits to the coast.[65]\\r\\nThe first foreigner to arrive at Hawaii was James Cook in 1778.[70] The first non-native to observe Kؐlauea in detail was William Ellis, an English missionary who in 1823 spent more than two weeks trekking across the volcano. He collated the first written account of the volcano and observed many of its features, establishing a premise for future explorations of the volcano.[71]\\r\\nAnother missionary, C. S. Stewart, U.S.N., writes of it in his journal 'A Residence in the Sandwich Islands', which Letitia Elizabeth Landon quotes from in the notes to her poem 'The Volcano of Ki-Rau-E-A' in Fisher's Drawing Room Scrap Book, 1832.\\r\\nOne of the earliest and most important surveyors of Kؐlauea was James Dwight Dana, who, staying with the missionary Titus Coan, studied the island's volcanoes in detail for decades first-hand.[72] Dana visited Kؐlauea's summit and described it in detail in 1840.[73] After publishing a summary paper in 1852, he directed a detailed geological study of the island in 1880 and 1881 but did not consider Kؐlauea a separate volcano, instead referring to it as a flank vent of Mauna Loa; it was not until another geologist, C. E. Dutton, had elaborated on Dana's research during an 1884 expedition that Kؐlauea came to be generally accepted as a separate entity.[74]:154ÿ155\\r\\nThe next era of Kؐlauea's history began with the establishment of the Hawaiian Volcano Observatory on the volcano's rim in 1912. The first permanent such installation in the United States, the observatory was the brainchild of Thomas Jaggar, head of geology at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology; after witnessing the devastation of the 1908 Messina earthquake near Mount Etna in Italy, he declared that something must be done to support systematic volcanic and seismic study, and chose Kؐlauea as the site of the first such establishment. After securing initial funding from MIT and the University of Hawaii, Jaggar took directorship of the observatory and, whilst its head between 1912 and 1940, pioneered seismological and observational study and observation of active volcanoes.[75] After initial funding ran out, the Observatory was successively funded by the National Weather Service, the United States Geological Survey (USGS), and the National Park Service, before settling on the USGS, under whose banner the observatory has been operating since 1947. The main building has been moved twice since establishment, and today is positioned on the northwest rim of Kؐlauea's caldera.[76]\\r\\nThe volcano became a tourist attraction from the 1840s onwards, and local businessmen such as Benjamin Pitman and George Lycurgus ran a series of hotels at the rim, including Volcano House which is still the only hotel or restaurant located within the borders of the Hawai?i Volcanoes National Park.[77] In 1891, Lorrin A. Thurston, grandson of the American missionary Asa Thurston and investor in hotels along the volcano's rim, began campaigning for a park on the volcano's slopes, an idea first proposed by William Richards Castle, Jr. in 1903. Thurston, who owned the Honolulu Advertiser newspaper, printed editorials in favor of the idea; by 1911 Governor Walter F. Frear had proposed a draft bill to create \\"Kilauea National Park\\". Following endorsements from John Muir, Henry Cabot Lodge, and former President Theodore Roosevelt (in opposition to local ranchers) and several legislative attempts introduced by delegate Jonah Khi Kalaniana'ole, House Resolution 9525 was signed into law by Woodrow Wilson on August 1, 1916. It was the 11th National Park in the United States, and the first in a Territory;[78] a few weeks later, the National Park Service Organic Act was signed into law, creating the National Park Service and tasking it with running the expanding system.[79] Originally called \\"Hawaii National Park\\", it was split from the Haleakala National Park on 22 September 1960. Today the park, renamed the Hawai?i Volcanoes National Park, is a major conservatory agency and tourist attraction, and, since 1987, a World Heritage Site.[80]\\r\\nIn its early days, tourism was a relatively new concept, but grew slowly before exploding with the advent of air travel around 1959, the year Hawai?i became a state. Today tourism is driven by the island's exotic tropical locations,[81] and Kؐlauea, being one of the few volcanoes in the world in a more or less constant state of moderate eruption, is a major part of the island's tourist draw.[82] Today, Kؐlauea is visited by roughly 2.6 million people annually, most of whom proceed up the volcano from the Kilauea Visitor Center near the park entrance. The Thomas A. Jaggar Museum is also a popular tourist stop; located at the edge of Kؐlauea caldera, the museum's observation deck offers the best sheltered view on the volcano of the activity at Halemaumau Crater. The Volcano House still provides the nearest lodging, and the nearby Volcano Village the most numerous; visitors associated with the military can find lodging at the Kilauea Military Camp. A number of hiking trails, points of interest, and guided ranger programs exist, and the Chain of Craters Road, Hilina Pali Road, and Crater Rim Drive provide access.[83][84] In 2008, Lava Viewing Area was opened by the county for tourists in Kalapana, on the southeastern side of the National Park, accessible only from State Route 130.[85]","input":"Where do most of kilauea's eruptions occur?"},{"output":"December 6, 2009","context":"Naruto is an anime series based on Masashi Kishimoto's manga series of the same name.

Facing the duty as a warrior to fight the Dharma Yudhha or righteous war between Pandavas and Kauravas, Arjuna is counselled by Lord Krishna to \\"fulfill his Kshatriya (warrior) duty as a warrior and establish Dharma.\\"[4] Inserted[4] in this appeal to kshatriya dharma (chivalry)[5] is \\"a dialogue?... between diverging attitudes concerning methods toward the attainment of liberation (moksha)\\".[6] The Bhagavad Gita was exposed to the world through Sanjaya, who senses and cognises all the events of the battlefield.[7] Sanjaya is Dhritarashtra's advisor and also his charioteer.\\r\\nThe Bhagavad Gita presents a synthesis[8][9] of the concept of Dharma,[8][9][10] theistic bhakti,[11][10] the yogic ideals[9] of moksha[9] through jnana, bhakti, karma, and Raja Yoga (spoken of in the 6th chapter)[11] and Samkhya philosophy.[web 1][note 1] It is Bhagavata explanation of the Purusha Sukta and the Purushamedha Srauta yajna described in the Satapatha Brahmana.[12]\\r\\nNumerous commentaries have been written on the Bhagavad Gita with widely differing views on the essentials. Vedanta commentators read varying relations between Self and Brahman in the text: Advaita Vedanta sees the non-dualism of Atman (soul) and Brahman as its essence,[13] whereas Bhedabheda and Vishishtadvaita see Atman and Brahman as both different and non-different, and Dvaita sees them as different. The setting of the Gita in a battlefield has been interpreted as an allegory for the ethical and moral struggles of the human life.\\r\\nThe Bhagavad Gita's call for selfless action inspired many leaders of the Indian independence movement including Bal Gangadhar Tilak and Mahatma Gandhi. Gandhi referred to the Gita as his \\"spiritual dictionary\\".[14]\\r\\nDivisions\\r\\nSama vedic\\r\\nYajur vedic\\r\\nAtharva vedic\\r\\nVaishnava puranas\\r\\nShaiva puranas\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe epic Mahabharata is traditionally ascribed to the Sage Vyasa; the Bhagavad Gita, being a part of the Mahabharata's Bhishma Parva, is also ascribed to him.[15]\\r\\nTheories on the date of composition of the Gita vary considerably. Scholars accept dates from the fifth century to the second century BCE as the probable range. Professor Jeaneane Fowler, in her commentary on the Gita, considers second century BCE to be the likely date of composition.[16] Kashi Nath Upadhyaya, a Gita scholar, on the basis of the estimated dates of Mahabharata, Brahma sutras, and other independent sources, concludes that the Bhagavad Gita was composed in the fifth or fourth century BCE.[17]\\r\\nIt is generally agreed that, \\"Unlike the Vedas, which have to be preserved letter-perfect, the Gita was a popular work whose reciters would inevitably conform to changes in language and style\\", so the earliest \\"surviving\\" components of this dynamic text are believed to be no older than the earliest \\"external\\" references we have to the Mahabharata epic, which may include an allusion in Panini's fourth century BCE grammar. It is estimated that the text probably reached something of a \\"final form\\" by the early Gupta period (about the 4th century CE). The actual dates of composition of the Gita remain unresolved.[15]\\r\\nThere is no reference to the Bhagavad Gita in Buddhist literature, the Tripitaka. The Buddha refers to 3 Vedas rather than 4 Vedas, as per general perception in many dialogues. So, there is doubt about whether the Bhagavad Gita was widely known about during the lifetime of Gautama Buddha.The Namboothiris of Kerala follows 3 Vedas only. According to Manusmriti (the law book of Manu) a Brahmanan who does not know the Vedic verses (at least of one Vedam) is useless. So it is safe to say Buddha only mentioned 3 Vedas just like the Brahman community of Kerala.\\r\\nDue to its presence in the Mahabharata, the Bhagavad Gita is classified as a Smriti text or \\"that which is remembered\\".[note 2] The smriti texts of the period between 200 BCE and 100 CE belong to the emerging \\"Hindu Synthesis\\", proclaiming the authority of the Vedas while integrating various Indian traditions and religions. Acceptance of the Vedas became a central criterion for defining Hinduism over and against the heterodoxies, which rejected the Vedas.[18]\\r\\nThe so-called \\"Hindu Synthesis\\" emerged during the early Classical period (200 BCE ÿ 300 CE) of Hinduism.[18][9][19] According to Alf Hiltebeitel, a period of consolidation in the development of Hinduism took place between the time of the late Vedic Upanishad (ca. 500 BCE) and the period of the rise of the Guptas (ca. 320ÿ467 CE) which he calls the \\"Hindu Synthesis\\", \\"Brahmanic Synthesis\\", or \\"Orthodox Synthesis\\".[18] It developed in interaction with other religions and peoples:\\r\\nThe emerging self-definitions of Hinduism were forged in the context of continuous interaction with heterodox religions (Buddhists, Jains, Ajivikas) throughout this whole period, and with foreign people (Yavanas, or Greeks; Sakas, or Scythians; Pahlavas, or Parthians; and Kusanas, or Kushans) from the third phase on [between the Mauryan empire and the rise of the Guptas].[18]\\r\\nThe Bhagavad Gita is the sealing achievement of this Hindu Synthesis, incorporating various religious traditions.[18][11][9][web 1][10] According to Hiltebeitel, Bhakti forms an essential ingredient of this synthesis, which incorporates Bhakti into Vedanta.[18] According to Deutsch and Dalvi, the Bhagavad Gita attempts \\"to forge a harmony\\"[20] between different strands of Indian thought: jnana, dharma and bhakti.[11] Deutsch and Dalvi note that the authors of the Bhagavad Gita \\"must have seen the appeal of the soteriologies both of the \\"heterodox\\" traditions of Buddhism and Jainism and of the more \\"orthodox\\" ones of Samkhya and Yoga\\",[8] while the Brahmanic tradition emphasised \\"the significance of dharma as the instrument of goodness\\".[8] Scheepers mentions the Bhagavat Gita as a Brahmanical text which uses the shramanic and Yogic terminology to spread the Brahmanic idea of living according to one's duty or dharma, in contrast to the yogic ideal of liberation from the workings of karma.[9] According to Basham,\\r\\nThe Bhagavadgita combines many different elements from Samkhya and Vedanta philosophy. In matters of religion, its important contribution was the new emphasis placed on devotion, which has since remained a central path in Hinduism. In addition, the popular theism expressed elsewhere in the Mahabharata and the transcendentalism of the Upanishads converge, and a God of personal characteristics is identified with the brahman of the Vedic tradition. The Bhagavadgita thus gives a typology of the three dominant trends of Indian religion: dharma-based householder life, enlightenment-based renunciation, and devotion-based theism.[web 1]\\r\\nBhagavad Gita as a synthesis:\\r\\nThe Bhagavadgita may be treated as a great synthesis of the ideas of the impersonal spiritual monism with personalistic monotheism, of the yoga of action with the yoga of transcendence of action, and these again with yogas of devotion and knowledge.[10]\\r\\nThe influence of the Bhagavad Gita was such, that its synthesis was adapted to and incorporated into specific Indian traditions. Nicholson mentions the Shiva Gita as an adaptation of the Vishnu-oriented Bhagavat Gita into Shiva-oriented terminology,[21] and the Isvara Gita as borrowing entire verses from the Krishna-oriented Bhagavad Gita and placing them into a new Shiva-oriented context.[22]\\r\\nThe Bhagavad Gita is part of the Prasthanatrayi, which also includes the Upanishads and Brahma sutras. These are the key texts for the Vedanta,[23][24][25] which interprets these texts to give a unified meaning. Advaita Vedanta sees the non-dualism of Atman and Brahman as its essence,[13] whereas Bhedabheda and Vishishtadvaita see Atman and Brahman as both different and non-different, and Dvaita sees them as different. In recent times the Advaita interpretation has gained worldwide popularity, due to the Neo-Vedanta of Vivekananda and Radhakrishnan, while the Achintya Bheda Abheda interpretation has gained worldwide popularity via the Hare Krishnas, a branch of Gaudiya Vaishnavism.[26]\\r\\nAlthough early Vedanta gives an interpretation of the sruti texts of the Upanishads, and its main commentary the Brahman Sutras, the popularity of the Bhagavad Gita was such that it could not be neglected.[6] It is referred to in the Brahman Sutras, and Shankara, Bhaskara and Ramanuja all three wrote commentaries on it.[6] The Bhagavad Gita is different from the Upanishads in format and content, and accessible to all, in contrast to the sruti, which are only to be read and heard by the higher castes.[6]\\r\\nSome branches of Hinduism give it the status of an Upanishad, and consider it to be a ?ruti or \\"revealed text\\".[27][28] According to Pandit, who gives a modern-orthodox interpretation of Hinduism, \\"since the Bhagavad Gita represents a summary of the Upanishadic teachings, it is sometimes called 'the Upanishad of the Upanishads'.\\"[29]\\r\\nThe Bhagavad Gita is a Bhagavata explanation of the Purusha Sukta and the Purushamedha Srauta yajna described in the Satapatha Brahmana.[12] Chapters 7 and 8 of the Bhagavad Gita describe the relationship between teacher and disciple, where the teacher is viewed as the absolute person, Purusa Narayana.[12] In Chapters 10 and 11 of the Bhagavad Gita, Krishna begins to instruct Arjuna about the directions of space-time within himself reflecting what is written in the Satapatha Brahmana and Purusa Sukta.[12] The vision of Krishna in his universal form shows the self-devouring nature of the absolute person, as described in the Satapatha Brahmana and Purusa Sukta.[12] Chapters 12 describes the two paths one chooses after one completes the Purushamedha yajna i.e. become a renunciate or remain as a householder.[12] Chapter 14 is the highest teaching within the Bhagavad Gita, the knowledge to achieve the same state as Purusa Narayana, which is the goal of the Purushamedha.[30]\\r\\nIn the epic Mahabharata, after Sanjayacounsellor of the Kuru king Dhritarashtrareturns from the battlefield to announce the death of Bhishma, he begins recounting the details of the Mahabharata war. Bhagavad Gita forms the content of this recollection.[31] The Gita begins before the start of the climactic Kurukshetra War, where the Pandava prince Arjuna is filled with doubt on the battlefield. Realising that his enemies are his own relatives, beloved friends, and revered teachers, he turns to his charioteer and guide, God Incarnate Lord Shri Krishna, for advice. Responding to Arjuna's confusion and moral dilemma, Krishna explains to Arjuna his duties as a warrior and prince, elaborating on a variety of philosophical concepts.[32]\\r\\nBhagavad Gita comprises 18 chapters (section 25 to 42)[33][web 2] in the Bhishma Parva of the epic Mahabharata and consists of 700 verses.[34] Because of differences in recensions, the verses of the Gita may be numbered in the full text of the Mahabharata as chapters 6.25ÿ42 or as chapters 6.23ÿ40.[web 3] According to the recension of the Gita commented on by Adi Shankara, a prominent philosopher of the Vedanta school, the number of verses is 700, but there is evidence to show that old manuscripts had 745 verses.[35] The verses themselves, composed with similes and metaphors, are poetic in nature. The verses mostly employ the range and style of the Sanskrit Anustubh metre (chhandas), and in a few expressive verses the Tristubh metre is used.[36]\\r\\nThe Sanskrit editions of the Gita name each chapter as a particular form of yoga. However, these chapter titles do not appear in the Sanskrit text of the Mahabharata.[web 3] Swami Chidbhavananda explains that each of the eighteen chapters is designated as a separate yoga because each chapter, like yoga, \\"trains the body and the mind\\". He labels the first chapter \\"Arjuna Vishada Yogam\\" or the \\"Yoga of Arjuna's Dejection\\".[37] Sir Edwin Arnold translates this chapter as \\"The Distress of Arjuna\\"[38]\\r\\nThe term dharma has a number of meanings.[45] Fundamentally, it means \\"what is right\\".[45] Early in the text, responding to Arjuna's despondency, Krishna asks him to follow his swadharma,[46][note 3] \\"the dharma that belongs to a particular man (Arjuna) as a member of a particular varna, (i.e., the kshatriya).\\"[46] Many traditional followers accept and believe that every man is unique in nature(svabhava) and hence svadharma for each and every individual is also unique and must be followed strictly with sole bhakthi and shraddha.[citation needed]\\r\\nAccording to Vivekananda:\\r\\nIf one reads this one Shloka, one gets all the merits of reading the entire Gita; for in this one Shloka lies imbedded the whole Message of the Gita.\\"[47]\\r\\n???????? ?? ??? ??? ????? ??????????????????? ? ???????? ????????????? ???????????????? ??????\\r\\nklaibhya? m sma gama? prtha naitattvayyupapadyate, k?udra? h?dayadaurbalya? tyaktvotti??ha para?tapa.\\r\\nDo not yield to unmanliness, O son of Prith.

(2.3)\\r\\nThe Bhagavad Gita is set in the narrative frame of the Mahabharata, which values heroism, \\"energy, dedication and self-sacrifice\\",[4] as the dharma, \\"holy duty\\"[48] of the Kshatriya (Warrior).[48][4][49] Axel Michaels in his book Hinduism: Past and Present writes that in the Bhagavad Gita, Arjuna is \\"exhorted by his charioteer, K?i?h?a, among others, to stop hesitating and fulfil his K?atriya (warrior) duty as a warrior and kill.\\"[4]\\r\\nAccording to Malinar, the dispute between the two parties in the Mahabharata centres on the question how to define \\"the law of heroism\\".[50][note 4] Malinar gives a description of the dharma of a Kshatriya (warrior) based on the Udyogaparvan, the fifth book of the Mahabharata:\\r\\nThis duty consists first of all in standing one's ground and fighting for status. The main duty of a warrior is never to submit to anybody. A warrior must resist any impulse to self-preservation that would make him avoid a fight. In brief, he ought to be a man (puruso bhava; cf. 5.157.6; 13;15). Some of the most vigorous formulations of what called the \\"heart\\" or the \\"essence\\" of heroism (ksatrahrdaya) come from the ladies of the family. They bare shown most unforgiving with regard to the humiliations they have gone through, the loss of their status and honour, not to speak of the shame of having a weak man in the house, whether husband, son or brother.[5][note 5]\\r\\nMichaels defines heroism as \\"power assimilated with interest in salvation\\".[51] According to Michaels:\\r\\nEven though the frame story of the Mahabharata is rather simple, the epic has an outstanding significance for Hindu heroism. The heroism of the Pandavas, the ideals of honor and courage in battle, are constant sources of treatises in which it is not sacrifice, renunciation of the world, or erudition that is valued, but energy, dedication and self-sacrifice. The Bhagavad Gita, inserted in the sixth book (Bhishmaparvan), and probably completed in the second century CE, is such a text, that is, a philosophical and theistic treatise, with which the Pandava is exhorted by his charioteer, Krishna, among others, to stop hesitating and fulfill his K?atriya (warrior) duty as a warrior and kill.[4]\\r\\nAccording to Malinar, \\"Arjuna's crisis and some of the arguments put forward to call him to action are connected to the debates on war and peace in the UdP [Udyoga Parva]\\".[52] According to Malinar, the UdP emphasises that one must put up with fate and, the BhG personalises the surrender one's personal interests to the power of destiny by \\"propagating the view that accepting and enacting the fatal course of events is an act of devotion to this god [Krsna] and his cause.\\"[52]\\r\\nThe eighteenth chapter of the Gita examines the relationship between svadharma and svabhava.[note 6][53] This chapter uses the gunas of Shankya philosophy to present a series of typologies, and uses the same term to characterise the specific activities of the four varnas, which are distinguished by the \\"gunas proceeding from their nature.\\"[53]\\r\\nAurobindo modernises the concept of dharma and svabhava by internalising it, away from the social order and its duties towards one's personal capacities, which leads to a radical individualism,[54] \\"finding the fulfilment of the purpose of existence in the individual alone.\\"[54] He deduced from the Gita the doctrine that \\"the functions of a man ought to be determined by his natural turn, gift, and capacities\\",[54] that the individual should \\"develop freely\\"[54] and thereby would be best able to serve society.[54]\\r\\nGandhi's view differed from Aurobindo's view.[55] He recognised in the concept of swadharma his idea of swadeshi, the idea that \\"man owes his service above all to those who are nearest to him by birth and situation.\\"[55] To him, swadeshi was \\"swadharma applied to one's immediate environment.\\"[56]\\r\\nThe first reference to dharma in the Bhagavad Gita occurs in its first verse, where Dhritarashtra refers to the Kurukshetra, the location of the battlefield, as the Field of Dharma, \\"The Field of Righteousness or Truth\\".[45] According to Fowler, dharma in this verse may refer to the sanatana dharma, \\"what Hindus understand as their religion, for it is a term that encompasses wide aspects of religious and traditional thought and is more readily used for \\"\\"religion\\".[45] Therefore, 'Field of action' implies the field of righteousness, where truth will eventually triumph.[45]\\r\\n\\"The Field of Dharma\\" is also called the \\"Field of action\\" by Sri Aurobindo, a freedom fighter and philosopher.[45] Sarvapalli Radhakrishnan, a philosopher and the second president of India, saw \\"The Field of Dharma\\" as the world (Bhavsagar), which is a \\"battleground for moral struggle\\".[57]\\r\\nUnlike any other religious scripture, the Bhagavad Gita broadcasts its message in the centre of the battlefield.[58] The choice of such an unholy ambience for the delivery of a philosophical discourse has been an enigma to many commentators.[web 25] Several modern Indian writers have interpreted the battlefield setting as an allegory of \\"the war within\\".[59]\\r\\nEknath Easwaran writes that the Gita's subject is \\"the war within, the struggle for self-mastery that every human being must wage if he or she is to emerge from life victorious\\",[60] and that \\"The language of battle is often found in the scriptures, for it conveys the strenuous, long, drawn-out campaign we must wage to free ourselves from the tyranny of the ego, the cause of all our suffering and sorrow.\\"[61]\\r\\nSwami Nikhilananda, takes Arjuna as an allegory of tman, Krishna as an allegory of Brahman, Arjuna's chariot as the body, and Dhritarashtra as the ignorance filled mind.[note 7]\\r\\nMohandas Karamchand Gandhi, in his commentary on the Gita,[62] interprets the battle as \\"an allegory in which the battlefield is the soul and Arjuna, man's higher impulses struggling against evil\\".[63]\\r\\nSwami Vivekananda also emphasised that the first discourse in the Gita related to the war could be taken allegorically.[64] Vivekananda further remarked,\\r\\nThis Kurukshetra War is only an allegory. When we sum up its esoteric significance, it means the war which is constantly going on within man between the tendencies of good and evil.[65]\\r\\nIn Aurobindo's view, Krishna was a historical figure, but his significance in the Gita is as a \\"symbol of the divine dealings with humanity\\",[66] while Arjuna typifies a \\"struggling human soul\\".[67] However, Aurobindo rejected the interpretation that the Gita, and the Mahabharata by extension, is \\"an allegory of the inner life, and has nothing to do with our outward human life and actions\\":[67]\\r\\n...?That is a view which the general character and the actual language of the epic does not justify and, if pressed, would turn the straightforward philosophical language of the Gita into a constant, laborious and somewhat puerile mystification?... the Gita is written in plain terms and professes to solve the great ethical and spiritual difficulties which the life of man raises, and it will not do to go behind this plain language and thought and wrest them to the service of our fancy. But there is this much of truth in the view, that the setting of the doctrine though not symbolical, is certainly typical.[67]\\r\\nSwami Chinmayananda writes:\\r\\nHere in the Bhagavad Gita, we find a practical handbook of instruction on how best we can re-organise our inner ways of thinking, feeling, and acting in our everyday life and draw from ourselves a larger gush of productivity to enrich the life around us, and to emblazon the subjective life within us.[68]\\r\\nOther scholars such as Steven Rosen, Laurie L. Patton and Stephen Mitchell have seen in the Gita a religious defense of the warrior class's (Kshatriya Varna) duty (svadharma), which is to conduct combat and war with courage and do not see this as only an allegorical teaching, but also a real defense of just war.[69][70]\\r\\nIndian independence leaders like Lala Lajpat Rai and Bal Gangadhar Tilak saw the Gita as a text which defended war when necessary and used it to promote war against the British Empire. Lajpat Rai wrote an article on the \\"Message of the Bhagavad Gita\\". He saw the main message as the bravery and courage of Arjuna to fight as a warrior.[71] Bal Gangadhar Tilak saw the Gita as defending killing when necessary for the betterment of society, such as, for example, the killing of Afzal Khan.[71]\\r\\nAccording to J. N. Farquhar:\\r\\n\\"Even the Gita was used to teach murder. Lies, deceit, murder, everything, it was argued, may be rightly used. How far the leaders really believed this teaching no man can say; but the younger men got filled with it, and many were only too sincere.\\"[72]\\r\\nLiberation or moksha in Vedanta philosophy is not something that can be acquired or reached. tman (Soul), the goal of moksha, is something that is always present as the essence of the self, and can be revealed by deep intuitive knowledge. While the Upanishads largely uphold such a monistic viewpoint of liberation, the Bhagavad Gita also accommodates the dualistic and theistic aspects of moksha. The Gita, while occasionally hinting at impersonal Brahman as the goal, revolves around the relationship between the Self and a personal God or Saguna Brahman. A synthesis of knowledge, devotion, and desireless action is given as a prescription for Arjuna's despondence; the same combination is suggested as a way to moksha.[73] Winthrop Sargeant further explains, \\"In the model presented by the Bhagavad Gؐt, every aspect of life is in fact a way of salvation.\\"[74]\\r\\nYoga in the Bhagavad Gita refers to the skill of union with the ultimate reality or the Absolute.[75] In his commentary, Zaehner says that the root meaning of yoga is \\"yoking\\" or \\"preparation\\"; he proposes the basic meaning \\"spiritual exercise\\", which conveys the various nuances in the best way.[76]\\r\\nSivananda's commentary regards the eighteen chapters of the Bhagavad Gita as having a progressive order, by which Krishna leads \\"Arjuna up the ladder of Yoga from one rung to another.\\"[77] The influential commentator Madhusudana Sarasvati divided the Gita's eighteen chapters into three sections of six chapters each. Swami Gambhirananda characterises Madhusudana Sarasvati's system as a successive approach in which Karma yoga leads to Bhakti yoga, which in turn leads to Gyaana yoga:[78][79]\\r\\nAs noted by various commentators, the Bhagavad Gita offers a practical approach to liberation in the form of Karma yoga. The path of Karma yoga upholds the necessity of action. However, this action is to be undertaken without any attachment to the work or desire for results. Bhagavad Gita terms this \\"inaction in action and action in inaction (4.18)\\". The concept of such detached action is also called Nishkam Karma, a term not used in the Gita.[80] Lord Krishna, in the following verses, elaborates on the role actions, performed without desire and attachment, play in attaining freedom from material bondage and transmigration:\\r\\nTo action alone hast thou a right and never at all to its fruits; let not the fruits of action be thy motive; neither let there be in thee any attachment to inaction\\r\\nFixed in yoga, do thy work, O Winner of wealth (Arjuna), abandoning attachment, with an even mind in success and failure, for evenness of mind is called yoga. (2.47ÿ8)[81]\\r\\nThe yogؐs, abandoning attachment, act with body, mind, intelligence, and even with the senses, only for the purpose of purification. (5.11)[web 26]\\r\\nMohandas Karamchand Gandhi writes, \\"The object of the Gita appears to me to be that of showing the most excellent way to attain self-realization\\", and this can be achieved by selfless action, \\"By desireless action; by renouncing fruits of action; by dedicating all activities to God, i.e., by surrendering oneself to Him body and soul.\\" Gandhi called the Gita \\"The Gospel of Selfless Action\\".[82] To achieve true liberation, it is important to control all mental desires and tendencies to enjoy sense pleasures. The following verses illustrate this:[83]\\r\\nWhen a man dwells in his mind on the object of sense, attachment to them is produced. From attachment springs desire and from desire comes anger.\\r\\nFrom anger arises bewilderment, from bewilderment loss of memory; and from loss of memory, the destruction of intelligence and from the destruction of intelligence he perishes. (2.62ÿ3)[83]\\r\\nThe introduction to chapter seven of the Bhagavad Gita explains bhakti as a mode of worship which consists of unceasing and loving remembrance of God. Faith (?raddh) and total surrender to a chosen God (Ishta-deva) are considered to be important aspects of bhakti.[84] Theologian Catherine Cornille writes, \\"The text [of the Gita] offers a survey of the different possible disciplines for attaining liberation through knowledge (Gyaana), action (karma), and loving devotion to God (bhakti), focusing on the latter as both the easiest and the highest path to salvation.\\"[85] M. R. Sampatkumaran, a Bhagavad Gita scholar, explains in his overview of Ramanuja's commentary on the Gita, \\"The point is that mere knowledge of the scriptures cannot lead to final release. Devotion, meditation, and worship are essential.\\"[86] Ramakrishna believed that the essential message of the Gita could be obtained by repeating the word Gita several times,[87] \\"'Gita, Gita, Gita', you begin, but then find yourself saying 'ta-Gi, ta-Gi, ta-Gi'. Tagi means one who has renounced everything for God.\\" In the following verses, Krishna elucidates the importance of bhakti:\\r\\nAnd of all yogins, he who full of faith worships Me, with his inner self abiding in Me, him, I hold to be the most attuned (to me in Yoga). (6.47)[88]\\r\\nFor one who worships Me, giving up all his activities unto Me and being devoted to Me without deviation, engaged in devotional service and always meditating upon Me, who has fixed his mind upon Me, O son of P?th, for him I am the swift deliverer from the ocean of birth and death. (12.6ÿ7)[web 27]\\r\\nRadhakrishnan writes that the verse 11.55 is \\"the essence of bhakti\\" and the \\"substance of the whole teaching of the Gita\\":[89]\\r\\nThose who make me the supreme goal of all their work and act without selfish attachment, who devote themselves to me completely and are free from ill will for any creature, enter into me.(11.55)[90]\\r\\nJnana yoga is the path of wisdom, knowledge, and direct experience of Brahman as the ultimate reality. The path renounces both desires and actions, and is therefore depicted as being steep and very difficult in the Bhagavad Gita. This path is often associated with the non-dualistic Vedantic belief of the identity of the tman with the Brahman. For the followers of this path, the realisation of the identity of tman and Brahman is held as the key to liberation.[91]\\r\\nWhen a sensible man ceases to see different identities, which are due to different material bodies, he attains to the Brahman conception. Thus he sees that beings are expanded everywhere. (13.31)[web 28]\\r\\nOne who knowingly sees this difference between the body and the owner of the body and can understand the process of liberation from this bondage, also attains to the supreme goal. (13.35)[web 29]\\r\\nThe Bhagavad Gita was first translated into English in the year 1785, by Charles Wilkins, on the orders of the Court of Directors of the East India Company, with special interest shown by Warren Hastings, the then Governor General of India. This edition had an introduction to the Gita by Warren Hastings. Soon the work was translated into other European languages such as German, French and Russian.\\r\\nIn 1849, the Weleyan Mission Press, Bangalore published The Bhagavat-Geeta, Or, Dialogues of Krishna and Arjoon in Eighteen Lectures, with Sanskrit, Canarese and English in parallel columns, edited by Rev.

It remains a popular text for commentators belonging to various philosophical schools. However, its composite nature also leads to varying interpretations of the text. In the words of Mysore Hiriyanna,\\r\\n[The Gita] is one of the hardest books to interpret, which accounts for the numerous commentaries on itÿeach differing from the rest in one essential point or the other.[93]\\r\\nRichard H. Davis cites Callewaert & Hemraj's 1982 count of 1891 BG translations in 75 languages, including 273 in English.[94][page?needed]\\r\\nThe oldest and most influential medieval commentary was that of Adi Shankara (788ÿ820 CE),[95] also known as Shankaracharya (Sanskrit: ?a?karcrya).[96][97] Shankara's commentary was based on a recension of the Gita containing 700 verses, and that recension has been widely adopted by others.[98]\\r\\nRamanujacharya's commentary chiefly seeks to show that the discipline of devotion to God (Bhakti yoga) is the way of salvation.[99]\\r\\nMadhva, a commentator of the Dvaita Vedanta school,[100] whose dates are given either as (1199ÿ1276 CE)[101] or as (1238ÿ1317 CE),[74] also known as Madhvacharya (Sanskrit: Madhvcrya), wrote a commentary on the Bhagavad Gita, which exemplifies the thinking of the \\"dualist\\" school.[96] Winthrop Sargeant quotes a dualistic assertion of the Madhva's school that there is \\"an eternal and complete distinction between the Supreme, the many souls, and matter and its divisions\\".[74] His commentary on the Gita is called Gita Bhshya. It has been annotated on by many ancient pontiffs of Dvaita Vedanta school like Padmanabha Tirtha, Jayatirtha, and Raghavendra Tirtha.[102]\\r\\nIn the Shaiva tradition,[103] the renowned philosopher Abhinavagupta (10ÿ11th century CE) has written a commentary on a slightly variant recension called Gitartha-Samgraha.\\r\\nOther classical commentators include\\r\\nAt a time when Indian nationalists were seeking an indigenous basis for social and political action, Bhagavad Gita provided them with a rationale for their activism and fight against injustice.[106] Among nationalists, notable commentaries were written by Bal Gangadhar Tilak and Mahatma Gandhi, who used the text to help inspire the Indian independence movement.[107][108] Tilak wrote his commentary Shrimadh Bhagvad Gita Rahasya while in jail during the period 1910ÿ1911 serving a six-year sentence imposed by the British colonial government in India for sedition.[109] While noting that the Gita teaches possible paths to liberation, his commentary places most emphasis on Karma yoga.[110] No book was more central to Gandhi's life and thought than the Bhagavad Gita, which he referred to as his \\"spiritual dictionary\\".[111] During his stay in Yeravda jail in 1929,[111] Gandhi wrote a commentary on the Bhagavad Gita in Gujarati. The Gujarati manuscript was translated into English by Mahadev Desai, who provided an additional introduction and commentary. It was published with a foreword by Gandhi in 1946.[112][113] Mahatma Gandhi expressed his love for the Gita in these words:\\r\\nI find a solace in the Bhagavadgؐt that I miss even in the Sermon on the Mount. When disappointment stares me in the face and all alone I see not one ray of light, I go back to the Bhagavadgؐt. I find a verse here and a verse there and I immediately begin to smile in the midst of overwhelming tragedies ÿ and my life has been full of external tragedies ÿ and if they have left no visible, no indelible scar on me, I owe it all to the teaching of Bhagavadgؐt.[114][115]\\r\\nAlthough Vivekananda did not write any commentaries on the Bhagavad Gita, his works contained numerous references to the Gita, such as his lectures on the four yogas ÿ Bhakti, Gyaana, Karma, and Raja.[116] Through the message of the Gita, Vivekananda sought to energise the people of India to claim their own dormant but strong identity.[117] Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay thought that the answer to the problems that beset Hindu society was a revival of Hinduism in its purity, which lay in the reinterpretation of Bhagavad Gita for a new India.[118] Aurobindo saw Bhagavad Gita as a \\"scripture of the future religion\\" and suggested that Hinduism had acquired a much wider relevance through the Gita.[119] Sivananda called Bhagavad Gita \\"the most precious jewel of Hindu literature\\" and suggested its introduction into the curriculum of Indian schools and colleges.[120] In the lectures Chinmayananda gave, on tours undertaken to revive of moral and spiritual values of the Hindus, he borrowed the concept of Gyaana yajna, or the worship to invoke divine wisdom, from the Gita.[121] He viewed the Gita as a universal scripture to turn a person from a state of agitation and confusion to a state of complete vision, inner contentment, and dynamic action. Teachings of International Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON), a Gaudiya Vaishnava religious organisation which spread rapidly in North America in the 1970s and 1980s, are based on a translation of the Gita called Bhagavad-Gؐt As It Is by A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada.[122]\\r\\nAmong notable modern commentators of the Bhagavad Gita are Bal Gangadhar Tilak, Vinoba Bhave, Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, Sri Aurobindo, Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan, Chinmayananda, etc. Chinmayananda took a syncretistic approach to interpret the text of the Gita.[123][124]\\r\\nParamahansa Yogananda's two volume commentary on the Bhagavad Gita, called God Talks With Arjuna: The Bhagavad Gita, was released 1995.[125]\\r\\nEknath Easwaran has also written a commentary on the Bhagavad Gita. It examines the applicability of the principles of Gita to the problems of modern life.[126]\\r\\nThe version by A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupda, entitled Bhagavad-gؐt As It Is, is \\"by far the most widely distributed of all English Gita translations.\\"[127] For each verse, he gives the verse in the Sanskrit Devanagari script, followed by a roman transliteration, a gloss for each word, and then a translation and commentary.[128] His publisher, the Bhaktivedanta Book Trust, estimates sales at twenty-three million copies, a figure which includes the original English edition and secondary translations into fifty-six other languages.[129]\\r\\nOther notable commentators include Jeaneane Fowler, Ithamar Theodor, Swami Parthasarathy, and Sadhu Vasvani.[130][131] In 1966, Maharishi Mahesh Yogi published a partial translation.[132]\\r\\nThe first English translation of the Bhagavad Gita was done by Charles Wilkins in 1785.[133][134] In 1981, Larson listed more than 40 English translations of the Gita, stating that \\"A complete listing of Gita translations and a related secondary bibliography would be nearly endless\\".[135]:514 He stated that \\"Overall?... there is a massive translational tradition in English, pioneered by the British, solidly grounded philologically by the French and Germans, provided with its indigenous roots by a rich heritage of modern Indian comment and reflection, extended into various disciplinary areas by Americans, and having generated in our time a broadly based cross-cultural awareness of the importance of the Bhagavad Gita both as an expression of a specifically Indian spirituality and as one of the great religious \\"classics\\" of all time.\\"[135]:518 Sanskrit scholar Barbara Stoler Miller produced a translation in 1986 intended to emphasise the poem's influence and current context within English Literature, especially the works of T.S.

In 1808, passages from the Gita were part of the first direct translation of Sanskrit into German, appearing in a book through which Friedrich Schlegel became known as the founder of Indian philology in Germany.[139] Swami Rambhadracharya released the first Braille version of the scripture, with the original Sanskrit text and a Hindi commentary, on 30 November 2007.[web 30] The former Turkish Scholar-Politician, Bulent Ecevit translated several Sanskrit scriptures, including the Gita, into Turkish.

According to Adluri and Bagchee, 19th century German indologists had an anti-Brahmanic stance,[143] due to their \\"Protestant suspicion of the Brahmans.\\"[144] They conceived of the Mahabharata as an Indo-Germanic war-epic in origin, to which layers of text were added by the later Brahmins, including the Bhagavad Gita.[145] This interpretation was fueled by the search for Germanic origins and identity, in which the Brahmins were anti-thetical to the pure Aryans.[146] According to Adluri and Bagchee, 20th century Indology professionalized, but remained anti-Brahmanic, though the anti-Brahmanism disappeared from sight and went \\"underground.\\"[147][note 8]\\r\\nWith the translation and study of the Bhagavad Gita by Western scholars beginning in the early 18th century, the Bhagavad Gita gained a growing appreciation and popularity.[web 1] According to the Indian historian and writer Khushwant Singh, Rudyard Kipling's famous poem \\"If\\" is \\"the essence of the message of The Gita in English.\\"[150]\\r\\nThe Bhagavad Gita has been highly praised, not only by prominent Indians including Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi and Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan,[151] but also by Aldous Huxley, Henry David Thoreau, J.

Commonly named among the Great American Novels, the work is among the first in major American literature to be written throughout in vernacular English, characterized by local color regionalism. It is told in the first person by Huckleberry \\"Huck\\" Finn, the narrator of two other Twain novels (Tom Sawyer Abroad and Tom Sawyer, Detective) and a friend of Tom Sawyer. It is a direct sequel to The Adventures of Tom Sawyer.\\r\\nThe book is noted for its colorful description of people and places along the Mississippi River. Set in a Southern antebellum society that had ceased to exist about 20 years before the work was published, Adventures of Huckleberry Finn is an often scathing satire on entrenched attitudes, particularly racism.\\r\\nPerennially popular with readers, Adventures of Huckleberry Finn has also been the continued object of study by literary critics since its publication. The book was widely criticized upon release because of its extensive use of coarse language.

Huck explains how he is placed under the guardianship of the Widow Douglas, who, together with her stringent sister, Miss Watson, are attempting to \\"sivilize\\" him and teach him religion. Finding civilized life confining, his spirits are raised somewhat when Tom Sawyer helps him to escape one night past Miss Watson's slave Jim, to meet up with Tom's gang of self-proclaimed \\"robbers.\\" Just as the gang's activities begin to bore Huck, he is suddenly interrupted by the reappearance of his shiftless father, \\"Pap\\", an abusive alcoholic. Knowing that Pap would only spend the money on alcohol, Huck is successful in preventing Pap from acquiring his fortune; however, Pap kidnaps Huck and leaves town with him.\\r\\nPap forcibly moves Huck to his isolated cabin in the woods along the Illinois shoreline. Because of Pap's drunken violence and imprisonment of Huck inside the cabin, Huck, during one of his father's absences, elaborately fakes his own death, escapes from the cabin, and sets off downriver. He settles comfortably, on Jackson's Island. Here, Huck reunites with Jim, Miss Watson's slave. Jim has also run away after he overheard Miss Watson planning to sell him \\"down the river\\" to presumably more brutal owners. Jim plans to make his way to the town of Cairo in Illinois, a free state, so that he can later buy the rest of his enslaved family's freedom. At first, Huck is conflicted about the sin and crime of supporting a runaway slave, but as the two talk in depth and bond over their mutually held superstitions, Huck emotionally connects with Jim, who increasingly becomes Huck's close friend and guardian. After heavy flooding on the river, the two find a raft (which they keep) as well as an entire house floating on the river (Chapter 9: \\"The House of Death Floats By\\"). Entering the house to seek loot, Jim finds the naked body of a dead man lying on the floor, shot in the back. He prevents Huck from viewing the corpse.[5]\\r\\nTo find out the latest news in town, Huck dresses as a girl and enters the house of Judith Loftus, a woman new to the area. Huck learns from her about the news of his own supposed murder; Pap was initially blamed, but since Jim ran away he is also a suspect and a reward for Jim's capture has initiated a manhunt. Mrs. Loftus becomes increasingly suspicious that Huck is a boy, finally proving it by a series of tests. Once he is exposed, she nevertheless allows him to leave her home without commotion, not realizing that he is the allegedly murdered boy they have just been discussing. Huck returns to Jim to tell him the news and that a search party is coming to Jackson's Island that very night. The two hastily load up the raft and depart.\\r\\nAfter a while, Huck and Jim come across a grounded steamship. Searching it, they stumble upon two thieves discussing murdering a third, but they flee before being noticed. They are later separated in a fog, making Jim intensely anxious, and when they reunite, Huck tricks Jim into thinking he dreamed the entire incident. Jim is not deceived for long, and is deeply hurt that his friend should have teased him so mercilessly. Huck becomes remorseful and apologizes to Jim, though his conscience troubles him about humbling himself to a black man.\\r\\nTraveling onward, Huck and Jim's raft is struck by a passing steamship, again separating the two. Huck is given shelter on the Kentucky side of the river by the Grangerfords, an \\"aristocratic\\" family. He befriends Buck Grangerford, a boy about his age, and learns that the Grangerfords are engaged in a 30-year blood feud against another family, the Shepherdsons. The Grangerfords and Shepherdsons go to the same church, which ironically preaches brotherly love. The vendetta finally comes to a head when Buck's older sister elopes with a member of the Shepherdson clan. In the resulting conflict, all the Grangerford males from this branch of the family are shot and killed, including Buck, whose horrific murder Huck witnesses. He is immensely relieved to be reunited with Jim, who has since recovered and repaired the raft.\\r\\nNear the Arkansas-Missouri-Tennessee border, Jim and Huck take two on-the-run grifters aboard the raft. The younger man, who is about thirty, introduces himself as the long-lost son of an English duke (the Duke of Bridgewater). The older one, about seventy, then trumps this outrageous claim by alleging that he himself is the Lost Dauphin, the son of Louis XVI and rightful King of France. The \\"duke\\" and \\"king\\" soon become permanent passengers on Jim and Huck's raft, committing a series of confidence schemes upon unsuspecting locals all along their journey. To divert suspicions from the public away from Jim, they pose him as recaptured slave runaway, but later paint him up entirely blue and call him the \\"Sick Arab\\" so that he can move about the raft without bindings.\\r\\nOn one occasion, the swindlers advertise a three-night engagement of a play called \\"The Royal Nonesuch\\". The play turns out to be only a couple of minutes' worth of an absurd, bawdy sham. On the afternoon of the first performance, a drunk called Boggs is shot dead by a gentleman named Colonel Sherburn; a lynch mob forms to retaliate against Sherburn; and Sherburn, surrounded at his home, disperses the mob by making a defiant speech describing how true lynching should be done. By the third night of \\"The Royal Nonesuch\\", the townspeople prepare for their revenge on the duke and king for their money-making scam, but the two cleverly skip town together with Huck and Jim just before the performance begins.\\r\\nIn the next town, the two swindlers then impersonate brothers of Peter Wilks, a recently deceased man of property. To match accounts of Wilks's brothers, the king attempts an English accent and the duke pretends to be a deaf-mute while starting to collect Wilks's inheritance. Huck decides that Wilks's three orphaned nieces, who treat Huck with kindness, do not deserve to be cheated thus and so he tries to retrieve for them the stolen inheritance. In a desperate moment, Huck is forced to hide the money in Wilks's coffin, which is abruptly buried the next morning. The arrival of two new men who seem to be the real brothers throws everything into confusion, so that the townspeople decide to dig up the coffin in order to determine which are the true brothers, but, with everyone else distracted, Huck leaves for the raft, hoping to never see the duke and king again. Suddenly, though, the two villains return, much to Huck's despair. When Huck is finally able to get away a second time, he finds to his horror that the swindlers have sold Jim away to a family that intends to return him to his proper owner for the reward. Defying his conscience and accepting the negative religious consequences he expects for his actions\\"All right, then, I'll go to hell!\\"Huck resolves to free Jim once and for all.\\r\\nHuck learns that Jim is being held at the plantation of Silas and Sally Phelps. The family's nephew, Tom, is expected for a visit at the same time as Huck's arrival, so Huck is mistaken for Tom and welcomed into their home. He plays along, hoping to find Jim's location and free him; in a surprising plot twist, it is revealed that the expected nephew is, in fact, Tom Sawyer. When Huck intercepts the real Tom Sawyer on the road and tells him everything, Tom decides to join Huck's scheme, pretending to be his own younger half-brother, Sid, while Huck continues pretending to be Tom. In the meantime, Jim has told the family about the two grifters and the new plan for \\"The Royal Nonesuch\\", and so the townspeople capture the duke and king, who are then tarred and feathered and ridden out of town on a rail.\\r\\nRather than simply sneaking Jim out of the shed where he is being held, Tom develops an elaborate plan to free him, involving secret messages, a hidden tunnel, snakes in a shed, a rope ladder sent in Jim's food, and other elements from adventure books he has read,[6] including an anonymous note to the Phelps warning them of the whole scheme. During the actual escape and resulting pursuit, Tom is shot in the leg, while Jim remains by his side, risking recapture rather than completing his escape alone. Although a local doctor admires Jim's decency, he has Jim arrested in his sleep and returned to the Phelps. After this, events quickly resolve themselves. Tom's Aunt Polly arrives and reveals Huck and Tom's true identities to the Phelps family. Jim is revealed to be a free man: Miss Watson died two months earlier and freed Jim in her will, but Tom (who already knew this) chose not to reveal this information to Huck so that he could come up with an artful rescue plan for Jim. Jim tells Huck that Huck's father (Pap Finn) has been dead for some time (he was the dead man they found earlier in the floating house), and so Huck may now return safely to St. Petersburg. Huck declares that he is quite glad to be done writing his story, and despite Sally's plans to adopt and civilize him, he intends to flee west to Indian Territory.\\r\\nAdventures of Huckleberry Finn explores themes of race and identity. A complexity exists concerning Jim's character. While some scholars point out that Jim is good-hearted, moral, and he is not unintelligent (in contrast to several of the more negatively depicted white characters), others have criticized the novel as racist, citing the use of the word \\"nigger\\" and emphasizing the stereotypically \\"comic\\" treatment of Jim's lack of education, superstition and ignorance.[7][8]\\r\\nThroughout the story, Huck is in moral conflict with the received values of the society in which he lives, and while he is unable to consciously refute those values even in his thoughts, he makes a moral choice based on his own valuation of Jim's friendship and Jim's human worth, a decision in direct opposition to the things he has been taught. Mark Twain, in his lecture notes, proposes that \\"a sound heart is a surer guide than an ill-trained conscience\\" and goes on to describe the novel as \\"...a book of mine where a sound heart and a deformed conscience come into collision and conscience suffers defeat\\".[9]\\r\\nTo highlight the hypocrisy required to condone slavery within an ostensibly moral system, Twain has Huck's father enslave his son, isolate him, and beat him. When Huck escapes, he then immediately encounters Jim \\"illegally\\" doing the same thing. The treatment both of them receive are radically different especially with an encounter with Mrs. Judith Loftus who takes pity on who she presumes to be a runaway apprentice, Huck, yet boasts about her husband sending the hounds after a runaway slave, Jim.[10]\\r\\nSome scholars discuss Huck's own character, and the novel itself, in the context of its relation to African-American culture as a whole. John Alberti quotes Shelley Fisher Fishkin, who writes in her 1990s book Was Huck Black?: Mark Twain and African-American Voices, \\"by limiting their field of inquiry to the periphery,\\" white scholars \\"have missed the ways in which African-American voices shaped Twain's creative imagination at its core.\\" It is suggested that the character of Huckleberry Finn illustrates the correlation, and even interrelatedness, between white and black culture in the United States.[11]\\r\\nThe original illustrations were done by E.W. Kemble, at the time a young artist working for Life magazine. Kemble was hand-picked by Twain, who admired his work. Hearn suggests that Twain and Kemble had a similar skill, writing that:\\r\\nWhatever he may have lacked in technical grace ... Kemble shared with the greatest illustrators the ability to give even the minor individual in a text his own distinct visual personality; just as Twain so deftly defined a full-rounded character in a few phrases, so too did Kemble depict with a few strokes of his pen that same entire personage.[12]\\r\\nAs Kemble could afford only one model, most of his illustrations produced for the book were done by guesswork. When the novel was published, the illustrations were praised even as the novel was harshly criticized. E.W. Kemble produced another set of illustrations for Harper's and the American Publishing Company in 1898 and 1899 after Twain lost the copyright.[13]\\r\\nTwain initially conceived of the work as a sequel to The Adventures of Tom Sawyer that would follow Huckleberry Finn through adulthood. Beginning with a few pages he had removed from the earlier novel, Twain began work on a manuscript he originally titled Huckleberry Finn's Autobiography. Twain worked on the manuscript off and on for the next several years, ultimately abandoning his original plan of following Huck's development into adulthood. He appeared to have lost interest in the manuscript while it was in progress, and set it aside for several years. After making a trip down the Hudson River, Twain returned to his work on the novel. Upon completion, the novel's title closely paralleled its predecessor's: Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Tom Sawyer's Comrade).[14]\\r\\nMark Twain composed the story in pen on notepaper between 1876 and 1883. Paul Needham, who supervised the authentication of the manuscript for Sotheby's books and manuscripts department in New York in 1991, stated, \\"What you see is [Clemens'] attempt to move away from pure literary writing to dialect writing\\". For example, Twain revised the opening line of Huck Finn three times. He initially wrote, \\"You will not know about me\\", which he changed to, \\"You do not know about me\\", before settling on the final version, \\"You don't know about me, without you have read a book by the name of 'The Adventures of Tom Sawyer'; but that ain't no matter.\\"[15] The revisions also show how Twain reworked his material to strengthen the characters of Huck and Jim, as well as his sensitivity to the then-current debate over literacy and voting.[16][17]\\r\\nA later version was the first typewritten manuscript delivered to a printer.[18]\\r\\nDemand for the book spread outside of the United States. Adventures of Huckleberry Finn was eventually published on December 10, 1884, in Canada and the United Kingdom, and on February 18, 1885, in the United States.[19] The illustration on page 283 became a point of issue after an engraver, whose identity was never discovered, made a last-minute addition to the printing plate of Kemble's picture of old Silas Phelps, which drew attention to Phelps' groin. Thirty thousand copies of the book had been printed before the obscenity was discovered. A new plate was made to correct the illustration and repair the existing copies.[20][21]\\r\\nIn 1885, the Buffalo Public Library's curator, James Fraser Gluck, approached Twain to donate the manuscript to the library. Twain did so. Later it was believed that half of the pages had been misplaced by the printer. In 1991, the missing first half turned up in a steamer trunk owned by descendants of Gluck's. The library successfully claimed possession and, in 1994, opened the Mark Twain Room to showcase the treasure.[22]\\r\\nIn relation to the literary climate at the time of the book's publication in 1885, Henry Nash Smith describes the importance of Mark Twain's already established reputation as a \\"professional humorist\\", having already published over a dozen other works. Smith suggests that while the \\"dismantling of the decadent Romanticism of the later nineteenth century was a necessary operation,\\" Adventures of Huckleberry Finn illustrated \\"previously inaccessible resources of imaginative power, but also made vernacular language, with its new sources of pleasure and new energy, available for American prose and poetry in the twentieth century.\\"[23]\\r\\nWhile it was clear that the publication of Adventures of Huckleberry Finn was controversial from the outset, Norman Mailer, writing in The New York Times in 1984, concluded that Twain's novel was not initially \\"too unpleasantly regarded.\\" In fact, Mailer writes: \\"the critical climate could hardly anticipate T. S. Eliot and Ernest Hemingway's encomiums 50 years later,\\" reviews that would remain longstanding in the American consciousness.[24]\\r\\nAlberti suggests that the academic establishment responded to the book's challenges both dismissively and with confusion. During Twain's time, and today, defenders of Adventures of Huckleberry Finn \\"lump all nonacademic critics of the book together as extremists and censors' thus equating the complaints about the book's coarseness' from the genteel bourgeois trustees of the Concord Public Library in the 1880s with more recent objections based on race and civil rights.\\"[11]\\r\\nUpon issue of the American edition in 1885 several libraries banned it from their shelves.[25] The early criticism focused on what was perceived as the book's crudeness. One incident was recounted in the newspaper the Boston Transcript:\\r\\nThe Concord (Mass.) Public Library committee has decided to exclude Mark Twain's latest book from the library. One member of the committee says that, while he does not wish to call it immoral, he thinks it contains but little humor, and that of a very coarse type. He regards it as the veriest trash. The library and the other members of the committee entertain similar views, characterizing it as rough, coarse, and inelegant, dealing with a series of experiences not elevating, the whole book being more suited to the slums than to intelligent, respectable people.[26]\\r\\nWriter Louisa May Alcott criticized the book's publication as well, saying that if Twain \\"[could not] think of something better to tell our pure-minded lads and lasses he had best stop writing for them\\".[27][28]\\r\\nTwain later remarked to his editor, \\"Apparently, the Concord library has condemned Huck as 'trash and only suitable for the slums.' This will sell us another twenty-five thousand copies for sure!\\"\\r\\nIn 1905, New York's Brooklyn Public Library also banned the book due to \\"bad word choice\\" and Huck's having \\"not only itched but scratched\\" within the novel, which was considered obscene. When asked by a Brooklyn librarian about the situation, Twain sardonically replied:\\r\\nI am greatly troubled by what you say. I wrote 'Tom Sawyer' & 'Huck Finn' for adults exclusively, & it always distressed me when I find that boys and girls have been allowed access to them. The mind that becomes soiled in youth can never again be washed clean. I know this by my own experience, & to this day I cherish an unappeased bitterness against the unfaithful guardians of my young life, who not only permitted but compelled me to read an unexpurgated Bible through before I was 15 years old. None can do that and ever draw a clean sweet breath again on this side of the grave.[29]\\r\\nMany subsequent critics, Ernest Hemingway among them, have deprecated the final chapters, claiming the book \\"devolves into little more than minstrel-show satire and broad comedy\\" after Jim is detained.[30] Although Hemingway declared, \\"All modern American literature comes from\\" Huck Finn, and hailed it as \\"the best book we've had\\", he cautioned, \\"If you must read it you must stop where the Nigger Jim is stolen from the boys  [sic]. That is the real end. The rest is just cheating.\\"[31][32] Pulitzer Prize winner Ron Powers states in his Twain biography (Mark Twain: A Life) that \\"Huckleberry Finn endures as a consensus masterpiece despite these final chapters\\", in which Tom Sawyer leads Huck through elaborate machinations to rescue Jim.[33]\\r\\nIn his introduction to The Annotated Huckleberry Finn, Michael Patrick Hearn writes that Twain \\"could be uninhibitedly vulgar\\", and quotes critic William Dean Howells, a Twain contemporary, who wrote that the author's \\"humor was not for most women\\". However, Hearn continues by explaining that \\"the reticent Howells found nothing in the proofs of Huckleberry Finn so offensive that it needed to be struck out\\".[34]\\r\\nMuch of modern scholarship of Huckleberry Finn has focused on its treatment of race. Many Twain scholars have argued that the book, by humanizing Jim and exposing the fallacies of the racist assumptions of slavery, is an attack on racism.[35] Others have argued that the book falls short on this score, especially in its depiction of Jim.[25] According to Professor Stephen Railton of the University of Virginia, Twain was unable to fully rise above the stereotypes of black people that white readers of his era expected and enjoyed, and, therefore, resorted to minstrel show-style comedy to provide humor at Jim's expense, and ended up confirming rather than challenging late-19th century racist stereotypes.[36]\\r\\nIn one instance, the controversy caused a drastically altered interpretation of the text: in 1955, CBS tried to avoid controversial material in a televised version of the book, by deleting all mention of slavery and omitting the character of Jim entirely.[37]\\r\\nBecause of this controversy over whether Huckleberry Finn is racist or anti-racist, and because the word \\"nigger\\" is frequently used in the novel (a commonly used word in Twain's time which has since become vulgar and taboo), many have questioned the appropriateness of teaching the book in the U.S. public school systemthis questioning of the word \\"nigger\\" is illustrated by a school administrator of Virginia in 1982 calling the novel the \\"most grotesque example of racism I've ever seen in my life\\".[38] According to the American Library Association, Huckleberry Finn was the fifth most frequently challenged book in the United States during the 1990s.[39]\\r\\nThere have been several more recent cases involving protests for the banning of the novel. In 2003, high school student Calista Phair and her grandmother, Beatrice Clark, in Renton, Washington, proposed banning the book from classroom learning in the Renton School District, though not from any public libraries, because of the word \\"nigger\\". Clark filed a request with the school district in response to the required reading of the book, asking for the novel to be removed from the English curriculum. The two curriculum committees that considered her request eventually decided to keep the novel on the 11th grade curriculum, though they suspended it until a panel had time to review the novel and set a specific teaching procedure for the novel's controversial topics.[40]\\r\\nIn 2009, a Washington state high school teacher called for the removal of the novel from a school curriculum. The teacher, John Foley, called for replacing Adventures of Huckleberry Finn with a more modern novel.[41] In an opinion column that Foley wrote in the Seattle Post Intelligencer, he states that all \\"novels that use the N-word' repeatedly need to go.\\" He states that teaching the novel is not only unnecessary, but difficult due to the offensive language within the novel with many students becoming uncomfortable at \\"just hear[ing] the N-word.\\" He views this change as \\"common sense,\\" with Obama's election into office as a sign that Americans \\"are ready for a change,\\" and that by removing these books from the reading lists, they would be following this change.[42]\\r\\nPublishers of the book have made their own attempts at easing the controversy by way of less-coarse publications. A 2011 edition of the book, published by NewSouth Books, replaced the word \\"nigger\\" with \\"slave\\" (although being incorrectly addressed to a freed man) and did not use the term \\"Injun.\\" Mark Twain scholar Alan Gribben said he hoped the edition would be more friendly for use in classrooms, rather than have the work banned outright from classroom reading lists due to its language.[43]\\r\\nAccording to publisher Suzanne La Rosa \\"At NewSouth, we saw the value in an edition that would help the works find new readers. If the publication sparks good debate about how language impacts learning or about the nature of censorship or the way in which racial slurs exercise their baneful influence, then our mission in publishing this new edition of Twain's works will be more emphatically fulfilled.\\"[44] Another scholar, Thomas Wortham, criticized the changes, saying the new edition \\"doesn't challenge children to ask, 'Why would a child like Huck use such reprehensible language?'\\"[45]\\r\\nIn 2016, Adventures of Huckleberry Finn was removed from a public school district in Virginia, along with the novel To Kill a Mockingbird, due to their use of racial slurs.[46][47]\\r\\nResponses to this include the publishing of The Hipster Huckleberry Finn which is an edition with the word \\"nigger\\" replaced with the word \\"hipster\\". The book's description includes this statement \\"Thanks to editor Richard Grayson, the adventures of Huckleberry Finn are now neither offensive nor uncool.\\"[48]","input":"Which came first huck finn or tom sawyer?"},{"output":"late 2006","context":"The baiji (Chinese: aU; pinyin: ?bijt~n?(help{info), Lipotes vexillifer, Lipotes meaning \\"left behind\\", vexillifer \\"flag bearer\\") is a functionally extinct species of freshwater dolphin formerly found only in the Yangtze River in China. Nicknamed \\"Goddess of the Yangtze\\" (simplified Chinese: W^; traditional Chinese: W^; pinyin: Chng Jing nshn) in China, the dolphin is also called Chinese river dolphin, Yangtze River dolphin, whitefin dolphin and Yangtze dolphin. It was regarded as the goddess of protection by local fishermen and boatmen in China (Zhou, 1991).[4] It is not to be confused with the Chinese white dolphin or the finless porpoise.\\r\\nThe baiji population declined drastically in decades as China industrialized and made heavy use of the river for fishing, transportation, and hydroelectricity. It has been credibly claimed, after surveys in the Yangtze River during the 1980s, that baiji could be the first dolphin species in history that humans have driven to extinction. A Conservation Action Plan for Cetaceans of the Yangtze River was approved by the Chinese Government in 2001.[5] Efforts were made to conserve the species, but a late 2006 expedition failed to find any baiji in the river. Organizers declared the baiji functionally extinct.[6] The baiji represents the first documented global extinction of a \\"megafaunal\\" vertebrate for over 50 years[7] since the demise of the Japanese sea lion and the Caribbean monk seal in the 1950s. It also signified the disappearance of an entire mammal family of river dolphins (Lipotidae).[7] The baiji's extinction would be the first recorded extinction of a well-studied cetacean species (it is unclear if some previously extinct varieties were species or subspecies) to be directly attributable to human influence.\\r\\nSwiss economist and CEO of the baiji.org Foundation, August Pfluger funded the expedition, in which an international team, taken in part from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the Fisheries Research Agency in Japan, searched for six weeks for signs of the dolphin. The search took place almost a decade after the last exploration in 1997, which turned up only 13 of the cetaceans.[8]\\r\\nIn August 2007, a Chinese man reportedly videotaped a large white animal swimming in the Yangtze.[9] Although it was tentatively confirmed that the animal on the video is probably a baiji,[10] the presence of only one or a few animals, particularly of advanced age, is not enough to save a functionally extinct species from true extinction. The last known living baiji was Qiqi (), who died in 2002. The World Wildlife Fund is calling for the preservation of any possible baiji habitat, in case the species is located and can be revived.[8]\\r\\nA related species from the Neogene is Parapontoporia.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBaiji were thought to breed in the first half of the year, the peak calving season being from February to April.[12] A 30% pregnancy rate was observed.[13] Gestation would last 10ÿ11 months, delivering one calf at a time; the interbirth interval was 2 years. Calves measured around 80ÿ90 centimetres (31ÿ35?in) at birth, and nursed for 8ÿ20 months.[14] Males reached sexual maturity at age four, females at age six.[14] Mature males were about 2.3 metres (7?ft 7?in) (7.5?ft) long, females 2.5 metres (8?ft 2?in), the longest specimen 2.7 metres (8?ft 10?in).[14] The animal weighed 135ÿ230 kilograms (298ÿ507?lb),[14] with a lifespan estimated at 24 years in the wild.[15] The Yangtze River Dolphin is pale blue to gray on the dorsal (back) side, and white on the ventral (belly) side. It has a long and slightly-upturned beak with 31ÿ36 conical teeth on either jaw. Its dorsal fin is low and triangular in shape and resembles a light-colored flag when the dolphin swims just below the surface of the murky Yangtze River, hence the name \\"white-flag\\" dolphin. It has smaller eyes compared to oceanic dolphins.[4]\\r\\nWhen escaping from danger, the baiji can reach 60?km/h (37?mph), but usually stays within 30 to 40?km/h (19 to 25?mph). Because of its poor vision, the baiji relies primarily on sonar for navigation.[16] The sonar system also plays an important role in socializing, predator avoidance, group coordination, and expressing emotions. Sound emission is focused and highly directed by the shape of the skull and melon. Peak frequencies of echolocation clicks are between 70?kHz and 100?kHz.[17]\\r\\nHistorically the baiji occurred along 1,700 kilometres (1,100?mi) of the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze from Yichang in the west to the mouth of the river, near to Shanghai, as well as in Poyang and Dongting lakes, and the smaller Qiantang river to the south. This had been reduced by several hundred kilometres both upstream and downstream, and was limited to the main channel of the Yangtze, principally the middle reaches between the two large tributary lakes, Dongting and Poyang.[18] Approximately 12% of the worlds human population lives and works within the Yangtze River catchment area, putting pressure on the river.[19] The construction of the Three Gorges Dam, along with other smaller damming projects, also led to habitat loss.\\r\\nFossil records suggest that the dolphin first appeared 25 million years ago and migrated from the Pacific Ocean to the Yangtze River 20 million years ago.[20] It was one of four species of dolphins known to have made fresh water their exclusive habitat. The other five species, including the boto and the La Plata dolphin, have survived in the Ro de la Plata and Amazon rivers in South America and the Ganges and Indus rivers on the Indian subcontinent.\\r\\nIt is estimated that there were 5,000 baiji when they were described in the ancient dictionary Erya circa 3rd century BC.\\r\\nIt is well known the river dolphins are not a natural group. Their mitochondrial genome reveals a split of two separate lineages, Platanista and Lipotes + (Inia + Pontoporia), having no sister relationship with each other, and the Platanista lineage is always within the odontocete clade instead of having a closer affinity to Mysticeti. The position of the Platanista is more basal, suggesting separate divergence of this lineage well before the other one. The Lipotes has a sister relationship with Inia + pontoporia, and they together formed the sister group to the Delphinoidea. This result strongly supports paraphyly of the classical river dolphins, and the nonplatanistoid river dolphins do represent a monophyletic grouping, with the Lipotidae as the sister taxa to (Iniidae + Pontoporiidae), and is well congruent with the studies based on short interspersed repetitive elements (SINEs).[21]\\r\\nLow values of haplotype diversity and nucleotide diversity were found for the baiji of the Yangtze River. The analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) supported a highlevel of overall genetic structure. The males having a higher genetic differentiation than the females suggested a significant female ÿbiased dispersal.[22]\\r\\nThe aquatic adaptations of the baiji and other cetaceans have happened slowly and can be linked to PSGs and/or other functional changes. Comparative genopic analyses have uncovered that the baiji have a slow molecular clock and molecular adaptations to their aquatic environment. This information leads scientists to conclude that a bottleneck must have occurred near the end of the last deglaciation, a time that coincided with rapid temperature decrease and a rise in eustatic sea level. Scientists have also looked into positively selected genes (PSGs) in the baiji genome which are used for DNA repair and response to DNA stimulus. These PSGs have not been found previously in any other mammal species. Pathways being used for DNA repair have been known to have a major impact on brain development and have been implicated in diseases including microcephaly. The slow down of the substitution rate among cetaceans may have been affected by the evolution of DNA damage pathways. Over time, river dolphins, including the baiji, have had a reduction in the size of their eyes and the acuity of their vision. This probably stems from poor visibility in fluvial and estuarine environments. When analyzing the baiji genome, scientists have found that there are four genes that have lost their function due to a frameshift mutation or premature stop codons. The baiji has the lowest single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) frequency reported thus far among mammals. This low frequency could be related to the relatively low rate of molecular evolution in cetaceans; however, considering that the decrease in the rate of molecular evolution in the baiji was not as great as the decrease in heterozygosity rate, it is likely that much if the low genetic diversity observed was caused by the precipitous decline in the total baiji population in recent decades and the associated breedings.[23]\\r\\nThe reconstructed demographic history over the last 100,000 years featured a continual population contraction through the last glacial maximum, a serious bottleneck during the last deglaciation, and sustained population growth after the eustatic sea level approached the current levels. The close correlation between population trends, regional temperatures, and eustatic sea levels suggest a dominant role for global and local climate changes in shaping the baiji's ancient population demography.[23]\\r\\nPer Chinese folklore, a beautiful young girl is said to have lived with her stepfather on the banks of the river Yangtze. He was evil, and a greedy man out for his own self-interest. One day, he took the girl on a boat, intending to sell her on the market. Out on the river, though, he became infatuated with her beauty and tried to take advantage of her. But she freed herself by plunging into the river whereupon a big storm came and sank the boat. After the storm had thus settled, people saw a beautiful dolphin swimming ÿ the incarnation of the girl ÿ which became known as the Goddess of the Yangtze. The baiji, in the region of Yangtze, is regarded as a symbol of peace and prosperity.[24]\\r\\nIn the 1950s, the population was estimated at 6,000 animals,[25] but declined rapidly over the subsequent five decades. Only a few hundred were left by 1970. Then the number dropped down to 400 by the 1980s and then to 13 in 1997 when a full-fledged search was conducted. Now the most endangered cetacean in the world, according to the Guinness Book of World Records, the baiji was last sighted in August 2004, though there was a possible sighting in 2007.[9] It is listed as an endangered species by the U.S. government under the Endangered Species Act. It is now thought to be extinct.\\r\\nThe World Conservation Union (IUCN) has noted the following as threats to the species: a period of hunting by humans during the Great Leap Forward, entanglement in fishing gear, the illegal practice of electric fishing, collisions with boats and ships, habitat loss, and pollution. Further studies have noted that a lack of information on the baiji's historical distribution or ecology, the environmental impact of the construction of the Three Gorges Dam on the living space of the baiji, and the failure to act for the protection of the baiji are also threats to the species.[26]\\r\\nDuring the Great Leap Forward, when traditional veneration of the baiji was denounced, it was hunted for its flesh and skin, and quickly became scarce.[27]\\r\\nAs China developed economically, pressure on the river dolphin grew significantly. Industrial and residential waste flowed into the Yangtze. The riverbed was dredged and reinforced with concrete in many locations. Ship traffic multiplied, boats grew in size, and fishermen employed wider and more lethal nets. Noise pollution caused the nearly blind animal to collide with propellers. Stocks of the dolphin's prey declined drastically in the late 20th century, with some fish populations declining to one thousandth of their pre-industrial levels.[28]\\r\\nA range of anthropogenic led causes (e.g. boat collisions, dam construction) which also threaten freshwater cetaceans in other river systems, have been implicated in the decline of the baiji population. However, the primary factor was probably unsustainable by-catch in local fisheries, which use rolling hooks, nets (gill nets and fyke nets) and electrofishing; similarly by-catch constitutes the principal cause of mortality in many populations of small cetaceans worldwide. Although there are relatively few data available on baiji mortality, at least half of all known baiji deaths in the 1970s and 1980s were caused by rolling hooks and other fishing gear, and electrofishing accounted for 40% of baiji deaths recorded during the 1990s. Unlike most historical-era extinctions of large-bodied animals, the baiji was the victim not of active persecution but of incidental mortality resulting from massive-scale human environmental impacts, primarily uncontrolled fishing.[29]\\r\\nIts extinction merely reflects the latest stage in the progressive ecological deterioration of the Yangtze region. In the 1970s and 1980s, an estimated half of baiji deaths were attributed to entanglement in fishing gear and nets. By the early 2000s, electric fishing was considered \\"the most important and immediate direct threat to the baiji's survival.\\"[27] Though outlawed, this fishing technique is widely and illegally practiced throughout China. The building of the Three Gorges Dam further reduced the dolphin's habitat and facilitated an increase in ship traffic; these were thought to make it extinct in the wild.\\r\\nThere are some scientists who have found that pollution has resulted in emerging diseases caused by paracitic infection in the Baiji population. The Baiji's reliance on aquatic environments could have resulted in interaction with both terrestrial and marine pathogen risks. Since the Baiji has a limited distribution endemic to the Yangtze River, the freshwater environment may have a higher pathogen level than marine waters (although systematic environmental studies have yet to be conducted). The pathogens in these waters could lead to viral infections that can result in epizootics, which has caused the deaths of thousands of marine mammals over the last twenty years. There have also been captured/killed individuals that have had helminth infestations in the stomach which leads scientists to believe that parasitic infections could be another cause of decline amongst the Baiji.[30]\\r\\nIt has been noted, however, that the declining geographical range that baiji have been spotted in is not connected to the population loss of baiji. A model provided by Yangtze fishing communities show that the baiji population was not connected by geographical range or fragmentation of location, as the baiji make long-term and periodic movements throughout several years. The movements of the baiji left the species unaffected by dwindling geographical range.[31]\\r\\nDuring the 1970s, China recognized the precarious state of the river dolphin. The government outlawed deliberate killing, restricted fishing, and established nature reserves.\\r\\nIn 1978, the Chinese Academy of Sciences established the Freshwater Dolphin Research Centre (iU칸z) as a branch of the Wuhan Institute of Hydrobiology. In the 1980s and 1990s, several attempts were made to capture dolphins and relocate them to a reserve. A breeding program would then allow the species to recover and be reintroduced to the Yangtze after conditions improve. However, capturing the rare, quick dolphins proved to be difficult, and few captives survived more than a few months.[27]\\r\\nThe first Chinese aquatic species protection organisation, the Baiji Dolphin Conservation Foundation of Wuhan (ΆaUTr), was founded in December 1996. It has raised 1,383,924.35 CNY (about 100,000 USD) and used the funds for in vitro cell preservation and to maintain the baiji facilities, including the Shishou Sanctuary that was flooded in 1998.\\r\\nSince 1992 five protected areas of the Yangtze have been designated as baiji reserves. Four were built in the main Yangtze channel where baiji are actively protected and fishing is banned: two national reserves (Shishou City and Xin-Luo) and two provincial (Tongling and Zhenjiang). In the past 20 years, five nature reserves have been established along the river. Imposing maximum prohibition of harmful and illegal fishing methods in the reserves might prolong the process of extinction of these cetaceans in the wild, but so far, the administrative measures taken in the reserves have not yet kept the baiji population from sharply declining. As humans continue to occupy the river and use the natural resources it provided , the question as to whether the river itself can reach a point later in the future to become a habitat for these species to live in once again remained, for the most part, unanswered by conversationalists. In Shishou, Hubei Province, and Tongling, Anhui Province, the two semi-natural reserves established in these regions aimed to build in an environment for the baiji, as well as another mammalian species, the finless porpoise, to breed. Through careful management, both these species not only survived, but did in fact reproduced successfully enough to provide some hope that the Baiji may be able to make a comeback.[44]\\r\\nThe fifth protected area is an isolated oxbow lake located off of the north bank of the river near to Shishou City: the Tian-e-Zhou Oxbow Semi-natural Reserve. Combined, these five reserves cover just over 350 kilometres (220?mi), about 1/3 of the baijis range, leaving two-thirds of the species' habitat unprotected.[19]\\r\\nAs well as these five protected areas there are also five \\"Protection Stations\\" in Jianli, Chenglingji, Hukou, Wuhu and Zhengjiang. These stations consist of two observers and a motorized fishing boat with the aim of conducting daily patrols, making observations and investigating reports of illegal fishing.[19]\\r\\nIn 2001 the Chinese government approved a Conservation Action Plan for Cetaceans of the Yangtze River. This plan re-emphasised the three measures identified at the 1986 workshop and was adopted as the national policy for the conservation of the Baiji. Despite all of these workshops and conventions little money was available in China to aid the conservation efforts. It has been estimated that US$1 million was needed to begin the project and maintain it for a further 3 years.[45]\\r\\nEfforts to save the mammals proved to be too little and too late. August Pfluger, chief executive of the Baiji.org Foundation, said, \\"The strategy of the Chinese government was a good one, but we didn't have time to put it into action.\\"[46] Furthermore, the conservation attempts have been criticized, as even with the international attention about the need for conservation for the baiji, the Chinese government did not \\"[make] any serious investment\\" to protect the baiji.[47]\\r\\nMost scientists agreed that the best course of action was an ex-situ effort working in parallel with an in situ effort. The deterioration of the Yangtze River had to be reversed to preserve the habitat. The ex-situ projects aimed to raise a large enough population over time so that some, if not all, of the dolphins could be returned to the Yangtze, so the habitat within the river had to be maintained anyway.\\r\\nThe Shishou Tian-e-Zhou is a 21-kilometre (13?mi) long, 2-kilometre (1.2?mi) wide oxbow lake located near Shishou City in Hubei Province. Shishou has been described as being \\"like a miniature Yangtze  possessing all of the requirements for a semi-natural reserve\\". From the designation as a national reserve in 1992 it has been intended to be used for not only the baiji but also the Yangtze finless porpoise. In 1990 the first finless porpoises were relocated to the reserve and since then have been surviving and reproducing well. As of April 2005 26 finless porpoises were known to live in the reserve. A baiji was introduced in December 1995, but died during the summer flood of 1996. To deal with these annual floods a dyke was constructed between the Yangtze and Shishou. Now water is controlled from a sluice gate located at the downstream mouth of the oxbow lake. It has been reported that since the installation of this sluice gate, water quality has declined since no annual transfer of nutrients can occur. Roughly 6,700 people live on the island within the oxbow lake and so some limited fishing is permitted.[19]\\r\\nThe success of Shishou with the porpoises and with migratory birds and other wetland fauna encouraged the local Wetlands Management Team to put forward an application to award the site Ramsar status.[48] It has also been noted that the site has incredible potential for ecotourism, which could be used to generate much needed revenue to improve the quality of the reserve. The necessary infrastructure does not currently exist to realize these opportunities.\\r\\nA baiji conservation dolphinarium was established at the Institute of Hydrobiology (IHB) in Wuhan in 1992. This was planned as a backup to any other conservation efforts by producing an area completely protected from any threats, and where the baiji could be easily observed. The site includes an indoor and outdoor holding pool, a water filtration system, food storage and preparation facilities, research labs and a small museum. The aim is to also generate income from tourism which can be put towards the baiji plight. The pools are not very large (25 metres (82?ft) arc [kidney shaped] x 7 metres (23?ft) wide x 3.5 metres (11?ft) deep, 10 metres (33?ft) diameter, 2 metres (6?ft 7?in) deep and 12 metres (39?ft) diameter, 3.5 metres (11?ft) deep) and so are not capable of holding many baijis at one time.\\r\\nDouglas Adams and Mark Carwardine documented their encounters with the endangered animals on their conservation travels for the BBC programme Last Chance to See. Through firsthand experience, they went to China, drinking Baiji beer and Baiji cola, staying in the Baiji Hotel and using Lipotes vexillifer toilet paper. They came across Baiji weighing scales and Baiji fertilizer. They met Qi Qi, the beautiful bluish-grey dolphin with a long, narrow, slightly upturned beak, a low triangular dorsal fin, broad flippers with tiny eyes. Qi-Qi was just a year old then, injured by fishing hooks in 1980 and taken into captivity to be nursed back to health. Out of the seven times Mark and Douglas had visited China, never did they encounter a wild and free Yangtze river dolphin. It is even more impossible now with the likelihood that Lipotes vexillfer may be the first cetacean to have been driven to extinction by human activity.[49] The book by the same name, published in 1990, included pictures of a captive specimen, a male named Qi Qi () that lived in the Wuhan Institute of Hydrobiology dolphinarium from 1980 to July 14, 2002. Discovered by a fisherman in Dongting Lake, he became the sole resident of the Baiji Dolphinarium (aUiAY) beside East Lake. A sexually mature female was captured in late 1995, but died after half a year in 1996 when the Tian-e-Zhou Oxbow Nature Reserve (f\`?sFDUT), which had contained only finless porpoises since 1990, was flooded.\\r\\nThe Xinhua News Agency announced on December 4, 2006 that no Chinese river dolphins were detected in a six-week survey of the Yangtze River conducted by 30 researchers. The failure of the Yangtze Freshwater Dolphin Expedition (simplified Chinese: ߷iUF; traditional Chinese: ߷iU?; pinyin: Chng Jing dnshu t~nli kҊoch) raised suspicions of the first unequivocal extinction of a cetacean species due to human action[50] (some extinct baleen whale populations might not have been distinct species). Poor water and weather conditions may have prevented sightings,[6] but expedition leaders declared it \\"functionally extinct\\" on December 13, 2006, as fewer are likely to be alive than are needed to propagate the species.[6] However, footage believed to be a baiji from August 2007 was released to the public.[10]\\r\\nThe Japanese sea lion and Caribbean monk seal disappeared in the 1950s, the last aquatic mammals to become extinct. Several land-based mammal species and subspecies have disappeared since then. If the baiji is now extinct, the vaquita has become the most endangered marine mammal species.\\r\\nSome scientists retain hope for the species:\\r\\nA report of the expedition was published online in the journal Biology Letters on August 7, 2007, in which the authors conclude \\"We are forced to conclude that the baiji is now likely to be extinct, probably due to unsustainable by-catch in local fisheries\\".[52]\\r\\n\\"Witness to Extinction: How We Failed To Save The Yangtze River Dolphin\\", an account of the 2006 baiji survey by Samuel Turvey, the lead author of the Biology Letters paper, was published by Oxford University Press in autumn 2008. This book investigated the baiji's probable extinction within the wider-scale context of how and why international efforts to conserve the species had failed, and whether conservation recovery programmes for other threatened species were likely to face similar potentially disastrous administrative hurdles.\\r\\nSome reports suggest that information about the baiji and its demise is being suppressed in China.[53] Other reports cite government media English language reports in China Central Television and Xinhua News Agency as evidence to the contrary.[54]\\r\\nIn August 2007, Zeng Yujiang reportedly videotaped a large white animal swimming in the Yangtze in Anhui Province.[9][55] Wang Kexiong of the Institute of Hydrobiology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences has tentatively confirmed that the animal on the video is a baiji.\\r\\nOn October 3, 2011 the sighting of almost 20 porpoises was reported in Chinese media. The sighting was done from a bridge in Nanjing city. It should be noted however, that the sighting has not been confirmed by independent media sources.[56]\\r\\nOn October 11, 2007, Chinese state media announced that under a development plan an additional 4,000,000 people will be relocated from their homes near the dam by the year 2020 due to ecological concerns, while a forum of officials and experts warned of a possible environmental catastrophe if preventive measures are not taken.[57][58][59] Currently, the quality of water in the Yangtze is falling rapidly, due to the dam's preventing dispersal of pollutants; algae blooms have risen progressively since the dams construction; and soil erosion has increased, causing riverbank collapses and landslides.[60] The report detailing this was officially released in September 2007.[61] Senior Chinese government officials and scholars said the dam could cause a huge disaster?... if steps are not taken promptly.[60] The same scholars and officials previously had defended the Three Gorges Dam project.[62] Xinhua also reported that tens of billions of yuan had been spent to prevent pollution and geological disasters by tree planting, measures to maintain species diversification, shutting down 1,500 polluting industrial and mining enterprises and building 70 sewage and waste treatment plants, all of which are \\"progressing well.\\" [62]\\r\\nIn October 2016 several news sources announced a recent sighting of what has been speculated to be a baiji.[63]","input":"When did the baiji river dolphin become extinct?"},{"output":"Worthington Christian High School","context":"Tyler Robert Joseph (born December 1, 1988) is an American singer, songwriter, multi-instrumentalist, record producer, and rapper.[6] He is the lead vocalist for the musical duo Twenty One Pilots.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nJoseph was born in Columbus, Ohio, and grew up with two brothers, Zack (also a singer) and Jay, and one sister, Madison.

The Belize Barrier Reef is a 300-kilometer (190?mi) long section of the 900-kilometer (560?mi) Mesoamerican Barrier Reef System, which is continuous from Canc~n on the north-eastern tip of the Yucatn Peninsula through the Riviera Maya and up to Honduras, making it the third largest coral reef system in the world after the Great Barrier Reef in Australia and the New Caledonian barrier reef in New Caledonia. It is Belize's top tourist destination, popular for scuba diving and snorkeling and attracting almost half of its 260,000 visitors. It is also vital to the country's fishing industry.[1]\\r\\nCharles Darwin described it as \\"the most remarkable reef in the West Indies\\" in 1842.\\r\\nIn addition to its barrier reef, it also boasts three distinct Caribbean atolls: Turneffe Atoll, Glover's Reef and Lighthouse Reef. Lighthouse Reef is the most easterly diving area in Belize, it is home to the Great Blue Hole, made famous by Jacques Cousteau in 1970; Turneffe Atoll lies directly to the east of Belize City and is the nearest of the atolls to the capital. These different reefs provide diverse scuba diving opportunities that include walls, pinnacles and reef flats that are located throughout an enormous area of sea.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Belize Barrier Reef is home to a large diversity of plants and animals?:\\r\\nWith 90% of the reef still needing to be researched, it is estimated that only 10% of all species have been discovered.[3]\\r\\nA large portion of the reef is protected by the Belize Barrier Reef Reserve System, which includes seven marine reserves, 450 cayes, and three atolls. It totals 960 square kilometres (370?sq?mi) in area, including:\\r\\nIn 1996 the Reserve System was designated a World Heritage Site due to its vulnerability and the fact that it contains the most important and significant natural habitats for in-situ conservation of biological diversity (according to criteria VII, IX, and X).\\r\\nBelize became the first country in the world to completely ban bottom trawling in December 2010.[4][5] In December 2015, Belize banned offshore oil drilling within 1?km of the Barrier Reef.[6]\\r\\nDespite these protective measures, the reef remains under threat from oceanic pollution as well as uncontrolled tourism, shipping, and fishing. Other threats include hurricanes, along with global warming and the resulting increase in ocean temperatures,[7] which causes coral bleaching. It is claimed by scientists that over 40% of Belize's coral reef has been damaged since 1998.[1]\\r\\nThe Belize Barrier Reef has been affected by mass-bleaching events. The first mass bleaching occurred in 1995, with an estimated mortality of 10 percent of coral colonies, according to a report by the Coastal Zone Management Institute in Belize. A second mass-bleaching event occurred, when Hurricane Mitch struck in 1998. Biologists observed a 48 percent reduction in live coral cover across the Belize reef system.\\r\\nUsually, it is hard to distinguish whether the reason for coral bleaching is human activities or natural reasons such as storms or bacterial fluctuations. But in the case of the Belize Barrier Reef, many factors which make the distinction difficult do not apply. Human population in this area is much more sparse than the corresponding areas near other coral reefs, so the human activity and pollution are much lower compared to other coral reefs and the Belize reef system is in a much more enclosed area.\\r\\nWhen coral bleaching occurs, a large part of the coral dies, and the remaining part of the ecosystem begins the process of repairing the damage. But the chances of recovery are low, as corals that are bleached become much more vulnerable to disease. Disease often kills more corals than the bleaching event itself. With continuous bleaching, the coral reef will have little to no chance of recovery.[8]\\r\\nGreen sea turtle with remora fish on its back\\r\\nClose-up view of the reef\\r\\nBarrier reef aerial\\r\\nSnorkeling the reef\\r\\nFan corals of the reef","input":"Where is the second largest barrier reef located?"},{"output":"28 March 2017","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe British one pound (S1) coin is a denomination of the pound sterling. Its obverse bears the Latin engraving ELIZABETH II D G REG Dei Gratia Regina meaning, Elizabeth II, by the grace of God, Queen and F D meaning Fidei defensor,[1] Defender of the Faith.[2] It has featured the profile of Queen Elizabeth II since the original coin's introduction on 21 April 1983.[3] Four different portraits of the Queen have been used, with the latest design by Jody Clark being introduced in 2015. The design on the reverse side of the current, 12-sided coin features four emblems to represent each of the nations of the United Kingdom ÿ the English rose, the leek for Wales, the Scottish thistle, and the shamrock for Northern Ireland ÿ emerging from a single stem within a crown. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe original, round S1 coin replaced the Bank of England S1 note, which ceased to be issued at the end of 1984 and was removed from circulation on 11 March 1988, though still redeemable at the Bank's offices, like all English banknotes. One-pound notes continue to be issued in Jersey, Guernsey and the Isle of Man, and by the Royal Bank of Scotland, but the pound coin is much more widely used. A new, dodecagonal (12-sided) design of coin was introduced on 28 March 2017 [4] and both new and old versions of the one pound coin circulated together until the older design was withdrawn from circulation on 15 October 2017. After that date, the older coin could only be redeemed at banks,[5] although some retailers announced they would continue to accept it for a limited time.[6] The original round pound remains legal tender on the Isle of Man.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe main purpose of redesigning the coin was to combat counterfeiting. As of March 2014 there were an estimated 1,553 million of the original nickel-brass coins in circulation,[8] of which the Royal Mint estimated in 2014 that just over 3% were counterfeit.[9][10] The new coin, in contrast, is bimetallic like the current S2 coin, and features an undisclosed hidden security feature called \\"iSIS\\" (Integrated Secure Identification Systems).[11][12]\\r\\n\\r\\nTo date, four different portraits of Elizabeth II have appeared on the obverse.

The fourth design, unveiled in March 2015,[14] expanded the inscription slightly to ELIZABETH II DEI.GRA.REG.FID.DEF. 2015.

The shield in its entirety was featured on the S1 coin. The coin's obverse remained unchanged.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe design of the reverse of the original coin was changed each year from 1983 to 2008 to show, in turn, an emblem representing the UK, Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland, and England, together with an appropriate edge inscription. This edge inscription could frequently be \\"upside-down\\" (when obverse is facing upward).[20] From 2008, national-based designs were still minted, but alongside the new standard version and no longer in strict rotation. The inscription ONE POUND appeared on all reverse designs.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn common with non-commemorative S2 coins, the round S1 coin (except 2004ÿ07 and the 2010ÿ11 \\"capital cities\\" designs) had a mint mark: a small crosslet found on the milled edge that represents Llantrisant in South Wales, where the Royal Mint has been based since 1968.[21]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe reverse of the new 12-sided, bimetallic pound coin, introduced on 28 March 2017,[4] was chosen by a public design competition.[22] The competition to design the reverse of this coin was opened in September 2014.[23] It was won in March 2015 by 15-year-old David Pearce from Walsall, and unveiled by Chancellor George Osborne during his Budget announcement. The design features a rose, leek, thistle and shamrock bound by a crown.[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nAll years except 1998 and 1999 have been issued into circulation, although the number issued has varied enormously ÿ 1983, 1984 and 1985 in particular had large mintages to facilitate the changeover from paper notes, while some years such as 1988 are only rarely seen (although 1988 is more noticeable as it has a unique reverse). Production since 1997 has been reduced, thanks to the introduction of the circulating two pound coin.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe final round coins minted for 2016 and the 2015 Shield of the Royal Arms 5th portrait did not enter circulation, as they were only available through commemorative sets.[31] These were the shield from the Royal Coat of Arms by Matthew Dent, and a design by Gregory Cameron, Bishop of St Asaph, of four heraldic beasts.[30][32]\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring later years of the round pound's use, Royal Mint surveys estimated the proportion of counterfeit S1 coins in circulation. This was estimated at 3.04% in 2013, a rise from 2.74%.[9][10] The figure previously announced in 2012 was 2.86%, following the prolonged rise from 0.92% in 2002ÿ2003 to 0.98% in 2004, 1.26% in 2005, 1.69% in 2006, 2.06% in 2007, 2.58% in 2008, 2.65% in 2009, 3.07% in 2010 and 3.09% in 2011.[34][35] Figures were generally reported in the following year; in 2008 (as reported in 2009), the highest levels of counterfeits were in Northern Ireland (3.6%) and the South East and London (2.97%), with the lowest being in Northwest England.[36][37][38] Coin testing companies estimated in 2009 that the actual figure was about twice the Mint's estimate, suggesting that the Mint was underplaying the figures so as not to undermine confidence in the coin.[39] It is illegal to pass on counterfeit currency knowingly; the official advice is to hand it in, with details of where received, to the police, who will retain it and investigate.[40][41] One article suggested \\"given that fake coins are worthless, you will almost certainly be better off not even looking\\".[39] The recipient also has recourse against the supplier in such cases.\\r\\n\\r\\nCounterfeits are put into circulation by dishonest people, then circulated inadvertently by others who are unaware; in many cases banks do not check, and circulate counterfeits. A 2011 BBC television programme withdrew 1,000 S1 coins from each of five major banks and found that each batch contained between 32 and 38 counterfeits; the Mint estimated that about 31 per 1,000 S1 coins were counterfeit.[40] Some of the counterfeits were found by automated machinery, others could be detected only by expert visual inspection.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn July 2010, following speculation that the Royal Mint would have to consider replacing S1 coins with a new design because of the fakes, bookmakers Paddy Power offered odds of 6/4 (bet S4 to win S6, plus the S4 stake back; decimal odds of 2.5), that the S1 coin would be removed from circulation.[37][42]\\r\\n\\r\\nSome counterfeits were of poor quality, with obviously visible differences  (less sharply defined, lacking intricate details, edge milling and markings visibly wrong). Many better counterfeits can be detected by comparing the orientation of the obverse and reversethey should match in genuine modern UK coins, but very often did not in counterfeit round S1.[40][41] The design on the reverse must be correct for the stamped year (e.g., a 1996 coin should have a Celtic cross).[43] It was difficult to manufacture round pounds with properly-produced edges; the milling (grooves) was often incomplete or poor and the inscription (often \\"DECUS ET TUTAMEN\\") sometimes poorly produced or in the wrong typeface.[40] A shiny coin with less wear than its date suggests is also suspect, although it may be a genuine coin that has rarely been used.[41]\\r\\n\\r\\nCounterfeit coins are made by different processes including casting, stamping, electrotyping, and copying with a pantograph or spark erosion.[44] In a 2009 survey, 99% of fake S1 coins found in cash centres were made of a nickel-brass, of which three fifths contained some lead and a fifth were of a very similar alloy to that used by the Royal Mint.  The remaining 1% were made of simple copper-zinc brass, or lead or tin, or both.[45] Those made of lead or tin may have a gold-coloured coating; counterfeits made of acrylic plastic containing metal powder to increase weight were occasionally found.[44]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe final 'round pounds' were minted in December 2015; the replacement, a new 12-sided design, was introduced in 2017[46], the earliest dated as 2016. The coin has a 12-edged shape, similar to the pre-decimal brass threepence coin; it has roughly the same size as the previous S1 coin, and is bi-metallic like most S2 coins. The new design is intended to make counterfeiting more difficult, and also has an undisclosed hidden security feature called \\"iSIS\\" (Integrated Secure Identification Systems).[22][47]\\r\\n\\r\\nCurrent two-pound coins, being bi-metallic (excluding some rarely tendered commemorative issues), remain harder to counterfeit than the round pound was; such counterfeits would often easily seen to have wrong colour(s).\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile the round pound was operational, others that entered circulation, although not legal tender, in the UK were some S1 coins of British Crown Dependencies, Gibraltar and UK South Atlantic Overseas Territories.  Most coins of these territories, in all denominations, were of the same size and composition as a UK equivalent and most bore the same portraits of the UK monarch.[48][49] None of these territories rushed to replace their round pound coins except Gibraltar after the UK did so, which continues to use gibraltarian pound coins as legal tender as well as the new UK pound coins.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn an April 1993 The New Yorker article \\"Real Britannia\\", Julian Barnes describes the meetings to choose the 1994ÿ1997 reverse designs.[50] This is reprinted in his book Letters from London as \\"Britannia's New Bra Size\\".","input":"When was the new 1 pound coin released?"},{"output":"Dominion of Canada","context":"","input":"Where did the north west mounted police live?"},{"output":"Memphis, Tennessee","context":"St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, founded in 1962, is a pediatric treatment and research facility focused on children's catastrophic diseases. The hospital costs about $2.4 million a day to run, and there is no cost to be treated.[1] It is located in Memphis, Tennessee, and is a nonprofit medical corporation designated as a 501(c)(3) tax-exempt organization by the Internal Revenue Service.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSt. Jude was founded by entertainer Danny Thomas in 1962, with help from Lemuel Diggs and close friend, Miami, Florida, automobile dealer Anthony Abraham, on the premise that \\"no child should die in the dawn of life\\".[3] This idea resulted from a promise that Thomas, a Maronite Catholic, had made to a saint years before the hospital was founded. Thomas was a comedian who was struggling to get a break in his career and living paycheck to paycheck. When his first child was about to be born, he attended Mass in Detroit and put his last $7.00 in the offering bin. He prayed to St. Jude Thaddeus for a means to provide for his family, and about a week later, he obtained a gig that paid 10 times what he had put in the offering bin. After that time, Thomas believed in the power of prayer. He promised St. Jude Thaddeus that if he made him successful, he would one day build him a shrine. Years later, Thomas became an extremely successful comedian and built St. Jude Childrens Research Hospital as a shrine to St. Jude Thaddeus to honor his promise.[4]\\r\\nIn 1957, Thomas founded the American Lebanese Syrian Associated Charities (ALSAC), which helped him realize his dream. ALSAC is also the fundraising organization of St. Jude. Since St. Jude opened its doors in 1962, ALSAC has had the responsibility of raising the necessary funds to keep the hospital open. Memphis was chosen at the suggestion of Roman Catholic Cardinal Samuel Stritch, a Tennessee native who had been a spiritual advisor to Thomas since he presided at Thomas's confirmation in Thomas's boyhood home of Toledo, Ohio.[5][6]\\r\\nAlthough it was named after Thomas's patron saint, St. Jude is not a Catholic hospital and is not affiliated with any religious organization.[7]\\r\\nIn late 2007, the Chili's Care Center opened on the St. Jude campus. Chili's restaurant chain has pledged to provide $50 million to fund the construction of the center. The seven-story Chili's Care Center will house 340,000 square feet (32,000?m2) and will add 24 labs and 16 beds to the campus. It will house the department of radiological services, The Pediatric Brain Tumor Consortium, two floors of outpatient clinics, one floor of inpatient clinics and rooms, two floors of laboratory space, an office floor and an unfinished level for future expansion.\\r\\nIn June 2008, Sterling Jewelers and St. Jude officially opened the new Kay Kafe (named after one of Sterling's jewelery chains), featuring a spacious lounge area, a significantly larger dining area and a variety of new dining options. More than ever, the cafeteria is the focal point of the campus where families and staff can escape and relax away from the treatment areas. The grand opening ceremony featured Marlo Thomas, national outreach director for St. Jude; Tony Thomas, member of the ALSAC/St. Jude Boards of Directors and Governors; Terry Burman, chairman of Sterling; Mark Light, CEO and president of Sterling; John P. Moses, CEO of ALSAC, the fundraising organization for St. Jude; Dr. William E. Evans, CEO of St. Jude; Joyce Aboussie, chair of the ALSAC Board of Directors, and Robert Breit, chair of the St. Jude Board of Governors.[8]\\r\\nIn 2014, the Marlo Thomas Center for Global Education and Collaboration was opened as part of the hospital.[9]\\r\\nDiscoveries at St. Jude have completely changed how doctors treat children with cancer and other catastrophic illnesses.[10][11] Since St. Jude was established, the survival rate for acute lymphoblastic leukemia, the most common type of childhood cancer, has increased from 4 percent in 1962 to 94 percent today.[11] During this time, the overall survival rate for childhood cancers has risen from 20 percent to 80 percent.[12] St. Jude has treated children from across the United States and from more than 70 countries. Doctors across the world consult with St. Jude on their toughest cases.[13] Also, St. Jude has an International Outreach Program to improve the survival rates of children with catastrophic illnesses worldwide through the transfer of knowledge, technology and organizational skills.[14]\\r\\nSt. Jude and over 46 of its staff members have been the recipients of numerous exemplary awards and achievements. For example, in 2010 St. Jude Children's Research Hospital was named the number one children's cancer hospital in the U.S by U.S. News & World Report.[15] It has also been named one of the top 10 companies to work for in academia by The Scientist for 7 successive years.[16] Most notably, Peter C. Doherty, Ph.D., of St. Jude Children's Research Hospital was co-recipient of the 1996 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for work related to how the immune system kills virus-infected cells.\\r\\nSt. Jude is associated with several affiliated hospitals around the nation to further its efforts beyond its own physical walls. The hospital uses its Domestic Affiliates Program to form this partnership with the other pediatric programs. This program is a network of hematology clinics, hospitals, and universities that are united under the mission of St. Jude.\\r\\nThese sites are used as a means of referring eligible patients to St. Jude as well as a location to administer some care. Through the Domestic Affiliates Program staff at St. Jude work together and collaborate with those at the other institutions. Affiliated sites are expected to comply with standards set by St. Jude and are audited to ensure proper and quality care.[17]\\r\\nCurrently the Domestic Affiliate Clinic sites include:\\r\\nSt. Jude also works closely with Le Bonheur Children's Medical Center, also located in downtown Memphis. St. Jude patients needing certain procedures, such as brain surgery, may undergo procedures at LeBonheur Hospital. Both St. Jude and Le Bonheur are teaching hospitals affiliated with the University of Tennessee Health Science Center. University of Tennessee physicians training in pediatrics, surgery, radiology, and other specialties undergo service rotations at St. Jude Hospital.\\r\\nThe Children's Cancer Center of Lebanon was established in Beirut on April 12, 2002. The center is an affiliate of St. Jude Children's Research Hospital and works in association with the American University of Beirut Medical Center (AUBMC).[19]\\r\\nFunding for St. Jude comes from many sources, including government grants and insurance recoveries, but the principal source of funding (64% average over the past seven years) is from the American Lebanese Syrian Associated Charities (ALSAC) - a semi-independent entity that raises funds using the name of St. Jude.[20] Of a dollar donated to the American Lebanese Syrian Associated Charities, about $0.52 makes its way through to St. Jude Children's Research Hospital (averaged over seven years). [20]\\r\\nAll medically eligible patients who are accepted for treatment at St. Jude are treated without regard to the family's ability to pay. St. Jude is one of a few pediatric research organizations in the United States where families never pay for treatments that are not covered by insurance, and families without insurance are never asked to pay. In addition to providing medical services to eligible patients, St. Jude also assists families with transportation, lodging, and meals. Three separate specially-designed patient housing facilities Tri Delta Place for short-term (up to one week), Ronald McDonald House for medium-term (one week to 3 months), and Target House for long-term (3 months or more)provide housing for patients and up to three family members, with no cost to the patient. These policies, along with research expenses and other costs, cause the hospital to incur more than $2.4 million in operating costs each day.[21]\\r\\nFrom 2000 to 2005, 83.7% of every dollar received by St. Jude went to the current or future needs of St. Jude. In 2002 to 2004, 47% of program expenses went to patient care and 41% to research.[22] As of 2012, 81 cents of every dollar donated to St. Jude goes directly to its research and treatment.[12]\\r\\nTo cover operating costs, ALSAC conducts many fund-raising events and activities. The FedEx St. Jude Classic, a PGA Tour event, is one of the most visible fund-raising events for the hospital. Other fund-raising programs include the St. Jude Math-A-Thon, Up 'til Dawn, direct mailings, radiothons and television marketing.\\r\\nSt. Jude also has a merchandise catalog called the Hope Catalog. The catalog contains everything from shirts to office items, and from patient art to \\"Give Thanks\\" wristbands.\\r\\nIn November 2004, St. Jude launched its inaugural Thanks and Giving campaign which encourages consumers to help raise funds at participating retailers by adding a donation at checkout or by purchasing specialty items to benefit St. Jude. The campaign is supported by network television spots, advertisements in major publications, interactive marketing on Yahoo! and a movie trailer that runs on 20,000 screens nationwide, runs from Thanksgiving until the New Year. The campaign was created by St. Jude National Outreach Director Marlo Thomas and her siblings Terre Thomas and Tony Thomas, children of hospital founder Danny Thomas. Customers nationwide are asked to help raise funds at participating retailers by adding a donation at check out or by purchasing specialty items to benefit St. Jude.\\r\\nCorporations such as Target, Best Buy, Domino's Pizza, the Williams-Sonoma family of brands, CVS/pharmacy, Kmart, Kay Jewelers, New York & Company, 7-Eleven, Inc., American Airlines, American Kiosk Management, AutoZone, Brooks Brothers, Busch Gardens, Casual Male XL, Catherines, Diane von Frstenberg, Dollar General, Easy Spirit, General Nutrition Centers, Gymboree, HSN, J. P. Morgan Chase, Marshall's, Alor, The Melting Pot, Memphis Grizzlies (NBA), Nine West, Rochester, Sag Harbor, Saks Fifth Avenue, SeaWorld, St. Louis Rams (NFL), West Elm, Westfield Shoppingtowns, and Yahoo! give customers a host of opportunities to support St. Jude.[23] The ultimate goal is to increase awareness with the hope that people will come to identify Thanksgiving with St. Jude, said Joyce Aboussie, vice chairwoman of the nonprofits board.[24] The official kick-off event for the Thanks and Giving campaign is the Give Thanks Walk. This event is a noncompetitive 5K that is now held in 75 cities across the country. Those participating in the race are encouraged to form teams, invite family and friends, and raise money for St. Jude. These walks have raised over $11 million to date.[25]\\r\\nOne of the hospital's most recent and successful fund-raising efforts has been the Dream Home Giveaway.\\"About St. Jude Dream Home Giveaway\\". St. Jude Children's Research Hospital. Retrieved 2008-01-29.? The giveaway allows contest entrants to reserve tickets for $100 each to qualify to win homes valued between $300,000 and $600,000. The Dream Home Giveaway, one of the largest national fund-raising programs, is conducted in cities across the United States.\\r\\nMany high schools around the country are creating student-led and student-run organizations called Team Up for St. Jude. These programs consist of high school students putting on events that raise funds and awareness for St. Jude while showing their school spirit. One of the main events is a letter writing campaign in which the students are sent pre-written letters that include stories of a patient and ask for donations. The high school students often have a \\"letter writing party\\" to address and send the letters to their family and friends asking them to support St. Jude.[26] Hoover High School (Hoover, AL) has a program that has brought in many fundraising ideas including \\"Team Up Week\\" which consists of prize wheels, inflatables, karaoke, cake walk, etc. to raise funds and awareness for the hospital.[27] Though this program is done on a much a smaller scale than the college program Up 'til Dawn, it has the potential to grow and increase awareness.\\r\\nAt various college campuses, some student organizations, fraternities and sororities raise funds in a program called Up 'til Dawn[28] Phi Mu Delta National Fraternity is partnered with St. Jude Children's Research Hospital. The fraternity's second core belief, \\"I Believe in Service... service to the college; service to every group organized for the common good; service to the individual. I believe in service defined in the terms of voluntary sacrifice for the welfare of those with whom I come in contact.\\" has helped shape many young men of admirable quality and exceptional character towards a dedication to St. Jude and other equally important causes.[29] Tau Kappa Epsilon (TKE) Fraternity partnered with St. Jude in the 1970s and 1980s to help raise money to fight childhood cancer. The fraternity renewed its link to St. Jude as its philanthropy of emphasis in 2008.[30][31] Saint Jude Founder Danny Thomas was a TKE in the Gamma-Nu chapter at the University of Toledo. \\"Tau Kappa Epsilon\\". stjude.org. Retrieved 2013-12-05.?\\r\\nSt. Jude is an International Philanthropic Project of Epsilon Sigma Alpha International, a co-ed service sorority. As of April 2013, ESA has raised more than $160 million in cash and pledges for St. Jude.[32][33]\\r\\nIn 1999, the Delta Delta Delta collegiate sorority formed a philanthropic partnership with St. Jude.[34] Tri Delta supports St. Jude nationally and supports cancer charities at a local level.[35] At the hospital in Memphis, the sorority donated the Teen Room for teenage patients to relax and spend time with each other. In July 2010, Tri Delta completed its \\"10 by 10\\" goal, raising over $10 million in less than four years, six years short of the original goal. Those funds were used to sponsor the Tri Delta Patient Care Floor in the Chilis Care Center. Upon completion of the \\"10 by 10\\" campaign, the sorority announced a new fundraising goal of $15 million in 5 years to name the Specialty Clinic located in the Patient Care Center.[36] Three and a half years later, Delta Delta Delta had raised $15 million and completed its goal ahead of schedule.[37] In July 2014, the on-campus residence center was renamed Tri Delta Place as a result of Tri Delta's pledge of $60 Million in 10 years.[38]\\r\\nIn July 2005, Kappa Alpha Psi (ʽ) fraternity announced St. Jude Childrens Research Hospital as its national philanthropic partner. Since that time, members across the country have joined in the fight against pediatric cancer, sickle cell disease, and other catastrophic illnesses. Kappa Alpha Psi has answered the call to service by raising more than $400,000representing the largest contribution that Kappa Alpha Psi has donated to any charity. Members of Kappa Alpha Psi have committed to raise $500,000 in support of the hospitals sickle cell program. St. Jude has one of the largest pediatric sickle cell research and treatment programs in the world. St. Jude is the first known hospital in the world to cure sickle cell disease through bone marrow transplantation. Today, bone marrow transplantation still offers the only cure for sickle cell disease. Members of Kappa Alpha Psi reach out to churches in their local communities to host a Sunday of Hope each January in support of St. Jude. January was selected because this is the month of Kappas founding. During the Sunday of Hope, churches will take up a special offering in honor of the patients and families of St. Jude. At the 2008 ALSAC/St. Jude Board and Awards Dinner, Kappa Alpha Psi received the Volunteer Group of the Year Award for their efforts in the inaugural year of the Sunday of Hope program which secured more than 130 churches to participate and raised more than $280,000.[39]\\r\\nLambda Theta Alpha sorority serves thousands of hours each year to a variety of philanthropic causes and needs. In the effort to create a more united and bigger impact nationally, Lambda Theta Alpha selected a national philanthropy. In January 2010, LTA became an official collegiate partner to St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, becoming the first individual Latino Greek organization to commit fully to the hospital's efforts. With this partnership, LTA provides our resources of community service and activism and more importantly, another direct link to the Hispanic community for St. Jude. LTA has pledged to raise awareness about childhood cancer and St. Jude in the Latin community, as well as fundraise for the hospital through a variety of events and programs.[40][41]\\r\\nPast events have included: sporting tournaments, charity galas, informational meetings, and much more.[41]\\r\\nAnother successful event is the Country Cares for St. Jude Kids radio-thon. During these events, country radio stations around the country allow those touched by St. Jude to share stories with listeners, highlighting patient stories, and having exciting promotions. Listeners are encouraged to call in and become a Partner In Hope by making either a one-time or monthly donation to the hospital. The 200 stations involved have helped raise over $400 million since 1989. Country artists have also supported St. Jude through concerts, hospital visits, call-ins, and other forms of support.[42]\\r\\nEagles for St. Jude is a program created during Stanford Financial Groups inaugural sponsorship year of the Stanford St. Jude Championship out of the desire to provide a season-long fundraising component to the Memphis PGA tournament.\\r\\nIn 1995, St. Jude received an anonymous letter postmarked in Dallas, Texas, containing a $1 million winning McDonald's Monopoly game piece. McDonald's officials came to the hospital, accompanied by a representative from the accounting firm Arthur Andersen, and verified it as a winner.[43] Although game rules prohibited the transfer of prizes, McDonald's waived the rule and has made the annual $50,000 annuity payments, even after learning that the piece was sent by an individual involved in an embezzlement scheme intended to defraud McDonald's.[44]\\r\\nSt. Jude Childrens Research celebrity visitors are individuals that are in the entertainment industry who visit the children in the hospital. Over the years, many celebrities such as musicians, political figures, actors and others have become involved with this foundation. Hollywood actors visit the hospital to meet some of the kids and try to get involved. Other celebrities have filmed commercials to encourage individuals to donate to St. Jude.

There is no region referred to as the \\"Great Plains\\" in The Atlas of Canada.[2] In terms of human geography, the term prairie is more commonly used in Canada, and the region is known as the Prairie Provinces or simply \\"the Prairies.\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe North American Environmental Atlas, produced by the Commission for Environmental Cooperation, a NAFTA agency composed of the geographical agencies of the Mexican, American, and Canadian governments, uses the \\"Great Plains\\" as an ecoregion synonymous with predominant prairies and grasslands rather than as physiographic region defined by topography.[3]  The Great Plains ecoregion includes five sub-regions: Temperate Prairies, West-Central Semi-Arid Prairies, South-Central Semi-Arid Prairies, Texas Louisiana Coastal Plains, and Tamaulipas-Texas Semi-Arid Plain, which overlap or expand upon other Great Plains designations.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe region is about 500?mi (800?km) east to west and 2,000?mi (3,200?km) north to south. Much of the region was home to American bison herds until they were hunted to near extinction during the mid/late-19th century. It has an area of approximately 500,000?sq?mi (1,300,000?km2). Current thinking regarding the geographic boundaries of the Great Plains is shown by this map at the Center for Great Plains Studies, University of NebraskaÿLincoln.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe term \\"Great Plains\\", for the region west of about the 96th and east of the Rocky Mountains, was not generally used before the early 20th century. Nevin Fenneman's 1916 study Physiographic Subdivision of the United States[5] brought the term Great Plains into more widespread usage. Before that the region was almost invariably called the High Plains, in contrast to the lower Prairie Plains of the Midwestern states.[6] Today the term \\"High Plains\\" is used for a subregion of the Great Plains.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Great Plains are the westernmost portion of the vast North American Interior Plains, which extend east to the Appalachian Plateau. The United States Geological Survey divides the Great Plains in the United States into ten physiographic subdivisions:\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Great Plains consist of a broad stretch of country underlain by nearly horizontal strata extends westward from the 97th meridian west to the base of the Rocky Mountains, a distance of from 300 to 500 miles (480 to 800?km). It extends northward from the Mexican boundary far into Canada. Although the altitude of the plains increases gradually from 600 or 1,200?ft (370?m) on the east to 4,000ÿ5,000 or 6,000 feet (1,800?m) near the mountains, the local relief is generally small. The semi-arid climate excludes tree growth and opens far-reaching views.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe plains are by no means a simple unit. They are of diverse structure and of various stages of erosional development. They are occasionally interrupted by buttes and escarpments. They are frequently broken by valleys. Yet on the whole, a broadly extended surface of moderate relief so often prevails that the name, Great Plains, for the region as a whole is well-deserved.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe western boundary of the plains is usually well-defined by the abrupt ascent of the mountains. The eastern boundary of the plains is more climatic than topographic. The line of 20 in. of annual rainfall trends a little east of northward near the 97th meridian. If a boundary must be drawn where nature presents only a gradual transition, this rainfall line may be taken to divide the drier plains from the moister prairies. The plains may be described in northern, intermediate, central and southern sections, in relation to certain peculiar features.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe northern section of the Great Plains, north of latitude 44, including eastern Montana, north-eastern Wyoming, most of North and South Dakota, and the Canadian Prairies, is a moderately dissected peneplain. \\r\\nThis is one of the best examples of its kind. The strata here are Cretaceous or early Tertiary, lying nearly horizontal. The surface is shown to be a plain of degradation by a gradual ascent here and there to the crest of a ragged escarpment, the escarpment-remnant of a resistant stratum. There are also the occasional lava-capped mesas and dike formed ridges, surmounting the general level by 500?ft (150?m) or more and manifestly demonstrating the widespread erosion of the surrounding plains. All these reliefs are more plentiful towards the mountains in central Montana. The peneplain is no longer in the cycle of erosion that witnessed its production. It appears to have suffered a regional uplift or increase in elevation, for the upper Missouri River and its branches no longer flow on the surface of the plain, but in well graded, maturely opened valleys, several hundred feet below the general level. A significant exception to the rule of mature valleys occurs, however, in the case of the Missouri, the largest river, which is broken by several falls on hard sandstones about 50 miles (80?km) east of the mountains. This peculiar feature is explained as the result of displacement of the river from a better graded preglacial valley by the Pleistocene ice sheet. Here, the ice sheet overspread the plains from the moderately elevated Canadian highlands far on the north-east, instead of from the much higher mountains near by on the west. The present altitude of the plains near the mountain base is 4,000?ft (1,200?m).[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe northern plains are interrupted by several small mountain areas. The Black Hills, chiefly in western South Dakota, are the largest group. They rise like a large island from the sea, occupying an oval area of about 100 miles (160?km) north-south by 50 miles (80?km) east-west. At Black Elk Peak, they reach an altitude of 7,216 feet (2,199?m) and have an effective relief over the plains of 2000 or 3,000?ft (910?m) This mountain mass is of flat-arched, dome-like structure, now well dissected by radiating consequent streams. The weaker uppermost strata have been eroded down to the level of the plains where their upturned edges are evenly truncated. The next following harder strata have been sufficiently eroded to disclose the core of underlying igneous and metamorphic crystalline rocks in about half of the domed area.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the intermediate section of the plains, between latitudes 44 and 42, including southern South Dakota and northern Nebraska, the erosion of certain large districts is peculiarly elaborate. Known as the Badlands, it is a minutely dissected form with a relief of a few hundred feet. This is due to several causes:\\r\\n\\r\\nThe central section of the Great Plains, between latitudes 42 and 36, occupying eastern Colorado and western Kansas, is, briefly stated, for the most part a dissected fluviatile plain. That is, this section was once smoothly covered with a gently sloping plain of gravel and sand that had been spread far forward on a broad denuded area as a piedmont deposit by the rivers which issued from the mountains. Since then, it has been more or less dissected by the erosion of valleys. The central section of the plains thus presents a marked contrast to the northern section. While the northern section owes its smoothness to the removal of local gravels and sands from a formerly uneven surface by the action of degrading rivers and their inflowing tributaries, the southern section owes its smoothness to the deposition of imported gravels and sands upon a previously uneven surface by the action of aggrading rivers and their outgoing distributaries. The two sections are also alike in that residual eminences still here and there surmount the peneplain of the northern section, while the fluviatile plain of the central section completely buried the pre-existent relief. Exception to this statement must be made in the southwest, close to the mountains in southern Colorado, where some lava-capped mesas (Mesa de Maya, Raton Mesa) stand several thousand feet above the general plain level, and thus testify to the widespread erosion of this region before it was aggraded.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe southern section of the Great Plains, between latitudes 35.5 and 25.5 lies in western Texas and eastern New Mexico. Like the central section, it is for the most part a dissected fluviatile plain. However, the lower lands which surround it on all sides place it in so strong relief that it stands up as a table-land, known from the time of Mexican occupation as the Llano Estacado. It measures roughly 150 miles (240?km) east-west and 400 miles (640?km) north-south. It is of very irregular outline, narrowing to the south. Its altitude is 5,500 feet (1,700?m) at the highest western point, nearest the mountains whence its gravels were supplied. From there, it slopes southeastward at a decreasing rate, first about 12?ft., then about 7?ft per mile (1.3 m/km), to its eastern and southern borders, where it is 2,000 feet (610?m) in altitude. Like the High Plains farther north, it is extraordinarily smooth.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is very dry, except for occasional shallow and temporary water sheets after rains. The Llano is separated from the plains on the north by the mature consequent valley of the Canadian River, and from the mountains on the west by the broad and probably mature valley of the Pecos River. On the east, it is strongly undercut by the retrogressive erosion of the headwaters of the Red, Brazos and Colorado rivers of Texas and presents a ragged escarpment approximately 500 to 800?ft (240?m) high, overlooking the central denuded area of that state. There, between the Brazos and Colorado rivers, occurs a series of isolated outliers capped by a limestone which underlies both the Llano Uplift on the west and the Grand Prairies escarpment on the east. The southern and narrow part of the table-land, called the Edwards Plateau, is more dissected than the rest, and falls off to the south in a frayed-out fault scarp. This scarp overlooks the coastal plain of the Rio Grande embayment. The central denuded area, east of the Llano, resembles the east-central section of the plains in exposing older rocks. Between these two similar areas, in the space limited by the Canadian and Red Rivers, rise the subdued forms of the Wichita Mountains in Oklahoma, the westernmost member of the Ouachita system.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the Cretaceous Period (145ÿ66 million years ago), the Great Plains were covered by a shallow inland sea called the Western Interior Seaway. However, during the Late Cretaceous to the Paleocene (65ÿ55 million years ago), the seaway had begun to recede, leaving behind thick marine deposits and a relatively flat terrain which the seaway had once occupied.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the Cenozoic era, specifically about 25 million years ago during the Miocene and Pliocene epochs, the continental climate became favorable to the evolution of grasslands. Existing forest biomes declined and grasslands became much more widespread.  The grasslands provided a new niche for mammals, including many ungulates and glires, that switched from browsing diets to grazing diets. Traditionally, the spread of grasslands and the development of grazers have been strongly linked. However, an examination of mammalian teeth suggests that it is the open, gritty habitat and not the grass itself which is linked to diet changes  in mammals, giving rise to the \\"grit, not grass\\" hypothesis.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nPaleontological finds in the area have yielded bones of mammoths, saber-toothed cats and other ancient animals,[9] as well as dozens of other megafauna (large animals over 100?lb?[45?kg]) ÿ such as giant sloths, horses, mastodons, and American lion ÿ that dominated the area of the ancient Great Plains for thousands to millions of years. The vast majority of these animals became extinct in North America at the end of the Pleistocene (around 13,000 years ago).[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn general, the Great Plains have a wide variety of weather through the year, with very cold and harsh winters and very hot and humid summers. Wind speeds are often very high, especially in winter. Grasslands are among the least protected biomes.[11] Humans have converted much of the prairies for agricultural purposes or to create pastures. The Great Plains have dust storms mostly every year or so.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 100th meridian roughly corresponds with the line that divides the Great Plains into an area that receive 20?in (510?mm) or more of rainfall per year and an area that receives less than 20?in (510?mm). In this context, the High Plains, as well as Southern Alberta, south-western Saskatchewan and Eastern Montana are mainly semi arid steppe land and are generally characterised by rangeland or marginal farmland. The region (especially the High Plains) is periodically subjected to extended periods of drought; high winds in the region may then generate devastating dust storms. The eastern Great Plains near the eastern boundary falls in the humid subtropical climate zone in the southern areas, and the northern and central areas fall in the humid continental climate.\\r\\n\\r\\nMany thunderstorms occur in the plains in the spring through summer. The southeastern portion of the Great Plains is the most tornado active area in the world and is sometimes referred to as Tornado Alley.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Great Plains are part of the floristic North American Prairies Province, which extends from the Rocky Mountains to the Appalachians.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first Americans (Paleo-Indians) who arrived to the Great Plains were successive indigenous cultures who are known to have inhabited the Great Plains for thousands of years, over 15,000 years ago.[12][13] Humans entered the North American continent in waves of migration, mostly over Beringia, the Bering Straits land bridge.\\r\\n\\r\\nHistorically the Great Plains were the range of the bison and of the culture of the Plains Indians, whose tribes included the Blackfoot, Crow, Sioux, Cheyenne, Arapaho, Comanche, and others. Eastern portions of the Great Plains were inhabited by tribes who lived in semi-permanent villages of earth lodges, such as the Arikara, Mandan, Pawnee and Wichita.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith the arrival of Francisco Vzquez de Coronado, a Spanish conquistador, the first recorded history of encounter between Europeans and Native Americans in the Great Plains occurred in Texas, Kansas and Nebraska from 1540 to 1542. In that same time period, Hernando de Soto crossed a west-northwest direction in what is now Oklahoma and Texas. Today this is known as the De Soto Trail. The Spanish thought the Great Plains were the location of the mythological Quivira and Cbola, a place said to be rich in gold.\\r\\n\\r\\nOver the next one hundred years, founding of the fur trade brought thousands of ethnic Europeans into the Great Plains. Fur trappers from France, Spain, Britain, Russia and the young United States made their way across much of the region, making regular contacts with Native Americans. After the United States acquired the Louisiana Purchase in 1803 and conducted the Lewis and Clark Expedition in 1804ÿ1806, more information about the Plains became available and various pioneers entered the areas.\\r\\n\\r\\nManuel Lisa, based in St. Louis, established a major fur trading site at his Fort Lisa on the Missouri River in Nebraska. Fur trading posts were often the basis of later settlements. Through the 19th century, more European Americans and Europeans migrated to the Great Plains as part of a vast westward expansion of population. New settlements became dotted across the Great Plains.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe new immigrants also brought diseases against which the Native Americans had no resistance. Between a half and two-thirds of the Plains Indians are thought to have died of smallpox by the time of the 1803 Louisiana Purchase.[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter 1870, the new railroads across the Plains brought hunters who killed off almost all the bison for their hides. The railroads offered attractive packages of land and transportation to European farmers, who rushed to settle the land. They (and Americans as well) also took advantage of the homestead laws to obtain free farms.  Land speculators and local boosters identified many potential towns, and those reached by the railroad had a chance, while the others became ghost towns. In Kansas, for example, nearly 5000 towns were mapped out, but by 1970 only 617 were actually operating.  In the mid-20th century, closeness to an interstate exchange determined whether a town would flourish or struggle for business.[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nMuch of the Great Plains became open range, or rangeland where cattle roamed free, hosting ranching operations where anyone was theoretically free to run cattle. In the spring and fall, ranchers held roundups where their cowboys branded new calves, treated animals and sorted the cattle for sale. Such ranching began in Texas and gradually moved northward. Between 1866 and 1895, cowboys herded 10 million cattle north to rail heads such as Dodge City, Kansas[17] and Ogallala, Nebraska; from there, cattle were shipped eastward.[18]\\r\\n\\r\\nMany foreign investors, especially British, financed the great ranches of the era. Overstocking of the range and the terrible winter of 1886 resulted in a disaster, with many cattle starved and frozen to death. Theodore Roosevelt, a rancher in the Dakotas, lost his entire investment; he returned east to reenter politics. From then on, ranchers generally raised feed to ensure they could keep their cattle alive over winter.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo allow for agricultural development of the Great Plains and house a growing population, the US passed the Homestead Acts of 1862: it allowed a settler to claim up to 160 acres (65?ha) of land, provided that he lived on it for a period of five years and cultivated it. The provisions were expanded under the Kinkaid Act of 1904 to include a homestead of an entire section. Hundreds of thousands of people claimed such homesteads, sometimes building sod houses out of the very turf of their land. Many of them were not skilled dryland farmers and failures were frequent. Much of the Plains were settled during relatively wet years. Government experts did not understand how farmers should cultivate the prairies and gave advice counter to what would have worked[citation needed]. Germans from Russia who had previously farmed, under similar circumstances, in what is now Ukraine were marginally more successful than other homesteaders. The Dominion Lands Act of 1871 served a similar function for establishing homesteads on the prairies in Canada.[19]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe railroads opened up the Great Plains for settlement, for now it was possible to ship wheat and other crops at low cost to the urban markets in the East, and Europe. Homestead land was free for American settlers. Railroads sold their land at cheap rates to immigrants in expectation they would generate traffic as soon as farms were established. Immigrants poured in, especially from Germany and Scandinavia. On the plains, very few single men attempted to operate a farm or ranch by themselves; they clearly understood the need for a hard-working wife, and numerous children, to handle the many chores, including child-rearing, feeding and clothing the family, managing the housework, feeding the hired hands, and, especially after the 1930s, handling paperwork and financial details.[20] During the early years of settlement, farm women played an integral role in assuring family survival by working outdoors. After approximately one generation, women increasingly left the fields, thus redefining their roles within the family. New technology including sewing and washing machines encouraged women to turn to domestic roles. The scientific housekeeping movement, promoted across the land by the media and government extension agents, as well as county fairs which featured achievements in home cookery and canning, advice columns for women regarding farm bookkeeping, and home economics courses in the schools.[21]\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough the eastern image of farm life in the prairies emphasized the isolation of the lonely farmer and wife, plains residents created busy social lives for themselves. They often sponsored activities that combined work, food and entertainment such as barn raisings, corn huskings, quilting bees,[22] Grange meetings, church activities and school functions. Women organized shared meals and potluck events, as well as extended visits between families.[23] The Grange was a nationwide farmers' organization, they reserved high offices for women, and gave them a voice in public affairs.[24]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe region roughly centered on the Oklahoma Panhandle, including southeastern Colorado, southwestern Kansas, the Texas Panhandle, and extreme northeastern New Mexico was known as the Dust Bowl during the late 1920s and early 1930s. The effect of an extended drought, inappropriate cultivation, and financial crises of the Great Depression, forced many farmers off the land throughout the Great Plains.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom the 1950s on, many areas of the Great Plains have become productive crop-growing areas because of extensive irrigation on large landholdings. The United States is a major exporter of agricultural products. The southern portion of the Great Plains lies over the Ogallala Aquifer, a huge underground layer of water-bearing strata dating from the last ice age. Center pivot irrigation is used extensively in drier sections of the Great Plains, resulting in aquifer depletion at a rate that is greater than the ground's ability to recharge.[25]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe rural Plains have lost a third of their population since 1920. Several hundred thousand square miles of the Great Plains have fewer than 6 inhabitants per square mile (2.3 inhabitants per square kilometer)the density standard Frederick Jackson Turner used to declare the American frontier \\"closed\\" in 1893. Many have fewer than 2 inhabitants per square mile (0.77 inhabitants per square kilometer). There are more than 6,000 ghost towns in the state of Kansas alone, according to Kansas historian Daniel Fitzgerald. This problem is often exacerbated by the consolidation of farms and the difficulty of attracting modern industry to the region. In addition, the smaller school-age population has forced the consolidation of school districts and the closure of high schools in some communities. The continuing population loss has led some to suggest that the current use of the drier parts of the Great Plains is not sustainable,[26] and there has been a proposal ÿ the \\"Buffalo Commons\\" ÿ to return approximately 139,000?sq?mi (360,000?km2) of these drier parts to native prairie land.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Great Plains contribute substantially to wind power in the United States. In July 2008, T. Boone Pickens, who developed wind farms after a long career as a petroleum executive, called for the U.S. to invest $1?trillion to build an additional 200,000?MW of wind power nameplate capacity in the Plains, as part of his Pickens Plan. Pickens cited Sweetwater, Texas as an example of economic revitalization driven by wind power development.[27][28][29]\\r\\n\\r\\nSweetwater was a struggling town typical of the Plains, steadily losing businesses and population, until wind turbines came to surrounding Nolan County.[30] Wind power brought jobs to local residents, along with royalty payments to landowners who leased sites for turbines, reversing the town's population decline. Pickens claims the same economic benefits are possible throughout the Plains, which he refers to as North America's \\"wind corridor.\\"","input":"What type of land is the great plains?"},{"output":"June 1975","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe ICC Cricket World Cup is the international championship of One Day International (ODI) cricket. The event is organised by the sport's governing body, the International Cricket Council (ICC), every four years, with preliminary qualification rounds leading up to a finals tournament. The tournament is one of the world's most viewed sporting events and is considered the \\"flagship event of the international cricket calendar\\" by the ICC.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first World Cup was organised in England in June 1975, with the first ODI cricket match having been played only four years earlier. However, a separate Women's Cricket World Cup had been held two years before the first men's tournament, and a tournament involving multiple international teams had been held as early as 1912, when a triangular tournament of Test matches was played between Australia, England and South Africa. The first three World Cups were held in England. From the 1987 tournament onwards, hosting has been shared between countries under an unofficial rotation system, with fourteen ICC members having hosted at least one match in the tournament.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe World Cup is open to all members of the International Cricket Council (ICC), although the highest-ranking teams receive automatic qualification. The remaining teams are determined via the World Cricket League and the ICC World Cup Qualifier. A total of twenty teams have competed in the eleven editions of the tournament, with fourteen competing in the latest edition in 2015; the next edition in 2019 will have only ten teams. Australia has won the tournament five times, with the West Indies, India (twice each), Pakistan and Sri Lanka (once each) also having won the tournament. The best performance by a non-full-member team came when Kenya made the semi-finals of the 2003 tournament.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first international cricket match was played between Canada and the United States, on 24 and 25 September 1844.[2] However, the first credited Test match was played in 1877 between Australia and England, and the two teams competed regularly for The Ashes in subsequent years. South Africa was admitted to Test status in 1889.[3] Representative cricket teams were selected to tour each other, resulting in bilateral competition. Cricket was also included as an Olympic sport at the 1900 Paris Games, where Great Britain defeated France to win the gold medal.[4] This was the only appearance of cricket at the Summer Olympics.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first multilateral competition at international level was the 1912 Triangular Tournament, a Test cricket tournament played in England between all three Test-playing nations at the time: England, Australia and South Africa. The event was not a success: the summer was exceptionally wet, making play difficult on damp uncovered pitches, and attendances were poor, attributed to a \\"surfeit of cricket\\".[5] Since then, international Test cricket has generally been organised as bilateral series: a multilateral Test tournament was not organised again until the triangular Asian Test Championship in 1999.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe number of nations playing Test cricket increased gradually over time, with the addition of West Indies in 1928, New Zealand in 1930, India in 1932, and Pakistan in 1952. However, international cricket continued to be played as bilateral Test matches over three, four or five days.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the early 1960s, English county cricket teams began playing a shortened version of cricket which only lasted for one day. Starting in 1962 with a four-team knockout competition known as the Midlands Knock-Out Cup,[7] and continuing with the inaugural Gillette Cup in 1963, one-day cricket grew in popularity in England. A national Sunday League was formed in 1969. The first One-Day International match was played on the fifth day of a rain-aborted Test match between England and Australia at Melbourne in 1971, to fill the time available and as compensation for the frustrated crowd. It was a forty over game with eight balls per over.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the late 1970s, Kerry Packer established the rival World Series Cricket (WSC) competition. It introduced many of the now commonplace features of One Day International cricket, including coloured uniforms, matches played at night under floodlights with a white ball and dark sight screens, and, for television broadcasts, multiple camera angles, effects microphones to capture sounds from the players on the pitch, and on-screen graphics. The first of the matches with coloured uniforms was the WSC Australians in wattle gold versus WSC West Indians in coral pink, played at VFL Park in Melbourne on 17 January 1979. The success and popularity of the domestic one-day competitions in England and other parts of the world, as well as the early One-Day Internationals, prompted the ICC to consider organising a Cricket World Cup.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe inaugural Cricket World Cup was hosted in 1975 by England, the only nation able to put forward the resources to stage an event of such magnitude at the time. The 1975 tournament started on 7 June.[10] The first three events were held in England and officially known as the Prudential Cup after the sponsors Prudential plc. The matches consisted of 60 six-ball overs per team, played during the daytime in traditional form, with the players wearing cricket whites and using red cricket balls.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nEight teams participated in the first tournament: Australia, England, India, New Zealand, Pakistan, and the West Indies (the six Test nations at the time), together with Sri Lanka and a composite team from East Africa.[12] One notable omission was South Africa, who were banned from international cricket due to apartheid. The tournament was won by the West Indies, who defeated Australia by 17 runs in the final at Lord's.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 1979 World Cup saw the introduction of the ICC Trophy competition to select non-Test playing teams for the World Cup,[13] with Sri Lanka and Canada qualifying.[14] The West Indies won a second consecutive World Cup tournament, defeating the hosts England by 92 runs in the final. At a meeting which followed the World Cup, the International Cricket Conference agreed to make the competition a quadrennial event.[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 1983 event was hosted by England for a third consecutive time. By this stage, Sri Lanka had become a Test-playing nation, and Zimbabwe qualified through the ICC Trophy. A fielding circle was introduced, 30 yards (27?m) away from the stumps. Four fieldsmen needed to be inside it at all times.[15] The teams faced each other twice, before moving into the knock-outs. India, an outsider, quoted at 66ÿ1 to win by bookmakers before the competition began, were crowned champions after upsetting the West Indies by 43 runs in the final.[9][16]\\r\\n\\r\\nIndia and Pakistan jointly hosted the 1987 tournament, the first time that the competition was held outside England. The games were reduced from 60 to 50 overs per innings, the current standard, because of the shorter daylight hours in the Indian subcontinent compared with England's summer.[17] Australia won the championship by defeating England by 7 runs in the final, the closest margin in World Cup final history.[18][19]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 1992 World Cup, held in Australia and New Zealand, introduced many changes to the game, such as coloured clothing, white balls, day/night matches, and a change to the fielding restriction rules. The South African cricket team participated in the event for the first time, following the fall of the apartheid regime and the end of the international sports boycott.[20] Pakistan overcame a dismal start in the tournament to eventually defeat England by 22 runs in the final and emerge as winners.[21]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 1996 championship was held in the Indian subcontinent for a second time, with the inclusion of Sri Lanka as host for some of its group stage matches.[22] In the semi-final, Sri Lanka, heading towards a crushing victory over India at Eden Gardens after the hosts lost eight wickets while scoring 120 runs in pursuit of 252, were awarded victory by default after crowd unrest broke out in protest against the Indian performance.[23] Sri Lanka went on to win their maiden championship by defeating Australia by seven wickets in the final at Lahore.[24]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1999 the event was hosted by England, with some matches also being held in Scotland, Ireland, Wales and the Netherlands.[25][26] Twelve teams contested the World Cup. Australia qualified for the semi-finals after reaching their target in their Super 6 match against South Africa off the final over of the match.[27] They then proceeded to the final with a tied match in the semi-final also against South Africa where a mix-up between South African batsmen Lance Klusener and Allan Donald saw Donald drop his bat and stranded mid-pitch to be run out. In the final, Australia dismissed Pakistan for 132 and then reached the target in less than 20 overs and with eight wickets in hand.[28]\\r\\n\\r\\nSouth Africa, Zimbabwe and Kenya hosted the 2003 World Cup. The number of teams participating in the event increased from twelve to fourteen. Kenya's victories over Sri Lanka and Zimbabwe, among others?ÿ and a forfeit by the New Zealand team, which refused to play in Kenya because of security concerns?ÿ enabled Kenya to reach the semi-finals, the best result by an associate.[29] In the final, Australia made 359 runs for the loss of two wickets, the largest ever total in a final, defeating India by 125 runs.[30][31]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2007 the tournament was hosted by the West Indies and expanded to sixteen teams.[32] Following Pakistan's upset loss to World Cup debutants Ireland in the group stage, Pakistani coach Bob Woolmer was found dead in his hotel room.[33] Jamaican police had initially launched a murder investigation into Woolmer's death but later confirmed that he died of heart failure.[34] Australia defeated Sri Lanka in the final by 53 runs (D/L) in farcical light conditions, and extended their undefeated run in the World Cup to 29 matches and winning three straight championships.[35]\\r\\n\\r\\nIndia, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh together hosted the 2011 Cricket World Cup. Pakistan were stripped of their hosting rights following the terrorist attack on the Sri Lankan cricket team in 2009, with the games originally scheduled for Pakistan redistributed to the other host countries.[36] The number of teams participating in the World Cup dropped down to fourteen.[37] Australia lost their final group stage match against Pakistan on 19 March 2011, ending an unbeaten streak of 35 World Cup matches, which had begun on 23 May 1999.[38] India won their second World Cup title by beating Sri Lanka by 6 wickets in the final in Mumbai, and became the first country to win the final on home soil.[37]\\r\\n\\r\\nAustralia and New Zealand jointly hosted the 2015 Cricket World Cup. The number of participants remained at fourteen. Ireland was the most successful Associate nation with a total of three wins in the tournament. New Zealand beat South Africa in a thrilling first semi-final to qualify for their maiden World Cup final. Australia defeated New Zealand by seven wickets in the final at Melbourne to lift the World Cup for the fifth time.[39]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Test-playing nations qualify automatically for the World Cup main event while the other teams have to qualify through a series of preliminary qualifying tournaments. A new qualifying format was introduced for the 2015 Cricket World Cup. The top two teams of the 2011ÿ13 ICC World Cricket League Championship qualify directly. The remaining six teams join the third and fourth-placed teams of 2011 ICC World Cricket League Division Two and the top two teams of the 2013 ICC World Cricket League Division Three in the World Cup Qualifier to decide the remaining two places.[40][41]\\r\\n\\r\\nQualifying tournaments were introduced for the second World Cup, where two of the eight places in the finals were awarded to the leading teams in the ICC Trophy.[13] The number of teams selected through the ICC Trophy had varied throughout the years. The World Cricket League (administered by the International Cricket Council) is the qualification system provided to allow the Associate and Affiliate members of the ICC more opportunities to qualify. The name \\"ICC Trophy\\" has been changed to \\"ICC World Cup Qualifier\\".[42]\\r\\n\\r\\nUnder the current qualifying process, the World Cricket League, all Associate and Affiliate members of the ICC are able to qualify for the World Cup. Associate and Affiliate members must play between two and five stages in the ICC World Cricket League to qualify for the World Cup finals, depending on the Division in which they start the qualifying process.\\r\\n\\r\\nProcess summary in chronological order (2011-2014):\\r\\n\\r\\nThe format of the Cricket World Cup has changed greatly over the course of its history. Each of the first four tournaments was played by eight teams, divided into two groups of four.[43] The competition consisted of two stages, a group stage and a knock-out stage. The four teams in each group played each other in the round-robin group stage, with the top two teams in each group progressing to the semi-finals. The winners of the semi-finals played against each other in the final. With South Africa returning in the fifth tournament in 1992 as a result of the end of the apartheid boycott, nine teams played each other once in the group phase, and the top four teams progressed to the semi-finals.[44] The tournament was further expanded in 1996, with two groups of six teams.[45] The top four teams from each group progressed to quarter-finals and semi-finals.\\r\\n\\r\\nA distinct format was used for the 1999 and 2003 World Cups. The teams were split into two pools, with the top three teams in each pool advancing to the Super 6.[46] The Super 6 teams played the three other teams that advanced from the other group. As they advanced, the teams carried their points forward from previous matches against other teams advancing alongside them, giving them an incentive to perform well in the group stages.[46] The top four teams from the Super 6 stage progressed to the semi-finals, with the winners playing in the final.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe format used in the 2007 World Cup involved 16 teams allocated into four groups of four.[47] Within each group, the teams played each other in a round-robin format. Teams earned points for wins and half-points for ties. The top two teams from each group moved forward to the Super 8 round. The Super 8 teams played the other six teams that progressed from the different groups. Teams earned points in the same way as the group stage, but carried their points forward from previous matches against the other teams who qualified from the same group to the Super 8 stage.[48] The top four teams from the Super 8 round advanced to the semi-finals, and the winners of the semi-finals played in the final.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe format used in the 2011 and 2015[49] World Cups featured two groups of seven teams, each playing in a round-robin format. The top four teams from each group proceeded to the knock out stage consisting of quarter-finals, semi-finals and ultimately the final.[50]\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is proposed that in 2019 World Cup, the number of teams participating will go down to 10 and all the teams will play against each other once in round robin format, before entering the semifinals. This would be similar to the one used in 1992 World Cup.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe ICC Cricket World Cup Trophy is presented to the winners of the World Cup. The current trophy was created for the 1999 championships, and was the first permanent prize in the tournament's history. Prior to this, different trophies were made for each World Cup.[51]  The trophy was designed and produced in London by a team of craftsmen from Garrard & Co over a period of two months.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe current trophy is made from silver and gilt, and features a golden globe held up by three silver columns. The columns, shaped as stumps and bails, represent the three fundamental aspects of cricket: batting, bowling and fielding, while the globe characterises a cricket ball.[52] The seam is tilted to symbolize the axial tilt of the Earth.  It stands 60?centimetres high and weighs approximately 11?kilograms. The names of the previous winners are engraved on the base of the trophy, with space for a total of twenty inscriptions. The ICC keeps the original trophy. A replica differing only in the inscriptions is permanently awarded to the winning team.[53]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe tournament is one of the world's most-viewed sporting events.[54] The 2011 Cricket World Cup final was televised in over 200 countries to over 2.2?billion television viewers.[55][56][57] Television rights, mainly for the 2011 and 2015 World Cup, were sold for over US$1.1?billion,[58] and sponsorship rights were sold for a further US$500?million.[59] The 2003 Cricket World Cup matches were attended by 626,845 people,[60] while the 2007 Cricket World Cup sold more than 672,000 tickets. The 2015 World Cup Sold over 1.1 million tickets which was a Record .[61][62]\\r\\n\\r\\nSuccessive World Cup tournaments have generated increasing media attention as One-Day International cricket has become more established. The 2003 World Cup in South Africa was the first to sport a mascot, Dazzler the zebra.[63] An orange mongoose known as Mello was the mascot for the 2007 Cricket World Cup.[64] Stumpy, a blue elephant was the mascot for the 2011 World Cup.[65]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 13 February, the opening of the 2015 tournament was celebrated with a Google Doodle.[66]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe International Cricket Council's executive committee votes for the hosts of the tournament after examining the bids made by the nations keen to hold a Cricket World Cup.[67]\\r\\n\\r\\nEngland hosted the first three competitions. The ICC decided that England should host the first tournament because it was ready to devote the resources required to organising the inaugural event.[10] India volunteered to host the third Cricket World Cup, but most ICC members preferred England as the longer period of daylight in England in June meant that a match could be completed in one day.[68] The 1987 Cricket World Cup was held in India and Pakistan, the first hosted outside England.[69]\\r\\n\\r\\nMany of the tournaments have been jointly hosted by nations from the same geographical region, such as South Asia in 1987, 1996 and 2011, Australasia in 1992 and 2015, Southern Africa in 2003 and West Indies in 2007.\\r\\n\\r\\nTwenty nations have qualified for the Cricket World Cup at least once. Seven teams have competed in every tournament, five of which have won the title.[9] The West Indies won the first two tournaments, Australia has won five, India has won two, while Pakistan and Sri Lanka have each won once. The West Indies (1975 and 1979) and Australia (1999, 2003 and 2007) are the only teams to have won consecutive titles.[9] Australia has played in seven of the eleven finals (1975, 1987, 1996, 1999, 2003, 2007, 2015). England has yet to win the World Cup, but has been runners-up three times (1979, 1987, 1992). The best result by a non-Test playing nation is the semi-final appearance by Kenya in the 2003 tournament; while the best result by a non-Test playing team on their debut is the Super 8 (second round) by Ireland in 2007.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nSri Lanka as a co-host of the 1996 Cricket World Cup was the first host to win the tournament though the final was held in Pakistan.[9] India won in 2011 as host and was the first team to win in a final played in their own country.[70] Australia repeated the feat in 2015.[39] England is the only other host to have made the final, in 1979. Other countries which have achieved or equalled their best World Cup results while co-hosting the tournament are New Zealand as finalists in 2015; Zimbabwe who reached the Super Six in 2003; and Kenya as semi-finalists in 2003.[9] In 1987, co-hosts India and Pakistan both reached the semi-finals, but were eliminated by Australia and England respectively.[9] Australia in 1992, England in 1999, South Africa in 2003, and Bangladesh in 2011 have been the host teams that were eliminated in the first round.\\r\\n\\r\\nAn overview of the teams' performances in every World Cup:\\r\\n\\r\\n?No longer exists.\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore the 1992 World Cup, South Africa was banned due to apartheid.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe number of wins followed by Run-rate is the criteria for determining the rankings till the 1987 World Cup.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe number of points followed by, head to head performance and then net run-rate is the criteria for determining the rankings for the World Cups from 1992 onwards.\\r\\n\\r\\nLegend\\r\\n\\r\\n?No longer exists.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe table below provides an overview of the performances of teams over past World Cups, as of the end of group stage of the 2015 tournament.

It took place simultaneously with the naval battle at Artemisium, in August or September 480 BC, at the narrow coastal pass of Thermopylae (\\"The Hot Gates\\"). The Persian invasion was a delayed response to the defeat of the first Persian invasion of Greece, which had been ended by the Athenian victory at the Battle of Marathon in 490 BC. Xerxes had amassed a huge army and navy, and set out to conquer all of Greece. The Athenian politician and general Themistocles had proposed that the allied Greeks block the advance of the Persian army at the pass of Thermopylae, and simultaneously block the Persian navy at the Straits of Artemisium.\\r\\nA Greek force of approximately 7,000 men marched north to block the pass in the middle of 480 BC. The Persian army, alleged by the ancient sources to have numbered over one million, but today considered to have been much smaller (various figures are given by scholars, ranging between about 100,000 and 150,000),[8][9] arrived at the pass in late August or early September. The vastly outnumbered Greeks held off the Persians for seven days (including three of battle) before the rear-guard was annihilated in one of history's most famous last stands. During two full days of battle, the small force led by Leonidas blocked the only road by which the massive Persian army could pass. After the second day, a local resident named Ephialtes betrayed the Greeks by revealing that a small path led behind the Greek lines. Leonidas, aware that his force was being outflanked, dismissed the bulk of the Greek army and remained to guard their retreat with 300 Spartans, 700 Thespians, and 400 Thebans, fighting to the death.\\r\\nThemistocles was in command of the Greek Navy at Artemisium when he received news that the Persians had taken the pass at Thermopylae. Since the Greek strategy required both Thermopylae and Artemisium to be held, given their losses, it was decided to withdraw to Salamis. The Persians overran Boeotia and then captured the evacuated Athens. The Greek fleetseeking a decisive victory over the Persian armadaattacked and defeated the invaders at the Battle of Salamis in late 480 BC. Fearful of being trapped in Europe, Xerxes withdrew with much of his army to Asia (losing most to starvation and disease), leaving Mardonius to attempt to complete the conquest of Greece. However, the following year saw a Greek army decisively defeat the Persians at the Battle of Plataea, thereby ending the Persian invasion.\\r\\nBoth ancient and modern writers have used the Battle of Thermopylae as an example of the power of a patriotic army defending its native soil. The performance of the defenders is also used as an example of the advantages of training, equipment, and good use of terrain as force multipliers and has become a symbol of courage against overwhelming odds.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe primary source for the Greco-Persian Wars is the Greek historian Herodotus. The Sicilian historian Diodorus Siculus, writing in the 1st century BC in his Bibliotheca historica, also provides an account of the Greco-Persian wars, partially derived from the earlier Greek historian Ephorus. This account is fairly consistent with Herodotus'.[10] The Greco-Persian wars are also described in less detail by a number of other ancient historians including Plutarch, Ctesias of Cnidus, and are referred to by other authors, as in Aeschylus in The Persians.\\r\\nArchaeological evidence, such as the Serpent Column (now in the Hippodrome of Constantinople), also supports some of Herodotus' specific claims.[11] George B. Grundy was the first modern historian to do a thorough topographical survey of the narrow pass at Thermopylae, and to the extent that modern accounts of the battle differ from Herodotus' they usually follow Grundy's.[12] For example, the military strategist Sir Basil Henry Liddell Hart defers to Grundy.[13] Grundy also explored Plataea and wrote a treatise on that battle.[14]\\r\\nOn the Battle of Thermopylae itself, two principal sources, Herodotus' and Simonides' accounts, survive.[15] In fact, Herodotus' account of the battle, in Book VII of his Histories, is such an important source that Paul Cartledge wrote: \\"we either write a history of Thermopylae with [Herodotus], or not at all\\".[16] Also surviving is an epitome of the account of Ctesias, by the eighth-century Byzantine Photias, though this is \\"almost worse than useless\\",[17] missing key events in the battle such as the betrayal of Ephialtes, and the account of Diodorus Siculus in his Universal History. Diodorus' account seems to have been based on that of Ephorus and contains one significant deviation from Herodotus' account: a supposed night attack against the Persian camp, of which modern scholars have tended to be skeptical.[18][19]\\r\\nThe Greek city-states of Athens and Eretria had encouraged the unsuccessful Ionian Revolt against the Persian Empire of Darius I in 499ÿ494 BC. The Persian Empire was still relatively young and prone to revolts amongst its subject peoples.[20][21] Darius, moreover, was a usurper and had spent considerable time extinguishing revolts against his rule.[20]\\r\\nThe Ionian revolt threatened the integrity of his empire, and Darius thus vowed to punish those involved, especially the Athenians, \\"since he was sure that [the Ionians] would not go unpunished for their rebellion\\".[22] Darius also saw the opportunity to expand his empire into the fractious world of Ancient Greece.[23] A preliminary expedition under Mardonius in 492 BC, to secure the land approaches to Greece, re-conquered Thrace and forced Macedon to become a client kingdom of Persia's.[24]\\r\\nDarius sent emissaries to all the Greek city-states in 491 BC asking for a gift of \\"earth and water\\" as tokens of their submission to him.[25] Having had a demonstration of his power the previous year, the majority of Greek cities duly obliged. In Athens, however, the ambassadors were put on trial and then executed by throwing them in a pit; in Sparta, they were simply thrown down a well.[25][26] This meant that Sparta was also effectively at war with Persia.[25]\\r\\nDarius thus put together an amphibious task force under Datis and Artaphernes in 490 BC, which attacked Naxos, before receiving the submission of the other Cycladic Islands. The task force then moved on Eretria, which it besieged and destroyed.[27] Finally, it moved to attack Athens, landing at the bay of Marathon, where it was met by a heavily outnumbered Athenian army. At the ensuing Battle of Marathon, the Athenians won a remarkable victory, which resulted in the withdrawal of the Persian army to Asia.[28]\\r\\nDarius, therefore, began raising a huge new army with which he meant to completely subjugate Greece; however, in 486 BC, his Egyptian subjects revolted, indefinitely postponing any Greek expedition.[21] Darius then died whilst preparing to march on Egypt, and the throne of Persia passed to his son Xerxes I.[29] Xerxes crushed the Egyptian revolt and very quickly restarted the preparations for the invasion of Greece.[30] Since this was to be a full-scale invasion, it required long-term planning, stockpiling, and conscription.[30] Xerxes decided that the Hellespont would be bridged to allow his army to cross to Europe, and that a canal should be dug across the isthmus of Mount Athos (rounding which headland, a Persian fleet had been destroyed in 492 BC).[31] These were both feats of exceptional ambition, which would have been beyond any other contemporary state.[31] By early 480 BC, the preparations were complete, and the army which Xerxes had mustered at Sardis marched towards Europe, crossing the Hellespont on two pontoon bridges.[32] According to Herodotus, Xerxes' army was so large that, upon arriving at the banks of the Echeidorus River, his soldiers proceeded to drink it dry. In the face of such imposing numbers, many Greek cities capitulated to the Persian demand for a tribute of earth and water.[33]\\r\\nThe Athenians had also been preparing for war with the Persians since the mid-480s BC, and in 482 BC the decision was taken, under the guidance of the Athenian politician Themistocles, to build a massive fleet of triremes that would be essential for the Greeks to fight the Persians.[34] However, the Athenians lacked the manpower to fight on both land and sea; therefore, combating the Persians would require an alliance of Greek city-states. In 481 BC, Xerxes sent ambassadors around Greece requesting \\"earth and water\\" but very deliberately omitting Athens and Sparta.[35] Support thus began to coalesce around these two leading states. A congress of city-states met at Corinth in late autumn of 481 BC,[36] and a confederate alliance of Greek city-states was formed. It had the power to send envoys to request assistance and dispatch troops from the member states to defensive points, after joint consultation. This was remarkable for the disjointed Greek world, especially since many of the city-states in attendance were still technically at war with each other.[37]\\r\\nThe \\"congress\\" met again in the spring of 480 BC. A Thessalian delegation suggested that the Greeks could muster in the narrow Vale of Tempe, on the borders of Thessaly, and thereby block Xerxes' advance.[38] A force of 10,000 hoplites was dispatched to the Vale of Tempe, through which they believed the Persian army would have to pass. However, once there, being warned by Alexander I of Macedon that the vale could be bypassed through Sarantoporo Pass and that Xerxes' army was overwhelming, the Greeks retreated.[39] Shortly afterwards, they received the news that Xerxes had crossed the Hellespont.[38]\\r\\nThemistocles, therefore, suggested a second strategy to the Greeks: the route to southern Greece (Boeotia, Attica, and the Peloponnesus) would require Xerxes' army to travel through the very narrow pass of Thermopylae, which could easily be blocked by the Greek hoplites, despite the overwhelming numbers of Persians.[40] Furthermore, to prevent the Persians from bypassing Thermopylae by sea, the Athenian and allied navies could block the straits of Artemisium. Congress adopted this dual-pronged strategy.[40] However, the Peloponnesian cities made fall-back plans to defend the Isthmus of Corinth, should it come to that, whilst the women and children of Athens had been evacuated en masse to the Peloponnesian city of Troezen.[41]\\r\\nThe Persian army seems to have made slow progress through Thrace and Macedon. News of the imminent Persian approach eventually reached Greece in August thanks to a Greek spy.[42] At this time of year the Spartans, de facto military leaders of the alliance, were celebrating the festival of Carneia. During the Carneia, military activity was forbidden by Spartan law; the Spartans had arrived too late at the Battle of Marathon because of this requirement.[43] It was also the time of the Olympic Games, and therefore the Olympic truce, and thus it would have been doubly sacrilegious for the whole Spartan army to march to war.[43][44] On this occasion, the ephors decided the urgency was sufficiently great to justify an advance expedition to block the pass, under one of its kings, Leonidas I. Leonidas took with him the 300 men of the royal bodyguard, the Hippeis.[45] This expedition was to try to gather as many other Greek soldiers along the way as possible and to await the arrival of the main Spartan army.[44]\\r\\nThe legend of Thermopylae, as told by Herodotus, has it that the Spartans had consulted the Oracle at Delphi earlier in the year. The Oracle is said to have made the following prophecy:\\r\\nO ye men who dwell in the streets of broad Lacedaemon!\\r\\nHonor the festival of the Carneia!! Otherwise,\\r\\nEither your glorious town shall be sacked by the children of Perseus,\\r\\nOr, in exchange, must all through the whole Laconian country\\r\\nHerodotus tells us that Leonidas, in line with the prophecy, was convinced he was going to certain death since his forces were not adequate for a victory, and so he selected only Spartans with living sons.[45]\\r\\nThe Spartan force was reinforced en route to Thermopylae by contingents from various cities and numbered more than 7,000 by the time it arrived at the pass.[47] Leonidas chose to camp at, and defend, the \\"middle gate\\", the narrowest part of the pass of Thermopylae, where the Phocians had built a defensive wall some time before.[48] News also reached Leonidas, from the nearby city of Trachis, that there was a mountain track which could be used to outflank the pass of Thermopylae. Leonidas stationed 1,000 Phocians on the heights to prevent such a manoeuvre.[49]\\r\\nFinally, in mid-August, the Persian army was sighted across the Malian Gulf approaching Thermopylae.[50] With the Persian army's arrival at Thermopylae the Greeks held a council of war.[51] Some Peloponnesians suggested withdrawal to the Isthmus of Corinth and blocking the passage to Peloponnesus.[51] The Phocians and Locrians, whose states were located nearby, became indignant and advised defending Thermopylae and sending for more help. Leonidas calmed the panic and agreed to defend Thermopylae.[51] According to Plutarch, when one of the soldiers complained that, \\"Because of the arrows of the barbarians it is impossible to see the sun\\", Leonidas replied, \\"Won't it be nice, then, if we shall have shade in which to fight them?\\"[52] Herodotus reports a similar comment, but attributes it to Dienekes.[53]\\r\\nXerxes sent a Persian emissary to negotiate with Leonidas. The Greeks were offered their freedom, the title \\"Friends of the Persian People\\", and the opportunity to re-settle on land better than that they possessed.[54] When Leonidas refused these terms, the ambassador carried a written message by Xerxes, asking him to \\"Hand over your arms\\". Leonidas' famous response was for the Persians to \\"Come and take them\\" (? ϫ?).[55] With the Persian embassy returning empty-handed, battle became inevitable. Xerxes delayed for four days, waiting for the Greeks to disperse, before sending troops to attack them.[56]\\r\\nThe number of troops which Xerxes mustered for the second invasion of Greece has been the subject of endless dispute, most notably between ancient sources, which report very large numbers, and modern scholars, who surmise much smaller figures. Herodotus claimed that there were, in total, 2.6 million military personnel, accompanied by an equivalent number of support personnel.[57] The poet Simonides, who was a near-contemporary, talks of four million; Ctesias gave 800,000 as the total number of the army that was assembled by Xerxes.[58]\\r\\nModern scholars tend to reject the figures given by Herodotus and other ancient sources as unrealistic and as resultant from miscalculations or exaggerations on the part of the victors.[59] Modern scholarly estimates are generally in the range 120,000ÿ300,000.[60]b[?] These estimates usually come from studying the logistical capabilities of the Persians in that era, the sustainability of their respective bases of operations, and the overall manpower constraints affecting them. Whatever the real numbers were, however, it is clear that Xerxes was anxious to ensure a successful expedition by mustering an overwhelming numerical superiority by land and by sea.[61] The number of Persian troops present at Thermopylae is therefore as uncertain as the number for the total invasion force. For instance, it is unclear whether the whole Persian army marched as far as Thermopylae, or whether Xerxes left garrisons in Macedon and Thessaly.\\r\\nAccording to Herodotus[47][62] and Diodorus Siculus,[63] the Greek army included the following forces:\\r\\nNotes:\\r\\nPausanias' account agrees with that of Herodotus (whom he probably read) except that he gives the number of Locrians, which Herodotus declined to estimate. Residing in the direct path of the Persian advance, they gave all the fighting men they had - according to Pausanias 6,000 men - which added to Herodotus' 5,200 would have given a force of 11,200.[67]\\r\\nMany modern historians, who usually consider Herodotus more reliable,[68] add the 1,000 Lacedaemonians and the 900 helots to Herodotus' 5,200 to obtain 7,100 or about 7,000 men as a standard number, neglecting Diodorus' Melians and Pausanias' Locrians.[69][70] However, this is only one approach, and many other combinations are plausible. Furthermore, the numbers changed later on in the battle when most of the army retreated and only approximately 3,000 men remained (300 Spartans, 700 Thespians, 400 Thebans, possibly up to 900 helots, and 1,000 Phocians stationed above the pass, less the casualties sustained in the previous days).[68]\\r\\nFrom a strategic point of view, by defending Thermopylae, the Greeks were making the best possible use of their forces.[71] As long as they could prevent a further Persian advance into Greece, they had no need to seek a decisive battle and could, thus, remain on the defensive. Moreover, by defending two constricted passages (Thermopylae and Artemisium), the Greeks' inferior numbers became less of a factor.[71] Conversely, for the Persians the problem of supplying such a large army meant they could not remain in the same place for very long.[72] The Persians, therefore, had to retreat or advance, and advancing required forcing the pass of Thermopylae.[72]\\r\\nTactically, the pass at Thermopylae was ideally suited to the Greek style of warfare.[71] A hoplite phalanx could block the narrow pass with ease, with no risk of being outflanked by cavalry. Moreover, in the pass, the phalanx would have been very difficult to assault for the more lightly armed Persian infantry.[71] The major weak point for the Greeks was the mountain track which led across the highland parallel to Thermopylae, that could allow their position to be outflanked. Although probably unsuitable for cavalry, this path could easily be traversed by the Persian infantry (many of whom were versed in mountain warfare).[73] Leonidas was made aware of this path by local people from Trachis, and he positioned a detachment of Phocian troops there in order to block this route.[74]\\r\\nIt is often claimed that at the time, the pass of Thermopylae consisted of a track along the shore of the Malian Gulf so narrow that only one chariot could pass through at a time.[48] In fact, as noted below, the pass was 100 metres wide, probably wider than the Greeks could have held against the Persian hordes. Herodotus reports that the Phocians had improved the defenses of the pass by channelling the stream from the hot springs to create a marsh, and it was a causeway across this marsh which was only wide enough for a single chariot to traverse. In a later passage, describing a Gaulish attempt to force the pass, Herodotus describes how the Gauls who fell into the marsh disappeared and were drowned.[citation needed]\\r\\nIt is also said that on the southern side of the track stood cliffs that overlooked the pass. However, a glance at any photograph of the pass shows there are no cliffs, only steep slopes covered in thorny bushes and trees. Although no obstacle to individuals, such terrain would not be passable by an army and its baggage train.[citation needed]\\r\\nOn the north side of the roadway was the Malian Gulf, into which the land shelved gently. When the Gauls attempted to force the pass, the shallowness of the water gave the Greek fleet great difficulty getting close enough to the fighting to bombard the Gauls with ship-borne missile weapons.\\r\\nAlong the path itself was a series of three constrictions, or \\"gates\\" (pylai), and at the center gate a short wall that had been erected by the Phocians, in the previous century, to aid in their defense against Thessalian invasions.[48] The name \\"Hot Gates\\" comes from the hot springs that were located there.[75]\\r\\nThe terrain of the battlefield was nothing that Xerxes and his forces were accustomed to. Although coming from a mountainous country, the Persians were not prepared for the real nature of the country they had invaded. The pure ruggedness of this area is caused by torrential downpours for four months of the year, combined with an intense summer season of scorching heat that cracks the ground. Vegetation is scarce and consists of low, thorny shrubs. The hillsides along the pass are covered in thick brush, with some plants reaching 10 feet (3.0?m) high. With the sea on one side and steep, impassable hills on the other, King Leonidas and his men chose the perfect topographical position to battle the Persian invaders.[76]\\r\\nToday, the pass is not near the sea, but is several kilometres inland because of sedimentation in the Malian Gulf. The old track appears at the foot of the hills around the plain, flanked by a modern road. Recent core samples indicate that the pass was only 100 metres (330?ft) wide, and the waters came up to the gates: \\"Little do the visitors realize that the battle took place across the road from the monument.\\"[77] The pass still is a natural defensive position to modern armies, and British Commonwealth forces in World War II made a defense in 1941 against the Nazi invasion metres from the original battlefield.[citation needed]\\r\\nOn the fifth day after the Persian arrival at Thermopylae and the first day of the battle, Xerxes finally resolved to attack the Greeks. First, he ordered 5,000 archers to fire a barrage of arrows, but they were ineffective; they fired from at least 100 yards away, according to modern day scholars, and the Greeks' bronze shields and helmets deflected the arrows. After that, Xerxes sent a force of 10,000 Medes and Cissians to take the defenders prisoner and bring them before him.[56][81] The Persians soon launched a frontal assault, in waves of around 10,000 men, on the Greek position.[56] The Greeks fought in front of the Phocian wall, at the narrowest part of the pass, which enabled them to use as few soldiers as possible.[82][83] Details of the tactics are scant; Diodorus says, \\"the men stood shoulder to shoulder\\", and the Greeks were \\"superior in valor and in the great size of their shields.\\"[84] This probably describes the standard Greek phalanx, in which the men formed a wall of overlapping shields and layered spear points protruding out from the sides of the shields, which would have been highly effective as long as it spanned the width of the pass.[85] The weaker shields, and shorter spears and swords of the Persians prevented them from effectively engaging the Greek hoplites.[84][86] Herodotus says that the units for each city were kept together; units were rotated in and out of the battle to prevent fatigue, which implies the Greeks had more men than necessary to block the pass.[87] The Greeks killed so many Medes that Xerxes is said to have stood up three times from the seat from which he was watching the battle.[88] According to Ctesias, the first wave was \\"cut to ribbons\\", with only two or three Spartans killed in return.[58]\\r\\nAccording to Herodotus and Diodorus, the king, having taken the measure of the enemy, threw his best troops into a second assault the same day, the Immortals, an elite corps of 10,000 men.[84][86] However, the Immortals fared no better than the Medes, and failed to make any headway against the Greeks.[86] The Spartans apparently used a tactic of feigning retreat, and then turning and killing the enemy troops when they ran after them.[86]\\r\\nOn the second day, Xerxes again sent in the infantry to attack the pass, \\"supposing that their enemies, being so few, were now disabled by wounds and could no longer resist.\\"[88] However, the Persians had no more success on the second day than on the first.[88] Xerxes at last stopped the assault and withdrew to his camp, \\"totally perplexed\\".[58]\\r\\nLater that day, however, as the Persian king was pondering what to do next, he received a windfall; a Trachinian named Ephialtes informed him of the mountain path around Thermopylae and offered to guide the Persian army.[89] Ephialtes was motivated by the desire for a reward.[89] For this act, the name \\"Ephialtes\\" received a lasting stigma; it came to mean \\"nightmare\\" in the Greek language and to symbolize the archetypal traitor in Greek culture.[90]\\r\\nHerodotus reports that Xerxes sent his commander Hydarnes that evening, with the men under his command, the Immortals, to encircle the Greeks via the path. However, he does not say who those men were.[91] The Immortals had been bloodied on the first day, so it is possible that Hydarnes may have been given overall command of an enhanced force including what was left of the Immortals; according to Diodorus, Hydarnes had a force of 20,000 for the mission.[92] The path led from east of the Persian camp along the ridge of Mt. Anopaea behind the cliffs that flanked the pass. It branched, with one path leading to Phocis and the other down to the Malian Gulf at Alpenus, the first town of Locris.[49]\\r\\nAt daybreak on the third day, the Phocians guarding the path above Thermopylae became aware of the outflanking Persian column by the rustling of oak leaves. Herodotus says they jumped up and were greatly amazed.[93] Hydarnes was perhaps just as amazed to see them hastily arming themselves as they were to see him and his forces.[94] He feared they were Spartans but was informed by Ephialtes that they were not.[93] The Phocians retreated to a nearby hill to make their stand (assuming the Persians had come to attack them).[93] However, not wishing to be delayed, the Persians merely shot a volley of arrows at them, before bypassing them to continue with their encirclement of the main Greek force.[93]\\r\\nLearning from a runner that the Phocians had not held the path, Leonidas called a council of war at dawn.[95] According to Diodorus, a Persian called Tyrrhastiadas, a Cymaean by birth, warned the Greeks.[96] Some of the Greeks argued for withdrawal, but Leonidas resolved to stay at the pass with the Spartans.[95] Upon discovering that his army had been encircled, Leonidas told his allies that they could leave if they wanted to. While many of the Greeks took him up on his offer and fled, around two thousand soldiers stayed behind to fight and die. Knowing that the end was near, the Greeks marched into the open field and met the Persians head-on. Many of the Greek contingents then either chose to withdraw (without orders) or were ordered to leave by Leonidas (Herodotus admits that there is some doubt about which actually happened).[95][97] The contingent of 700 Thespians, led by their general Demophilus, refused to leave and committed themselves to the fight.[98] Also present were the 400 Thebans and probably the helots who had accompanied the Spartans.[94]\\r\\nLeonidas' actions have been the subject of much discussion. It is commonly stated that the Spartans were obeying the laws of Sparta by not retreating, but it seems it was actually the failure to retreat from Thermopylae that gave rise to the notion that Spartans never retreated.[99] It is also possible that, recalling the words of the Oracle, Leonidas was committed to sacrifice his life in order to save Sparta. However, since the prophecy was specific to him, this seems a poor reason to commit 1,500 other men to a fight to the death.[99]\\r\\nThe most likely theory is that Leonidas chose to form a rearguard so that the other Greek contingents could get away.[99][100] If all the troops had retreated, the open ground beyond the pass would have allowed the Persian cavalry to run the Greeks down. If they had all remained at the pass, they would have been encircled and would eventually have all been killed.[94] By covering the retreat and continuing to block the pass, Leonidas could save more than 3,000 men, who would be able to fight again.[100]\\r\\nThe Thebans have also been the subject of some discussion. Herodotus suggests they were brought to the battle as hostages to ensure the good behavior of Thebes.[45] However, as Plutarch long ago pointed out, if they were hostages, why not send them away with the rest of the Greeks?[99] The likelihood is that these were the Theban \\"loyalists\\", who unlike the majority of their fellow citizens, objected to Persian domination.[99] They thus probably came to Thermopylae of their own free will and stayed to the end because they could not return to Thebes if the Persians conquered Boeotia.[94] The Thespians, resolved as they were not to submit to Xerxes, faced the destruction of their city if the Persians took Boeotia.[99]\\r\\nHowever, this alone does not explain the fact that they remained; the remainder of Thespiae was successfully evacuated before the Persians arrived there.[99] It seems that the Thespians volunteered to remain as a simple act of self-sacrifice, all the more amazing since their contingent represented every single hoplite the city could muster.[101] This seems to have been a particularly Thespian trait ÿ on at least two other occasions in later history, a Thespian force would commit itself to a fight to the death.[99]\\r\\nAt dawn, Xerxes made libations, pausing to allow the Immortals sufficient time to descend the mountain, and then began his advance.[83] A Persian force of 10,000 men, comprising light infantry and cavalry, charged at the front of the Greek formation. The Greeks this time sallied forth from the wall to meet the Persians in the wider part of the pass, in an attempt to slaughter as many Persians as they could.[83] They fought with spears, until every spear was shattered, and then switched to xiph (short swords).[102] In this struggle, Herodotus states that two of Xerxes' brothers fell: Abrocomes and Hyperanthes.[102] Leonidas also died in the assault, shot down by Persian archers, and the two sides fought over his body; the Greeks took possession.[102] As the Immortals approached, the Greeks withdrew and took a stand on a hill behind the wall.[103] The Thebans \\"moved away from their companions, and with hands upraised, advanced toward the barbarians...\\" (Rawlinson translation), but a few were slain before their surrender was accepted.[103] The king later had the Theban prisoners branded with the royal mark.[104] Of the remaining defenders, Herodotus says:\\r\\n\\"Here they defended themselves to the last, those who still had swords using them, and the others resisting with their hands and teeth.\\"[103]\\r\\nTearing down part of the wall, Xerxes ordered the hill surrounded, and the Persians rained down arrows until every last Greek was dead.[103] In 1939, archaeologist Spyridon Marinatos, excavating at Thermopylae, found large numbers of Persian bronze arrowheads on Kolonos Hill, which changed the identification of the hill on which the Greeks were thought to have died from a smaller one nearer the wall.[105]\\r\\nThe pass at Thermopylae was thus opened to the Persian army, according to Herodotus, at the cost to the Persians of up to 20,000 fatalities.[106] The Greek rearguard, meanwhile, was annihilated, with a probable loss of 2,000 men, including those killed on the first two days of battle.[107] Herodotus says, at one point 4,000 Greeks died, but assuming the Phocians guarding the track were not killed during the battle (as Herodotus implies), this would be almost every Greek soldier present (by Herodotus' own estimates), and this number is probably too high.[108]\\r\\nWhen the Persians recovered Leonidas' body, Xerxes, in a rage against Leonidas, ordered that the head be cut off and the body crucified. Herodotus observes this was very uncommon for the Persians, as they traditionally treated \\"valiant warriors\\" with great honour (the example of Pytheas, captured off Skiathos before the Battle of Artemisium, strengthens this suggestion).[103][109] However, Xerxes was known for his rage. Legend has it that he had the very water of the Hellespont whipped because it would not obey him.[32]\\r\\nAfter the Persians' departure, the Greeks collected their dead and buried them on the hill. After the Persian invasion was repulsed, a stone lion was erected at Thermopylae to commemorate Leonidas.[110] A full 40 years after the battle, Leonidas' bones were returned to Sparta, where he was buried again with full honors; funeral games were held every year in his memory.[102][111]\\r\\nWith Thermopylae now opened to the Persian army, the continuation of the blockade at Artemisium by the Greek fleet became irrelevant. The simultaneous naval Battle of Artemisium had been a tactical stalemate, and the Greek navy was able to retreat in good order to the Saronic Gulf, where they helped to ferry the remaining Athenian citizens to the island of Salamis.[100]\\r\\nFollowing Thermopylae, the Persian army proceeded to sack and burn Plataea and Thespiae, the Boeotian cities that had not submitted, before it marched on the now evacuated city of Athens.[112] Meanwhile, the Greeks (for the most part Peloponnesians) preparing to defend the Isthmus of Corinth, demolished the single road that led through it and built a wall across it.[113] As at Thermopylae, making this an effective strategy required the Greek navy to stage a simultaneous blockade, barring the passage of the Persian navy across the Saronic Gulf, so that troops could not be landed directly on the Peloponnese.[114] However, instead of a mere blockade, Themistocles persuaded the Greeks to seek a decisive victory against the Persian fleet. Luring the Persian navy into the Straits of Salamis, the Greek fleet was able to destroy much of the Persian fleet in the Battle of Salamis, which essentially ended the threat to the Peloponnese.[115]\\r\\nFearing the Greeks might attack the bridges across the Hellespont and trap his army in Europe, Xerxes now retreated with much of the Persian army back to Asia,[116] though nearly all of them died of starvation and disease on the return voyage.[117] He left a handpicked force, under Mardonius, to complete the conquest the following year.[118] However, under pressure from the Athenians, the Peloponnesians eventually agreed to try to force Mardonius to battle, and they marched on Attica.[119] Mardonius retreated to Boeotia to lure the Greeks into open terrain, and the two sides eventually met near the city of Plataea.[119] At the Battle of Plataea, the Greek army won a decisive victory, destroying much of the Persian army and ending the invasion of Greece.[119] Meanwhile, at the near-simultaneous naval Battle of Mycale, they also destroyed much of the remaining Persian fleet, thereby reducing the threat of further invasions.[120]\\r\\nThermopylae is arguably the most famous battle in European ancient history, repeatedly referenced in ancient, recent, and contemporary culture. In Western culture at least, it is the Greeks who are lauded for their performance in battle.[121] However, within the context of the Persian invasion, Thermopylae was undoubtedly a defeat for the Greeks.[122] It seems clear that the Greek strategy was to hold off the Persians at Thermopylae and Artemisium;[71] whatever they may have intended, it was presumably not their desire to surrender all of Boeotia and Attica to the Persians.[71] The Greek position at Thermopylae, despite being massively outnumbered, was nearly impregnable.[100] If the position had been held for even a little longer, the Persians might have had to retreat for lack of food and water.[72] Thus, despite the heavy losses, forcing the pass was strategically a Persian victory,[100] but the successful retreat of the bulk of the Greek troops was in its own sense a victory as well. The battle itself had showed what a few free men, willing to do anything for victory against the invaders, could accomplish, and the defeat at Thermopylae had turned Leonidas and the men under his command into martyrs. That boosted the morale of all Greek soldiers in the second Persian invasion.[100]\\r\\nIt is sometimes stated that Thermopylae was a Pyrrhic victory for the Persians[123][124] (i.e., one in which the victor is as damaged by the battle as the defeated party). However, there is no suggestion by Herodotus that the effect on the Persian forces was that. The idea ignores the fact that the Persians would, in the aftermath of Thermopylae, conquer the majority of Greece,[125] and the fact that they were still fighting in Greece a year later.[126] Alternatively, the argument is sometimes advanced that the last stand at Thermopylae was a successful delaying action that gave the Greek navy time to prepare for the Battle of Salamis.c[?] However, compared to the probable time (about one month) between Thermopylae and Salamis, the time bought was negligible.[127] Furthermore, this idea also neglects the fact that a Greek navy was fighting at Artemisium during the Battle of Thermopylae, incurring losses in the process.[128] George Cawkwell suggests that the gap between Thermopylae and Salamis was caused by Xerxes' systematically reducing Greek opposition in Phocis and Boeotia, and not as a result of the Battle of Thermopylae; thus, as a delaying action, Thermopylae was insignificant compared to Xerxes' own procrastination.[125] Far from labeling Thermopylae as a Pyrrhic victory, modern academic treatises on the Greco-Persian Wars tend to emphasise the success of Xerxes in breaching the formidable Greek position and the subsequent conquest of the majority of Greece. For instance, Cawkwell states: \\"he was successful on both land and sea, and the Great Invasion began with a brilliant success. ... Xerxes had every reason to congratulate himself\\",[129] while Lazenby describes the Greek defeat as \\"disastrous\\".[122]\\r\\nThe fame of Thermopylae is thus principally derived not from its effect on the outcome of the war but for the inspirational example it set.[127][130] Thermopylae is famous because of the heroism of the doomed rearguard, who, despite facing certain death, remained at the pass.[121] Ever since, the events of Thermopylae have been the source of effusive praise from many sources: \\"...the fairest sister-victories which the Sun has ever seen, yet they would never dare to compare their combined glory with the glorious defeat of King Leonidas and his men.\\"[131] A second reason is the example it set of free men, fighting for their country and their freedom:\\r\\nSo almost immediately, contemporary Greeks saw Thermopylae as a critical moral and culture lesson. In universal terms, a small, free people had willingly outfought huge numbers of imperial subjects who advanced under the lash. More specifically, the Western idea that soldiers themselves decide where, how, and against whom they will fight was contrasted against the Eastern notion of despotism and monarchyfreedom proving the stronger idea as the more courageous fighting of the Greeks at Thermopylae, and their later victories at Salamis and Plataea attested.[132]\\r\\nWhile this paradigm of \\"free men\\" outfighting \\"slaves\\" can be seen as a rather sweeping over-generalization (there are many counter-examples), it is nevertheless true that many commentators have used Thermopylae to illustrate this point.[71]\\r\\nMilitarily, although the battle was actually not decisive in the context of the Persian invasion, Thermopylae is of some significance on the basis of the first two days of fighting. The performance of the defenders is used as an example of the advantages of training, equipment, and good use of terrain as force multipliers.[133]\\r\\nThere are several monuments around the battlefield of Thermopylae.\\r\\nA well-known epigram, usually attributed to Simonides, was engraved as an epitaph on a commemorative stone placed on top of the burial mound of the Spartans at Thermopylae. It is also the hill on which the last of them died.[65] The original stone has not survived, but in 1955, the epitaph was engraved on a new stone. The text from Herodotus is:[65]\\r\\nThe alternative ancient reading Ĳ?ך ?? for ??ϫ Ĳ?ך substitutes \\"laws\\" or \\"orders\\" for \\"words.\\" In other words, the \\"orders\\" are not personal but refer to official and binding phrases (the Ancient Greek term can also refer to a formal speech).[135]\\r\\nThe form of this ancient Greek poetry is an elegiac couplet, commonly used for epitaphs. Some English renderings are given in the table below. It is also an example of Laconian brevity, a spartan style of verse that allows for varying interpretations of the meaning of the poem.[134] Ioannis Ziogas points out that the usual English translations are far from the only interpretation possible, and indicate much about the romantic tendencies of the translators.\\r\\nIt was well known in ancient Greece that all the Spartans who had been sent to Thermopylae had been killed there (with the exception of Aristodemus and Pantites), and the epitaph exploits the conceit that there was nobody left to bring the news of their deeds back to Sparta. Greek epitaphs often appealed to the passing reader (always called 'stranger') for sympathy, but the epitaph for the dead Spartans at Thermopylae took this convention much further than usual, asking the reader to make a personal journey to Sparta to break the news that the Spartan expeditionary force had been wiped out. The stranger is also asked to stress that the Spartans died 'fulfilling their orders'.\\r\\nThe first line of the epigram was used as the title of the short story \\"Stranger, Bear Word to the Spartans We\\" by German Nobel Prize laureate Heinrich B?ll. A variant of the epigram is inscribed on the Polish Cemetery at Monte Cassino.\\r\\nJohn Ruskin expressed the importance of this ideal to Western civilization as follows:\\r\\nAlso obedience in its highest form is not obedience to a constant and compulsory law, but a persuaded or voluntary yielded obedience to an issued command .... His name who leads the armies of Heaven is \\"Faithful and True\\"...?and all deeds which are done in alliance with these armies ... are essentially deeds of faith, which therefore ... is at once the source and the substance of all known deed, rightly so called ... as set forth in the last word of the noblest group of words ever, so far as I know, uttered by simple man concerning his practice, being the final testimony of the leaders of a great practical nation ... [the epitaph in Greek][150]\\r\\nCicero recorded a Latin variation in his Tusculanae Disputationes (1.42.101):\\r\\nAdditionally, there is a modern monument at the site, called the \\"Leonidas Monument\\", in honor of the Spartan king. It features a bronze statue of Leonidas. A sign, under the statue, reads simply: \\"? ϫ?\\" (\\"Come and take them!\\"as in answer to Xerxes' demand that the Greeks give up their weapons). The metope below depicts battle scenes. The two marble statues on the left and the right of the monument represent, respectively, the river Eurotas and Mount Taygetos, famous landmarks of Sparta.[151]\\r\\nIn 1997, a second monument was officially unveiled by the Greek government, dedicated to the 700 Thespians who fought with the Spartans. The monument is made of marble and features a bronze statue depicting the god Eros, to whom the ancient Thespians accorded particular religious veneration. Under the statue, a sign reads: \\"In memory of the seven hundred Thespians.\\"\\r\\nA plate below the statue explains its symbolism:\\r\\nThe monument to the Thespians is placed beside the one to the Spartans.\\r\\nHerodotus' colorful account of the battle has provided history with many apocryphal incidents and conversations away from the main historical events. These accounts are obviously not verifiable, but they form an integral part of the legend of the battle and often demonstrate the laconic speech (and wit) of the Spartans to good effect.\\r\\nFor instance, Plutarch recounts, in his Sayings of Spartan Women, upon his departure, Leonidas' wife Gorgo asked what she should do if he did not return, to which Leonidas replied, \\"Marry a good man and have good children.\\"[152]\\r\\nIt is reported that, upon arriving at Thermopylae, the Persians sent a mounted scout to reconnoiter. The Greeks allowed him to come up to the camp, observe them, and depart. Xerxes found the scout's reports of the size of the Greek force, and that the Spartans were indulging in calisthenics and combing their long hair, laughable. Seeking the counsel of Demaratus, an exiled Spartan king in his retinue, Xerxes was told the Spartans were preparing for battle, and it was their custom to adorn their hair when they were about to risk their lives. Demaratus called them \\"the bravest men in Greece\\" and warned the Great King they intended to dispute the pass. He emphasized that he had tried to warn Xerxes earlier in the campaign, but the king had refused to believe him. He added that if Xerxes ever managed to subdue the Spartans, \\"there is no other nation in all the world which will venture to lift a hand in their defense.\\"[153]\\r\\nHerodotus also describes Leonidas' reception of a Persian embassy. The ambassador told Leonidas that Xerxes would offer him the kingship of all Greece if he joined with Xerxes. Leonidas answered: \\"If you had any knowledge of the noble things of life, you would refrain from coveting others' possessions; but for me to die for Greece is better than to be the sole ruler over the people of my race.\\"[154] Then the ambassador asked him more forcefully to surrender their arms. To this Leonidas gave his famous answer: ? ϫ? (pronounced Greek pronunciation:?[mo?l??n la?be]) \\"Come and get them.\\"[155]\\r\\nSuch Laconic bravery doubtlessly helped to maintain morale. Herodotus writes that when Dienekes, a Spartan soldier, was informed that Persian arrows would be so numerous as \\"to block out the sun\\", he retorted, unconcerned: \\"So much the better...then we shall fight our battle in the shade.\\"[156]\\r\\nAfter the battle, Xerxes was curious as to what the Greeks had been trying to do (presumably because they had had so few men) and had some Arcadian deserters interrogated in his presence. The answer was: all the other men were participating in the Olympic Games. When Xerxes asked what the prize was for the winner, the answer was: \\"an olive-wreath\\". Upon hearing this, Tigranes, a Persian general, said: \\"Good heavens, Mardonius, what kind of men are these that you have pitted against us? It is not for riches that they contend but for honor!\\" (Godley translation) or otherwise, \\"Ye Gods, Mardonius, what men have you brought us to fight against? Men that fight not for gold, but for glory.\\"[157]\\r\\nThe Battle of Thermopylae has remained a cultural icon of western civilization ever since it was fought. The battle is revisited in countless adages and works of popular culture, such as in films (e.g., The 300 Spartans (1962) and 300 (2007), based on the events during and close to the time of the battle), in literature, in song, in television programs, and in video games. The battle is also discussed in many articles and books on the theory and practice of warfare.\\r\\nPrior to the battle, the Hellenes remembered the Dorians, an ethnic distinction which applied to the Spartans, as the conquerors and displacers of the Ionians in the Peloponnesus. After the battle, Spartan culture became an inspiration and object of emulation, a phenomenon known as Laconophilia.\\r\\nThere are several analogous battles.\\r\\nSimilarities between the Battle of Thermopylae and the Battle of Persian Gate have been recognized by both ancient and modern authors,[158] which describe it as a kind of reversal of the Battle of Thermopylae,[159] calling it \\"the Persian Thermopylae\\".[160] Here, on Alexander the Great's campaign against Persia in 330 BC to exact revenge for the Persian invasion of Greece, he faced the same situation, encountering a last stand of the Persian forces (under Ariobarzanes) at a narrow pass near Persepolis who held the invaders for a month, until their fall as the enemy found a path to their rear. There are even accounts that a local shepherd informed Alexander's forces about the secret path, just as a local Greek showed the Persian forces a secret path around the pass at Thermopylae.[159][161]\\r\\nOther analogous battles include:\\r\\nInformational notes\\r\\n^?a:?Although some authors state the result was a Pyrrhic victory for Persia,[123][124] the majority of authors do not apply this label to the result: see above.\\r\\n^?b:?A huge number of estimates have been made since the 19th century, ranging from 15,000 to acceptance of Herodotus' 1,800,000. No real consensus exists; even the most recent estimates by academics vary between 120,000 and 300,000. As Holland puts it, \\"in short...we will never know.\\"[60]\\r\\n^?c:?\\"The Battle of Thermopylae was a Pyrrhic victory for [the Persians] but it offered Athens invaluable time to prepare for the decisive naval battle of Salamis one month later.\\"[162]\\r\\nCitations\\r\\nBibliography\\r\\nFurther reading","input":"How many persian soldiers were at the battle of thermopylae?"},{"output":"26 August 1995","context":"","input":"When did rugby union become a professional sport?"},{"output":"the chemical primarily responsible for the yellow color of urine","context":"Urobilin or urochrome is the chemical primarily responsible for the yellow color of urine.

A lack of water intake, for example following sleep or dehydration, reduces the water content of urine, thereby concentrating urobilin and producing a darker color of urine. Obstructive jaundice reduces biliary bilirubin excretion, which is then excreted directly from the blood stream into the urine, giving a dark-colored urine but with a paradoxically low urobilin concentration, no urobilinogen, and usually with correspondingly pale faeces.

Andr immediately suggested replacing the man with a figure made from tires. Thus O'Galop transformed the earlier image into Michelin's symbol. Today, Bibendum is one of the world's most recognised trademarks, representing Michelin in over 150 countries.\\r\\nThe 1898 poster showed him offering the toast Nunc est bibendum to his scrawny competitors with a glass full of road hazards, with the title and the tag C'est  dire?:  votre sant. Le pneu Michelin boit l'obstacle (\\"That is to say, to your health. The Michelin tire drinks up obstacles\\"). The implication is that Michelin tires will easily take on road hazards. The company used this basic poster format for fifteen years, adding its latest products to the table in front of the figure. It is unclear when the word \\"Bibendum\\" came to be the name of the character himself. At the latest, it was in 1908, when Michelin commissioned Curnonsky to write a newspaper column signed \\"Bibendum\\".\\r\\nFrom 1912 onwards, tires became black in colour because carbon was added as a preservative and a strengthener to the basic rubber material. Before then, they were a gray-white or light and translucent-beige colour. Bibendum's appearance also changed. Though briefly featured in several print ads, Michelin quickly changed back his appearance, citing printing and aesthetic issues for the change, and not racial concerns as commonly believed.[4]\\r\\nThe name of the plump tire-man has entered the language to describe someone obese or wearing comically bulky clothing. (e.g. \\"How can I wrap up warm without looking like the Michelin Man?\\")[5]\\r\\nBibendum's shape has changed over the years. O'Galop's logo was based on bicycle tires, wore pince-nez glasses with lanyard, and smoked a cigar. By the 1980s, Bibendum was being shown running, and in 1998, his 100th anniversary, a slimmed-down version became the company's new logo. He had long since given up the cigar and pince-nez. The slimming of the logo reflected lower-profile, smaller tires of modern cars. Bib even had a similar-looking puppy as a companion when the duo were CGI animated for recent American television advertisements.\\r\\nA history of the emblem was written by Olivier Darmon and published in 1997: Le Grand Sicle de Bibendum; Paris: Ho?beke.[6]\\r\\nThe \\"Bibendum chair\\" was designed by Eileen Gray in 1925.\\r\\nCayce Pollard, the main character of William Gibson's novel Pattern Recognition, has a strong aversion to corporate brands and logos. The sight of Bibendum in particular gives her panic attacks.\\r\\nBibendum made a brief guest appearance in the Asterix series, as the chariot-wheel dealer in certain translations, including the English one, of Asterix in Switzerland. (The original French version used the Gaulish warrior mascot of French service-station company Antar.)\\r\\nMichelin sued the performance artist Momus for releasing a song about the trademarked Michelin Man.\\r\\nFrench reggae band Tryo sang about Bibendum on their album Grain de Sable. 'Monsieur Bibendum, il est vraiment norme / Monsieur Bibendum, le bonheur en personne' ('Mr Bibendum, he is truly enormous, Mr Bibendum; happiness in person').\\r\\nIn the 2009 animated, Academy Award-winning satire Logorama, a series of Bibendums play police detectives, a sheriff, and a squad of SWAT personnel who all work together to try to bring down a psychotic, ultraviolent criminal played by Ronald McDonald.","input":"What is the symbol of the michelin tyre company?"},{"output":"Australian Cattle Dog","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Australian Cattle Dog (ACD), or simply Cattle Dog, is a breed of herding dog originally developed in Australia for droving cattle over long distances across rough terrain. This breed is a medium-sized, short-coated dog that occurs in two main colour forms. It has either brown or black hair distributed fairly evenly through a white coat, which gives the appearance of a \\"red\\" or \\"blue\\" dog. \\r\\n\\r\\nAs with dogs from other working breeds, the Australian Cattle Dog is energetic and intelligent with an independent streak. It responds well to structured training, particularly if it is interesting and challenging. It was originally bred to herd by biting, and is known to nip running children. It forms a strong attachment to its owners, and can be protective of them and their possessions. It is easy to groom and maintain, requiring little more than brushing during the shedding period. The most common health problems are deafness and progressive blindness (both hereditary conditions) and accidental injury; otherwise, it is a robust breed with a lifespan of 12 to 14 years.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the 19th century, New South Wales cattle farmer Thomas Hall crossed the dogs used by drovers in his parents' home county, Northumberland, with dingoes he had tamed. The resulting dogs were known as Halls Heelers. After Hall's death in 1870, the dogs became available beyond the Hall family and their associates. They were subsequently developed into two modern breeds: the Australian Cattle Dog and the Australian Stumpy Tail Cattle Dog. Robert Kaleski, who wrote the first standard for the breed, was influential in its development.\\r\\n\\r\\nAustralian Cattle Dog has been nicknamed a \\"Red Heeler\\" or \\"Blue Heeler\\" on the basis of its colouring and practice of moving reluctant cattle by nipping at their heels. Dogs from a line bred in Queensland, Australia, which were successful at shows and at stud in the 1940s, were called \\"Queensland Heelers\\" to differentiate them from lines bred in New South Wales; this nickname is now occasionally applied to any Australian Cattle Dog.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Australian Cattle Dog is a sturdy, muscular, compact dog that gives the impression of agility and strength. It has a broad skull that flattens to a definite stop between the eyes, with muscular cheeks and a medium-length, deep, powerful muzzle. The ears are pricked, small to medium in size and set wide apart, with a covering of hair on the inside. The eyes are oval and dark, with an alert, keen expression. The neck and shoulders are strong and muscular; the forelegs are straight and parallel; and the feet round and arched, with small, sturdy toes and nails.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Cattle Dog breed standard states that it should have well-conditioned muscles, even when bred for companion or show purposes, and that its appearance should be symmetrical and balanced, with no individual part of the dog exaggerated. It should not look either delicate or cumbersome, as either characteristic limits the agility and endurance that is necessary for a working dog.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe female Australian Cattle Dog measures approximately 43ÿ48 centimetres (17ÿ19?in) at the withers, and the male measures about 46ÿ51 centimetres (18ÿ20?in) at the withers. The dog should be longer than tall, that is, the length of the body from breast bone to buttocks is greater than the height at the withers, in a ratio of 10 to 9.[1] An Australian Cattle Dog in good condition weighs around 15ÿ22 kilograms (33ÿ49?lb).\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are two accepted coat colours, red and blue, though chocolate and cream do occur. Blue dogs can be blue, blue mottled, or blue speckled with or without black, tan, or white markings. Red dogs are evenly speckled with solid red markings. Both red dogs and blue dogs are born white (except for any solid-coloured body or face markings) and the red or black hairs grow in as they mature. The distinctive adult colouration is the result of black or red hairs closely interspersed through a predominantly white coat. This is not merle colouration (a speckled effect that has associated health issues), but rather the result of the ticking gene. A number of breeds show ticking, which is the presence of colour through white areas, though the overall effect depends on other genes that will modify the size, shape and density of the ticking.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn addition to the primary colouration, an Australian Cattle Dog displays some patches of solid or near-solid colour. In both red and blue dogs, the most common are masks over one or both eyes, a white tip to the tail, a solid spot at the base of the tail, and sometimes solid spots on the body, though these are not desirable in dogs bred for conformation shows. Blue dogs can have tan midway up the legs and extending up the front to breast and throat, with tan on jaws, and tan eyebrows.[1] Both colour forms can have a white \\"star\\" on the forehead called the \\"Bentley Mark\\", after a legendary dog owned by Tom Bentley.[3] Common miscolours in the Australian Cattle Dog are black hairs in a red-coated dog, including the extreme of a black saddle on a red dog, and extensive tan on the face and body on a blue dog, called \\"creeping tan\\".[4] The Cattle Dog has a double coatthe short, straight outer guard hairs are protective in nature, keeping the elements from the dog's skin while the undercoat is short, fine and dense.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe mask consists of a black patch over one or both eyes (for the blue coat colour) or a red patch over one or both eyes (for the red coat colour). Depending on whether one or both eyes have a patch, these are called, respectively, \\"single\\" (or \\"half\\") mask and \\"double\\" (or \\"full\\") mask. Dogs without a mask are called plain-faced. Any of these are acceptable according to the breed standard. In conformation shows, even markings are preferred over uneven markings.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe breed standards of the Australian, American and Canadian kennel clubs specify that the Australian Cattle Dog should have a natural, long, un-docked tail. There will often be a solid colour spot at the base of the tail and a white tip. The tail should be set moderately low, following the slope of the back. It should hang in a slight curve at rest, though an excited dog may carry its tail higher. The tail should feature a reasonable level of brush.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the United States, tails are sometimes docked on working stock. The tail is not docked in Australia, and serves a useful purpose in increasing agility and the ability to turn quickly.[5] The Australian Cattle Dog is a breed distinct from the Australian Stumpy Tail Cattle Dog, a square-bodied dog born with a naturally \\"bobbed\\" tail. The Stumpy Tail resembles the Australian Cattle Dog, but has a taller, leaner conformation. It occasionally has a natural long thin tail, but most are born without tails.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nLike many working dogs, the Australian Cattle Dog has high energy levels, an active mind, and a level of independence.[7] The breed ranks 10th in Stanley Coren's The Intelligence of Dogs, rated as one of the most intelligent dogs ranked by obedience command trainability.[8] The Cattle Dog needs plenty of exercise, companionship and a job to do, so a non-working dog might participate in dog sports, learning tricks, or other activities that engage its body and mind.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen on home ground, the Australian Cattle Dog is an affectionate and playful pet.[7] However, it is reserved with people it does not know and naturally cautious in new situations. Its attitude to strangers makes it an excellent guard dog when trained for this task, and it can be socialised to become accustomed to a variety of people from an early age as a family pet. It is good with older, considerate children, but will herd people by nipping at their heels, particularly younger children who run and squeal.[9]  By the time puppies are weaned, they should have learned that the company of people is pleasurable, and that responding to cues from a person is rewarding.[10] The bond that this breed can create with its owner is strong and will leave the dog feeling protective towards the owner, typically resulting in the dog's never being too far from the owner's side. The Australian Cattle Dog can be the friendliest of companions although it is quick to respond to the emotions of its owners, and may defend them without waiting for a command.[11] The ACD was originally bred to move reluctant cattle by biting, and it will bite if treated harshly.[9] The Australian Cattle Dog's protective nature and tendency to nip at heels can be dangerous as the dog grows into an adult if unwanted behaviours are left unchecked.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile an Australian Cattle Dog generally works silently, it will bark in alarm or to attract attention. It has a distinctive intense, high-pitched bark. Barking can be a sign of boredom or frustration, although research has shown that pet dogs increase their vocalisation when raised in a noisy environment.[13] It responds well to familiar dogs, but when multiple dogs are present, establishing a pecking order can trigger aggression. It is not a breed that lives in a pack with other dogs.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nData accumulated from Council reports in New South Wales from April to June 2013, showed that dogs identified as Australian Cattle Dogs were involved in 66 attacks, where an attack is defined as any incident where a dog rushes at, bites, harasses or chases any person or animal. Staffordshire Bull Terrier (155 attacks), German Shepherd (89) and American Staffordshire Terrier (88) were reported to be involved in more incidents.[14] Expressed as a percentage of registered dogs, 0.1% of Australian Cattle Dogs were involved in attacks.[15]  The data gathered in 2011ÿ2012 listed the ACD twenty-seventh in involvement in incidents ranked by percentage of dogs registered.[16] [note 1] A review of incidents in Melbourne where a dog bit, rushed at or chased a person or animal in a public space, found that there were sixty breeds involved and the German Shepherd and German Shepherd crosses, and Australian Cattle Dog and Cattle Dog crosses accounted for 9% of incidents.[17]  Surveys of U.S. breed club members showed that both dog-directed aggression and stranger-directed aggression were higher in the ACD than the average of breeds studied, with dog-directed aggression being the more prevalent of the two aggression types.[18] The American Temperament Test Society reports a test pass rate of 79.3% for Australian Cattle Dogs.[19] The average pass rate for all breeds is 80.4%.[20]\\r\\n\\r\\nKnown as a \\"wash and wear\\" dog, the Australian Cattle Dog requires little grooming, and an occasional brushing is all that is required to keep the coat clean and odour-free. Even for the show ring it needs no more than wiping down with a moist cloth. It is not a year-round shedder but blows its coat once a year (twice in the case of intact females) and frequent brushing and a warm bath during this period will contain the shedding hair. As with all dogs, regular attention to nails, ears and teeth will help avoid health problems.[21]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Katherine Buetow's guide to the Australian Cattle Dog, Ian Dunbar makes the point that while people think of dog training as teaching a dog to sit, speak and roll over, the dog already knows how to do these things. Training, he says, involves teaching the dog that it is a good idea to do these things when a particular word is said or signal is given. He goes on to explain his belief that training is about opening communication channels, so that the dog knows what the handler wants it to do, and knows that it will be worth its while to do it. Consequences for the dog can be rewards for doing what is required, as recommended by Dunbar, or corrections where an unwanted behaviour is performed.[22] Like other working breeds, the Australian Cattle Dog is intelligent and responsive; both of these traits can be an advantage in training where a structured, varied program is used, but can lead to unwanted outcomes if training is not consistent, or is repetitive and boring for the dog.[23] Stock dog trainer Scott Lithgow recommends making training a game so the Cattle Dog learns that obedience leads to enjoyment.[10] Many of a Cattle Dog's natural behaviours are undesirable in a pet: barking, chewing, chasing, digging, defending territory, and nipping heels. Training, therefore, involves helping the dog adopt a lifestyle that is probably very different from that of its droving ancestors.[23] The Australian Cattle Dog is biddable, and responds well to training.[24]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Australian Cattle Dog demands a high level of physical activity. Like many other herding dog breeds, the Cattle Dog has an active and fertile mind and if it is not given jobs to do it will find its own activities. It will appreciate a walk around the neighbourhood, but it needs structured activities that engage and challenge it, and regular interaction with its owner. While individual dogs have their own personalities and abilities, as a breed the Australian Cattle Dog is suited to any activity that calls for athleticism, intelligence, and endurance.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nKennel club-sponsored herding trials with a range of events suit the driving abilities of the Cattle Dog and other upright breeds, while sheepdog trials are more suited to the \\"eye\\" breeds such as the Border Collie and Australian Kelpie. Herding instincts and trainability are measured at non-competitive herding tests, and basic commands are sometimes taught through herding games, where rules such as \\"stay\\", \\"get it\\" and \\"that'll do\\" are applied to fetching a ball or chasing a yard broom.[25]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Australian Cattle Dog was developed for its ability to encourage reluctant cattle to travel long distances and may be the best breed in the world for this work.[10] However, some working dog trainers have expressed concern that dogs bred for the show ring are increasingly too short in the legs and too stocky in the body to undertake the work for which they were originally bred.[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nAmong the most popular activities for an Australian Cattle Dog is dog agility. It is ideally suited for navigating obstacle courses, since as a herding dog it is reactive to the handler's body language and willing to work accurately at a distance from the handler. Agility has been used by Cattle Dog owners to instil confidence in their dogs, and enhance their performance in training and competition.[26]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Australian Cattle Dog thrives on change and new experiences, and many handlers find training the breed challenging for this reason. An Australian Cattle Dog can excel in obedience competition. It will enjoy the challenges, such as retrieving a scented article, but the breed's problem-solving ability may lead it to find solutions to problems that are not necessarily rewarded by the obedience judges. Rally obedience offers more interaction with the owner and less repetition than traditional obedience trials.[27]\\r\\n\\r\\nAustralian Cattle Dogs have been successful in a range of dog sports including weight pulling, flyball and schutzhund.[28] The breed is particularly suited to activities that a dog can share with its owner such as canicross, disc dog, and skijoring or bikejoring. It is an effective hiking companion because of its natural endurance, its general lack of interest in hunting, and preference for staying by its owner's side.[27] Most Australian Cattle Dogs love the water and are excellent swimmers.[29] It is not a hyperactive breed, and once one has had its exercise, it is happy to lie at its owner's feet, or to rest in its bed or crate while keeping an ear and eye open for signs of pending activity. The Australian Cattle Dog is an adaptable dog that can accept city or indoor living conditions, if its considerable exercise and companionship needs are met.[30]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Australian Cattle Dog can be put to work in a number of ways. Cattle Dogs are service dogs for people with a disability or are therapy dogs,[28] some work for customs agencies in drug detection, some as police dogs,[27] others haze pest animals, such as geese, for city or state agencies,[31] and some work as scat-detection dogs, tracking endangered wildlife species.[32]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a small sample of 11 deceased dogs, Australian Cattle Dogs had a median longevity of 11.7?years (maximum 15.9?yrs).[33] A larger survey of 100 deceased dogs yielded a mean longevity of 13.41?years with a standard deviation of 2.36?years.[34] The median longevities of breeds of similar size are between 11 and 13?years.[35] There is an anecdotal report of a Cattle Dog named Bluey, born in 1910 and living for 29.5?years, but the record is unverified.[36] Even if true, Bluey's record age would have to be regarded more as an uncharacteristic exception than as an indicator of common exceptional longevity for the entire breed.[34] It remains, however, that Australian Cattle Dogs generally age well and appear to live on average almost a year longer than most dogs of other breeds in the same weight class.[34] Many members of the breed are still well and active at 12 or 14?years of age, and some maintain their sight, hearing and even their teeth until their final days.[37]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Australian Cattle Dog carries recessive piebald alleles that produce white in the coat and skin and are linked to congenital hereditary deafness, though it is possible that there is a multi-gene cause for deafness in a dog with the piebald pigment genes.[38] Around 2.4% of Cattle Dogs in one study were found to be deaf in both ears and 14.5% were deaf in at least one ear.[39]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Australian Cattle Dog is one of the dog breeds affected by progressive retinal atrophy. It has the most common form, progressive rod-cone degeneration (PRCD), a condition that causes the rods and cones in the retina of the eye to deteriorate later in life, resulting in blindness. PRCD is an autosomal recessive trait and a dog can be a carrier of the affected gene without developing the condition.[40]\\r\\n\\r\\nHip dysplasia is not common in the breed,[21] although it occurs sufficiently often for many breeders to have their breeding stock tested. The Cattle Dog has a number of inherited conditions,[41] but most of these are not common. Hereditary polioencephalomyelopathy of the Australian Cattle Dog is a very rare condition caused by an inherited biochemical defect. Dogs identified with the condition were completely paralysed within their first year.[42] Based on a sample of 69 still-living dogs, the most common health issues noted by owners were musculoskeletal (spondylosis, elbow dysplasia, and arthritis) and reproductive (pyometra, infertility, and false pregnancy), and blindness.[33] A study of dogs diagnosed at Veterinary Colleges in the United States and Canada over a thirty-year period described fractures, lameness and cruciate ligament tears as the most common conditions in the Australian Cattle Dogs treated.[43]\\r\\n\\r\\nGeorge Hall and his family arrived in the New South Wales Colony in 1802. By 1825, the Halls had established two cattle stations in the Upper Hunter Valley, and had begun a northward expansion into the Liverpool Plains, New England and Queensland. Getting his cattle to the Sydney markets presented a problem in that thousands of head of cattle had to be moved for thousands of kilometres along unfenced stock routes through sometimes rugged bush and mountain ranges. A note, in his own writing, records Thomas Hall's anger at losing 200 head in scrub.[44]\\r\\n\\r\\nA droving dog was needed, but the colonial working dogs are understood to have been of the Old English Sheepdog type, commonly referred to as Smithfields. Descendants of these dogs still exist, but are useful only over short distances and for yard work with domesticated cattle. Thomas Hall addressed the problem by importing several of the dogs used by drovers in Northumberland, his parents' home county. At that time dogs were generally described by their job, regardless of whether they constituted a breed as it is currently understood. In the manner of the time, the Hall family historian, A. J. Howard, gave these blue mottled dogs a name: Northumberland Blue Merle Drovers Dog.[45]\\r\\n\\r\\nThomas Hall crossed his Drovers Dogs with dingoes he had tamed, and by 1840 was satisfied with his resulting progeny. During the next thirty years, the Halls Heelers, as they became known, were used only by the Halls. Given that they were dependent on the dogs, which gave them an advantage over other cattle breeders, it is understandable that the dogs were not distributed beyond the Hall's properties. It was not until after Thomas Hall's death in 1870, when the properties went to auction with the stock on them, that Halls Heelers became freely available.[46]\\r\\n\\r\\nBy the 1890s, the dogs had attracted the attention of the Cattle Dog Club of Sydney, a group of men with a recreational interest in the new practice of showing dogs competitively. None were stockmen working cattle on a daily basis, and initially they were interested in a range of working dogs, including the Smithfield. They reportedly adopted the term \\"Australian Cattle Dog\\" to refer to the dogs being bred from bloodlines originating from Thomas Hall's \\"heelers\\", and prominent members of the group concentrated on breeding these lines.[47] Of these breeders, the Bagust family was the most influential. Robert Kaleski, of Moorebank, a young associate of Harry Bagust, wrote \\"in 1893 when I got rid of my cross-bred cattle dogs and took up the blues, breeders of the latter had started breeding?... to fix the type. I drew up a standard for them on those lines\\".[48] This first breed standard for the Cattle Dog breed was published, with photographs, by the New South Wales Department of Agriculture in 1903.[49]\\r\\n\\r\\nKaleski's standard was adopted by breed clubs in Queensland and New South Wales and re-issued as their own, with local changes. His writings from the 1910s give an important insight into the early history of the breed. However, dog breeder and author Noreen Clark has noted that his opinions are sometimes just that, and he introduces some contradictory assertions in his later writings, as well as some assumptions that are illogical in the light of modern science.[50] Some of these have persisted; for example he saw the red colour form as having more dingo in it than the blue form, and there is a persistent belief that reds are more vicious than blues. The most enduring of Kaleski's myths relate to Dalmatian and Kelpie infusions into the early Cattle Dog breed. These infusions are not referred to in Kaleski's writings until the 1920s and it seems likely that Kaleski sought to explain the Cattle Dog's mottled colouration and tan on legs by similarity to the Dalmatian and Kelpie, respectively.[51] The genetics of coat colour, and the current understanding of hereditary characteristics, make the infusion of Dalmatian to increase the cattle dog's tolerance of horses an extremely unlikely event. There were relatively few motor vehicles in Australia at the beginning of the 20th century, so most dogs of any breed would have been accustomed to horses.[52] The Kelpie breed was developed after the Cattle Dog type was described, so its infusion is unlikely.[53] It is possible that there was some infusion of Bull Terrier but there is no verifiable record of this, and the Cattle Dog has not had the Bull Terrier's instinct to bite and hold, which would have been an undesirable trait.[54] Early in the 1900s there was considerable in-fighting amongst members of the Cattle Dog Club, and a series of arguments about the origin of the breed appeared in newspapers and journals of the time. While many of these arguments were misleading, some irrational, and the majority not supported by historical facts, they continue to be circulated,[47] resulting in a number of theories on the origins of the breed. In recent years, information technology enabling the manipulation of large databases combined with advances in the understanding of canine genetics has allowed a clearer understanding of the development of the breed.[55]\\r\\n\\r\\nThrough the 1890s, Cattle Dogs of Halls Heeler derivations were seen in the kennels of exhibiting Queensland dog breeders such as William Byrne of Booval, and these were a different population from those shown in New South Wales. Little Logic was bred in Rockdale, New South Wales, however Sydney exhibitors saw Little Logic for the first time after the dog had been added to the Hillview kennels of Arch Bevis in Brisbane. The show records of Little Logic and his offspring created a demand in New South Wales for Queensland dogs.[56] By the end of the 1950s, there were few Australian Cattle Dogs whelped that were not descendants of Little Logic and his best known son, Logic Return. The success and popularity of these dogs led to the growth of the nickname \\"Queensland Heeler\\".[57]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe prominence of Little Logic and Logic Return in the pedigrees of modern Australian Cattle Dogs was perpetuated by Wooleston Kennels. For some twenty years, Wooleston supplied foundation and supplementary breeding stock to breeders in Australia, North America and Continental Europe. As a result, Wooleston Blue Jack is ancestral to most, if not all, Australian Cattle Dogs whelped since 1990 in any country.[58]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the 1940s Alan McNiven, a Sydney veterinarian, introduced Dingo, Kelpie, German Shepherd, and Kangaroo Hound into his breeding program; however, the Royal Agricultural Society Kennel Club (RASKC) would not register the cross breeds as Australian Cattle Dogs, even though McNiven argued they were true to conformation, colour and temperament. McNiven responded by giving his pups registration papers from dead dogs, and was consequently expelled from the RASKC and all of his dogs removed from the registry. Meanwhile, Greg Lougher, a Napa, California cattle rancher who met Alan McNiven while stationed in Australia during World War II, had imported several adults and several litters from McNiven. After his de-registration McNiven continued to export his \\"improved\\" dogs to the United States. Many U.S. soldiers who were stationed in Queensland or NSW during the War discovered the Australian Cattle Dog and took one home when they returned.[59]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the late 1950s a veterinarian in Santa Rosa, California, Jack Woolsey, was introduced to Lougher's dogs. With his partners, he bought several dogs and started breeding them. The breeders advertised the dogs in Western Horsemen stating they were guaranteed to work and calling them Queensland Heelers. Woolsey imported several purebred Australian Cattle Dogs to add to his breeding program, including Oaklea Blue Ace, Glen Iris Boomerang and several Glen Iris bitches. The National Stock Dog Registry of Butler, Indiana, registered the breed, assigning American numbers without reference to Australian registrations.[59]\\r\\n\\r\\nAustralian Cattle Dogs had been classified in the \\"miscellaneous\\" category at the American Kennel Club (AKC) since the 1930s; to get the breed full recognition, the AKC required that a National Breed Parent Club be organised for promotion and protection of the breed.[59] In 1967 Esther Ekman met Chris Smith-Risk at an AKC show, and the two fell into conversation about their Australian Cattle Dogs and the process of establishing a parent club for the breed. By 1969 the fledgling club had 12 members and formally applied to the AKC for instructions. One of the requirements was that the Club had to start keeping its own registry for the breed and that all dogs on the registry would have to be an extension of the Australian registry, tracing back to registered dogs in Australia.[59] The AKC Parent Club members began researching their dogs, including exchanging correspondence with McNiven, and discovered that few of them had dogs that could be traced back to dogs registered in Australia. The AKC took over the club registry in 1979 and the breed was fully recognised in September 1980. The Australian Cattle Dog Club of America is still active in the promotion of the breed and the maintenance of breed standards. The National Stock Dog Registry continued to recognise Cattle Dogs without prerequisite links to Australian registered dogs, on the condition that any dog of unknown parentage that was presented for registry would be registered as an \\"American Cattle Dog\\", and all others would still be registered as \\"Australian Cattle Dogs\\".[59]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe breed gained official recognition from the Canadian Kennel Club in January 1980 after five years of collecting pedigrees, gathering support, and lobbying officials by two breeders and enthusiasts.[60] The small number of Australian Cattle Dogs in Canada at the time were primarily working dogs on farms and ranches scattered across large distances. However, the fledgling breed club held conformation shows, obedience and agility competitions, and entered their dogs in sports including flyball and lure coursing. At the end of 1980, Landmaster Carina was named the first Australian Cattle Dog in Canada to gain both her conformation and obedience titles.[60]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first registered Australian Cattle Dogs to arrive in the United Kingdom were two blue puppies, Lenthal Flinton and Lenthal Darlot, followed in 1980 by Landmaster Darling Red in whelp.[27] Landmaster Darling Red was imported by John and Mary Holmes, and proved to be an outstanding brood bitch. Over the next few years additional Cattle Dogs arrived in the UK from the Netherlands, Kenya, Germany and Australia, although prior to relaxation of rules regarding artificial insemination, the UK gene pool was limited. In 1985 an Australian Cattle Dog Society was formed and officially recognised by the Kennel Club; before this they had to compete in the category \\"Any Variety Not Separately Classified\\". Australian Cattle Dogs were competing successfully in obedience and working trials in the UK during the 1980s.[27]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Texas Heeler is a cross between the Australian Cattle Dog and the Australian Shepherd that was first registered with the Animal Research Foundation (ARF) in 1970. The ARF has registered Australian Cattle Dogs without papers as \\"Australian Cattledog Queensland Heelers\\" since 1965 and was the first organisation to recognise the Australian Shepherd.[61] Although originally bred for its ability to work cattle,[62] the Texas Heeler is increasingly used as a pet and a companion in dog sports. As with most cross breeds, the Texas Heeler's size and appearance is a variable combination of the parent breeds.","input":"What type of dog is a blue heeler?"},{"output":"Torey Lovullo","context":"There have been a total of six managers in the history of the Arizona Diamondbacks Major League Baseball (MLB) franchise of the National League.

He has managed the Diamondbacks to one playoff berth, in 2007, in which he led the team to the National League Championship Series (NLCS).[2][3] Al Pedrique and A.J. Hinch are the only two managers in the Diamondbacks history to not lead a team into the playoffs.\\r\\nIn the 2000 baseball season, the Diamondbacks decided to release Buck Showalter, soon then to be replaced by manager Bob Brenly. The following year, Brenly led the Diamondbacks to win the 2001 World Series.[4] However, after a poor 2003 and start of the 2004 season, Brenly was also released and was replaced with Al Pedrique[5] , the third base coach for the Diamondbacks at the time. At the end of that season, the Diamondbacks originally hired Wally Backman as their new manager for the team. Though, after allegations of Backman driving under the influence, the Diamondbacks decided to instead hire Bob Melvin as their new manager instead of hiring Backman.[6] Melvin, the former Mariners manager, led the Diamondbacks since the 2005 season of baseball.

The first four survival horror video games in the series, Silent Hill, 2, 3, and 4: The Room, were developed by an internal group called Team Silent, a development staff within former Konami subsidiary Konami Computer Entertainment Tokyo. The later five games, Origins, Homecoming, Shattered Memories, Downpour and Book of Memories, were developed by other unrelated groups. The Silent Hill franchise has expanded to include various print pieces, two feature films, and spin-off video games.\\r\\nSilent Hill is set in the series' eponymous fictitious American town. The series is heavily influenced by the literary genre of psychological horror, with its player characters being mostly \\"everymen\\".[1]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first installment in the series follows Harry Mason as he searches for his missing adopted daughter in the mysterious town of Silent Hill. Stumbling upon a cult conducting a ritual to revive a deity it worships, Harry discovers his daughter's true origin. Multiple game endings are possible, depending on in-game actions taken by the player. It was released in 1999 for the PlayStation. In 2009, the game became available for download from the European PlayStation Network store for the PlayStation 3 and the PlayStation Portable and later, in the same year, from the North American PlayStation Network store.[2][3]\\r\\nThe second installment in the series follows James Sunderland searching for his deceased wife in Silent Hill after having received a letter from her informing him that she is waiting for him there. After searching in and exploring the mysterious town, he ultimately realizes her death's true nature. It was released in September 2001 for the PlayStation 2. An extended version of the game was released for the Xbox in December of the same year as Silent Hill 2: Restless Dreams in North America and Silent Hill 2: Inner Fears in Europe, and for the PlayStation 2 in 2002 as Silent Hill 2: Director's Cut, with a port of Director's Cut to Microsoft Windows released in December 2002.\\r\\nThe third installment in the series follows a teenaged girl named Heather as she becomes caught in a conflict within Silent Hill's cult and discovers her true origin. It was released in May 2003 for the PlayStation 2, with a port to Microsoft Windows released in October of the same year. Silent Hill 3 is a direct sequel to the first installment in the series.[4]\\r\\nThe fourth installment in the series follows Henry Townshend, who finds himself locked in his apartment as strange phenomena begin to unfold around him and other residents of the building. It was released in 2004 for the PlayStation 2, Xbox and Microsoft Windows and it also marked the end of Team Silent's contributions to the series.\\r\\nThe fifth installment in the series is a prequel that follows trucker Travis Grady, who becomes trapped in Silent Hill after rescuing a girl from a burning house. During his quest to find the fate of the burned girl, he encounters characters from previous installments and is forced to face his past.[5] It was developed by Climax Studios and released in 2007 for the PlayStation Portable, with a port for the PlayStation 2 released in 2008 and was also the first Silent Hill title developed outside Japan.[6] It is known as Silent Hill Zero in Japan.\\r\\nThe sixth installment in the series follows Alex Shepherd, a soldier who has returned from a war overseas. Alex discovers upon his arrival that his father has gone missing, his mother has become catatonic, and no one can provide the whereabouts of his younger brother, Joshua. The game chronicles Alex's search to find his missing brother.[7] It was developed by Double Helix Games and released in 2008 for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 and in 2009 for Microsoft Windows.\\r\\nThe seventh installment in the series is an reimagining of the first installment. Developed by Climax Studios for the Wii in December 2009, with ports for the PlayStation 2 and the PlayStation Portable released in January 2010.[8] Shattered Memories retains the premise of the original gameHarry Mason's quest to find his missing daughter in the American town of Silent Hillbut is set in what appears to be a different fictional universe, following a different plot, with characters from the first game appearing altered alongside new ones. Gameplay takes place in two parts: a framing, first-person psychotherapy session with an unseen patient and an over-the-shoulder perspective of Harry's journey through Silent Hill, periodically interrupted by the occurrence of a shift to an alternate dimension where he is pursued by monsters.\\r\\nShattered Memories' gameplay focuses on completion of psychological tests which alter in-game elements, while in the first setting, and exploration, puzzle solving, and monster evasion, when in the second setting. The game's developers avoided integrating combat into the second setting's gameplay, centering instead on a weaponless player character attempting to rescue themselves from powerful opponents, as they considered this to be more fear-inducing. The game received generally positive reviews, with its graphics, storyline, voice acting, soundtrack, and use of the Wii Remote as the Wii version's controller praised by reviewers; Shattered Memories' chase sequences and duration, though, were criticized by certain reviewers, because they deemed them potentially frustrating and short, respectively.\\r\\nThe eighth installment in the series follows Murphy Pendleton, a prisoner who is stranded in Silent Hill after his prison transport vehicle crashes. It was announced in April 2010[9] and developed by Vatra Games for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 on March 13, 2012.[10] It is the first game in the series to feature 3D (stereoscopic) graphics.\\r\\nSilent Hill: The Arcade deals with two characters, Eric and Tina, who have entered the town of Silent Hill and must battle monsters while uncovering the mystery behind Eric's nightmares about a girl and a steamship.[11] The Arcade has a multiplayer element, where each player can choose to be either Eric or Tina.[12] A second player can join the game at any time.[13]\\r\\nSilent Hill: The Escape is a mobile phone spin-off title for the Silent Hill franchise. It was first released in Japan for the FOMA phone December 19, 2007; and was released for the iOS internationally in 2009.\\r\\nThe goal of the game is to guide the player through ten stages by finding a key and opening the locked door. The game is played in a first-person perspective.\\r\\nThe game achieved mixed reviews due to lack of storyline and poor execution.[14]\\r\\nSilent Hill HD Collection is a HD re-release of Silent Hill 2 and Silent Hill 3 for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, featuring high-resolution visuals, new sounds, new voices and Trophies/Achievements for both games. Silent Hill 2 features the exclusive option to use both the old and new voices; however, Silent Hill 3 features only a new voice track, with the old voices unavailable due to legal reasons. Silent Hill 2 features both the main scenario and the Born from a Wish sub-scenario for Maria seen in later re-releases, namely the Director's Cut. This pack is also the first time Silent Hill 3 is playable on an Xbox brand console. The collection got mixed to negative reviews due to severe issues with both games, such as severe framerate problems, lockups and more. While the PlayStation 3 version was patched, the Xbox 360 patch was cancelled and Konami offered refunds to all Xbox 360 owners of the game.[15]\\r\\nThe PlayStation Vita entry, titled Silent Hill: Book of Memories, was released in October 2012.[10] The RPG, also serving as a spin-off,[16] was developed by WayForward Technologies.[17][18][19] Book of Memories utilizes an overhead isometric view, follows a new storyline and features returning creatures from the series' fictional universe, as well as cooperative gameplay;[20] the game is the first installment in the series to feature multiplayer gameplay.[20][21] According to series producer Tomm Hulett, Book of Memories' gameplay \\"will be largely different from the one established in previous installments in the series, focusing on cooperative multiplayer action rather than traditional psychological horror.\\"[22]\\r\\nWayForward Technologies, developers of Silent Hill: Book of Memories, worked on a series installment for the Nintendo DS in 2006. They developed a one-room prototype demo using the lead character and assets from Silent Hill 2 before the game was cancelled.[23]\\r\\nRenegade Kid pitched their DS title, Dementium: The Ward as a Silent Hill spinoff title. It was rejected by Konami for various reasons involving Konami not wanting to trust a small company with the Silent Hill license. Renegade Kid later pitched a modified version of Dementium II which was also rejected, but for Konami simply not wanting to enter the DS space with a horror title at the time.[24]\\r\\nBefore Climax Studios started working on what would later become Silent Hill: Origins, they had originally pitched a different game idea to Konami in 2006. Intended to be a PlayStation 3 exclusive, the proposed game would have taken place in Arizona and starred protagonist Father Hector Santos. The priest would have utilized water, a major motif in the game, to perform \\"holy rites and rituals.\\" The proposal never received a greenlight from Konami, and it was reimagined as an original title called Broken Covenant but that too, was eventually shelved.[25]\\r\\nSilicon Knights, a video game developer struggling financially after a legal battle with Epic Games, announced the titles in production when the company ceased development in 2012. One of these games was called Silent Hill: The Box,[26] but later became known simply as The Box, which could have been the codename for the title after a publishing deal fell through given the company's financial status. A screenshot from the game was released via ComputerAndVideoGames.com.[27]\\r\\nDuring Sony Computer Entertainment's presentation at Gamescom 2014, an interactive teaser titled P.T. (short for \\"Playable Teaser\\") was released on the PlayStation Store for PlayStation 4. Upon completion of the teaser it was revealed to be for a new Silent Hill game entitled Silent Hills, being developed by Kojima Productions using the Fox Engine, and a collaboration between Metal Gear series creator Hideo Kojima and Hollywood director Guillermo del Toro, featuring actor Norman Reedus. On September 1, 2014, Sony revealed during its pre-TGS press conference that P.T. had been downloaded over a million times and had been viewed over 30,000,000 times across platforms. During the 2015 San Francisco Film Festival on April 26, 2015, del Toro announced that he would no longer be involved in the project with Kojima, presumably due to Kojima's leaving of Konami.[28] Konami later released a statement confirming the departure of Reedus but clarified the series would continue to be developed, with no mention of the current status of Silent Hills.[29] On April 27, 2015, Konami confirmed that Silent Hills was cancelled, but was open to future collaborations with Reedus and del Toro.[30] The P.T. teaser was also pulled from the PlayStation Store and is no longer available for download.[31]\\r\\nAll the plots of the installments in the Silent Hill series, except Shattered Memories and The Room, share a common setting: the foggy rural American town of Silent Hill, which is a fictitious location set in the northeastern United States: some games specifically reference the town as being located in Maine, whereas in the film, the town is set in West Virginia. The town in the first three games was inspired by concepts of a small town in America as depicted by various media from various countries of origin. While some of the development planning is more reminiscent of that of a Japanese village, indirect influence comes from perhaps two factual American towns in particular: Cushing, Maine;[a] and Snoqualmie, Washington.[b] The town from the film series, however, was inspired by Centralia, Pennsylvania.[c] The series' player characters experience an occasional dark alteration of reality called the \\"Otherworld\\".[32] In that reality, physical law often does not apply,[33] with varying forms but most frequently ones whose physical appearance is based on that of Silent Hill, and the series' characters experience delusions and encounter tangible symbols of elements from their unconscious minds, mental states, and innermost thoughts when present in it,[33][34] manifested into the real world. The origin of these manifestations is a malevolent power native to Silent Hill, which materializes human thoughts; this force was formerly non-evil, but was corrupted by the occurrence of certain events in the area.[33] Recurring monsters include the Nurses who are included in almost every Silent Hill game; Pyramid Head, another recurring monster who became the series mascot; and Robbie the Rabbit, an amusement park mascot. A dog named Mira is also included in many joke endings. Another recurring plot trait in the Silent Hill series is a fictitious religious cult known only as The Order. The organization has certain members who act as antagonists in most of the series' installments (such as Dahila in the first and prequel, Claudia in 3, Walter in The Room, and Judge Holloway in Homecoming), and operates the \\"Wish House\\" (also called \\"Hope House\\"), an orphanage for poor and homeless children built by a charity organization called the \\"Silent Hill Smile Support Society\\".[35] The religion followed by the Order is focused on the worship of a chief deity,[36] who is named Samael but was always called \\"God\\".[37] The group's dogma is derived from a myth: the deity set out to create paradise, but ran out of power during the process; she will someday be resurrected, thus becoming able to finally create paradise and save mankind.[36] The town's cult repeatedly participates in illegal acts: ritual human sacrifices whose purpose is the deity's resurrection,[38] illegal drug trade,[39] and kidnapping and confinement of children in a facility to teach them its dogma through brainwashing, while presenting the facility as an orphanage.[35] Also repeatedly featured are various religious items with magical properties, appearing widely in the games of the series.[40]\\r\\nThree thematic elements consistently drive the narratives of Silent Hill games: the theme of a main protagonist who is depicted as an \\"everyman\\" (with the exception of Homecoming, where the protagonist is thought to be a soldier and the game's mechanics operate as such),[41] and the everyman's quest, either a search for a missing loved one [42] or a situation where the protagonist wanders into the town apparently by accident but is in fact being \\"summoned\\" by a spiritual force in the town. Multiple endings are a staple of the series, with all installments featuring some, the realization of which often depends on in-game actions performed by the player.[43][44] In all but two of the series' games, one of these endings is a joke ending in which the main protagonist comes in contact with unidentified flying objects: there is no joke ending in Silent Hill 4: The Room, and the only joke ending in Downpour is a surprise party for the player featuring characters from previous instalments of the franchise.[45]\\r\\nThe installments in the Silent Hill series contain various symbolisms. The symbols are images, sounds, objects, creatures, or situations, and represent concepts and facts, as well as feelings, emotions, and mental states of the characters.[46][47][48][49][50][51][52][53]\\r\\nThe installments in the Silent Hill series utilize a third-person view, with occasional fixed camera angles. While visibility is low due to the alternating fog and darkness, all of the series' player characters, except Henry Townshend of Silent Hill 4: The Room, are equipped with a flashlight and a portable device which warns the player of nearby monsters by emitting static (a portable radio in Origins and the first three titles, a walkie-talkie in Homecoming and Downpour, and a mobile phone in Shattered Memories).[54][55] The player characters of every Silent Hill game have access to a variety of melee weapons and firearms, with Origins and Downpour also featuring rudimentary hand-to-hand combat.[56] Shattered Memories is the sole exception: it is designed without combat and based around evasion of the creatures. Another key feature of the series' gameplay is puzzle-solving, which often results in the acquisition of an item essential to advance in the games.\\r\\nDevelopment of the Silent Hill series started in September 1996 with the beginning of the development of its first installment, Silent Hill.[57] The game was created by Team Silent, a group of staff members within the Konami Computer Entertainment Tokyo studio.[58][59][60] The new owners of its parent company Konami sought to produce a game that would be successful in the United States. For this reason, a Hollywood-like atmosphere was proposed for it. Despite the profit-oriented approach of the parent company, however, the developers of Silent Hill had much artistic freedom because the game was still produced as in the era of lower-budget 2D titles. Eventually, the development staff decided to ignore the limits of Konami's initial plan, and to make Silent Hill a game that would appeal to the emotions of players instead.[61]\\r\\nThe first installment's scenario was created by director Keiichiro Toyama.[62] The story of the second installment, Silent Hill 2, was conceived by CGI director Takayoshi Sato, who based it on the novel Crime and Punishment, with individual members of the team collaborating on the game's actual scenario;[63][64][65] the main writing was done by Hiroyuki Owaku and Sato.[63][64][66]\\r\\nThe first game, Silent Hill, utilizes real-time 3D environments. To mitigate limitations of the hardware, developers liberally used fog and darkness to muddle the graphics.[1]\\r\\nSato estimated the budget of the first installment at US$3ÿ5 million and Silent Hill 2's at US$7ÿ10 million.[64] He said that the development team intended to make Silent Hill a masterpiece rather than a traditional sales-oriented game, and that they opted for an engaging story, which would persist over time?ÿ similar to successful literature.[61]\\r\\nThe games are known to have drawn influence from media such as Jacob's Ladder, Phantoms, Session 9, Alien and Stephen King's The Mist largely through cultivating a technique of inducing fear through more psychological levels of perception, many sequences and tropes from these films share identical concepts.[67] The films of American filmmaker David Lynch are also acknowledged to have influenced the development team on the development of the series,[68][69] especially on the creation of Silent Hill 2.[69] Another major influence is Japanese horror, with comparisons made to classical Japanese Noh theatre and early 20th-century fiction writers such as the Japanese Edogawa Rampo.[70] The town of Silent Hill is small rural American town imagined by the creative team. It was based on Western literature and films, as well as on depictions of American towns in European and Russian culture.[61] The version of the town from the film adaptations of the first and third games is loosely based on the central Pennsylvania town of Centralia.[d] The Order's religion is based on various characteristics of different religions, such as the origins of Christianity, Aztec rituals, Shinto shrines, as well as Japanese folklore; the names of gods in the organization's religion were conceived by Hiroyuki Owaku, but they have Aztec and Mayan motifs, as Owaku used pronunciations from these civilizations as a reference.[36] Certain religious items appearing in the series were conceived by the team and for some others various religions were used as a basis: the evil spirit-dispelling substance Aglaophotis, which appears in the first installment and Silent Hill 3, is based on a herb of similar name and nature in the Kabbalah (Jewish mysticism); the name of the talisman called \\"Seal of Metatron\\" references the angel Metatron.[40]\\r\\nThe installments in the Silent Hill series feature various sound effects,[46][71] some of them being ambient, as well as silence;[71] the sound effects have been added with the intent of inducing certain emotions and feelings in the player,[46][71] such as urgency, displeasure,[71] or a sense of disturbance of their psyche.[46] According to the series' former sound director Akira Yamaoka, atmosphere is an emphasized element of the series which if it had not been given importance, the series' production would be impossible.[71] The games also feature soundtracks scored by Yamaoka.[72][73][74][75][76][77][78] The genres of the musical pieces range from industrial to rock and some pieces include vocals by voice actress Mary Elizabeth McGlynn.[42][74][75][76][77][78] Downpour and Book of Memories feature soundtracks scored by composer Daniel Licht;[20][79] Downpour includes music belonging to the industrial genre and vocals by McGlynn and band Korn.[79][80]\\r\\nSpin-off video games based on the series include the visual novel Play Novel: Silent Hill for the Game Boy Advance,[81][82] the arcade game Silent Hill: The Arcade,[83] and the mobile games Silent Hill: The Escape and Silent Hill: Orphan.[84]\\r\\nThe Silent Hill series has been universally praised for its graphics, atmosphere, and story. While the first three installments received critical acclaim, later games were less well received.[107]\\r\\nThe first installment in the series, Silent Hill, received positive reviews from critics on its release and was commercially successful. It is considered a defining title in the survival horror genre, moving away from B movie horror elements, toward a psychological style of horror emphasizing atmosphere.[1]\\r\\nSilent Hill 2 was risen by critical acclaim. It was named the fourteenth best game of the PS2 by IGN, saying \\"It preserved most of the original game's what-might-be-out-there fear, but with major advances to the graphics and sound, the game was able to deliver a far more immersive, frightful and compelling storyline.\\"[108] Silent Hill 2 is considered one of the best horror games of all time by many, as it features on several \\"best games ever\\" lists by critics.\\r\\nSilent Hill 3 was mostly well received by critics, especially in its presentation, including its environments, graphics and audio, as well as the overall horror elements and themes that are continued from past installments.[109][110] The game received praise for its story, which was a continuation of the first game's story.[111][112]\\r\\nBeginning with Silent Hill 4: The Room, the games have been slightly less well received; many reviewers criticized the increased emphasis on combat, compromising the horror aspect of gameplay. 1UP.com said that Konami went \\"backwards\\" with this game,[113] though reviewers such as GameSpot still praised the game's atmosphere.[114]\\r\\nOrigins received positive reviews despite some criticism. It was praised for going back to the old gameplay formulaaccording to IGN, \\"Origins does justice to the series as a whole.\\" However, some criticized the series' increasing predictability. GameSpot stated that \\"This old fog needs to learn some new tricks.\\"[115]\\r\\nHomecoming received favorable reviews. It was praised for its graphics and audio, but the horror and gameplay have been met with mixed reactions. Some critics, such as GameSpot, felt that it lost \\"the psychological horror factor that the series is so well-known for.\\"[116] Some critics were harsher; IGN called the game a \\"letdown.\\"[117]\\r\\nShattered Memories received more positive reviews. GameSpot praised the game's effort at reinventing the first game's plot, rather than being a simple remake.[118]\\r\\nDownpour received mixed reviews. While certain critics praised the soundtrack and story elements, it has been let down by \\"sluggish combat\\" and \\"occasional freezes\\".\\r\\nHD Collection has also received mixed reviews. Critics criticised towards many technical issues plaguing both games and artistic changes made to the games.\\r\\nBook of Memories, while receiving mixed reviews, has been the least well received game in the series, with most criticism regarding the game's shift in genre.\\r\\nThe Duffer Brothers have cited Silent Hill as an influence on their 2016 television show Stranger Things. They noted that it inspired the Upside Down, a parallel dimension in the series.[119]\\r\\nPrint media of the Silent Hill franchise include a series of comic book adaptations;[120][121][122] the novels Silent Hill, Silent Hill 2 and Silent Hill 3 by Sadamu Yamashita, which are novelizations of their eponymous video games;[123] the novel Silent Hill: Betrayal by Shaun M. Jooste, which is a unique tale set within the titular town;[124][125][126][127] the guide book Lost Memories; and the art book Drawing Block: Silent Hill 3 Program.\\r\\nA film adaptation of the first game in the series, Silent Hill, was released in 2006. It was adapted and directed by the French film director, producer and writer Christophe Gans. Gans himself is a big fan of the Silent Hill game series. A second film adaptation, titled Silent Hill: Revelation and based on Silent Hill 3,[128] was released in 2012. The former received mixed reviews, while the latter received generally negative reviews.","input":"Which came first silent hill game or movie?"},{"output":"\\"The Telltale Head\\"","context":"Robert Underdunk Terwilliger Jr., PhD, better known as Sideshow Bob, is a recurring character in the animated television series The Simpsons. He is voiced by Kelsey Grammer and first appeared briefly in the episode \\"The Telltale Head\\". Bob is a self-proclaimed genius who is a graduate of Yale University, a member of the Republican Party, and a champion of high culture. He began his career as a sidekick on Krusty the Clown's television show, but after enduring constant abuse, Bob attempted to frame his employer for armed robbery in \\"Krusty Gets Busted\\". The plan was foiled by Bart Simpson, and Sideshow Bob was sent to prison.\\r\\nBob made his second major appearance in season three's \\"Black Widower\\"; the writers echoed the premise of the Coyote chasing the Road Runner by having Bob unexpectedly insert himself into Bart's life, threatening to disrupt ÿ and sometimes end ÿ it. In each appearance thereafter, Bob has assumed the role on The Simpsons of an evil genius. Episodes in which he is a central character typically involve Sideshow Bob being released from prison and executing an elaborate revenge plan, usually foiled by Bart and Lisa. His plans often involve murder and destruction, usually targeted at Bart or, less often, Krusty, though these plans often involve targeting the entire Simpson family. In 2015, however, during the \\"Treehouse of Horror\\" segment, \\"Wanted: Dead, Then Alive\\", Bob finally gets his wish of killing Bart, commenting that he spent 24 years trying to kill a ten-year-old child; however, he becomes bored with Bart dead, so he brings him back to life so that he can repeatedly kill Bart over and over again.[1][2][3]\\r\\nSideshow Bob shares some personality traits of Grammer's character Frasier Crane from the sitcoms Cheers and Frasier, and has been described as \\"Frasier pickled in arsenic\\".[4] Several parallels have been explicitly drawn in The Simpsons between Bob and Frasier Crane?ÿ Bob's brother Cecil and his father were played by David Hyde Pierce and John Mahoney respectively, echoing the roles they played in Frasier. Grammer, who based Bob's voice on that of actor Ellis Rabb, has been praised for his portrayals of the character. In 2006, he won an Emmy for Outstanding Voice-Over Performance for his work in the episode \\"The Italian Bob\\".\\r\\nAs of December 2017, Bob has had speaking appearances in 20 episodes and been featured in 13; the most recent of the latter, \\"Gone Boy\\", aired during the 29th season. In addition to his recurring role in the series, Sideshow Bob has made several appearances in other Simpsons media. He appears in the Simpsons Comics, cameos in the 2007 video game The Simpsons Game, and stars as the main antagonist in The Simpsons Ride at Universal Studios' theme parks. A lover of Gilbert and Sullivan operettas, Sideshow Bob is also known for his singing voice; several of Grammer's performances have been included in The Simpsons musical compilations.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe character of Sideshow Bob began his career as the non-speaking sidekick on Krusty the Clown's television show.[5] The episode \\"Brother from Another Series\\" (season eight, 1997) reveals that Bob only received the job after his younger brother Cecil failed an audition, because Krusty considered Bob to be a perfect comic foil.[6] After repeated instances of abuse, including being shot from a cannon and hit constantly with pies, the Yale-educated Bob became angry at Krusty and resentful of the clown's success. In \\"Krusty Gets Busted\\" (season one, 1990) Bob disguised himself as Krusty and framed him for armed robbery of the Kwik-E-Mart. After Krusty is arrested, Bob takes control of the show, introducing children to elements of high culture. However, Bob's reign is short-lived; Bart Simpson exposes him as the robber, Krusty is released, and Bob is fired and sent to jail.[7]\\r\\nIn \\"Black Widower\\" (season three, 1992), Bob's first major appearance after framing Krusty, he is released from prison and marries Bart's aunt Selma Bouvier. As part of a scheme to inherit money she has invested in the stock market, Bob attempts to blow Selma up during their honeymoon. Bart again foils the plan and Sideshow Bob returns to prison.[8] After being paroled from prison in \\"Cape Feare\\" (season five, 1993), Bob targets Bart directly, threatening him repeatedly and forcing the Simpsons into hiding as part of the Witness Relocation Program. Bob follows them to their hideout, a houseboat on Terror Lake, and, after subduing the family, prepares to kill Bart. He allows a final request, however, and Bart asks to hear Bob sing the entire score of H.M.S. Pinafore. The delaying tactic leads to Bob's third arrest.[9]\\r\\nBob is released from prison once again in \\"Sideshow Bob Roberts\\" (season six, 1994), and runs for Mayor of Springfield as the Republican Party candidate. He defeats Democratic Party incumbent Joe Quimby in a landslide, but Bart and Lisa discover that Bob rigged the election, leading to another incarceration.[10] Bob escapes from prison for the first time in \\"Sideshow Bob's Last Gleaming\\" (season seven, 1995), and threatens to blow up Springfield with a nuclear bomb unless the city stops broadcasting all television shows. He is thwarted when he finds out that the bomb itself is a dud, then kidnaps Bart and flies the Wright Brothers' plane in an attempt to kill himself, Bart, and Krusty (who is hiding inside a shack, improvising a performance on the Emergency Broadcast System). This too is thwarted, and Bob returns to prison.[11] In the following season, Bob takes advantage of the prison's work release program, and appears to be genuinely redeemed. In \\"Brother from Another Series\\", Reverend Lovejoy declares him a changed man and recommends him for a work release opportunity. Bob is discharged from prison into the care of his brother Cecil, who is Springfield's chief hydrological and hydrodynamical engineer. However, the scheming Cecil, still smarting over his failed audition for Krusty, tries to frame Bob by sabotaging the Springfield Dam. Bob, Bart, and Lisa together stop Cecil and save the town, and both brothers, despite Bob's genuine innocence, are sent to prison.[6]\\r\\nIn \\"Day of the Jackanapes\\" (season 12, 2001), Bob discovers that Krusty has erased all of the early shows featuring Sideshow Bob as Krusty himself is declaring his fifth and final retirement after being annoyed with the network executives. Bob is released from prison and develops a plot to kill Krusty using Bart as a suicide bomber during Krusty's retirement special. Just as Bob was to succeed, he overhears Krusty publicly holding himself responsible for turning Bob into a criminal, expressing his regret of mistreating Bob during his years as Sideshow. To appease things, Krusty sings himself a song on Bob's behalf, and being touched by this, Bob decides to abort his plan of attempted murder and reconciles with Krusty, although he is returned to prison for it.[12] Bob's aid is sought by Springfield police in \\"The Great Louse Detective\\" (season 14, 2002). After an attempt is made on Homer Simpson's life, Bob is released from prison to help find the culprit. When the mystery is solved, he returns to murder Bart. However, Bob finds he is \\"accustomed to [Bart's] face\\" and cannot do it.[13]\\r\\nIt is revealed in \\"The Italian Bob\\" (season 17, 2005) that Bob has moved to Italy to make a fresh start. He is elected mayor of a village in Tuscany and marries a local woman named Francesca, with whom he has a son named Gino. The Simpson family, in Italy to retrieve a car for Mr. Burns, encounters him by chance. Bob welcomes them with hospitality on the condition that they not reveal his felonious past; however, a drunken Lisa jokes about Bob's criminal deeds, alienating Bob from his citizens. He, his wife and son swear a vendetta on the Simpsons.[14] The entire Terwilliger family returns in \\"Funeral for a Fiend\\" (season 19, 2007) in which Bob's father, Robert Terwilliger Sr., and mother, Dame Judith Underdunk, make their first appearances. Bob fakes his own death and locks Bart in the coffin, which he attempts to cremate at the otherwise empty funeral home as all the Terwilligers laugh maniacally. They are foiled by Lisa and the rest of the Simpson family and sent to prison.[15] Bob briefly returns in the season 20 episode \\"Wedding for Disaster\\", when Bart and Lisa initially suspect Bob of kidnapping Homer to prevent him from attending his second wedding with Marge (due to a keychain they found had an 'S' and a 'B'), but Krusty provides him with an alibi, explaining to the kids that Bob was with him the whole day. Eventually, Bob and the kids discover the true culprits, Patty and Selma.[16]\\r\\nBob reappears again in the episode \\"The Bob Next Door\\" (season 21, 2010), where he switches faces with his prison cellmate Walt Warren. Bob returns to Springfield and moves into the house next to the Simpson family, assuming Walt's identity. He exploits this to make his latest attempt to kill Bart legally over state lines, but is foiled again and gets taken away by state police.[17] Bob briefly appears in \\"At Long Last Leave\\" (season 23, 2012), where he attends a town meeting to decide if the Simpson family should be banished from Springfield, and is one of many who express their desire for it to happen.[18] In \\"The Man Who Grew Too Much\\" (season 25, 2014), he was revealed as a Chief Scientist for a genetic engineering company named Monsarno, having received the position after he was selected as a test subject and published the results of the experiments to which he was subjected. He and Lisa bond over their interest in Walt Whitman, but Bob soon reveals that he has also genetically modified himself to give himself various superhuman abilities, intending to acquire DNA from the relics of various historical figures stored in the Springfield Museum to make himself a superhuman dictator. However, after he is provoked into a fight, he realizes that he has become a crude monster and jumps off the Springfield Dam, surviving because the gills he gave himself allow him to survive in the lake.\\r\\nBob briefly appears in \\"Clown in the Dumps\\" (season 26, 2014), where offered his condolences to Krusty after the death of his father, Rabbi Krustofsky. He also made a brief appearance on \\"Blazed and Confused\\" (season 26, 2014), where he meets Mr. Lassen, Bart's former teacher, who was now reduced to working in prison as a guard after Bart's actions got him fired. Despite Lassen's offer to get him out, Bob rejects the idea that they team up as Lassen thought that they would take turns gutting Bart. In Treehouse of Horror XXVI segment \\"Wanted: Dead, then Alive\\", Bob successfully kills Bart, but finds his life so meaningless in Bart's absence that he creates a machine to bring Bart back to life so that he can keep killing his enemy over and over, until the other Simpsons rescue Bart and Bart uses the resurrection machine to turn Bob into a twisted amalgamation of creatures. Bob has made a brief appearance in \\"Gal of Constant Sorrow\\", grunting in annoyance as he wipes off Bart's graffiti from Hettie Mae Boggs' promo poster on the wall along with Snake Jailbird and other inmates. Bob appeared in the 29th season in Gone Boy when he tries to track down the whereabouts of Bart Simpson.\\r\\nIn addition to regular roles in the television series, Sideshow Bob has made several appearances in other Simpsons media. Kelsey Grammer recorded several Sideshow Bob lines for The Simpsons Movie, but the scene was cut.[19] Sideshow Bob has made regular appearances in the monthly Simpsons Comics,[20] and several of Kelsey Grammer's singing performances have been included in The Simpsons CD compilations. His performance of the H.M.S. Pinafore in \\"Cape Feare\\" was later included on the album Go Simpsonic with The Simpsons,[21] and the song \\"The Very Reason That I Live\\" from \\"The Great Louse Detective\\" was included on The Simpsons: Testify.[22] A previously unaired song, \\"Hullaba Lula\\", originally written for \\"Day of the Jackanapes\\", was also included on that compilation.[22] The producers modeled the song after \\"Zip-a-Dee-Doo-Dah\\", but were forced to remove the song from the episode when they were unable to obtain the rights to it.[23]\\r\\nIn The Simpsons Game, released in November 2007, Bob has a speaking cameo appearance at the end of the chapter titled \\"Invasion of the Yokel-Snatchers\\" in which he was working with Kang and Kodos.[24] Sideshow Bob appears in the 1991 The Simpsons Arcade Game, on the fifth level where he is pulling a cart containing a roast chicken health pick up. Bob was also included as a level boss in the 1991 video game Bart vs. the Space Mutants.[25] Sideshow Bob plays a lead role in The Simpsons Ride, which opened at Universal Studios Florida and Universal Studios Hollywood in May 2008. Voiced by Grammer, he is the main villain in the ride, having escaped from prison to get revenge on the Simpson family.[26][27]\\r\\nIn The Simpsons: Tapped Out, a city builder game released in February 2012, Sideshow Bob occurs as a bonus. Popping up every couple hours, the players are given a chance to tap on him to receive a small sum of money, and \\"send\\" him to jail. In a later update to the game, Sideshow Bob also has a stand in Krusty Land, where player get to pop balloons for a chance to win donuts and Krusty tickets. The Simpsons: Tapped Out Terwilligers content update was released April 14, 2015 and has several references to the Simpsons episodes with Sideshow Bob. This game event was split in 3 acts and ended June 4, 2015. New characters, skins and costumes include Sideshow Bob, Cecil Terwilliger, Gino Terwilliger, Francesca Terwilliger, Dr. Robert Terwilliger Sr., Judith Underdunk, Captain Bob and Opera Krusty. Most of the event action takes place at Monsarno Research and Opera House.\\r\\nSideshow Bob first appeared in \\"The Telltale Head\\", the eighth episode of season one. His design was relatively simple compared to later incarnations, and his hairstyle was rounded. However, towards the end of the episode, he appears again, in a panning shot of a crowd, with his familiar hairstyle.[28] His first major appearance was in season one's twelfth episode \\"Krusty Gets Busted\\", written by Jay Kogen and Wallace Wolodarsky.[29] Bob's design was updated for \\"Krusty Gets Busted\\"; as the episode's animation style evolved, director Brad Bird made the character of Sideshow Bob sleeker and more refined, to fit Grammer's voice technique.[30] Following the re-design, animators tried to redraw his scenes in \\"The Telltale Head\\", but had insufficient time before the show was produced.[28]\\r\\nBob has no lines of dialogue during the first half of \\"Krusty Gets Busted\\"; the character's only communication takes the form of a slide whistle. This was designed to make Bob appear simplistic, so that when he finally spoke, viewers would be surprised to hear his sophisticated vocabulary.[31] An early version of the script for \\"Krusty Gets Busted\\" called for James Earl Jones to voice Bob, but the producers instead selected Kelsey Grammer.[32] For Bob's voice, Grammer performed an impression of theatre actor and director Ellis Rabb. Grammer had once worked for Rabb, whose \\"lamenting tones became [the] foundation for Sideshow Bob\\".[33][34]\\r\\nSideshow Bob's full name is Robert Underdunk Terwilliger.[35] His last name was first revealed in \\"Black Widower\\"[8] while his middle name was first mentioned in \\"Sideshow Bob Roberts\\".[10] Competing theories as to the origin of his name exist; some sources say he was named after the character Dr. Terwilliker, a megalomaniac outwitted by a boy named Bart in the film The 5,000 Fingers of Dr. T by Dr. Seuss, but others say he was named after Terwilliger Boulevard in Portland, Oregon.[36][37][38] Yet another theory is that he was named after Sergeant Terwilliger and Mrs. Underdunk in the pilot episode of the TV show Hunter.[39]\\r\\nFor season three's \\"Black Widower\\", the writers echoed the premise of Wile E. Coyote chasing the Road Runner from Looney Tunes cartoons by having Bob unexpectedly insert himself into Bart's life and attempt to kill him. Executive producer Al Jean has compared Bob's character to that of Wile E. Coyote, noting that both are intelligent, yet always foiled by what they perceive as an inferior intellect.[40] For \\"Black Widower\\", director David Silverman updated the character model to reflect the animation of director Brad Bird.[30] A rule for earlier episodes featuring Bob called for a recap of his evil deeds; this was dropped after season eight's \\"Brother from Another Series\\" when the chronology became too lengthy.[41] Another rule established by the show's writers mandated Bob's return to prison at the end of each episode, although this pattern was abandoned in later episodes like \\"The Great Louse Detective\\" and \\"The Italian Bob\\".[41]\\r\\nBill Oakley and Josh Weinstein, the showrunners for the seventh and eighth seasons, believed that every season of the show should contain an episode starring Sideshow Bob. However, by the seventh season Bob had already been the focus of four stories, and writers were having trouble developing new ways to include him.[42] Weinstein describes Bob's dialogue as difficult to write, due to his unique and refined style of speaking.[43] Despite these challenges, however, creators of The Simpsons usually look forward to \\"Sideshow Bob episodes\\"; the writers consider them enjoyable to write,[44] and former director Dominic Polcino describes them as \\"a treat\\" to work on.[45]\\r\\nKelsey Grammer initially expected Sideshow Bob to be a one-time role, and calls him \\"the most popular character I've ever played\\".[33] Grammer usually joins the show's \\"table readings\\" (wherein cast members read each script together for the first time),[46] and former executive producer David Mirkin described working with Grammer as very pleasant, due to his lively sense of humor. Grammer, Mirkin says, is capable of perfect readings, but noted that the actor dislikes performing Sideshow Bob's evil laugh.[47] In a 2007 interview, Simpsons executive producer Al Jean listed Grammer as one of his favorite guest stars (second only to Phil Hartman), saying \\"his voice is so rich.\\"[48] Writer George Meyer commented that \\"writing for Kelsey is great, he can give the kind of purple, florid, melodramatic speeches that most of the characters would never give. And he can sing.\\"[35]\\r\\nThe show's writers admire Grammer's singing voice, and try to include a song for each appearance.[46] Alf Clausen, the primary composer for The Simpsons, commented that \\"[Grammer] is so great. He's just amazing. You can tell he has this love of musical theater and he has the vocal instrument to go with it, so I know whatever I write is going to be sung the way I've heard it.\\"[49] Clausen composed Sideshow Bob's theme, which is played whenever Bob gets out of prison or is about to commit a sinister action, and was first used in \\"Cape Feare\\". It is based on the score of the film Cape Fear, composed by Bernard Herrmann.[46] The musical score for \\"Cape Feare\\" earned Clausen an Emmy Award nomination for Outstanding Dramatic Underscore?ÿ Series in 1994.[50]\\r\\nBob's prisoner number is often 24601, which is Jean Valjean's prisoner number in Les Misrables.[51] Another trademark for Bob is a visual gag of stepping on a rake and being struck in the face with its handle; this joke first appeared in \\"Cape Feare\\". To fill time, the writers added nine consecutive iterations of the same joke in quick succession.[46] The sequence has become known as the \\"rake joke\\" and was described by Entertainment Weekly as showing \\"genius in its repetitive stupidity.\\"[52]\\r\\nThe episode \\"Brother from Another Series\\" introduces Bob's brother Cecil. After writer Ken Keeler was assigned to write an episode featuring Sideshow Bob, he drew inspiration from episodes of Frasier. He decided to incorporate elements of Grammer's other show into the character of Sideshow Bob, and designed Cecil to resemble Grammer's brother on Frasier.[44] Cecil is voiced by David Hyde Pierce, who portrayed Frasier Crane's brother Niles. Pierce commented, \\"Normally, I would not do something like this. But how often do you get a chance to work with an actor like Kelsey Grammer and, more importantly, play his brother?\\"[53] Several of Frasier's producers were asked to review the original script and provide feedback. Their comments were positive; they only expressed concern with a very brief scene in which Cecil talks to a visible character whom he refers to as \\"Maris\\". In Frasier, Maris Crane is an unseen character, and the producers of Frasier asked that the scene be removed.[44] Many of the interactions between Bob and Cecil were based on those of Niles and Frasier.[44] Cecil was drawn to resemble David Hyde Pierce, while retaining a visual similarity to Sideshow Bob. According to director Pete Michels, it was difficult to draw Bob and Cecil standing together, because of their comically oversized feet.[54]\\r\\nCecil returns in season 19's \\"Funeral for a Fiend\\", which introduces the brothers' previously unseen father, Dr. Robert Terwilliger, played by John Mahoney.[55] Mahoney portrayed Martin Crane, the father of Grammer's and Pierce's characters in Frasier.[56] Whereas in Frasier, Mahoney played the \\"down-to-Earth, average guy\\" to Grammer's and Hyde Pierce's \\"uppity snobs\\", Robert Terwilliger Sr. was portrayed as equally highbrow as Bob.[57] His wife, Bob's mother, is Dame Judith Underdunk, \\"the finest classical actress of her generation.\\" She sports the same curly spiked hair as her two sons. Bob also has a wife named Francesca (voiced by Maria Grazia Cucinotta) and a son named Gino, both of whom were introduced in season 17 episode \\"The Italian Bob\\" and returned for \\"Funeral for a Fiend\\".[14]\\r\\nThe character of Sideshow Bob and Grammer's voicework have received many accolades. In 2006 IGN listed him as the second-best \\"peripheral character\\" on The Simpsons, commenting that Bob is \\"a man of contradictions; his goofy appearance, complete with palm tree like hair, doesn't seem to match up to the well spoken and even musically talented maniac.\\"[59] Also that year, Wizard Magazine rated Bob as the 66th greatest villain of all time.[60] Adam Finley of TV Squad wrote that \\"that baritone voice, the Shakespearean delivery, and the ability to go from calm and collected to stark raving mad all within the same second make Sideshow Bob one of the best recurring characters on the show.\\"[61]\\r\\nKelsey Grammer has consistently received praise for his voicework, and has been described as \\"brilliant\\",[62] \\"inimitable\\"[63] and \\"a feast of mid-Atlantic anglophilia\\".[64] In 2006, Grammer won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Voice-Over Performance for his role in \\"The Italian Bob\\"; he had previously won four awards in the Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series category for his portrayal of the title role on Frasier.[65] In 2008, Grammer was included in Entertainment Weekly's list of the sixteen best Simpsons guest stars; Hyde Pierce was also included in that list.[66] Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly wrote that \\"Kelsey Grammer's grand voice-performance as Sideshow Bob is Frasier pickled in arsenic.\\"[4] In her book My Life as a 10-Year-Old Boy, Nancy Cartwright (who performs the voice of Bart Simpson) wrote that \\"Kelsey Grammer scores big-time by injecting caustic, bitter, contemptuous and deliciously vile energy into his rendition of Sideshow Bob. Springfield just wouldn't be the same without him.\\"[58]\\r\\nMost of the episodes featuring Bob have been well received by fans and critics. \\"Cape Feare\\" is generally regarded as one of the best episodes of The Simpsons[67] and placed third on Entertainment Weekly's 2003 list of the show's top 25 episodes.[52] IGN considers it the best episode of the fifth season.[68] In 2007, Vanity Fair called it the show's fourth-best episode, because of its \\"masterful integration of filmic parody and a recurring character\\".[69] Ben Rayner of the Toronto Star listed \\"Cape Feare\\", \\"Sideshow Bob's Last Gleaming\\" and \\"Brother From Another Series\\" among the best episodes of the series, writing \\"forget Frasier, these are Kelsey Grammer's best roles.\\"[70] \\"The Italian Bob\\" and its writer John Frink won a Writers Guild of America Award in 2007 in the animation category.[71] In December 2009, Robert Canning of IGN ranked the ten episodes to feature Bob that had aired at the time. The first five Bob episodes took up the top five, with \\"Cape Feare\\" being ranked first. \\"The Italian Bob\\" was ranked tenth, with the explanation that \\"All the things we love about a Sideshow Bob episode?ÿ the vengeance, the familiar settings and characters, the elaborate scheming?ÿ were missing from this half-hour. Without it, Bob wasn't nearly as entertaining, and the episode didn't result in a whole lot of laughs.\\" He noted that only \\"The Italian Bob\\" and the ninth ranked \\"Funeral for a Fiend\\" were \\"the only ones I'd consider clunkers. The remaining episodes are all quite fun.\\"[72]\\r\\nIn Planet Simpson, author Chris Turner writes that Bob is built into a highbrow snob and conservative Republican so that the writers can continually use him as a strawman and pincushion. He represents high culture while Krusty represents low culture, and Bart, stuck in between, always wins out.[64] In the book Leaving Springfield, David L. G. Arnold comments that Bart is a product of a \\"mass-culture upbringing\\" and thus is Bob's enemy.[73] Frustrated by his early role as the target of \\"Krusty's cheap gags\\", Bob frames Krusty and takes over the show. He changes the content of that show to present readings of classic literature and segments examining the emotional lives of pre-teens. He believes that by exposing the kids to high culture he will improve their lives.[74] Arnold writes that \\"Bob's own conscience and morality are clearly unaffected by the high culture he represents.\\" He also tries to \\"manipulate the tastes of the masses\\" by becoming a criminal mastermind.[74] Arnold believes that this is most apparent in \\"Sideshow Bob Roberts\\", wherein he rigs the election to become the mayor of Springfield. When accused of election fraud, he rants, \\"Your guilty consciences may force you to vote Democratic, but secretly you yearn for a cold-hearted Republican who'll cut taxes, brutalize criminals, and rule you like a king! You need me, Springfield!\\" He considers himself a member of the social elite, and happily uses Machiavellian methods to acquire and maintain power.[75]\\r\\nBob's intelligence serves him in many ways. During the episode \\"Cape Feare\\", for example, the parole board asks Bob why he has a tattoo that says \\"Die, Bart, Die\\". Bob replies that it is German for \\"The, Bart, The\\"; members of the board are impressed by his reasoning.[76] Believing that \\"nobody who speaks German could be an evil man\\", they release him.[9] However, his love of high culture is sometimes used against him. In the same episode, Bob agrees to perform the operetta H.M.S. Pinafore in its entirety as a last request for Bart. The tactic stalls Bob long enough for the police to arrest him.[76]","input":"When did sideshow bob first appear in the simpsons?"},{"output":"from the intercommunal violence in Mandatory Palestine between Israelis and Arabs from 1920 and erupted into full-scale hostilities in the 1947ÿ48 civil war","context":"","input":"How did conflict between israel and palestine begin?"},{"output":"parts of Europe that had smaller trade relations with their neighbours, including the majority of the Basque Country, isolated parts of Belgium and the Netherlands, and isolated alpine villages throughout the continent","context":"The Black Death, also known as the Black Plague, Great Plague or simply Plague, was one of the most devastating pandemics in human history, resulting in the deaths of an estimated 75 to 200 million people in Eurasia and peaking in Europe from 1347 to 1351.[1][2][3] The bacterium Yersinia pestis, which results in several forms of plague, is believed to have been the cause.[4] The plague created a series of religious, social, and economic upheavals, which had profound effects on the course of European history.\\r\\nThe Black Death is thought to have originated in the dry plains of Central Asia, where it then travelled along the Silk Road, reaching Crimea by 1343.[5] From there, it was most likely carried by Oriental rat fleas living on the black rats that were regular passengers on merchant ships, spreading throughout the Mediterranean and Europe.\\r\\nThe Black Death is estimated to have killed 30ÿ60% of Europe's total population.[6] In total, the plague may have reduced the world population from an estimated 450?million down to 350ÿ375 million in the 14th century.[7] It took 200?years for the world population to recover to its previous level.[8][9] The plague recurred as outbreaks in Europe until the 19th century.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe plague disease, caused by Yersinia pestis, is enzootic (commonly present) in populations of fleas carried by ground rodents, including marmots, in various areas including Central Asia, Kurdistan, Western Asia, Northern India and Uganda.[10] Due to climate change in Asia, rodents began to flee the dried out grasslands to more populated areas, spreading the disease.[11] Nestorian graves dating to 1338ÿ1339 near Lake Issyk Kul in Kyrgyzstan have inscriptions referring to plague and are thought by many epidemiologists to mark the outbreak of the epidemic, from which it could easily have spread to China and India.[12] In October 2010, medical geneticists suggested that all three of the great waves of the plague originated in China.[13] In China, the 13th-century Mongol conquest caused a decline in farming and trading. However, economic recovery had been observed at the beginning of the 14th?century. In the 1330s, a large number of natural disasters and plagues led to widespread famine, starting in 1331, with a deadly plague arriving soon after.[14] Epidemics that may have included plague killed an estimated 25?million Chinese and other Asians during the 15?years before it reached Constantinople in 1347.[15][16]\\r\\nThe disease may have travelled along the Silk Road with Mongol armies and traders or it could have come via ship.[17] By the end of 1346, reports of plague had reached the seaports of Europe: \\"India was depopulated, Tartary, Mesopotamia, Syria, Armenia were covered with dead bodies\\".[18]\\r\\nPlague was reportedly first introduced to Europe via Genoese traders at the port city of Kaffa in the Crimea in 1347. After a protracted siege, during which the Mongol army under Jani Beg was suffering from the disease, the army catapulted infected corpses over the city walls of Kaffa to infect the inhabitants. The Genoese traders fled, taking the plague by ship into Sicily and the south of Europe, whence it spread north.[19] Whether or not this hypothesis is accurate, it is clear that several existing conditions such as war, famine, and weather contributed to the severity of the Black Death.\\r\\nGeoffrey the Baker, Chronicon Angliae\\r\\nThere appear to have been several introductions into Europe. The plague reached Sicily in October 1347, carried by twelve Genoese galleys,[20] and rapidly spread all over the island. Galleys from Kaffa reached Genoa and Venice in January 1348, but it was the outbreak in Pisa a few weeks later that was the entry point to northern Italy. Towards the end of January, one of the galleys expelled from Italy arrived in Marseille.[21]\\r\\nFrom Italy, the disease spread northwest across Europe, striking France, Spain, Portugal and England by June 1348, then turned and spread east through Germany and Scandinavia from 1348 to 1350. It was introduced in Norway in 1349 when a ship landed at Ask?y, then spread to Bj?rgvin (modern Bergen) and Iceland.[22] Finally it spread to northwestern Russia in 1351. The plague was somewhat less common in parts of Europe that had smaller trade relations with their neighbours, including the majority of the Basque Country, isolated parts of Belgium and the Netherlands, and isolated alpine villages throughout the continent.[23][24]\\r\\nModern researchers do not think that the plague ever became endemic in Europe or its rat population. The disease repeatedly wiped out the rodent carriers so that the fleas died out until a new outbreak from Central Asia repeated the process. The outbreaks have been shown to occur roughly 15 years after a warmer and wetter period in areas where plague is endemic in other species such as gerbils.[25][26]\\r\\nThe plague struck various regions in the Middle East during the pandemic, leading to serious depopulation and permanent change in both economic and social structures. As it spread from China with the Mongols to a Chinese trading post in Crimea, called Kaffa, used by the Republic of Genoa. From there the disease, infected rodents infecting new rodents, entered the region from southern Russia also. By autumn 1347, the plague reached Alexandria in Egypt, through the port's trade with Constantinople, and ports on the Black Sea. During 1347, the disease travelled eastward to Gaza, and north along the eastern coast to cities in Lebanon, Syria and Palestine, including Ashkelon, Acre, Jerusalem, Sidon, Damascus, Homs, and Aleppo. In 1348ÿ1349, the disease reached Antioch. The city's residents fled to the north, However most of them ended up dying during the journey.[27]\\r\\nMecca became infected in 1349. During the same year, records show the city of Mawsil (Mosul) suffered a massive epidemic, and the city of Baghdad experienced a second round of the disease.\\r\\nContemporary accounts of the plague are often varied or imprecise. The most commonly noted symptom was the appearance of buboes (or gavocciolos) in the groin, the neck and armpits, which oozed pus and bled when opened.[28] Boccaccio's description is graphic:\\r\\nIn men and women alike it first betrayed itself by the emergence of certain tumours in the groin or armpits, some of which grew as large as a common apple, others as an egg...From the two said parts of the body this deadly gavocciolo soon began to propagate and spread itself in all directions indifferently; after which the form of the malady began to change, black spots or livid making their appearance in many cases on the arm or the thigh or elsewhere, now few and large, now minute and numerous. As the gavocciolo had been and still was an infallible token of approaching death, such also were these spots on whomsoever they showed themselves.[29]\\r\\nThe only medical detail that is questionable in Boccaccio's description is that the gavocciolo was an 'infallible token of approaching death', as, if the bubo discharges, recovery is possible.[30]\\r\\nThis was followed by acute fever and vomiting of blood. Most victims died two to seven days after initial infection. Freckle-like spots and rashes,[31] which could have been caused by flea-bites, were identified as another potential sign of the plague.\\r\\nSome accounts, like that of Lodewijk Heyligen, whose master the Cardinal Colonna died of the plague in 1348, noted a distinct form of the disease that infected the lungs and led to respiratory problems[28] and is identified with pneumonic plague.\\r\\nIt is said that the plague takes three forms. In the first people suffer an infection of the lungs, which leads to breathing difficulties. Whoever has this corruption or contamination to any extent cannot escape but will die within two days. Another form...in which boils erupt under the armpits,...a third form in which people of both sexes are attacked in the groin.[32]\\r\\nMedical knowledge had stagnated during the Middle Ages. The most authoritative account at the time came from the medical faculty in Paris in a report to the king of France that blamed the heavens, in the form of a conjunction of three planets in 1345 that caused a \\"great pestilence in the air\\".[34] This report became the first and most widely circulated of a series of plague tracts that sought to give advice to sufferers. That the plague was caused by bad air became the most widely accepted theory. Today, this is known as the miasma theory. The word plague had no special significance at this time, and only the recurrence of outbreaks during the Middle Ages gave it the name that has become the medical term.\\r\\nThe importance of hygiene was recognised only in the nineteenth century; until then it was common that the streets were filthy, with live animals of all sorts around and human parasites abounding. A transmissible disease will spread easily in such conditions. One development as a result of the Black Death was the establishment of the idea of quarantine in Dubrovnik in 1377 after continuing outbreaks.[35]\\r\\nThe dominant explanation for the Black Death is the plague theory, which attributes the outbreak to Yersinia pestis, also responsible for an epidemic that began in southern China in 1865, eventually spreading to India. The investigation of the pathogen that caused the 19th-century plague was begun by teams of scientists who visited Hong Kong in 1894, among whom was the French-Swiss bacteriologist Alexandre Yersin, after whom the pathogen was named Yersinia pestis.[36] The mechanism by which Y. pestis was usually transmitted was established in 1898 by Paul-Louis Simond and was found to involve the bites of fleas whose midguts had become obstructed by replicating Y. pestis several days after feeding on an infected host. This blockage results in starvation and aggressive feeding behaviour by the fleas, which repeatedly attempt to clear their blockage by regurgitation, resulting in thousands of plague bacteria being flushed into the feeding site, infecting the host. The bubonic plague mechanism was also dependent on two populations of rodents: one resistant to the disease, which act as hosts, keeping the disease endemic, and a second that lack resistance. When the second population dies, the fleas move on to other hosts, including people, thus creating a human epidemic.[36]\\r\\nThe historian Francis Aidan Gasquet wrote about the Great Pestilence in 1893[37] and suggested that \\"it would appear to be some form of the ordinary Eastern or bubonic plague\\". He was able to adopt the epidemiology of the bubonic plague for the Black Death for the second edition in 1908, implicating rats and fleas in the process, and his interpretation was widely accepted for other ancient and medieval epidemics, such as the Justinian plague that was prevalent in the Eastern Roman Empire from 541 to 700?CE.[36]\\r\\nAn estimate of the mortality rate for the modern bubonic plague, following the introduction of antibiotics, is 11%, although it may be higher in underdeveloped regions.[38] Symptoms of the disease include fever of 38ÿ41?C (100ÿ106?F), headaches, painful aching joints, nausea and vomiting, and a general feeling of malaise. Left untreated, of those that contract the bubonic plague, 80 per cent die within eight days.[39] Pneumonic plague has a mortality rate of 90 to 95 per cent. Symptoms include fever, cough, and blood-tinged sputum. As the disease progresses, sputum becomes free-flowing and bright red. Septicemic plague is the least common of the three forms, with a mortality rate near 100%. Symptoms are high fevers and purple skin patches (purpura due to disseminated intravascular coagulation). In cases of pneumonic and particularly septicemic plague, the progress of the disease is so rapid that there would often be no time for the development of the enlarged lymph nodes that were noted as buboes.[40]\\r\\nA number of alternative theories ÿ implicating other diseases in the Black Death pandemic ÿ have also been proposed by some modern scientists (see below ÿ \\"Alternative Explanations\\").\\r\\nIn October 2010, the open-access scientific journal PLoS Pathogens published a paper by a multinational team who undertook a new investigation into the role of Yersinia pestis in the Black Death following the disputed identification by Drancourt and Raoult in 1998. They assessed the presence of DNA/RNA with polymerase chain reaction (PCR) techniques for Y. pestis from the tooth sockets in human skeletons from mass graves in northern, central and southern Europe that were associated archaeologically with the Black Death and subsequent resurgences. The authors concluded that this new research, together with prior analyses from the south of France and Germany,[41] \\"ends the debate about the cause of the Black Death, and unambiguously demonstrates that Y. pestis was the causative agent of the epidemic plague that devastated Europe during the Middle Ages\\".[42]\\r\\nThe study also found that there were two previously unknown but related clades (genetic branches) of the Y. pestis genome associated with medieval mass graves. These clades (which are thought to be extinct) were found to be ancestral to modern isolates of the modern Y. pestis strains Y. p. orientalis and Y. p. medievalis, suggesting the plague may have entered Europe in two waves. Surveys of plague pit remains in France and England indicate the first variant entered Europe through the port of Marseille around November 1347 and spread through France over the next two years, eventually reaching England in the spring of 1349, where it spread through the country in three epidemics. Surveys of plague pit remains from the Dutch town of Bergen op Zoom showed the Y. pestis genotype responsible for the pandemic that spread through the Low Countries from 1350 differed from that found in Britain and France, implying Bergen op Zoom (and possibly other parts of the southern Netherlands) was not directly infected from England or France in 1349 and suggesting a second wave of plague, different from those in Britain and France, may have been carried to the Low Countries from Norway, the Hanseatic cities or another site.[42]\\r\\nThe results of the Haensch study have since been confirmed and amended. Based on genetic evidence derived from Black Death victims in the East Smithfield burial site in England, Schuenemann et al. concluded in 2011 \\"that the Black Death in medieval Europe was caused by a variant of Y. pestis that may no longer exist.\\"[43] A study published in Nature in October 2011 sequenced the genome of Y. pestis from plague victims and indicated that the strain that caused the Black Death is ancestral to most modern strains of the disease.[44]\\r\\nDNA taken from 25 skeletons from the 14th century found in London have shown the plague is a strain of Y. pestis that is almost identical to that which hit Madagascar in 2013.[45][46]\\r\\nThe plague theory was first significantly challenged by the work of British bacteriologist J. F. D. Shrewsbury in 1970, who noted that the reported rates of mortality in rural areas during the 14th-century pandemic were inconsistent with the modern bubonic plague, leading him to conclude that contemporary accounts were exaggerations.[36] In 1984 zoologist Graham Twigg produced the first major work to challenge the bubonic plague theory directly, and his doubts about the identity of the Black Death have been taken up by a number of authors, including Samuel K. Cohn, Jr. (2002 and 2013), David Herlihy (1997), and Susan Scott and Christopher Duncan (2001).[36]\\r\\nIt is recognised that an epidemiological account of the plague is as important as an identification of symptoms, but researchers are hampered by the lack of reliable statistics from this period. Most work has been done on the spread of the plague in England, and even estimates of overall population at the start vary by over 100% as no census was undertaken between the time of publication of the Domesday Book and the year 1377.[47] Estimates of plague victims are usually extrapolated from figures from the clergy.\\r\\nIn addition to arguing that the rat population was insufficient to account for a bubonic plague pandemic, sceptics of the bubonic plague theory point out that the symptoms of the Black Death are not unique (and arguably in some accounts may differ from bubonic plague); that transference via fleas in goods was likely to be of marginal significance; and that the DNA results may be flawed and might not have been repeated elsewhere, despite extensive samples from other mass graves.[36] Other arguments include the lack of accounts of the death of rats before outbreaks of plague between the 14th and 17th centuries; temperatures that are too cold in northern Europe for the survival of fleas; that, despite primitive transport systems, the spread of the Black Death was much faster than that of modern bubonic plague; that mortality rates of the Black Death appear to be very high; that, while modern bubonic plague is largely endemic as a rural disease, the Black Death indiscriminately struck urban and rural areas; and that the pattern of the Black Death, with major outbreaks in the same areas separated by 5 to 15 years, differs from modern bubonic plaguewhich often becomes endemic for decades with annual flare-ups.[36]\\r\\nMcCormick has suggested that earlier archaeologists were simply not interested in the \\"laborious\\" processes needed to discover rat remains.[48] Wall?e complains that all of these authors \\"take it for granted that Simond's infection model, black rat L rat flea L human, which was developed to explain the spread of plague in India, is the only way an epidemic of Yersinia pestis infection could spread\\", whilst pointing to several other possibilities.[49] Similarly, Green has argued that greater attention is needed to the range of (especially non-commensal) animals that might be involved in the transmission of plague.[50]\\r\\nA variety of alternatives to the Y. pestis have been put forward. Twigg suggested that the cause was a form of anthrax, and Norman Cantor thought it may have been a combination of anthrax and other pandemics. Scott and Duncan have argued that the pandemic was a form of infectious disease that they characterise as hemorrhagic plague similar to Ebola. Archaeologist Barney Sloane has argued that there is insufficient evidence of the extinction of a large number of rats in the archaeological record of the medieval waterfront in London and that the plague spread too quickly to support the thesis that the Y. pestis was spread from fleas on rats; he argues that transmission must have been person to person.[51][52] This theory is supported by research in 2018 which suggested transmission was more likely by body lice and human fleas during the Second Pandemic.[53]\\r\\nHowever, no single alternative solution has achieved widespread acceptance.[36] Many scholars arguing for the Y. pestis as the major agent of the pandemic suggest that its extent and symptoms can be explained by a combination of bubonic plague with other diseases, including typhus, smallpox and respiratory infections. In addition to the bubonic infection, others point to additional septicemic (a type of \\"blood poisoning\\") and pneumonic (an airborne plague that attacks the lungs before the rest of the body) forms of the plague, which lengthen the duration of outbreaks throughout the seasons and help account for its high mortality rate and additional recorded symptoms.[28] In 2014, scientists with Public Health England announced the results of an examination of 25 bodies exhumed from the Clerkenwell area of London, as well as of wills registered in London during the period, which supported the pneumonic hypothesis.[45]\\r\\nThere are no exact figures for the death toll; the rate varied widely by locality. In urban centres, the greater the population before the outbreak, the longer the duration of the period of abnormal mortality.[54] It killed some 75 to 200 million people in Eurasia.[1][2][3] According to medieval historian Philip Daileader in 2007:\\r\\nThe trend of recent research is pointing to a figure more like 45ÿ50% of the European population dying during a four-year period. There is a fair amount of geographic variation. In Mediterranean Europe, areas such as Italy, the south of France and Spain, where plague ran for about four years consecutively, it was probably closer to 75ÿ80% of the population. In Germany and England ... it was probably closer to 20%.[55]\\r\\nA death rate as high as 60% in Europe has been suggested by Norwegian historian Ole Benedictow:\\r\\nDetailed study of the mortality data available points to two conspicuous features in relation to the mortality caused by the Black Death: namely the extreme level of mortality caused by the Black Death, and the remarkable similarity or consistency of the level of mortality, from Spain in southern Europe to England in north-western Europe. The data is sufficiently widespread and numerous to make it likely that the Black Death swept away around 60 per cent of Europe's population. It is generally assumed that the size of Europe's population at the time was around 80 million. This implies that around 50 million people died in the Black Death.[56]\\r\\nThe most widely accepted estimate for the Middle East, including Iraq, Iran and Syria, during this time, is for a death rate of about a third.[57] The Black Death killed about 40% of Egypt's population.[58] Half of Paris's population of 100,000 people died. In Italy, the population of Florence was reduced from 110,000ÿ120,000 inhabitants in 1338 down to 50,000 in 1351. At least 60% of the population of Hamburg and Bremen perished,[59] and a similar percentage of Londoners may have died from the disease as well.[45] In London approximately 62,000 people died between the years between 1346 and 1353.[11] While contemporary reports account of mass burial pits being created in response to the large numbers of dead, recent scientific investigations of a burial pit in Central London found well-preserved individuals to be buried in isolated, evenly spaced graves, suggesting at least some pre-planning and Christian burials at this time.[60] Before 1350, there were about 170,000 settlements in Germany, and this was reduced by nearly 40,000 by 1450.[61] In 1348, the plague spread so rapidly that before any physicians or government authorities had time to reflect upon its origins, about a third of the European population had already perished. In crowded cities, it was not uncommon for as much as 50% of the population to die.[36] The disease bypassed some areas, and the most isolated areas were less vulnerable to contagion. Monks and priests were especially hard-hit since they cared for victims of the Black Death.[62]\\r\\nRenewed religious fervour and fanaticism bloomed in the wake of the Black Death. Some Europeans targeted \\"various groups such as Jews, friars, foreigners, beggars, pilgrims\\",[63] lepers,[63][64] and Romani, thinking that they were to blame for the crisis. Lepers, and other individuals with skin diseases such as acne or psoriasis, were singled out and exterminated throughout Europe.\\r\\nBecause 14th-century healers were at a loss to explain the cause, Europeans turned to astrological forces, earthquakes, and the poisoning of wells by Jews as possible reasons for the plague's emergence.[65] The governments of Europe had no apparent response to the crisis because no one knew its cause or how it spread. The mechanism of infection and transmission of diseases was little understood in the 14th century; many people believed the epidemic was a punishment by God for their sins. This belief led to the idea that the cure to the disease was to win God's forgiveness[66]\\r\\nThere were many attacks against Jewish communities.[67] In February 1349, the citizens of Strasbourg murdered 2,000 Jews.[67] In August 1349, the Jewish communities in Mainz and Cologne were annihilated. By 1351, 60 major and 150 smaller Jewish communities had been destroyed.[68] These massacres eventually died out in Western Europe, only to continue on in Eastern Europe. During this period many Jews relocated to Poland and Russia, receiving a warm welcome from King Casimir.[69]\\r\\nThe plague repeatedly returned to haunt Europe and the Mediterranean throughout the 14th to 17th centuries.[70] According to Biraben, the plague was present somewhere in Europe in every year between 1346 and 1671.[71] The Second Pandemic was particularly widespread in the following years: 1360ÿ1363; 1374; 1400; 1438ÿ1439; 1456ÿ1457; 1464ÿ1466; 1481ÿ1485; 1500ÿ1503; 1518ÿ1531; 1544ÿ1548; 1563ÿ1566; 1573ÿ1588; 1596ÿ1599; 1602ÿ1611; 1623ÿ1640; 1644ÿ1654; and 1664ÿ1667. Subsequent outbreaks, though severe, marked the retreat from most of Europe (18th?century) and northern Africa (19th?century).[72] According to Geoffrey Parker, \\"France alone lost almost a million people to the plague in the epidemic of 1628ÿ31.\\"[73]\\r\\nIn England, in the absence of census figures, historians propose a range of preincident population figures from as high as 7?million to as low as 4?million in 1300,[74] and a postincident population figure as low as 2?million.[75] By the end of 1350, the Black Death subsided, but it never really died out in England. Over the next few hundred years, further outbreaks occurred in 1361ÿ1362, 1369, 1379ÿ1383, 1389ÿ1393, and throughout the first half of the 15th?century.[76] An outbreak in 1471 took as much as 10ÿ15% of the population, while the death rate of the plague of 1479ÿ1480 could have been as high as 20%.[77] The most general outbreaks in Tudor and Stuart England seem to have begun in 1498, 1535, 1543, 1563, 1589, 1603, 1625, and 1636, and ended with the Great Plague of London in 1665.[78]\\r\\nIn 1466, perhaps 40,000?people died of the plague in Paris.[79] During the 16th and 17th centuries, the plague was present in Paris around 30 per cent of the time.[80] The Black Death ravaged Europe for three years before it continued on into Russia, where the disease was present somewhere in the country 25 times between 1350 and 1490.[81] Plague epidemics ravaged London in 1563, 1593, 1603, 1625, 1636, and 1665,[82] reducing its population by 10 to 30% during those years.[83] Over 10% of Amsterdam's population died in 1623ÿ1625, and again in 1635ÿ1636, 1655, and 1664.[84] Plague occurred in Venice 22 times between 1361 and 1528.[85] The plague of 1576ÿ1577 killed 50,000 in Venice, almost a third of the population.[86] Late outbreaks in central Europe included the Italian Plague of 1629ÿ1631, which is associated with troop movements during the Thirty Years' War, and the Great Plague of Vienna in 1679. Over 60% of Norway's population died in 1348ÿ1350.[87] The last plague outbreak ravaged Oslo in 1654.[88]\\r\\nIn the first half of the 17th century, a plague claimed some 1.7 million victims in Italy, or about 14% of the population.[89] In 1656, the plague killed about half of Naples' 300,000 inhabitants.[90] More than 1.25 million deaths resulted from the extreme incidence of plague in 17th-century Spain.[91] The plague of 1649 probably reduced the population of Seville by half.[92] In 1709ÿ1713, a plague epidemic that followed the Great Northern War (1700ÿ1721, Sweden v. Russia and allies)[93] killed about 100,000 in Sweden,[94] and 300,000 in Prussia.[92] The plague killed two-thirds of the inhabitants of Helsinki,[95] and claimed a third of Stockholm's population.[96] Europe's last major epidemic occurred in 1720 in Marseille.[87]\\r\\nThe Black Death ravaged much of the Islamic world.[97] Plague was present in at least one location in the Islamic world virtually every year between 1500 and 1850.[98] Plague repeatedly struck the cities of North Africa. Algiers lost 30,000ÿ50,000 inhabitants to it in 1620ÿ1621, and again in 1654ÿ1657, 1665, 1691, and 1740ÿ1742.[99] Plague remained a major event in Ottoman society until the second quarter of the 19th century. Between 1701 and 1750, thirty-seven larger and smaller epidemics were recorded in Constantinople, and an additional thirty-one between 1751 and 1800.[100] Baghdad has suffered severely from visitations of the plague, and sometimes two-thirds of its population has been wiped out.[101]\\r\\nThe third plague pandemic (1855ÿ1859) started in China in the mid-19th century, spreading to all inhabited continents and killing 10 million people in India alone.[102] Twelve plague outbreaks in Australia between 1900 and 1925 resulted in well over 1,000 deaths, chiefly in Sydney. This led to the establishment of a Public Health Department there which undertook some leading-edge research on plague transmission from rat fleas to humans via the bacillus Yersinia pestis.[103]\\r\\nThe first North American plague epidemic was the San Francisco plague of 1900ÿ1904, followed by another outbreak in 1907ÿ1908.[104][105][106][107][108][109][110] From 1944 through 1993, 362 cases of human plague were reported in the United States; approximately 90% occurred in four western states: Arizona, California, Colorado, and New Mexico.[111]\\r\\nModern treatment methods include insecticides, the use of antibiotics, and a plague vaccine. The plague bacterium could develop drug resistance and again become a major health threat. One case of a drug-resistant form of the bacterium was found in Madagascar in 1995.[112] A further outbreak in Madagascar was reported in November 2014.[113] In October 2017 the deadliest outbreak of the plague in modern times hit Madagascar, killing 170 people and infecting thousands.[114]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe phrase \\"black death\\" (mors nigra) was used in 1350 by Simon de Covino or Couvin, a Belgian astronomer, who wrote the poem \\"On the Judgment of the Sun at a Feast of Saturn\\" (De judicio Solis in convivio Saturni), which attributes the plague to a conjunction of Jupiter and Saturn.[115] In 1908, Gasquet claimed that use of the name atra mors for the 14th-century epidemic first appeared in a 1631 book on Danish history by J.?I. Pontanus: \\"Commonly and from its effects, they called it the black death\\" (Vulgo & ab effectu atram mortem vocatibant).[116] The name spread through Scandinavia and then Germany, gradually becoming attached to the mid 14th-century epidemic as a proper name.[117] However, atra mors is used to refer to a pestilential fever (febris pestilentialis) already in the 12th-century On the Signs and Symptoms of Diseases (Latin: De signis et sinthomatibus egritudinum) by French physician Gilles de Corbeil.[118] In England, the phrase \\"Black Death\\" is first used to refer to the 14th-century epidemic in 1823.[119] Writers contemporary with the plague described the event as \\"great plague\\"[65] or \\"great pestilence\\".[120]","input":"What parts of europe were least affected by the black plague?"},{"output":"Jinder Mahal","context":"The WWE Championship is a world heavyweight championship created and promoted by the American professional wrestling promotion WWE on the SmackDown brand. It is one of two world titles in the WWE, alongside the WWE Universal Championship that was created for the Raw brand as a result of the 2016 WWE draft. The title is currently held by Jinder Mahal, who is in his first reign.\\r\\nThe original world championship of the promotion, it was established by the then-World Wide Wrestling Federation (WWWF) on April 25, 1963 as the WWWF World Heavyweight Championship, following the promotion seceding from the National Wrestling Alliance (NWA). The inaugural champion was Buddy Rogers. Since its inception, the title has undergone many name changes due to company name changes and title unifications. It is the oldest championship currently active in the WWE, and is presented as being the promotion's most prestigious title, with many matches for the title having headlined pay-per-view events ÿ including WWE's flagship event WrestleMania.[2]\\r\\nFrom its inception until 2001, it was promoted as WWE's sole primary championship. An additional world title, the WCW Championship, was added after the then-World Wrestling Federation's purchase of World Championship Wrestling in early 2001. The titles were later unified as the Undisputed Championship. After the first brand extension in 2002 and the promotion becoming the WWE, the championship became exclusive to SmackDown, and the World Heavyweight Championship was created for Raw. ECW became a third brand in 2006, adding the ECW World Heavyweight Championship. Over the course of the first brand extension, the WWE Championship switched between brands, usually as a result of the annual draft. The ECW Championship was deactivated in 2010, and the World Heavyweight Championship was unified with the WWE Championship in 2013. The championship was again the sole world title of WWE until the reintroduction of the brand extension in 2016.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe title was introduced in 1963 with Buddy Rogers becoming the first champion. However, its origin is attributed to events that began in the National Wrestling Alliance (NWA), which had various territorial member promotions. In the 1950s, Capitol Wrestling Corporation (CWC) was a member of the NWA and by 1963, its executives held a controlling stake over NWA operations. During this time, Buddy Rogers held the NWA World Heavyweight Championship until January 24, when Lou Thesz defeated Rogers for the championship in a one fall match. Claiming the title can only be contested in a traditional two out of three falls match, the promotion disputed the title change, and thus seceded from the NWA and became the World Wide Wrestling Federation (WWWF). The WWWF World Heavyweight Championship was then established and awarded to Buddy Rogers with the explanation that he won a fictional tournament in Rio de Janeiro, supposedly defeating Antonino Rocca in the finals.[3] After several years, the WWWF became affiliated with the NWA once again, and \\"World\\" was dropped from the championship's name. In 1979, the WWWF was renamed World Wrestling Federation (WWF), and then after conclusively ending its affiliation with the NWA in 1983, the championship became known as the WWF World Heavyweight Championship. Although the full name appeared on the championship belts until 1998, the name was often abbreviated to WWF Championship, which became its official name in 1998.\\r\\nIn 1991, World Championship Wrestling (WCW), a member of the NWA, established the WCW World Heavyweight Championship to replace the NWA's world title. In 1993, WCW seceded from the NWA and grew to become a rival promotion to the WWF. Both organizations grew into mainstream prominence and were eventually involved in a television ratings war, dubbed the Monday Night Wars. Near the end of the ratings war, WCW began a financial decline, which culminated in WWF purchasing WCW in March 2001.[4] As a result of the purchase, the WWF acquired, among other assets, WCW's championships. Thus, there were two world titles in the WWF: the original WWF Championship and the WCW Championship, which was eventually renamed the \\"World Championship\\".[5][6]\\r\\nIn December 2001, the two championships were unified at Vengeance. At the event, Stone Cold Steve Austin defeated Kurt Angle to retain the WWF Championship, while Chris Jericho defeated The Rock for the World Championship. After this, Jericho then defeated Austin, unifying the WWF and World Championships, and becoming the first Undisputed WWF Champion; the Undisputed championship retained the lineage of the WWF Championship and the World Championship was retired.[7] Subsequently, the Big Eagle Belt (formerly representing the WWF Championship) and the Big Gold Belt (formerly representing the World Championship) were used in tandem to represent the Undisputed Championship.[8][9][10] Jericho held the championship for four months until he lost it at WrestleMania X8 against Triple H, who was soon after presented with a single championship belt.[11]\\r\\nThe Undisputed Championship continued until the brand extension, which saw wrestlers being drafted to the company's main television programs, Raw and SmackDown, each show representing the brand of the same name, with championships assigned to and authority figures appointed for each brand.[12] The holder of the Undisputed Championship was the only male wrestler allowed to appear on both shows.\\r\\nIn May 2002, the WWF was renamed World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) and the championships were renamed accordingly. At first, the championship remained unaffiliated with either brand as wrestlers from both brands could challenge the champion. Following the appointment of Eric Bischoff and Stephanie McMahon as General Managers of Raw and SmackDown, respectively, Stephanie McMahon convinced then-Undisputed Champion Brock Lesnar to become exclusive to the SmackDown brand, leaving the Raw brand without a world title.[13][14] In response, on September 2, Bischoff disputed Lesnar's status as champion, stating Lesnar was refusing to defend his title against the designated No. 1 contender, Triple H, and awarded the latter with the newly created World Heavyweight Championship, spun off from the Undisputed Championship. Immediately afterwards, Lesnar's championship dropped the epithet \\"Undisputed\\" and became known as the WWE Championship.[15]\\r\\nOver the course of the first brand extension, the WWE Championship was featured as the world title of the SmackDown brand twice and the Raw brand three times. In all but two cases, the WWE Championship switched brands as a result of the annual draft. In June 2006, the WWE established ECW as a third brand, featuring former Extreme Championship Wrestling stars, in addition to newer talent. When ECW's Rob Van Dam won the WWE Championship at ECW One Night Stand on June 11, 2006, the championship briefly became a world title of the ECW brand; the ECW World Heavyweight Championship was subsequently reactivated for the ECW brand upon Van Dam's title win. Van Dam held both titles until he lost the WWE Championship to Raw's Edge the following month. The ECW brand was disbanded in 2010, subsequently deactivating the ECW Championship. The first brand extension ended in August 2011.\\r\\nPreviously that year, a storyline saw CM Punk vowing to leave the company with the WWE Championship when his contract expired on July 17, 2011, the date of the 2011 Money in the Bank pay-per-view. At the event, Punk succeeded in defeating the defending champion John Cena to win the title, and left the company with the physical championship belt. Subsequently, the championship was vacated and Rey Mysterio won an eight-man tournament by defeating The Miz in the finals to be crowned the new WWE Champion, only to subsequently lose it later that night to Cena, for the latter's record ninth reign. However, following Cena's win, Punk returned to WWE with his own championship belt, disputing Cena's claim to the title.[16] The two WWE Champions wrestled each other at SummerSlam; Punk defeated Cena to solidify his claim on the title.\\r\\nFollowing the end of the first brand extension in August 2011, both the WWE Champion and World Heavyweight Champion could appear on both Raw and SmackDown. In November 2013, the night after Survivor Series, then-World Heavyweight Champion John Cena made a challenge to then-WWE Champion Randy Orton to determine an undisputed WWE world champion. Orton defeated Cena in a TLC match at the TLC: Tables, Ladders & Chairs pay-per-view on December 15, 2013, to unify the titles. Subsequently, the unified championship was renamed WWE World Heavyweight Championship and retained the lineage of the WWE Championship; the World Heavyweight Championship was retired.[17] Orton and subsequent champions held both championship belts until a single championship belt was given to then-champion Brock Lesnar in 2014.[18]\\r\\nAfter Dean Ambrose became champion in June 2016, the title's name was reverted to WWE Championship.[19][20][21] In light of the return of the WWE brand extension, then-WWE Champion Dean Ambrose was drafted to SmackDown on July 19. Ambrose then retained his title at Battleground on July 24 against Raw draftees Seth Rollins and Roman Reigns, making the title exclusive to SmackDown.[22] On the July 25 episode of Raw, to address the lack of a world title for the brand, the WWE Universal Championship was created; Finn Blor became the inaugural champion at SummerSlam.[23] After the unveiling of the Universal title, the WWE Championship was renamed WWE World Championship,[24][25] but reverted to WWE Championship in December 2016 during AJ Styles' reign.[26]\\r\\nFollowing the events of the first WWE brand extension, an annual WWE draft was established in 2002, with Ric Flair and Vince McMahon heading up the Raw and SmackDown brands respectively. Further individuals acted as General Manager of Raw and of SmackDown in subsequent years. Each year, the General Managers participated in a draft lottery in which select members of the WWE roster were assigned to a brand. The revived ECW became a third brand from 2006 to 2010.[27] On August 29, 2011, WWE ended the brand extension and wrestlers (including all champions), were then free to appear on any program.\\r\\nOn May 25, 2016, WWE announced that SmackDown would move to Tuesday nights and go live starting July 19 and also receive a unique set of wrestlers and writers, as opposed to Raw, thus reintroducing the brand extension. The draft took place on the live premiere of SmackDown.[28] On the July 18 episode of Raw, SmackDown Commissioner Shane McMahon named Daniel Bryan the SmackDown General Manager and Raw Commissioner Stephanie McMahon named Mick Foley the Raw General Manager.[21][29]\\r\\nThe following is a list of dates indicating the transitions of the WWE Championship between the Raw, SmackDown, and ECW brands.\\r\\nThe original WWWF World Heavyweight Championship belt design was originally a title belt used to represent a United States championship that Buddy Rogers had defended sometime prior to becoming the inaugural WWWF world champion. Due to this, the center plate was an outline of the continental United States, and there were two shield-shaped side plates with grapplers on them. On the center plate, there was a circle flanked by grapplers, and the circle was designed to contain a photograph of the titleholder. Above the circle was a shield with an eagle atop it with stars on opposite sides of the shield. The caption \\"World's Champion\\" was added below the circle. This version of the title belt was worn by the inaugural champion Buddy Rogers in 1963 and the second champion Bruno Sammartino.[36] After Sammartino became champion, a new version on a blue strap was introduced. The enlarged center piece contained a crowned globe and two grapplers, and read \\"WWWF World Champion\\"; the two side plates commemorated Sammartino's title win. Sammartino wore this version for the duration of his seven-year reign. After defeating Sammartino in January 1971, Ivan Koloff held this version for three weeks before losing it to Pedro Morales.[37]\\r\\nDuring Morales's reign, the championship belt was updated several times. First, the 1971 design, on an indigo colored strap, contained three shield-shaped plates. Below the center plate, which read \\"World Heavyweight Champion\\" and had a cross at its center, a separate plate read \\"WWWF\\". This was replaced with another design in 1972. This version, on a red strap, read \\"WWWF Heavyweight Wrestling Champion\\" around the edges with an eagle at the center, while six side plates represented several countries. 1973 saw the introduction of another yet similar design; this one was on a black strap and contained two grapplers above the eagle. This version was subsequently held by Stan Stasiak, Bruno Sammartino, Superstar Billy Graham ÿ who wore a red leather variation ÿ and Bob Backlund. During the latter's reign, the promotion's name was shortened to World Wrestling Federation (WWF), but the physical championship belt still read \\"WWWF\\".[37]\\r\\nA new design was introduced in 1982, nicknamed the \\"Big Green Belt\\" due to its size and the color of its strap. It included eight (later ten) side plates dedicated to the previous champions. The center plate featured a wrestler holding up a championship belt with a globe behind him. This design, held by Bob Backlund, The Iron Sheik, and Hulk Hogan, was replaced first by the \\"Hogan '84\\" design in late 1984, then by the nearly identical \\"Hogan '85\\" design in early 1985. Both were called \\"Hogan\\" belts as they were only worn by Hulk Hogan. Both championship belts were similar in design to the NWA Television Championship at the time. They consisted of silver plates on a black strap, the center plate read \\"WWF\\" at the top. Below that was an eagle with two banners below it reading \\"World Heavyweight Wrestling Champion\\". The bottom read \\"Worldwide Wrestling\\" and above that was a name plate commemorating Hogan's title win, while the side plates noted previous champions. The difference between the '84 and the '85 designs were that the writing (except WWF) was in red on the '84, and black background was added on the '85 belt. The next year, the \\"Hogan '86\\" was introduced and was again only worn by Hogan. The center plate featured a globe in the center, along with Roman columns and olive branches. It read \\"World Heavyweight Wrestling Champion\\" and included the famous WWF block logo at the top, while four side plates had flags (two flags per side plate) representing the United States, Canada, Mexico, Japan, the United Kingdom, Australia, the Soviet Union, and Italy.[37]\\r\\nIn 1988, just before ending his first championship reign, Hogan introduced another new design, the \\"Winged Eagle\\" championship belt, which became the primary design for the next decade with many wrestlers holding this version, and is considered the most popular design of the championship. Its nickname is derived from the eagle's wings seemingly coming off of the center plate, which included the block WWF logo and read \\"World Heavyweight Wrestling Champion\\". The championship belt also had four identical side plates. Apart from the usual black leather strap, The Ultimate Warrior wore white, light blue, yellow, and purple variations. Sgt. Slaughter continued to wear Warrior's purple strap.[37] In 1998, after Stone Cold Steve Austin became champion, he was presented with a new design, often dubbed the \\"Big Eagle\\" or \\"Attitude Era\\" championship belt. The center plate was similar to the previous design, but became fully rounded, and the side plates were updated. When it was unveiled, it originally contained the block WWF logo and was on a blue strap, but was soon updated to the WWF scratch logo and on a black strap. In addition to the logo, it read \\"World Wrestling Federation Champion\\".[37]\\r\\nAfter Chris Jericho unified the WWF and WCW Championships into the Undisputed WWF Championship, the \\"Big Eagle\\" championship belt was used in tandem with the \\"Big Gold Belt\\", the former WCW Championship belt, until a single Undisputed Championship belt was introduced to champion Triple H on the April 1, 2002 episode of Raw.[11] This new belt was designed by New Yorkÿbased tattoo artist Keith Ciaramello. Taking inspiration from WCW, this design included a name plate, and like the previous two designs, it had an eagle atop the globe. It originally had the WWF scratch logo and read \\"World Wrestling Federation Champion\\"; after the promotion was renamed World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) in May 2002, both the scratch logo and wording were changed accordingly.[38] The championship later became the WWE Championship in September 2002 when it became exclusive to SmackDown, while the Big Gold Belt was resurrected to represent the World Heavyweight Championship for Raw.[37]\\r\\nAfter John Cena won the WWE Championship in April 2005, he introduced his own custom belt, the \\"Spinner Belt\\", which had a gold and diamond bling-bling style reflecting his hip hop character at the time. Although originally a custom belt for Cena, it became the WWE Championship's primary design from April 11, 2005 until February 18, 2013. The scratch WWE logo, placed between an eagle on top and the word \\"Champ\\" and a name plate below, could be spun like spinner wheels or a turntable in keeping with the hip-hop theme. The inner side plates read \\"WWE Champion\\", though before 2008, one side plate indicated the brand the title was designated to. The spinning function was phased out in later years and the logo set in a fixed place, most notably during The Miz's reign when the logo was turned upside down to look like an \\"M\\". The Rock commented negatively on the spinning function on the night the belt was retired.[37]\\r\\nOn the February 18, 2013 episode of Raw, The Rock unveiled a new WWE Championship belt. The new title was partially designed by Orange County Choppers of American Chopper fame.[39][40][41] The championship included a large cut-out of the scratch WWE logo (encrusted with diamonds) inside a large irregular heptagonal plate. The word \\"Champion\\" appeared underneath the logo in large letters. On each side was a divider bar and a large plate. Default side plates consisted of a red globe with the WWE logo underneath a crown, but they were replaced with the reigning champion's personal logo. This championship belt was used in tandem with the Big Gold Belt to represent the renamed WWE World Heavyweight Championship after Randy Orton unified the WWE Championship and the World Heavyweight Championship on December 15, 2013.[42][37]\\r\\nOn the August 18, 2014 episode of Raw, reigning champion Brock Lesnar, who had won the title the night before at SummerSlam, was presented with a single championship belt. It has a slightly updated design from the belt introduced by The Rock in 2013 as a result of WWE adapting a new corporate logo originally used for the WWE Network. It includes a large center plate dominated by a cut out of the new WWE logo inside an irregular heptagon with the capital words \\"World Heavyweight Champion\\" along the bottom edges, in very small print. The large side plates, like the previous design, include removable round sections, allowing the holder's personal logo to be added to the championship belt; the default sections show gold and red world maps with the WWE logo over them, though they lack the crown placed on top of the plates in the previous design. The Big Gold Belt was retired with the unveiling of the new championship belt.[18][37]\\r\\nAfter the 2016 brand extension where the championship became exclusive to SmackDown, the similarly designed WWE Universal Championship was introduced for the Raw brand. The WWE World Heavyweight Championship was briefly renamed WWE Championship; the digitized belt in the pre-match graphic read \\"WWE Champion\\" below the WWE logo. It was then renamed WWE World Championship in July 2016 and the pre-match graphic was updated to read \\"WWE World Champion\\". In December 2016, the title was again reverted to WWE Championship; the pre-match graphic no longer includes the title's name. The physical belt, however, retains \\"World Heavyweight Champion\\" below the logo.\\r\\nCustom championship belts have been created to honor certain reigning champions or match their characters. During Hogan's reign in 1986, he had a modified version of the Hogan '86 made, which included a picture of himself at the center. This was a short lived custom design as he reverted to the Hogan '86 version. A much larger version similar to the Hogan '86 championship belt was created for Andr the Giant before WrestleMania III, although he never wore it as champion.[43][37]\\r\\nA custom championship belt was presented to Stone Cold Steve Austin during his second reign, which included his \\"Smoking Skull\\" logo as well as rattle snakes. As an answer, The Rock also had a custom championship belt designed and constructed, including his trademark \\"Brahma Bull\\" logo, but due to creative reasons, it never appeared on television.[38] The Spinner Belt, originally a customized belt for John Cena, remained the standard title belt from 2005 to 2013. During Edge's second reign, he introduced his own variation, the \\"Rated R Spinner\\" design, replacing the scratch WWE logo with his \\"Rated R Superstar\\" logo. Edge was going to have a completely new custom belt designed, but due to time constraints, it did not get made.[44][37]\\r\\nIn what has become a tradition since fall 2014, WWE sends a custom WWE Championship belt (current design) to championship winners in the NFL, MLB, NBA, NHL, and others, with the team's logo on the side plates, which are non-removable. WWE may also present a custom belt to exceptionally notable people for their efforts in their profession.[45][46][47][48][49]\\r\\nThe following are those that WWE has presented a custom championship to:\\r\\nThe WWE Championship was the first world championship introduced into the promotion in 1963. The inaugural champion was Buddy Rogers, and there have been 50 different official champions overall and 11 vacancies.[2] The longest reigning champion is Bruno Sammartino, who held the title from May 17, 1963 to January 18, 1971, for a total of 2,803 days (7 years, 8 months, and 1 day); Sammartino also holds the record for longest combined reign at 4,040 days.[87] Andr the Giant is the shortest reigning champion, officially holding the title for 1 minute, 48 seconds.[1] The youngest champion is Brock Lesnar, who won the title at the age of 25, while the oldest champion is Vince McMahon, who won it at the age of 54. John Cena holds the record for most reigns with 13.\\r\\nJinder Mahal is the current champion in his first reign.

It is an important piece of the early Romantic period. The first performance was at the Paris Conservatoire on 5 December 1830. Franz Liszt made a piano transcription of the symphony in 1833 (S. 470).[1]\\r\\nLeonard Bernstein described the symphony as the first musical expedition into psychedelia because of its hallucinatory and dream-like nature, and because history suggests Berlioz composed at least a portion of it under the influence of opium. According to Bernstein, \\"Berlioz tells it like it is. You take a trip, you wind up screaming at your own funeral.\\"[2][3]\\r\\nIn 1831, Berlioz wrote a lesser known sequel to the work, Llio, for actor, orchestra and chorus.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe score calls for a total of over 90 instruments:\\r\\nBerlioz specified at least 15 1st violins, 15 2nd violins, 10 violas, 11 celli and 9 basses on the score.\\r\\nThe symphony is a piece of program music that tells the story of an artist gifted with a lively imagination who has poisoned himself with opium in the depths of despair because of hopeless, unrequited love. Berlioz provided his own preface and program notes for each movement of the work. They exist in two principal versions ÿ one from 1845 in the first score of the work and the second from 1855.[4] From the revised preface and notes, it can be seen how Berlioz, later in his life, downplayed the programmatic aspect of the work.\\r\\nIn the first score from 1845, he writes:[4]\\r\\nThe composer's intention has been to develop various episodes in the life of an artist, in so far as they lend themselves to musical treatment. As the work cannot rely on the assistance of speech, the plan of the instrumental drama needs to be set out in advance. The following programme must therefore be considered as the spoken text of an opera, which serves to introduce musical movements and to motivate their character and expression.\\r\\nIn the 1855 preface, a different outlook towards the work's programmatic undertones is established by Berlioz:[4]\\r\\nThe following programme should be distributed to the audience every time the Symphonie fantastique is performed dramatically and thus followed by the monodrama of Llio which concludes and completes the episode in the life of an artist. In this case the invisible orchestra is placed on the stage of a theatre behind the lowered curtain. If the symphony is performed on its own as a concert piece this arrangement is no longer necessary: one may even dispense with distributing the programme and keep only the title of the five movements. The author hopes that the symphony provides on its own sufficient musical interest independently of any dramatic intention.\\r\\nThere are five movements instead of four that were conventional for symphonies at the time:\\r\\nIn program notes from 1845, the composer writes:[4]\\r\\nThe author imagines that a young musician, afflicted by the sickness of spirit which a famous writer has called the vagueness of passions (le vague des passions), sees for the first time a woman who unites all the charms of the ideal person his imagination was dreaming of, and falls desperately in love with her. By a strange anomaly, the beloved image never presents itself to the artist's mind without being associated with a musical idea, in which he recognizes a certain quality of passion, but endowed with the nobility and shyness which he credits to the object of his love.\\r\\nThis melodic image and its model keep haunting him ceaselessly like a double ide fixe. This explains the constant recurrence in all the movements of the symphony of the melody which launches the first allegro. The transitions from this state of dreamy melancholy, interrupted by occasional upsurges of aimless joy, to delirious passion, with its outbursts of fury and jealousy, its returns of tenderness, its tears, its religious consolations ÿ all this forms the subject of the first movement.\\r\\nBerlioz writes in the program notes from 1855:[4]\\r\\nHe remembers first the uneasiness of spirit, the indefinable passion, the melancholy, the aimless joys he felt even before seeing his beloved; then the explosive love she suddenly inspired in him, his delirious anguish, his fits of jealous fury, his returns of tenderness, his religious consolations.\\r\\nThe first movement is radical in its harmonic outline, building a vast arch back to the home key; while similar to the sonata form of the classical period, Parisian critics regarded this as unconventional. It is here that the listener is introduced to the theme of the artist's beloved, or the ide fixe. Throughout the movement there is a simplicity in the way melodies and themes are presented, which Robert Schumann likened to Beethoven's epigrams' ideas that could be extended had the composer chosen to. In part, it is because Berlioz rejected writing the more symmetrical melodies then in academic fashion, and instead looked for melodies that were \\"so intense in every note as to defy normal harmonization\\", as Schumann put it. The theme itself was taken from Berlioz's scne lyrique \\"Herminie\\", composed in 1828.[5]\\r\\nIn the first edition of the score from 1845, he writes:[4]\\r\\nThe artist finds himself in the most diverse situations in life, in the tumult of a festive party, in the peaceful contemplation of the beautiful sights of nature, yet everywhere, whether in town or in the countryside, the beloved image keeps haunting him and throws his spirit into confusion.\\r\\nThe revised program notes from 1855 state:[4]\\r\\nHe meets again his beloved in a ball during a glittering fte.\\r\\nThe second movement has a mysterious-sounding introduction that creates an atmosphere of impending excitement, followed by a passage dominated by two harps; then the flowing waltz theme appears, derived from the ide fixe at first,[6] then transforming it. More formal statements of the ide fixe twice interrupt the waltz.\\r\\nThe movement is the only one to feature the two harps, providing the glamour and sensual richness of the ball, and may also symbolize the object of the young man's affection. Berlioz wrote extensively in his memoirs of his trials and tribulations in having this symphony performed, due to a lack of capable harpists and harps, especially in Germany.\\r\\nAnother feature of this movement is that Berlioz added a part for solo cornet to his autograph score, although it was not included in the score published in his lifetime. The work has most often been played and recorded without the solo cornet part.[7] Conductors Jean Martinon, Colin Davis, Otto Klemperer, Gustavo Dudamel and Leonard Slatkin have employed this part for cornet in performances of the symphony.\\r\\nBerlioz's program notes from the first score:[4]\\r\\nOne evening in the countryside he hears two shepherds in the distance dialoguing with their ranz des vaches; this pastoral duet, the setting, the gentle rustling of the trees in the wind, some causes for hope that he has recently conceived, all conspire to restore to his heart an unaccustomed feeling of calm and to give to his thoughts a happier colouring. He broods on his loneliness, and hopes that soon he will no longer be on his own... But what if she betrayed him!... This mingled hope and fear, these ideas of happiness, disturbed by dark premonitions, form the subject of the adagio. At the end one of the shepherds resumes his ranz des vaches; the other one no longer answers. Distant sound of thunder... solitude... silence.\\r\\nIn the 1855 program notes, Berlioz writes:[4]\\r\\nOne summer evening in the countryside he hears two shepherds dialoguing with their ranz des vaches; this pastoral duet, the setting, the gentle rustling of the trees in the light wind, some causes for hope that he has recently conceived, all conspire to restore to his heart an unaccustomed feeling of calm and to give to his thoughts a happier colouring; but she reappears, he feels a pang of anguish, and painful thoughts disturb him: what if she betrayed him... One of the shepherds resumes his simple melody, the other one no longer answers. The sun sets... distant sound of thunder... solitude... silence...\\r\\nThe two \\"shepherds\\" Berlioz mentions in the notes are depicted with a cor anglais and an offstage oboe tossing an evocative melody back and forth. After the cor anglaisÿoboe conversation, the principal theme of the movement appears on solo flute and violins. Berlioz salvaged this theme from his abandoned Messe solennelle.[5] The ide fixe returns in the middle of the movement, played by oboe and flute.[8] The sound of distant thunder at the end of the movement is a striking passage for four timpani.[5]\\r\\nFrom Berlioz's program notes in 1845:[4]\\r\\nConvinced that his love is spurned, the artist poisons himself with opium. The dose of narcotic, while too weak to cause his death, plunges him into a heavy sleep accompanied by the strangest of visions. He dreams that he has killed his beloved, that he is condemned, led to the scaffold and is witnessing his own execution. The procession advances to the sound of a march that is sometimes sombre and wild, and sometimes brilliant and solemn, in which a dull sound of heavy footsteps follows without transition the loudest outbursts. At the end of the march, the first four bars of the ide fixe reappear like a final thought of love interrupted by the fatal blow.\\r\\nDescription of the movement by Berlioz in 1855:[4]\\r\\nHe dreams that he has killed his beloved, that he is condemned to death and led to execution. The procession advances to the sound of a march that is sometimes sombre and wild, and sometimes brilliant and solemn, in which a dull sound of heavy footsteps follows without transition the loudest outbursts. At the end, the ide fixe reappears for a moment like a final thought of love interrupted by the fatal blow.\\r\\nBerlioz claimed to have written the fourth movement in a single night, reconstructing music from an unfinished project ÿ the opera Les francs-juges.[5] The movement begins with timpani sextuplets in thirds, for which he directs: \\"The first quaver of each half-bar is to be played with two drumsticks, and the other five with the right hand drumsticks\\". The movement proceeds as a march filled with blaring horns and rushing passages, and scurrying figures that later show up in the last movement. Before the musical depiction of his execution, there is a brief, nostalgic recollection of the ide fixe in a solo clarinet, as though representing the last conscious thought of the soon-to-be-executed man.[2]\\r\\nIn both the program notes, Berlioz wrote:[4]\\r\\nHe sees himself at a witches' sabbath, in the midst of a hideous gathering of shades, sorcerers and monsters of every kind who have come together for his funeral. Strange sounds, groans, outbursts of laughter; distant shouts which seem to be answered by more shouts. The beloved melody appears once more, but has now lost its noble and shy character; it is now no more than a vulgar dance tune, trivial and grotesque: it is she who is coming to the sabbath ... Roar of delight at her arrival ... She joins the diabolical orgy ... The funeral knell tolls, burlesque parody of the Dies irae, the dance of the witches. The dance of the witches combined with the Dies irae.\\r\\nThis movement can be divided into sections according to tempo changes:\\r\\nThere are a host of effects, including eerie col legno in the strings ÿ the bubbling of the witches' cauldron to the blasts of wind. The climactic finale combines the somber Dies Irae melody with the wild fugue of the Ronde du Sabbat.[9]\\r\\nAfter attending a performance of Shakespeare's Hamlet on 11 September 1827, Berlioz fell in love with the Irish actress Harriet Smithson who had played the role of Ophelia. He sent her numerous love letters, all of which went unanswered. When she left Paris they had still not met. He then wrote the symphony as a way to express his unrequited love. It premiered in Paris on 5 December 1830; Harriet was not present. She eventually heard the work in 1832 and realized his genius. The two finally met, and they were married on 3 October 1833. Their marriage became increasingly bitter, and eventually they separated after several years of unhappiness.[10]","input":"Who inspired berlioz to compose his symphonie fantastique?"},{"output":"in the province of Gangwon-do, South Korea, located in the Taebaek Mountains region.","context":"Pyeongchang (Korean pronunciation:?[p?j??t??a?]; in full, Pyeongchang-gun [p?j??t??a?un]; English: /?pj???t???/[2]) is a county in the province of Gangwon-do, South Korea, located in the Taebaek Mountains region.

In 1465, King Sejo and administrators donated to rebuild the temple.[22] Sejo's son, King Yejong designated it as a memorial for his father.

The National Woman's Party broke from the much larger National American Woman Suffrage Association, which was focused on attempting to gain women's suffrage at the state level. The National Woman's Party prioritized the passage of a constitutional amendment ensuring women's suffrage throughout the United States.\\r\\nThe National Woman's Party, like the Congressional Union, was under the leadership of Alice Paul, who learned from militant suffragettes in Britain who used a variety of tactics to gain publicity for the cause of suffrage. Paul's strategy was to use publicity to hold the party in power, the Democratic Party and President Woodrow Wilson, responsible for the status of woman suffrage. Starting in January 1917, NWP members known as Silent Sentinels continued their quest for equality by protesting outside the White House.\\r\\nWhile the British suffragettes stopped their protests when Britain entered the war in 1914, and supported the British war effort, Paul remained committed to the suffrage cause and continued her campaign after the US entered the war on April 6, 1917. Members of the NWP argued it was hypocritical for the United States to fight a war for democracy in Europe while denying its benefits to half of the US population. Similar arguments were being made in Europe, where most of the allied nations of Europe had enfranchised some women or would soon.[1]\\r\\nThe NWP pickets were controversial as they continued during war time.[2] Many NWP activists were later arrested on the charge of obstructing traffic, and many went on hunger strikes in prison to protest their unlawful detention.[3] Abusive treatment of the protesters, who believed themselves to be political prisoners, angered some Americans and created more support for the suffrage amendment. They were eventually released and their arrests were later declared unconstitutional. In the meantime, NAWSA helped pass the 1917 referendum in New York State in favor of suffrage. In early 1918, Wilson came out in favor of the amendment, and it passed the House, but failed in the Senate despite another round of protests and arrests. After the NWP helped replace anti-suffrage senators in the 1918 elections, the amendment finally passed both houses and was sent to the states for ratification. The Nineteenth amendment was ratified by enough states by 1920, thus giving many women the right to vote. Many African American women in the Jim Crow South remained disenfranchised after the ratification of this amendment.\\r\\nAfter ratification, the NWP turned its attention to passage of an Equal Rights Amendment to the Constitution. Historian Nancy Cott has noted that as the party moved into the 1920s it remained ideologically consistent in the pursuit of equal rights for women and that:\\r\\nToday, the National Woman's Party exists as a 501c3 educational organization. Its task is now the maintenance and interpretation of the collection and archives of the historic National Woman's Party[5] The NWP operates out of the Belmont-Paul Women's Equality National Monument in Washington, DC, where objects from the collection are exhibited.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter their experience with militant suffrage work in Great Britain, Alice Paul and Lucy Burns reunited in the United States in 1910. The two women originally were appointed to the Congressional Committee of the National American Woman Suffrage Association. In March 1913, the two women organized a parade of 5,000ÿ8,000 women (by differing estimates)[citation needed] in Washington, D.C. on the day before Woodrow Wilson's inauguration. Though planned as an elegant progression of symbolically dressed, accomplished, and professional women, the parade quickly devolved into chaos due to violent reactions from the crowd and a lack of support by the local police. The D.C. police did little to help the suffragists; the women were assisted by the Massachusetts National Guard, the Pennsylvania National Guard, and boys from the Maryland Agricultural College, who created a human barrier protecting the women from the angry crowd.[6]\\r\\nAfter this incident, which Paul effectively used to rally public opinion to the suffrage cause, Paul and Burns founded the Congressional Union for Woman Suffrage in April 1913, which split off from NAWSA later that year. The Congressional Union began publishing a weekly newspaper, The Suffragist, in November 1913. Paul and Burns were frustrated with the National's slower approach of focusing on individual state referendums and wanted to pursue a congressional amendment. Alice Paul had also chafed under the leadership of Carrie Chapman Catt, as she had very different ideas of how to go about suffrage work, and a different attitude towards militancy.[7] Catt disapproved of the radical strategies, inspired by the British \\"Suffragettes\\", Paul and Burns were trying to implement into the American Suffrage Movement.\\r\\nThe split was confirmed by a major difference of opinion on the Shafroth-Palmer Amendment. This amendment was spearheaded by Alice Paul's replacement as chair of the National's Congressional Committee, and was a compromise of sorts meant to appease racist sentiment in the South. ShafrothÿPalmer was to be a constitutional amendment that would require any state with more than 8 percent signing an initiative petition to hold a state referendum on suffrage. This would have kept the law-making out of federal hands, a proposition more attractive to the South. Southern states feared a congressional women's suffrage amendment as a possible federal encroachment into their restrictive system of voting laws, meant to disenfranchise the black voter.\\r\\nPaul and Burns felt that this amendment was a lethal distraction from the true and ultimately necessary goal of an all-encompassing federal amendment protecting the rights of all womenespecially as the bruising rounds of state referendums were perceived at the time as almost damaging the cause. In Paul's words: \\"It is a little difficult to treat with seriousness an equivocating, evasive, childish substitute for the simple and dignified suffrage amendment now before Congress.\\"[8]\\r\\nPortrait of Alice Paul, 1915\\r\\nLucy Burns, Vice Chairman Congressional Union, 1913\\r\\nRheta Childe Dorr, first editor of The Suffragist\\r\\nWomen associated with the party staged a very innovative suffrage parade on March 3, 1913, the day before Wilson's inauguration.[9]\\r\\nDuring the group's first meeting, Paul clarified that the party would not be a political party and therefore would not endorse a candidate for president during elections. While non-partisan, the NWP directed most of its attention to President Woodrow Wilson and the Democrats, criticizing them as responsible for the failure to pass a constitutional amendment. The National Woman's Party continued to focus on suffrage as their main cause. It refused to either support or attack American involvement in the World War, while the rival National American Woman Suffrage Association (NAWSA) under Carrie Chapman Catt gave full support to the war effort. As a result, a diverse group of activists such as pacifists and Socialists were attracted to the NWP due to its opposition to an anti-suffrage president.[10]\\r\\nWhile the British suffragettes stopped their protests in 1914 and supported the British war effort, Paul continued her struggle for women's equality and organized picketing of a war time president to maintain attention to the lack of enfranchisement for women. Known as \\"Silent Sentinels\\", their action lasted from January 10, 1917 until June 1919. The picketers were tolerated at first, but when they continued to picket after the United States declared war in 1917, they were arrested by police for obstructing traffic. Many of the NWP's members upon arrest went on hunger strikes; some, including Paul, were force-fed by jail personnel as a consequence. Anne Henrietta Martin, the NWP's first vice chairman, was sentenced to the Occoquan Workhouse, though Wilson pardoned her in less than a week.[11] Other suffragists arrested during the picket included Helena Hill and Iris Calderhead.[citation needed] The resulting publicity at a time when Wilson was trying to build a reputation for himself and the nation as an international leader in human rights was designed to force Wilson to publicly call for the Congress to pass the Suffrage Amendment.[12]\\r\\nWilson favored woman suffrage at the state level, but held off support for a nationwide constitutional amendment because his party was sharply divided, with the South opposing an amendment on the grounds of state's rights. The only Southern state to grant women the vote was Arkansas. The NWP in 1917ÿ1919 repeatedly attacked Wilson and his party for not enacting an amendment. Wilson, however, kept in close touch with more moderate suffragists of the National American Woman Suffrage Association. He continued to hold off until he was sure the Democratic Party in the North was supportive; the 1917 referendum in New York State in favor of suffrage proved decisive for him. In January 1918, Wilson went in person to the House and made a strong and widely published appeal to the House to pass the bill. The innovative non-violent tactics of the NWP were a contributing factor in getting Wilson to change his position on the suffrage bill. It passed but the Senate stalled until 1919 then finally sent the amendment to the states for ratification.[13] Scholar Belinda A. Stillion Southard has written that \\"...the campaign of the NWP was crucial toward securing the passage of the Nineteenth Amendment.\\"[14]\\r\\nAfter the ratification of the Nineteenth amendment in 1920, the NWP turned its attention to eliminating other forms of gender discrimination, principally by advocating passage of the Equal Rights Amendment, which Paul drafted in 1923. The organization regrouped and published the magazine Equal Rights. The publication was directed towards women but also intended to educate men about the benefits of women's suffrage, women's rights and other issues concerning American women.\\r\\n\\"Men and women shall have equal rights throughout the United States and every place subject to its jurisdiction.\\"[15]\\r\\nThe NWP's agenda was at times opposed by working class women and by the labor unions that represented working class men who feared low-wage women workers would lower the overall pay scale and demean the role of the male breadwinner. Eleanor Roosevelt, an ally of the unions, generally opposed the NWP policies because she believed women needed protective legislation, not equality.[16] However, the National Woman's Party found protective legislation to relegate women to a lower class, and aimed their work on the ERA and other legislation to combat this second class citizenship status. The NWP argued that protective labor legislation would continue to depress women's wages and prevent women from gaining access to all types of work and parts of society.\\r\\nAfter 1920, the National Woman's Party authored over 600 pieces of legislation fighting for women's equality; over 300 of these were passed. In addition, the NWP continued to lobby for the passage of the Equal Rights Amendment[17] and under president Sarah Tarleton Colvin, who served in 1933, pressed for equal pay.[18][19] Scholar Mary K. Trigg has noted, \\"...the NWP played a central role in the women's rights movement after 1945. It stuck to its laser-like focus on the ERA, doggedly lobbying year in and year out for the amendment's introduction in Congress.\\"[20] In 1997, the NWP ceased to be a lobbying organization. Instead, it turned its focus to education and to preserving its collection of first hand source documents from the women's suffrage movement. The NWP continues to function as an educational organization, maintaining and interpreting the collection left by the work of the historic National Woman's Party.\\r\\nCongress passed the ERA Amendment and many states ratified it, but at the last minute in 1982 it was stopped by a coalition of conservatives led by Phyllis Schlafly and never passed. However, in 1964 the NWP did succeed, with the support of conservatives and over the opposition of liberals, blacks and labor unions, to have \\"sex\\" added to the Civil Rights Act of 1964, thus achieving some of the goals sought by the NWP.\\r\\nIn 1963 Congress passed the Equal Pay Act of 1963, which prohibited wage differentials based on sex.\\r\\nThe prohibition on sex discrimination was added by Howard W. Smith, a powerful Virginian Democrat who chaired the House Rules Committee. He was a conservative who strongly opposed civil rights laws for blacks, but he supported such laws for white women. Smith's amendment was passed by a teller vote of 168 to 133.\\r\\nHistorians debate Smith's motivationwas it a cynical attempt to defeat the bill by someone opposed to both civil rights for blacks and women, or did he support women's rights and was attempting to improve the bill by broadening it to include women?[21][22][23] Smith expected that Republicans, who had included equal rights for women in their party's platform since 1944, would probably vote for the amendment. Historians speculate that Smith was trying to embarrass northern Democrats who opposed civil rights for women because the clause was opposed by labor unions.[24]\\r\\nSmith asserted that he sincerely supported the amendment and, indeed, along with Rep. Martha Griffiths,[25] he was the chief spokesperson for the amendment.[24] For twenty years Smith had sponsored the Equal Rights Amendmentwith no linkage to racial issuesin the House because he believed in it. For decades he had been close to the National Woman's Party and especially Paul. She and other activists had worked with Smith since 1945 trying to find a way to include sex as a protected civil rights category. Now was the moment.[26] Griffiths argued that the new law would protect black women but not white women, and that was unfair to white women. Furthermore, she argued that the laws \\"protecting\\" women from unpleasant jobs were actually designed to enable men to monopolize those jobs, and that was unfair to women who were not allowed to try out for those jobs.[27] The amendment passed with the votes of Republicans and Southern Democrats. The final law passed with the votes of Republicans and Northern Democrats.\\r\\nThe Suffragist newspaper was founded by the Congressional Union for Woman Suffrage in 1913. It was referred to as \\"the only women's political newspaper in the United States\\" and was published to promote women's suffrage activities.[28] Its articles had political cartoons, a form of visual propaganda, by Nina E. Allender to garner support for the movement and communicate the status of the suffrage amendment.[28]\\r\\nThe woman who reads our paper will be informed as to happenings in Congress, not only suffrage happenings, although they come first, but all proceedings of special interest to women. Men do not realize how serious are the changes that are taking place in the conduct of Congress. Women will have to inform them. Only in the pages of The Suffragist will you find the information you need.\\r\\nAfter the amendment for the women's right to vote was passed, the publication was discontinued by the National Woman's Party and succeeded in 1923 by Equal Rights.[28] Published until 1954, Equal Rights began as a weekly newsletter and evolved into a bi-monthly release aimed at keeping NWP members informed about developments related to the ERA and legislative issues. It included field reports, legislation updates and features about the activities of the NWP and featured writing from contributors including Crystal Eastman, Zona Gale, Ruth Hale and Inez Haynes Irwin.[29] Josephine Casey appeared on the cover of the publication in April 1931 as a result of her recurring column about the labour conditions of female textile workers in Georgia.[30]","input":"Who formed and started the national womens party?"},{"output":"July 12, 1969","context":"Created by Gene Roddenberry, the science fiction television series Star Trek (which eventually acquired the retronym Star Trek: The Original Series) starred William Shatner as Captain Kirk, Leonard Nimoy as Mr. Spock, and DeForest Kelley as Dr. Leonard \\"Bones\\" McCoy aboard the fictional Federation starship USS Enterprise.

The first episode broadcast in color was \\"Arena\\" on November 15, 1969. The running order was very different from the US original with the episodes being shown in four seasons between 1969 and 1971. The Cage was first transmitted on Sky One in July 1990 and three episodes, \\"Plato's Stepchildren\\", \\"The Empath\\" and \\"Whom Gods Destroy\\" were not broadcast on the BBC until early 1994. Sky One were the first to show them in their run that started in 1990 (though Sky were supplied with the BBC edited versions of the series) and tellingly the three \\"banned\\" episodes were the only ones that had the opening titles in the right place, having never been shown by the BBC although \\"The Empath\\" is listed for transmission on Wednesday December 16, 1970 at 7.20pm in the Radio Times.[40]\\r\\nThe BBC broadcast versions of the episodes differed from the way they had been shown in America. The opening elements of each episode were transposed so that the title sequence was the first thing seen, followed by the teaser, and then into the rest of the episode without a pause. These prints were used up until the 1990s but for their new run the BBC were supplied with NTSC tape transfers instead of new film prints. This resulted in the odd blurry appearance that viewers were getting used to on new US shows at the time. Season one was shown and at least some episodes had edits that matched the syndication cuts of the US episodes \\"The Menagerie\\" Part 1 for instance. Viewers complained and the BBC obtained film prints from season two, although for some reason the old edited version of \\"The Deadly Years\\" was shown in the first 1990s repeat.","input":"When was star trek first shown in the uk?"},{"output":"unnamed protagonist, referred to as the narrator,","context":"Fight Club is a 1999 American film based on the 1996 novel of the same name by Chuck Palahniuk.

He forms a \\"fight club\\" with soap maker Tyler Durden, played by Pitt, and they are joined by men who also want to fight recreationally. The narrator becomes embroiled in a relationship with Durden and a dissolute woman, Marla Singer, played by Bonham Carter.\\r\\nPalahniuk's novel was optioned by 20th Century Fox producer Laura Ziskin, who hired Jim Uhls to write the film adaptation. Fincher was one of four directors the producers considered, and was selected because of his enthusiasm for the film. Fincher developed the script with Uhls and sought screenwriting advice from the cast and others in the film industry. The director and the cast compared the film to Rebel Without a Cause (1955) and The Graduate (1967). They said its theme was the conflict between a generation of young people and the value system of advertising.[4][5] The director copied the homoerotic overtones from Palahniuk's novel to make audiences uncomfortable and keep them from anticipating the twist ending.[6]\\r\\nStudio executives did not like the film and restructured Fincher's intended marketing campaign to try to reduce anticipated losses. Fight Club failed to meet the studio's expectations at the box office and initially received polarizing reactions from critics, becoming one of the most controversial and talked-about films of the year. Critics praised the acting, directing, themes and messages but debated the explicit violence and moral ambiguity. Over time, however, reception towards the film has become largely positive with critics and audiences, finding critical and commercial success with its DVD release, which established Fight Club as a cult film.

He decides to participate in support groups of various kinds, always allowing the groups to assume that he suffers what they do. However, he begins to notice another impostor, Marla Singer, whose presence reminds him that he is attending these groups dishonestly, and this disturbs his bliss. The two negotiate to avoid their attending the same groups, but, before going their separate ways, Marla gives him her phone number.\\r\\nOn a flight home from a business trip, the Narrator meets Tyler Durden, a soap salesman with whom he begins to converse after noticing the two share the same kind of briefcase.

After a conversation about consumerism, outside the bar, Tyler chastises the Narrator for his timidity about needing a place to stay. Tyler requests that the Narrator hit him, which leads the two to engage in a fistfight. The Narrator moves into Tyler's home, a large dilapidated house in an industrial area of their city. They have further fights outside the bar on subsequent nights, and these fights attract growing crowds of men.

Fincher described the Narrator as an \\"everyman\\";[10] the character is identified in the script as \\"Jack\\", but left unnamed in the film.[11] Fincher outlined the Narrator's background: \\"He's tried to do everything he was taught to do, tried to fit into the world by becoming the thing he isn't.\\" The Narrator cannot find happiness, so he travels on a path to enlightenment in which he must \\"kill\\" his parents, his god, and his teacher. At the start of the film, he has \\"killed off\\" his parents. With Tyler Durden, he kills his god by doing things they are not supposed to do. To complete the process of maturing, the Narrator has to \\"kill off\\" his teacher, Tyler Durden.[12]\\r\\nThe character is a 1990s inverse of The Graduate archetype: \\"a guy who does not have a world of possibilities in front of him, he has no possibilities, he literally cannot imagine a way to change his life.\\" He is confused and enraged, so he responds to his environment by creating Tyler Durden, a Nietzschean bermensch, in his mind. While Tyler is who the Narrator would want to be, he is not empathetic and does not help the Narrator face decisions in his life \\"that are complicated and have moral and ethical implications\\". Fincher explained, \\"[Tyler] can deal with the concepts of our lives in an idealistic fashion, but it doesn't have anything to do with the compromises of real life as modern man knows it. Which is: You're not really necessary to a lot of what's going on. It's built, it just needs to run now.\\"[10] While studio executives worried that Fight Club was going to be \\"sinister and seditious\\", Fincher sought to make it \\"funny and seditious\\" by including humor to temper the sinister element.[13]\\r\\nUhls described the film as a \\"romantic comedy\\", explaining, \\"It has to do with the characters' attitudes toward a healthy relationship, which is a lot of behavior which seems unhealthy and harsh to each other, but in fact does work for thembecause both characters are out on the edge psychologically.\\"[14] The Narrator seeks intimacy, but he avoids it with Marla Singer, seeing too much of himself in her.[15] While Marla is a seductive and negativist prospect for the Narrator, he instead embraces the novelty and excitement that comes with befriending Tyler Durden. The Narrator is comfortable being personally connected to Tyler Durden, but he becomes jealous when Tyler becomes sexually involved with Marla. When the Narrator argues with Tyler about their friendship, Tyler tells him that being friends is secondary to pursuing the philosophy they have been exploring.[16] Tyler also suggests doing something about Marla, implying that she is a risk to be removed. When Tyler says this, the Narrator realizes that his desires should have been focused on Marla and begins to diverge from Tyler's path.[15]\\r\\nThe unreliable narrator is not immediately aware that Tyler Durden originated in him and is being mentally projected.[18] He also mistakenly promotes the fight clubs as a way to feel powerful,[19] though the Narrator's physical condition worsens while Tyler Durden's appearance improves. While Tyler desires \\"real experiences\\" of actual fights like the Narrator at first,[20] he manifests a nihilistic attitude of rejecting and destroying institutions and value systems.[21] His impulsive nature, representing the id,[15] conveys an attitude that is seductive and liberating to the Narrator and the members of Project Mayhem. Tyler's initiatives and methods become dehumanizing;[21] he orders around the members of Project Mayhem with a megaphone similar to camp directors at Chinese re-education camps.[15] The Narrator pulls back from Tyler and in the end, he arrives at a middle ground between his two conflicting selves.[16]\\r\\nFight Club examines Generation X angst as '\\"the middle children of history\\".[5] Norton said, Fight Club examines the value conflicts of Generation X, as the first generation raised on television \\"having its value system largely dictated to it by advertising culture\\", including values such as one could achieve \\"spiritual happiness through home furnishing\\", later to wake up to the emptiness of this \\"received value system.\\"[4][20] Pitt said, \\"Fight Club is a metaphor for the need to push through the walls we put around ourselves and just go for it, so for the first time we can experience the pain.\\"[22] Fight Club also parallels the 1955 film Rebel Without a Cause; both probe the frustrations of the people that live in the system.[20] The characters, having undergone societal emasculation, are reduced to \\"a generation of spectators\\".[23] A culture of advertising defines society's \\"external signifiers of happiness\\", causing an unnecessary chase for material goods that replaces the more essential pursuit of spiritual happiness. The film references Gucci, Calvin Klein, and the Volkswagen New Beetle. Norton said of the Beetle, \\"We smash it?... because it seemed like the classic example of a Baby Boomer generation marketing plan that sold culture back to us.\\"[24] His character also walks through his apartment while visual effects identify his many IKEA possessions. Fincher described the Narrator's immersion, \\"It was just the idea of living in this fraudulent idea of happiness.\\"[25] Pitt explained the dissonance, \\"I think there's a self-defense mechanism that keeps my generation from having any real honest connection or commitment with our true feelings. We're rooting for ball teams, but we're not getting in there to play. We're so concerned with failure and successlike these two things are all that's going to sum you up at the end.\\"[22]\\r\\nThe violence of the fight clubs serves not to promote or glorify physical combat, but for participants to experience feeling in a society where they are otherwise numb.[26] The fights tangibly represent a resistance to the impulse to be \\"cocooned\\" in society.[23] Norton believed that the fighting between the men strips away the \\"fear of pain\\" and \\"the reliance on material signifiers of their self-worth\\", leaving them to experience something valuable.[20] When the fights evolve into revolutionary violence, the film only half-accepts the revolutionary dialectic by Tyler Durden; the Narrator pulls back and rejects Durden's ideas.[16] Fight Club purposely shapes an ambiguous message, the interpretation of which is left to the audience.[21] Fincher elaborated, \\"I love this idea that you can have fascism without offering any direction or solution. Isn't the point of fascism to say, 'This is the way we should be going'? But this movie couldn't be further from offering any kind of solution.\\"[13]\\r\\nThe novel Fight Club by Chuck Palahniuk was published in 1996. Before its publication, a 20th Century Fox book scout sent a galley proof of the novel to creative executive Kevin McCormick. The executive assigned a studio reader to review the proof as a candidate for a film adaptation, but the reader discouraged it. McCormick then forwarded the proof to producers Lawrence Bender and Art Linson, who also rejected it. Producers Josh Donen and Ross Bell saw potential and expressed interest. They arranged unpaid screen readings with actors to determine the script's length, and an initial reading lasted six hours. The producers cut out sections to reduce the running time, and they used the shorter script to record its dialogue. Bell sent the recording to Laura Ziskin, head of the division Fox 2000, who listened to the tape and purchased the rights to Fight Club from Palahniuk for $10,000.[27]\\r\\nZiskin initially considered hiring Buck Henry to write the adaptation, finding Fight Club similar to the 1967 film The Graduate, which Henry had adapted. When a new screenwriter, Jim Uhls, lobbied Donen and Bell for the job, the producers chose him over Henry. Bell contacted four directors to direct the film. He considered Peter Jackson the best choice, but Jackson was too busy filming the 1996 film The Frighteners in New Zealand. Bryan Singer received the book but did not read it. Danny Boyle met with Bell and read the book, but he pursued another film. David Fincher, who had read Fight Club and had tried to buy the rights himself, talked with Ziskin about directing the film. He hesitated to accept the assignment with 20th Century Fox at first because he had an unpleasant experience directing the 1992 film Alien 3 for the studio. To repair his relationship with the studio, he met with Ziskin and studio head Bill Mechanic.[27] In August 1997, 20th Century Fox announced that Fincher would direct the film adaptation of Fight Club.[28]\\r\\nProducer Ross Bell met with actor Russell Crowe to discuss his candidacy for the role of Tyler Durden. Producer Art Linson, who joined the project late, met with Pitt regarding the same role. Linson was the senior producer of the two, so the studio sought to cast Pitt instead of Crowe.[27] Pitt was looking for a new film after the failure (in the US market) of his 1998 film Meet Joe Black, and the studio believed Fight Club would be more commercially successful with a major star. The studio signed Pitt and offered him a US$17.5?million salary.[29]\\r\\nFor the role of the unnamed Narrator, the studio desired a \\"sexier marquee name\\" like Matt Damon to increase the film's commercial prospects; it also considered Sean Penn. Fincher instead considered Norton a candidate for the role, based on the actor's performance in the 1996 film The People vs. Larry Flynt.[30] Other studios were approaching Norton for leading roles in developing films like The Talented Mr. Ripley and Man on the Moon. The actor was cast in Runaway Jury, but the film did not reach production. 20th Century Fox offered Norton a $2.5?million salary to attract him to Fight Club. Norton could not accept the offer immediately because he still owed Paramount Pictures a film; he had signed a contractual obligation with Paramount to appear in one of the studio's future films for a smaller salary (Norton later satisfied the obligation with his role in the 2003 film The Italian Job).[29]\\r\\nIn January 1998, 20th Century Fox announced that Pitt and Norton were cast in the film.[31] The actors prepared for their roles by taking lessons in boxing, taekwondo, grappling,[32] and soapmaking.[33] Pitt voluntarily visited a dentist to have pieces of his front teeth chipped off so his character would not have perfect teeth. The pieces were restored after filming concluded.[34]\\r\\nFincher's first choice for the role of Marla Singer was Janeane Garofalo, who objected to the film's sexual content.[35] The filmmakers considered Courtney Love and Winona Ryder as early candidates.[36] The studio wanted to cast Reese Witherspoon, but Fincher objected that she was too young for the role.[29] He chose to cast Bonham Carter based on her performance in the 1997 film The Wings of the Dove.[37]\\r\\nUhls started working on an early draft of the adapted screenplay, which excluded a voice-over because the industry perceived at the time that the technique was \\"hackneyed and trite\\". When Fincher joined the film, he thought that the film should have a voice-over, believing that the film's humor came from the Narrator's voice.[29] The director described the film without a voice-over as seemingly \\"sad and pathetic\\".[38] Fincher and Uhls revised the script for six to seven months and by 1997 had a third draft that reordered the story and left out several major elements. When Pitt was cast, he was concerned that his character, Tyler Durden, was too one-dimensional. Fincher sought the advice of writer-director Cameron Crowe, who suggested giving the character more ambiguity. Fincher also hired screenwriter Andrew Kevin Walker for assistance. The director invited Pitt and Norton to help revise the script, and the group drafted five revisions in the course of a year.[29]\\r\\nPalahniuk praised the faithful film adaptation of his novel and applauded how the film's plot was more streamlined than the book's. Palahniuk recalled how the writers debated if film audiences would believe the plot twist from the novel. Fincher supported including the twist, arguing, \\"If they accept everything up to this point, they'll accept the plot twist. If they're still in the theater, they'll stay with it.\\"[39] Palahniuk's novel also contained homoerotic overtones, which the director included in the film to make audiences uncomfortable and accentuate the surprise of the film's twists.[6] The bathroom scene where Tyler Durden bathes next to the Narrator is an example of the overtones; the line, \\"I'm wondering if another woman is really the answer we need,\\" was meant to suggest personal responsibility rather than homosexuality.[15] Another example is the scene at the beginning of the film in which Tyler Durden puts a gun barrel down the Narrator's mouth.[40]\\r\\nThe Narrator finds redemption at the end of the film by rejecting Tyler Durden's dialectic, a path that diverged from the novel's ending in which the Narrator is placed in a mental institution.[13] Norton drew parallels between redemption in the film and redemption in The Graduate, indicating that the protagonists of both films find a middle ground between two divisions of self.[16] Fincher considered the novel too infatuated with Tyler Durden and changed the ending to move away from him: \\"I wanted people to love Tyler, but I also wanted them to be OK with his vanquishing.\\"[13]\\r\\nStudio executives Mechanic and Ziskin planned an initial budget of US$23?million to finance the film,[27] but by the start of production, the budget was increased to $50?million. Half was paid by New Regency, but during filming, the projected budget escalated to US$67?million. New Regency's head and Fight Club executive producer Arnon Milchan petitioned Fincher to reduce costs by at least US$5?million. The director refused, so Milchan threatened Mechanic that New Regency would withdraw financing. Mechanic sought to restore Milchan's support by sending him tapes of dailies from Fight Club. After seeing three weeks of filming, Milchan reinstated New Regency's financial backing.[41] The final production budget was $63?million.[1]\\r\\nThe fight scenes were heavily choreographed, but the actors were required to \\"go full out\\" to capture realistic effects like having the wind knocked out of them.[22] Makeup artist Julie Pearce, who worked for the director on the 1997 film The Game, studied mixed martial arts and pay-per-view boxing to portray the fighters accurately. She designed an extra's ear to have cartilage missing, citing as inspiration the boxing match in which Mike Tyson bit off part of Evander Holyfield's ear.[42] Makeup artists devised two methods to create sweat on cue: spraying mineral water over a coat of Vaseline, and using the unadulterated water for \\"wet sweat\\". Meat Loaf, who plays a member of the fight club who has \\"bitch tits\\", wore a 90-pound (40?kg) fat harness that gave him large breasts for the role.[32] He also wore eight-inch (20?cm) lifts in his scenes with Norton to be taller than him.[15]\\r\\nFilming lasted 138 days,[43] during which Fincher shot more than 1,500 rolls of film, three times the average for a Hollywood film.[32] The locations were in and around Los Angeles, including most notably: The Promenade Towers, Melrose Avenue, St. Brendan's Catholic Church, and Michael Heizer's public art sculpture \\"North, South East, West\\". Sets were also built in Century City.[43] Production designer Alex McDowell constructed more than 70 sets.[32] The exterior of Tyler Durden's house was built in Wilmington, California,[44] while the interior was built on a sound stage at the studio's location. The interior was given a decayed look to illustrate the deconstructed world of the characters.[43] Marla Singer's apartment was based on photographs of apartments in downtown LA.[18] Overall production included 300 scenes, 200 locations, and complex special effects. Fincher compared Fight Club to his subsequent, less complex film Panic Room: \\"I felt like I was spending all my time watching trucks being loaded and unloaded so I could shoot three lines of dialogue. There was far too much transportation going on.\\"[45]\\r\\nFincher used the Super 35 format to film Fight Club since it gave him maximum flexibility in composing shots. He hired Jeff Cronenweth as cinematographer; Cronenweth's father Jordan Cronenweth was the cinematographer who worked for Fincher on the 1992 film Alien 3 but left midway through its production due to Parkinson's disease. Fincher explored visual styles in his previous films Seven and The Game, and he and Cronenweth drew elements from these styles for Fight Club.[43]\\r\\nThey applied a lurid style, choosing to make people \\"sort of shiny\\".[18] The appearance of the Narrator's scenes without Tyler Durden were bland and realistic. The scenes with Tyler were described by Fincher as \\"more hyper-real in a torn-down, deconstructed sensea visual metaphor of what [the Narrator is] heading into\\". The filmmakers used heavily desaturated colors in the costuming, makeup, and art direction.[43] Bonham Carter wore opalescent makeup to portray her romantic nihilistic character with a \\"smack-fiend patina\\". Fincher and Cronenweth drew influences from the 1973 film American Graffiti, which applied a mundane look to nighttime exteriors while simultaneously including a variety of colors.[18]\\r\\nThe crew took advantage of both natural and practical light at filming locations. The director sought various approaches to the lighting setups, for example choosing several urban locations for the city lights' effects on the shots' backgrounds. He and the crew also embraced fluorescent lighting at other practical locations to maintain an element of reality and to light the prostheses depicting the characters' injuries.[43] On the other hand, Fincher also ensured that scenes were not so strongly lit so the characters' eyes were less visible, citing cinematographer Gordon Willis' technique as the influence.[15]\\r\\nFight Club was filmed mostly at night and Fincher purposely filmed the daytime shots in shadowed locations. The crew equipped the bar's basement with inexpensive work lamps to create a background glow. Fincher avoided stylish camerawork when filming early fight scenes in the basement and instead placed the camera in a fixed position. In later fight scenes, Fincher moved the camera from the viewpoint of a distant observer to that of the fighter.[43]\\r\\nThe scenes with Tyler Durden were staged to conceal that the character was a mental projection of the unnamed Narrator. The character was not filmed in two shots with a group of people, nor was he shown in any over the shoulder shots in scenes where Tyler gives the Narrator specific ideas to manipulate him. In scenes before the Narrator meets Tyler, the filmmakers inserted Tyler's presence in single frames for subliminal effect.[18] Tyler appears in the background and out of focus, like a \\"little devil on the shoulder\\".[15] Fincher explained the subliminal frames: \\"Our hero is creating Tyler Durden in his own mind, so at this point he exists only on the periphery of the Narrator's consciousness.\\"[46]\\r\\nWhile Cronenweth generally rated and exposed the Kodak film stock normally on Fight Club, several other techniques were applied to change its appearance. Flashing was implemented on much of the exterior night photography, the contrast was stretched to be purposely ugly, the print was adjusted to be underexposed, Technicolor's ENR silver retention was used on a select number of prints to increase the density of the film's blacks, and high-contrast print stocks were chosen to create a \\"stepped-on\\" look on the print with a dirty patina.[18]\\r\\nFincher hired visual effects supervisor Kevin Tod Haug, who worked for him on The Game, to create visual effects for Fight Club. Haug assigned the visual effects artists and experts to different facilities that each addressed different types of visual effects: CG modeling, animation, compositing, and scanning. Haug explained, \\"We selected the best people for each aspect of the effects work, then coordinated their efforts. In this way, we never had to play to a facility's weakness.\\" Fincher visualized the Narrator's perspective through a \\"mind's eye\\" view and structured a myopic framework for the film audiences. Fincher also used previsualized footage of challenging main-unit and visual effects shots as a problem-solving tool to avoid making mistakes during the actual filming.[46]\\r\\nThe film's title sequence is a 90-second visual effects composition that depicts the inside of the Narrator's brain at a microscopic level; the camera pulls back to the outside, starting at his fear center and following the thought processes initiated by his fear impulse.[47] The sequence, designed in part by Fincher, was budgeted separately from the rest of the film at first, but the sequence was awarded by the studio in January 1999.[46] Fincher hired Digital Domain and its visual effects supervisor Kevin Mack, who won an Academy Award for Visual Effects for the 1998 film What Dreams May Come, for the sequence. The company mapped the computer-generated brain using an L-system,[48] and the design was detailed using renderings by medical illustrator Katherine Jones. The pullback sequence from within the brain to the outside of the skull included neurons, action potentials, and a hair follicle. Haug explained the artistic license that Fincher took with the shot, \\"While he wanted to keep the brain passage looking like electron microscope photography, that look had to be coupled with the feel of a night divewet, scary, and with a low depth of field.\\" The shallow depth of field was accomplished with the ray tracing process.[46]\\r\\nOther visual effects include an early scene in which the camera flashes past city streets to survey Project Mayhem's destructive equipment lying in underground parking lots; the sequence was a three-dimensional composition of nearly 100?photographs of Los Angeles and Century City by photographer Michael Douglas Middleton. The final scene of the demolition of the credit card office buildings was designed by Richard Baily of Image Savant; Baily worked on the scene for over fourteen?months.[46]\\r\\nMidway through the film, Tyler Durden points out the cue marknicknamed \\"cigarette burn\\" in the filmto the audience. The scene represents a turning point that foreshadows the coming rupture and inversion of the \\"fairly subjective reality\\" that existed earlier in the film. The director explained, \\"Suddenly it's as though the projectionist missed the changeover, the viewers have to start looking at the movie in a whole new way.\\"[46]\\r\\nFincher was concerned that bands experienced in writing film scores would be unable to tie the movie's themes together, so he sought a band which had never recorded for film. He pursued Radiohead,[15] but ultimately chose the breakbeat producing duo Dust Brothers to score the film. The duo created a post-modern score that included drum loops, electronic scratches, and computerized samples. Dust Brothers performer Michael Simpson explained the setup: \\"Fincher wanted to break new ground with everything about the movie, and a nontraditional score helped achieve that.\\"[49] The film's climax and end credits feature the song \\"Where Is My Mind?\\" by the Pixies.[50]\\r\\nFilming concluded in December 1998, and Fincher edited the footage in early 1999 to prepare Fight Club for a screening with senior executives. They did not receive the film positively and were concerned that there would not be an audience for the film.[51] Executive producer Art Linson, who supported the film, recalled the response: \\"So many incidences of Fight Club were alarming, no group of executives could narrow them down.\\"[52] Nevertheless, Fight Club was originally slated to be released in July 1999[53] but was later changed to August?6, 1999. The studio further delayed the film's release, this time to autumn, citing a crowded summer schedule and a hurried post-production process.[54] Outsiders attributed the delays to the Columbine High School massacre earlier in the year.[55]\\r\\nMarketing executives at 20th Century Fox faced difficulties in marketing Fight Club and at one point considered marketing it as an art film. They considered that the film was primarily geared toward male audiences because of its violence and believed that not even Pitt would attract female filmgoers. Research testing showed that the film appealed to teenagers. Fincher refused to let the posters and trailers focus on Pitt and encouraged the studio to hire the advertising firm Wieden+Kennedy to devise a marketing plan. The firm proposed a bar of pink soap with the title \\"Fight Club\\" embossed on it as the film's main marketing image; the proposal was considered \\"a bad joke\\" by Fox executives. Fincher also released two early trailers in the form of fake public service announcements presented by Pitt and Norton; the studio did not think the trailers marketed the film appropriately. Instead, the studio financed a $20?million large-scale campaign to provide a press junket, posters, billboards, and trailers for TV that highlighted the film's fight scenes. The studio advertised Fight Club on cable during World Wrestling Entertainment broadcasts, which Fincher protested, believing that the placement created the wrong context for the film.[51] Linson believed that the \\"ill-conceived one-dimensional\\" marketing by marketing executive Robert Harper largely contributed to Fight Club's lukewarm box office performance in the United States.[56]\\r\\nThe studio held Fight Club's world premiere at the 56th Venice International Film Festival on September 10, 1999.[57][58] For the American theatrical release, the studio hired the National Research Group to test screen the film; the group predicted the film would gross between US$13?million and US$15?million in its opening weekend.[59] Fight Club opened commercially in the United States and Canada on October?15, 1999 and earned US$11,035,485 in 1,963 theaters over the opening weekend.[1] The film ranked first at the weekend box office, defeating Double Jeopardy and The Story of Us, a fellow weekend opener.[60] The gender mix of audiences for Fight Club, argued to be \\"the ultimate anti-date flick\\", was 61% male and 39% female; 58% of audiences were below the age of 21. Despite the film's top placement, its opening gross fell short of the studio's expectations.[61] Over the second weekend, Fight Club dropped 42.6% in revenue, earning US$6,335,870.[62] Against its production budget of US$63 million, the film grossed US$37 million from its theatrical run in the United States and Canada and earned US$100.9 million in theaters worldwide.[1] The underwhelming North American performance of Fight Club soured the relationship between 20th Century Fox's studio head Bill Mechanic and media executive Rupert Murdoch, which contributed to Mechanic's resignation in June 2000.[63]\\r\\nThe British Board of Film Classification reviewed Fight Club for its November?12, 1999 release in the United Kingdom and removed two scenes involving \\"an indulgence in the excitement of beating a (defenseless) man's face into a pulp\\". The board assigned the film an 18 certificate, limiting the release to adult-only audiences in the UK. The BBFC did not censor any further, considering and dismissing claims that Fight Club contained \\"dangerously instructive information\\" and could \\"encourage anti-social (behavior)\\". The board decided, \\"The film as a whole isquite clearlycritical and sharply parodic of the amateur fascism which in part it portrays. Its central theme of male machismo (and the anti-social behaviour that flows from it) is emphatically rejected by the central character in the concluding reels.\\"[64] The scenes were restored in a two-disc DVD edition released in the UK in March 2007.[65]\\r\\nFincher supervised the composition of the DVD packaging and was one of the first directors to participate in a film's transition to home media. The film was released in two DVD editions.[66] The single-disc edition included a commentary track,[67] while the two-disc special edition included the commentary track, behind-the-scenes clips, deleted scenes, trailers, fake public service announcements, the promotional music video \\"This is Your Life\\", Internet spots, still galleries, cast biographies, storyboards, and publicity materials.[68] The director worked on the DVD as a way to finish his vision for the film. Julie Markell, 20th Century Fox's senior vice president of creative development, said the DVD packaging complemented the director's vision: \\"The film is meant to make you question. The package, by extension, tries to reflect an experience that you must experience for yourself. The more you look at it, the more you'll get out of it.\\" The studio developed the packaging for two months.[69] The two-disc special edition DVD was packaged to look covered in brown cardboard wrapper. The title \\"Fight Club\\" was labeled diagonally across the front, and packaging appeared tied with twine. Markell said, \\"We wanted the package to be simple on the outside, so that there would be a dichotomy between the simplicity of brown paper wrapping and the intensity and chaos of what's inside.\\"[69] Deborah Mitchell, 20th Century Fox's vice president of marketing, described the design: \\"From a retail standpoint, [the DVD case] has incredible shelf-presence.\\"[70]\\r\\nFight Club won the 2000 Online Film Critics Society Awards for Best DVD, Best DVD Commentary, and Best DVD Special Features.[71] Entertainment Weekly ranked the film's two-disc edition in first place on its 2001 list of \\"The 50 Essential DVDs\\", giving top ratings to the DVD's content and technical picture-and-audio quality.[72] When the two-disc edition went out of print, the studio re-released it in 2004 because of fans' requests.[73] The film sold more than 6 million copies on DVD and video within the first ten years,[74] making it one of the largest-selling home media items in the studio's history,[56] in addition to grossing over $55 million in video and DVD rentals.[75] With a weak box office performance in the United States and Canada, a better performance in other territories, and the highly successful DVD release, Fight Club generated a US$10?million profit for the studio.[56]\\r\\nThe Laserdisc edition was only released in Japan on May 26, 2000[76] and features a different cover art, as well as one of the very few Dolby EX soundtracks released on LD.\\r\\nThe VHS edition was released on October 31, 2000, as a part of 20th Century Fox's \\"Premiere Series\\" line. It includes a featurette after the film, entitled \\"Behind the Brawl\\".[77]\\r\\nFight Club was released in the Blu-ray Disc format in the United States on November?17, 2009.[78] Fox Creative chose Neuron Syndicate to design the art for the format's packaging, and Neuron commissioned five graffiti artists to create 30 pieces of art. The art encompasses urban aesthetics found on the East Coast and West Coast of the United States as well as influences from European street art.[79] The Blu-ray edition opens with a menu screen for the romantic comedy Never Been Kissed starring Drew Barrymore before leading into the actual Fight Club menu screen. David Fincher got permission from Barrymore to include the fake menu screen.[80]\\r\\nWhen Fight Club premiered at the 56th Venice International Film Festival, the film was fiercely debated by critics. A newspaper reported, \\"Many loved and hated it in equal measures.\\" Some critics expressed concern that the film would incite copycat behavior, such as that seen after A Clockwork Orange debuted in Britain nearly three decades previously.[81] Upon the film's theatrical release, The Times reported the reaction: \\"It touched a nerve in the male psyche that was debated in newspapers across the world.\\"[82] Although the film's makers called Fight Club \\"an accurate portrayal of men in the 1990s,\\" some critics called it \\"irresponsible and appalling\\". Writing for the Australian newspaper, Christopher Goodwin stated: \\"Fight Club is shaping up to be the most contentious mainstream Hollywood meditation on violence since Stanley Kubrick's A Clockwork Orange.\\"[83]\\r\\nJanet Maslin, reviewing for The New York Times, praised Fincher's direction and editing of the film. She wrote that Fight Club carried a message of \\"contemporary manhood\\", and that, if not watched closely, the film could be misconstrued as an endorsement of violence and nihilism.[84] Roger Ebert, reviewing for the Chicago Sun-Times, called Fight Club \\"visceral and hard-edged\\", but also \\"a thrill ride masquerading as philosophy\\", whose promising first act is followed by a second that panders to macho sensibilities and a third he dismissed as \\"trickery\\".[85] Ebert later acknowledged that the film was \\"beloved by most, not by me\\".[86] He was later requested to have a shot-by-shot analysis of Fight Club at the Conference on World Affairs; he stated that \\"[s]eeing it over the course of a week, I admired its skill even more, and its thought even less.\\"[87] Jay Carr of The Boston Globe opined that the film began with an \\"invigoratingly nervy and imaginative buzz\\", but that it eventually became \\"explosively silly\\".[88] Newsweek's David Ansen described Fight Club as \\"an outrageous mixture of brilliant technique, puerile philosophizing, trenchant satire and sensory overload\\" and thought that the ending was too pretentious.[89] Richard Schickel of Time described the director's mise en scne as dark and damp: \\"It enforces the contrast between the sterilities of his characters' aboveground life and their underground one. Water, even when it's polluted, is the source of life; blood, even when it's carelessly spilled, is the symbol of life being fully lived. To put his point simply: it's better to be wet than dry.\\" Schickel applauded the performances of Brad Pitt and Edward Norton, but he criticized the film's \\"conventionally gimmicky\\" unfolding and the failure to make Helena Bonham Carter's character interesting.[90]\\r\\nCineaste's Gary Crowdus reviewed the critical reception in retrospect: \\"Many critics praised Fight Club, hailing it as one of the most exciting, original, and thought-provoking films of the year.\\" He wrote of the negative opinion, \\"While Fight Club had numerous critical champions, the film's critical attackers were far more vocal, a negative chorus which became hysterical about what they felt to be the excessively graphic scenes of fisticuffs?... They felt such scenes served only as a mindless glamorization of brutality, a morally irresponsible portrayal, which they feared might encourage impressionable young male viewers to set up their own real-life fight clubs in order to beat each other senseless.\\"[91]\\r\\nFight Club was nominated for the 2000 Academy Award for Best Sound Editing, but it lost to The Matrix.[92] Bonham Carter won the 2000 Empire Award for Best British Actress.[93] The Online Film Critics Society also nominated Fight Club for Best Film, Best Director, Best Actor (Norton), Best Editing, and Best Adapted Screenplay (Uhls).[94] Though the film won none of the awards, the organization listed Fight Club as one of the top ten films of 1999.[95] The soundtrack was nominated for a BRIT Award, losing to Notting Hill.[96]\\r\\nOn Rotten Tomatoes, Fight Club holds a rating of 79%, based on 162 reviews, with an average rating of 7.3/10.

A \\"Gentleman's Fight Club\\" was started in Menlo Park, California in 2000 and had members mostly from the tech industry.[105] Teens and preteens in Texas, New Jersey, Washington state, and Alaska also initiated fight clubs and posted videos of their fights online, leading authorities to break up the clubs. In 2006, an unwilling participant from a local high school was injured at a fight club in Arlington, Texas, and the DVD sales of the fight led to the arrest of six teenagers.[106] An unsanctioned fight club was also started at Princeton University, where matches were held on campus.[107] The film was suspected of influencing Luke Helder, a college student who planted pipe bombs in mailboxes in 2002. Helder's goal was to create a smiley pattern on the map of the United States, similar to the scene in Fight Club in which a building is vandalized to have a smiley on its exterior.[108] On July 16, 2009, a 17-year-old who had formed his own fight club in Manhattan was charged with detonating a homemade bomb outside a Starbucks Coffee shop in the Upper East Side. The New York City Police Department reported the suspect was trying to emulate \\"Project Mayhem\\".[109] In September 2015, two employees at Lightbridge Academy, a New Jersey daycare center, were charged with instigating \\"Fight Clubÿstyle\\" brawls between children aged four to six years of age. The fights were reportedly filmed and uploaded to Snapchat, a video messaging application, and involved approximately a \\"dozen boys and girls\\".

All of them have individual voting rights, and all votes are equal, regardless of the population of the delegate's member state. The employer and worker delegates are normally chosen in agreement with the \\"most representative\\" national organizations of employers and workers. Usually, the workers' delegates coordinate their voting, as do the employers' delegates.[citation needed] All delegates have the same rights, and are not required to vote in blocs.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nThrough July 2011, the ILO had adopted 189 conventions. If these conventions are ratified by enough governments, they become in force. However, ILO conventions are considered international labour standards regardless of ratification.

The core members all knew one another from earlier private professional and ideological networks, in which they exchanged knowledge, experiences, and ideas on social policy. Prewar \\"epistemic communities\\", such as the International Association for Labour Legislation (IALL), founded in 1900, and political networks, such as the socialist Second International, were a decisive factor in the institutionalization of international labour politics.[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the postÿWorld War I euphoria, the idea of a \\"makeable society\\" was an important catalyst behind the social engineering of the ILO architects. As a new discipline, international labour law became a useful instrument for putting social reforms into practice. The utopian ideals of the founding memberssocial justice and the right to decent workwere changed by diplomatic and political compromises made at the Paris Peace Conference of 1919, showing the ILO's balance between idealism and pragmatism.[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nOver the course of the First World War, the international labour movement proposed a comprehensive programme of protection for the working classes, conceived as compensation for labour's support during the war.[clarification needed] Post-war reconstruction and the protection of labour unions occupied the attention of many nations during and immediately after World War I. In Great Britain, the Whitley Commission, a subcommittee of the Reconstruction Commission, recommended in its July 1918 Final Report that \\"industrial councils\\" be established throughout the world.[18] The British Labour Party had issued its own reconstruction programme in the document titled Labour and the New Social Order.[19] In February 1918, the third Inter-Allied Labour and Socialist Conference (representing delegates from Great Britain, France, Belgium and Italy) issued its report, advocating an international labour rights body, an end to secret diplomacy, and other goals.[20] And in December 1918, the American Federation of Labor (AFL) issued its own distinctively apolitical report, which called for the achievement of numerous incremental improvements via the collective bargaining process.[21]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the war drew to a close, two competing visions for the post-war world emerged. The first was offered by the International Federation of Trade Unions (IFTU), which called for a meeting in Bern, Switzerland, in July 1919. The Bern meeting would consider both the future of the IFTU and the various proposals which had been made in the previous few years. The IFTU also proposed including delegates from the Central Powers as equals. Samuel Gompers, president of the AFL, boycotted the meeting, wanting the Central Powers delegates in a subservient role as an admission of guilt for their countries' role in the bringing about war. Instead, Gompers favoured a meeting in Paris which would only consider President Woodrow Wilson's Fourteen Points as a platform. Despite the American boycott, the Bern meeting went ahead as scheduled. In its final report, the Bern Conference demanded an end to wage labour and the establishment of socialism. If these ends could not be immediately achieved, then an international body attached to the League of Nations should enact and enforce legislation to protect workers and trade unions.[21]\\r\\n\\r\\nMeanwhile, the Paris Peace Conference sought to dampen public support for communism. Subsequently, the Allied Powers agreed that clauses should be inserted into the emerging peace treaty protecting labour unions and workers' rights, and that an international labour body be established to help guide international labour relations in the future. The advisory Commission on International Labour Legislation was established by the Peace Conference to draft these proposals. The Commission met for the first time on 1 February 1919, and Gompers was elected chairman.[21]\\r\\n\\r\\nTwo competing proposals for an international body emerged during the Commission's meetings. The British proposed establishing an international parliament to enact labour laws which each member of the League would be required to implement. Each nation would have two delegates to the parliament, one each from labour and management.[21] An international labour office would collect statistics on labour issues and enforce the new international laws. Philosophically opposed to the concept of an international parliament and convinced that international standards would lower the few protections achieved in the United States, Gompers proposed that the international labour body be authorized only to make recommendations, and that enforcement be left up to the League of Nations. Despite vigorous opposition from the British, the American proposal was adopted.[21]\\r\\n\\r\\nGompers also set the agenda for the draft charter protecting workers' rights. The Americans made 10 proposals. Three were adopted without change: That labour should not be treated as a commodity; that all workers had the right to a wage sufficient to live on; and that women should receive equal pay for equal work. A proposal protecting the freedom of speech, press, assembly, and association was amended to include only freedom of association. A proposed ban on the international shipment of goods made by children under the age of 16 was amended to ban goods made by children under the age of 14. A proposal to require an eight-hour work day was amended to require the eight-hour work day or the 40-hour work week (an exception was made for countries where productivity was low). Four other American proposals were rejected. Meanwhile, international delegates proposed three additional clauses, which were adopted: One or more days for weekly rest; equality of laws for foreign workers; and regular and frequent inspection of factory conditions.[21]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Commission issued its final report on 4 March 1919, and the Peace Conference adopted it without amendment on 11 April. The report became Part XIII of the Treaty of Versailles.[21]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first annual conference, referred to as the International Labour Conference (ILC), began on 29 October 1919 at the Pan American Union Building in Washington, D.C.[22] and adopted the first six International Labour Conventions, which dealt with hours of work in industry, unemployment, maternity protection, night work for women, minimum age, and night work for young persons in industry.[23] The prominent French socialist Albert Thomas became its first director-general.\\r\\n\\r\\nDespite open disappointment and sharp critique, the revived International Federation of Trade Unions (IFTU) quickly adapted itself to this mechanism. The IFTU increasingly oriented its international activities around the lobby work of the ILO.[24]\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the time of establishment, the U.S. government was not a member of ILO, as the US Senate rejected the covenant of the League of Nations, and the United States could not join any of its agencies. Following the election of Franklin Delano Roosevelt to the U.S. presidency, the new administration made renewed efforts to join the ILO without league membership. On 19 June, 1934, the U.S. Congress passed a joint resolution authorizing the president to join ILO without joining the League of Nations as a whole. On 22 June, 1934, the ILO adopted a resolution inviting the U.S. government to join the organization. On 20 August, 1934, the U.S. government responded positively and took its seat at the ILO.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the Second World War, when Switzerland was surrounded by German troops, ILO director John G. Winant made the decision to leave Geneva. In August 1940, the government of Canada officially invited the ILO to be housed at McGill University in Montreal. Forty staff members were transferred to the temporary offices and continued to work from McGill until 1948.[25]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe ILO became the first specialized agency of the United Nations system after the demise of the league in 1946.[26] Its constitution, as amended, includes the Declaration of Philadelphia (1944) on the aims and purposes of the organization.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn July, 1970, the United States withdrew 50% of its financial support to the ILO following the appointment of an assistant director-general from the Soviet Union. This appointment (by the ILO's British director-general, C. Wilfred Jenks) drew particular criticism from AFLÿCIO president George Meany and from Congressman John E. Rooney. However, the funds were eventually paid.[27][28]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 12 June, 1975, the ILO voted to grant the Palestinian Liberation Organization observer status at its meetings. Representatives of the United States and Israel walked out of the meeting. The U.S. House of Representatives subsequently decided to withhold funds. The United States gave notice of full withdrawal on 6 November, 1975, stating that the organization had become politicized. The United States also suggested that representation from communist countries was not truly \\"tripartite\\"including government, workers, and employersbecause of the structure of these economies. The withdrawal became effective on 1 November, 1977.[27]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe United States returned to the organization in 1980 after extracting some concessions from the organization. It was partly responsible for the ILO's shift away from a human rights approach and towards support for the Washington Consensus. Economist Guy Standing wrote \\"the ILO quietly ceased to be an international body attempting to redress structural inequality and became one promoting employment equity\\".[29]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe ILO is a major provider of labour statistics. Labour statistics are an important tool for its member states to monitor their progress toward improving labour standards. As part of their statistical work, ILO maintains several databases.[30] This database covers 11 major data series for over 200 countries. In addition, ILO publishes a number of compilations of labour statistics, such as the Key Indicators of Labour Markets[31] (KILM). KILM covers 20 main indicators on labour participation rates, employment, unemployment, educational attainment, labour cost, and economic performance. Many of these indicators have been prepared by other organizations. For example, the Division of International Labour Comparisons of the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics prepares the hourly compensation in manufacturing indicator.[32]\\r\\nThe U.S. Department of Labor also publishes a yearly report containing a List of Goods Produced by Child Labor or Forced Labor[33] issued by the Bureau of International Labor Affairs. The December 2014 updated edition of the report listed a total of 74 countries and 136 goods.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe International Training Centre of the International Labour Organization (ITCILO) is based in Turin, Italy.[34] Together with the University of Turin Department of Law, the ITC offers training for ILO officers and secretariat members, as well as offering educational programmes. For instance, the ITCILO offers a Master of Laws programme in management of development, which aims specialize professionals in the field of cooperation and development.[35]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe term child labour is often defined as work that deprives children of their childhood, potential, dignity, and is harmful to their physical and mental development.\\r\\n\\r\\nChild labour refers to work that is mentally, physically, socially or morally dangerous and harmful to children. Further, it can involve interfering with their schooling by depriving them of the opportunity to attend school, obliging them to leave school prematurely, or requiring them to attempt to combine school attendance with excessively long and heavy work.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn its most extreme forms, child labour involves children being enslaved, separated from their families, exposed to serious hazards and illnesses and left to fend for themselves on the streets of large cities ÿ often at a very early age. Whether or not particular forms of \\"work\\" can be called child labour depends on the child's age, the type and hours of work performed, the conditions under which it is performed and the objectives pursued by individual countries. The answer varies from country to country, as well as among sectors within countries.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe ILO's International Programme on the Elimination of Child Labour (IPEC) was created in 1992 with the overall goal of the progressive elimination of child labour, which was to be achieved through strengthening the capacity of countries to deal with the problem and promoting a worldwide movement to combat child labour. The IPEC currently has operations in 88 countries, with an annual expenditure on technical cooperation projects that reached over US$74 million, ?50 million in 2006. It is the largest programme of its kind globally and the biggest single operational programme of the ILO.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe number and range of the IPEC's partners have expanded over the years and now include employers' and workers' organizations, other international and government agencies, private businesses, community-based organizations, NGOs, the media, parliamentarians, the judiciary, universities, religious groups and children and their families.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe IPEC's work to eliminate child labour is an important facet of the ILO's Decent Work Agenda.[36] Child labour not only prevents children from acquiring the skills and education they need for a better future,[37] it also perpetuates poverty and affects national economies through losses in competitiveness, productivity and potential income.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nBecause of different cultural views involving labour, the ILO developed a series of culturally sensitive mandates, including convention Nos. 169, 107, 138, and 182, to protect indigenous culture, traditions, and identities. Convention Nos. 138 and 182 lead in the fight against child labour, while Nos. 107 and 169 promote the rights of indigenous and tribal peoples and protect their right to define their own developmental priorities.[38] The ILO recognizes these changes are necessary to respect the culture and traditions of other communities while also looking after the welfare of children.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn many indigenous communities, parents believe children learn important life lessons through the act of work and through the participation in daily life.  Working is seen as a learning process preparing children of the future tasks they will eventually have to do as an adult.[39] It is a belief that the family's and child well-being and survival is a shared responsibility between members of the whole family.  They also see work as an intrinsic part of their child's developmental process.  While these attitudes toward child work remain, many children and parents from indigenous communities still highly value education.[38] The ILO wants to include these communities in the fight against exploitative child labour while being sensitive to their traditions and values.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe ILO has considered the fight against forced labour to be one of its main priorities. During the interwar years, the issue was mainly considered a colonial phenomenon, and the ILO's concern was to establish minimum standards protecting the inhabitants of colonies from the worst abuses committed by economic interests. After 1945, the goal became to set a uniform and universal standard, determined by the higher awareness gained during World War II of politically and economically motivated systems of forced labour, but debates were hampered by the Cold War and by exemptions claimed by colonial powers. Since the 1960s, declarations of labour standards as a component of human rights have been weakened by government of postcolonial countries claiming a need to exercise extraordinary powers over labour in their role as emergency regimes promoting rapid economic development.[40]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn June 1998 the International Labour Conference adopted a Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work and its follow-up that obligates member states to respect, promote and realize freedom of association and the right to collective bargaining, the elimination of all forms of forced or compulsory labour, the effective abolition of child labour, and the elimination of discrimination in respect of employment and occupation.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith the adoption of the declaration, the ILO created the InFocus Programme on Promoting the Declaration which is responsible for the reporting processes and technical cooperation activities associated with the declaration; and it carries out awareness raising, advocacy and knowledge functions.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn November 2001, following the publication of the InFocus Programme's first global report on forced labour, the ILO's governing body created a special action programme to combat forced labour (SAP-FL),[41] as part of broader efforts to promote the 1998 Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work and its follow-up.\\r\\n\\r\\nSince its inception, the SAP-FL has focused on raising global awareness of forced labour in its different forms, and mobilizing action against its manifestation. Several thematic and country-specific studies and surveys have since been undertaken, on such diverse aspects of forced labour as bonded labour, human trafficking, forced domestic work, rural servitude, and forced prison labour.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe SAP-FL has spearheaded the ILO's work in this field since early 2002. The programme is designed to:\\r\\n\\r\\nTo protect the right of labours for fixing minimum wage, ILO has created Minimum Wage-Fixing Machinery Convention, 1928, Minimum Wage Fixing Machinery (Agriculture) Convention, 1951 and Minimum Wage Fixing Convention, 1970 as minimum wage law.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe International Labour Organization (ILO) is the lead UN-agency on HIV workplace policies and programmes and private sector mobilization. The ILO recognizes that HIV has a potentially devastating impact on labour and productivity and represents an enormous burden for working people, their families and communities. ILOAIDS[42] is the branch of the ILO dedicated to this issue.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe ILO has been involved with the HIV response since 1998. In June 2001, the ILO's governing body adopted a pioneering code of practice on HIV/AIDS and the world of work,[43] which was launched during a special session of the UN General Assembly.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe same year, ILO became a cosponsor of the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS).\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2010, the 99th International Labour Conference adopted the ILO's recommendation concerning HIV and AIDS and the world of work, 2010 (No. 200),[44] the first international labour standard on HIV and AIDS. The recommendation lays out a comprehensive set of principles to protect the rights of HIV-positive workers and their families, while scaling up prevention  in the workplace. Working under the theme of Preventing HIV, Protecting Human Rights at Work, ILOAIDS undertakes a range of policy advisory, research and technical support functions in the area of HIV and AIDS and the world of work. The ILO also works on promoting social protection as a means of reducing vulnerability to HIV and mitigating its impact on those living with or affected by HIV.\\r\\n\\r\\nILOAIDS is currently engaged in the \\"Getting to Zero\\"[45] campaign to arrive at zero new infections, zero AIDS-related deaths and zero-discrimination by 2015.[46] Building on this campaign, ILOAIDS is executing a programme of voluntary and confidential counselling and testing at work, known as VCT@WORK.[47]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the word \\"migrant\\" suggests, migrant workers refer to those who moves from place to place to do their job. For the rights of migrant workers, ILO has adopted conventions, including Migrant Workers (Supplementary Provisions) Convention, 1975 and United Nations Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families in 1990.\\r\\n\\r\\nDomestic workers are those who perform a variety of tasks for and in other peoples' homes. For example, they may cook / clean the house and look after children. Yet they are often the ones with the least consideration, excluded from labour and social protection. This is mainly due to the fact that women have traditionally carried out the tasks without pay.[48] For the rights and decent work of domestic workers including migrant domestic workers, ILO has adopted Convention on domestic workers on 16 June 2011.\\r\\n\\r\\nSeeking a process of globalization that is inclusive, democratically governed and provides opportunities and tangible benefits for all countries and people. The World Commission on the Social Dimension of Globalization was established by the ILO's governing body in February 2002 at the initiative of the director-general in response to the fact that there did not appear to be a space within the multilateral system that would cover adequately and comprehensively the social dimension of the various aspects of globalization. The World Commission Report, A Fair Globalization: Creating Opportunities for All, is the first attempt at structured dialogue among representatives of constituencies with different interests and opinions on the social dimension of globalization, aimed at finding common ground on one of the most controversial and divisive subjects of our time.[49]","input":"What is the purpose of the international labour organization?"},{"output":"7,200 U.S. gallons (27,276 litres)","context":"The Martin JRM Mars is a large, four-engined cargo transport seaplane originally designed and built in limited numbers for the U.S. Navy during the World War II era. It was the largest Allied flying boat to enter production, although only seven were built. The United States Navy contracted the development of the XPB2M-1 Mars in 1938 as a long range ocean patrol flying boat, which later entered production as the JRM Mars long range transport.\\r\\nFour of the surviving aircraft were later converted for civilian use to firefighting water bombers. One example of the aircraft still remains in limited service based out of Sproat Lake just outside of Port Alberni, British Columbia.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Glenn L. Martin Company scaled up their PBM Mariner patrol bomber design to produce the prototype XPB2M-1 Mars.[1] The XPB2M-1 was launched on 8 November 1941. After a delay caused by an engine fire during ground runs, the aircraft first flew on 23 June 1942. After flight tests with the XPB2M between 1942 and 1943, she was passed on to the Navy. The original patrol bomber concept was considered obsolete by this time, and the Mars was converted into a transport aircraft designated the XPB2M-1R. The Navy was satisfied with the performance, and ordered 20 of the modified JRM-1 Mars.[1] The first, named Hawaii Mars, was delivered in June 1945, but with the end of World War II the Navy scaled back their order, buying only the five aircraft which were then on the production line.[2] Though the original Hawaii Mars was lost in an accident on Chesapeake Bay a few weeks after it first flew, the other five Mars were completed, and the last delivered in 1947.\\r\\nNamed the Marianas Mars, Philippine Mars, Marshall Mars, Caroline Mars, and a second Hawaii Mars, the five production Mars aircraft entered service ferrying cargo to Hawaii and the Pacific Islands on 23 January 1944.[3] The last production airplane (the Caroline Mars) was designated JRM-2, powered by 3,000?hp (2,200?kW) Pratt & Whitney R-4360 engines, and featured a higher maximum weight and other improvements. On 4 March 1949, the Caroline Mars set a new world passenger load record by carrying 269 people from San Diego to Alameda, CA.[4] On 5 April 1950, the Marshall Mars was lost near Hawaii when an engine fire consumed the airplane after her crew had evacuated. The remaining \\"Big Four\\" flew record amounts of Naval cargo on the San Francisco-Honolulu route efficiently until 1956, when they were beached at NAS Alameda.[1]\\r\\nIn 1959, the remaining Mars aircraft were to be sold for scrap, but a Canadian company, Forest Industries Flying Tankers (FIFT), was formed and bid for the four aircraft and a large spares inventory. The company represented a consortium of British Columbia forest companies, and the bid was accepted and the sale completed in December 1959. The four aircraft were flown to Fairey Aviation at Victoria, British Columbia, for conversion into water bombers. The conversion involved the installation of a tank in the cargo bay and retractable pick-up scoops to allow uploading of water while the aircraft was taxiing. The scoops allowed 30 tons of water to be taken on board in 22 seconds. Later some of the hull fuel tanks were replaced with water tanks.\\r\\nThe Marianas Mars crashed near Northwest Bay, British Columbia, on 23 June 1961 during firefighting operations; all four crew members were lost. Just over a year later, on 12 October 1962 while parked onshore at the Victoria airport, the Caroline Mars was damaged beyond repair by Typhoon Freda when she was blown 200 yards, breaking her back.[5] The Hawaii Mars and Philippine Mars had their conversion into water bombers advanced and entered service in 1963.[1] They appeared at local airshows, demonstrating their water-dropping ability. Flying Tankers Inc. flew the water bombers to hot spots around the province when a need developed, such as in August 2003, when a large forest fire threatened the outskirts of Kelowna, British Columbia.\\r\\nOn 10 November 2006, TimberWest Forest Ltd. announced they were looking for buyers of the Mars. A condition of sale was that the purchaser would have to donate one plane back to Port Alberni when they were retired, as a historic attraction.[6] The Maryland Aviation Museum and British Columbia Aviation Council initiated a joint effort to preserve the aircraft, one for display in Maryland and the other at the current location in Canada.[7] On 13 April 2007, TimberWest announced the sale of both aircraft to Coulson Forest Products, a local forestry company in Port Alberni, British Columbia. The two surviving tankers are presently operated by Coulson Flying Tankers and are based and maintained at Sproat Lake near Port Alberni. On 25 October 2007, the Hawaii Mars (\\"Redtail\\") arrived at Lake Elsinore in southern California, on a private contract, to assist with firefighting efforts at the California wildfires of October 2007. Meanwhile, the Philippine Mars had been undergoing \\"extensive maintenance and renovation\\" and was expected to be ready to fly again by 2010.[8] As of 13 August 2009[update], the Hawaii Mars was in service fighting the La Brea fire east of Santa Maria in Southern California.\\r\\nThe aircraft can carry 7,200 U.S. gallons (27,276 litres) of water and each drop can cover an area of up to 4 acres (1.6 hectares). The aircraft can also carry up to 600 U.S. gallons (2,270 litres) of foam concentrate for gelling the load drop.[9] They are mainly used to fight fires along the coast of British Columbia and sometimes in the interior. As of July 29, 2010, the Martin Mars was being used to fight the Mason Lake/Bonaparte Lake fire north of Kamloops.[10]\\r\\nOn 23 August 2012, the Coulson Group announced that the Philippine Mars, due to its lack of use for five years, would be retired and flown to the National Naval Aviation Museum at Naval Air Station Pensacola, Florida to become a static exhibit. The aircraft was repainted to its original U.S. Navy colors and was to have been delivered to the museum in November 2012.[11] After many delays, the trade deal of transferring the aircraft to the museum was put on hold by the navy in June 2016, pending the outcome of the 2016 US Presidential election.[12]\\r\\nOn 10 May 2013, the B.C. provincial government announced that the Hawaii Mars would no longer be placed on contract after the 2013 season, due to not having been used to fight any B.C. fires for two years and the operation of newer and more versatile aircraft by the Coulson group including a Lockheed C-130 Hercules converted to firefighting use. Although Coulson stated that the Hawaii Mars has been under numerous recent upgrades to make it safer and more reliable,[13] no buyers have come forward to purchase the aircraft. Coulson also cautioned against any plans to open the aircraft as a tourist attraction because of the 2013 closure of the Flying Tankers Bomber Base Museum from poor attendance.[14]\\r\\nIn May 2015, the Hawaii Mars received a small contract to be used briefly for training Chinese pilots. This was done using the Martin Mars to evaluate against civil certification regulations by The International Test Pilot School, on how to handle such a large amphibious aircraft. These pilots will be involved with the Chinese state owned Aviation Industry Corporation of China as they get ready to launch their forthcoming AVIC TA-600 airplane.[15] Subsequently, in July 2015, the airplane was put back in service after public outcry, being awarded a 30-day contract from the BC Government to help with a particularly bad fire season.[16]\\r\\nIn 2016, the Hawaii Mars made its first appearance at EAA AirVenture Oshkosh in hopes of being sold or leased to a new home or business.[17] According to the Smithsonian Channel episode of Mighty Planes Martin Mars, only one Martin Mars is now flying.\\r\\nData from Janes Fighting Aircraft of World War II[2][23]\\r\\nGeneral characteristics\\r\\nPerformance","input":"How much water does the mars bomber hold?"},{"output":"Sonoma County","context":"Santa Rosa is a city in and the county seat of Sonoma County, California, United States.[10] Its estimated 2014 population was 174,170.[11] Santa Rosa is the largest city in California's Redwood Empire, Wine Country and the North Bay; the fifth most populous city in the San Francisco Bay Area after San Jose, San Francisco, Oakland, and Fremont; and the 28th most populous city in California.\\r\\nFive percent of the city's homes were destroyed in the Tubbs Firea 45,000 acre wildfire that occurred October 2017 and claimed the lives of at least 19 people in Sonoma County, making it the third deadliest wildfire in California state history.[12][13]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFounded in 1833 and named after Saint Rose of Lima. Before the arrival of Europeans, the wide valley containing Santa Rosa was home to a strong and populous tribe of Pomo natives known as the Bitakomtara. The Bitakomtara controlled the valley closely, barring passage to others until permission was arranged. Those who entered without permission were subject to harsh penalties. The tribe gathered at ceremonial times on Santa Rosa Creek near present-day Spring Lake Regional Park. Upon the arrival of Europeans, the Pomos were decimated by smallpox brought from Europe, and by the eradication efforts of Anglo settlers. By 1900 the Pomo population had decreased by 95%.[14]\\r\\nThe first known permanent European settlement of Santa Rosa was the homestead of the Carrillo family, in-laws to Mariano Guadalupe Vallejo, who settled the Sonoma pueblo and Petaluma area. In the 1830s, during the Mexican period, the family of Mara L܇pez de Carrillo built an adobe house on their Rancho Cabeza de Santa Rosa land grant, just east of what later became downtown Santa Rosa. Allegedly, however, by the 1820s, before the Carrillos built their adobe in the 1830s, Spanish and Mexican settlers from nearby Sonoma and other settlements to the south raised livestock in the area and slaughtered animals at the fork of the Santa Rosa Creek and Matanzas Creek, near the intersection of modern-day Santa Rosa Avenue and Sonoma Avenue. This is supposedly the origin of the name of Matanzas Creek as, because of its use as a slaughtering place, the confluence came to be called La Matanza.\\r\\nBy the 1850s, a Wells Fargo post and general store were established in what is now downtown Santa Rosa. In the mid-1850s, several prominent locals, including Julio Carrillo, son of Maria Carrillo, laid out the grid street pattern for Santa Rosa with a public square in the center, a pattern which largely remains as the street pattern for downtown Santa Rosa to this day, despite changes to the central square, now called Old Courthouse Square.\\r\\nIn 1867, the county recognized Santa Rosa as an incorporated city and in 1868 the state officially confirmed the incorporation, making it officially the third incorporated city in Sonoma County, after Petaluma, incorporated in 1858, and Healdsburg, incorporated in 1867.\\r\\nThe U.S. Census records, among others, show that after California became a state, Santa Rosa grew steadily early on, despite initially lagging behind nearby Petaluma in the 1850s and early 1860s. According to the U.S. Census, in 1870 Santa Rosa was the eighth largest city in California, and county seat of one of the most populous counties in the state. Growth and development after that was steady but never rapid. The city continued to grow when other early population centers declined or stagnated, but by 1900 it was being overtaken by many other newer population centers in the San Francisco Bay Area and Southern California. According to a 1905 article in the Press Democrat newspaper reporting on the \\"Battle of the Trains\\", the city had just over 10,000 people at the time.\\r\\nThe 1906 San Francisco earthquake essentially destroyed the entire downtown, but the city's population did not greatly suffer. However, after that period the population growth of Santa Rosa, as with most of the area, was very slow.\\r\\nFamed director Alfred Hitchcock filmed his thriller Shadow of a Doubt in Santa Rosa in 1943; the film gives glimpses of Santa Rosa in the 1940s. Many of the downtown buildings seen in the film no longer exist due to major reconstruction following the strong earthquakes in October 1969. However, some, like the rough-stone Northwestern Pacific Railroad depot and the prominent Empire Building (built in 1910 with a gold-topped clock tower), still survive. A scene at the bank was filmed at the corner of Fourth Street and Mendocino Avenue (at present day Old Courthouse square); the KRESS building on Fourth Street is also visible. However, the courthouse and bank are now gone. The Coen brothers' 2001 film The Man Who Wasn't There is set in Santa Rosa c. 1949.\\r\\nSanta Rosa grew following World War II, because it was the location for Naval Auxiliary Landing Field Santa Rosa, the remnants now located in southwest Santa Rosa. The city was a convenient location for San Francisco travelers bound for the Russian River.\\r\\nThe population increased by 2/3 between 1950 and 1970, an average of 1,000 new residents a year over the 20 years. Some of the increase was from immigration, and some from annexation of portions of the surrounding area.\\r\\nIn 1958 the United States Office of Civil and Defense Mobilization designated Santa Rosa as one of its eight regional headquarters, with jurisdiction over Region 7, which included American Samoa, Arizona, California, Guam, Hawaii, Nevada, and Utah. Santa Rosa continued as a major center for civil defense activity (under the Office of Emergency Planning and the Office of Emergency Preparedness) until 1979 when the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) was created in its place, ending the civil defense's 69-year history.[15]\\r\\nWhen the City Council adopted the city's first modern General Plan in 1991, the population was about 113,000. In the 21 years following 1970, Santa Rosa grew by about 3,000 residents a yeartriple the average growth during the previous twenty years.\\r\\nSanta Rosa 2010, the 1991 General Plan, called for a population of 175,000 in 2010. The Council expanded the city's urban boundary to include all the land then planned for future annexation, and declared it would be Santa Rosa's \\"ultimate\\" boundary. The rapid growth that was being criticized as urban sprawl became routine infill development.\\r\\nAt the first five-year update of the plan, in 1996, the Council extended the planning period by ten years, renaming it Vision 2020 (updated to Santa Rosa 2020, and then again to Santa Rosa 2030 Vision), and added more land and population. Now the City projects a population of 195,000 in 2020.\\r\\nOn October 9, 2017, the Tubbs Fire, a wind-whipped firestorm, incinerated dozens of city blocks primarily in the central northern part of Santa Rosa, and killed at least 19 people in Sonoma County. Most homes in the Coffey Park and Fountaingrove neighborhoods were destroyed.[16]\\r\\nSanta Rosa is located at 382655N 1224217W? / ?38.448611N 122.704722W? / 38.448611; -122.704722[1] in Sonoma County. According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 41.50?sq?mi (107.5?km2), of which 41.29?sq?mi (106.9?km2) is land and 0.205?sq?mi (0.5?km2) (0.49%) is water.[17]\\r\\nThe city is part of the North Bay region, which includes such cities as Petaluma, Rohnert Park, Windsor, and smaller cities as Sonoma, Healdsburg, Sebastopol. It lies along the US Route 101 corridor, approximately 55 miles (89?km) north of San Francisco, via the Golden Gate Bridge.\\r\\nSanta Rosa lies on the Santa Rosa Plain. The city's eastern extremities stretch into the Valley of the Moon, and the Sonoma Creek watershed known as the Sonoma Valley. The city's western edge lies in the Laguna de Santa Rosa catchment basin.\\r\\nThe city is in the watershed of Santa Rosa Creek, which rises on Hood Mountain and discharges to the Laguna de Santa Rosa. Tributary basins to Santa Rosa Creek lying significantly in the city are Brush Creek, Matanzas Creek, and Piner Creek. Other water bodies within the city include Fountaingrove Lake, Lake Ralphine, and Santa Rosa Creek Reservoir.\\r\\nThe prominent visual features east of the city include Bennett Peak, Mount Hood, and Sonoma and Taylor Mountains.[18]\\r\\nSanta Rosa has a warm-summer Mediterranean climate (K?ppen Csb) with cool, wet winters and warm, dry summers. In the summer, fog and low overcast often move in from the Pacific Ocean during the evenings and mornings. They usually clear up to warm, sunny weather by late morning or noon before returning in the later evening but will occasionally linger all day. Average annual rainfall is 32.20 inches (818?mm), falling on 74 days annually. The wettest year was 1983 with 63.07 inches (1,602?mm) and the driest year was 1976 with 11.38 inches (289?mm). The most rainfall in one month was 19.42 inches (493?mm) in February 1998 and the most rainfall in 24 hours was 5.23 inches (133?mm) on December 19, 1981. Measurable snowfall is rare in the lowlands, but light amounts sometimes fall in the nearby mountains.\\r\\nThere are an average of 28.9 days with highs of 90?F (32?C) or more and an average of 30.2 days with lows reaching the freezing mark. The record high was 113?F (45?C) on July 11, 1913, and the record low was 9?F (?13?C) on December 25, 1924.[19]\\r\\nSanta Rosa lies atop the Healdsburg-Rodgers Creek segment of the Hayward-Rodgers Creek Fault System. The Working Group on California Earthquake Probabilities estimated a minimum 27 percent chance of a magnitude 6.7 or greater earthquake on this segment by 2037.[21]\\r\\nOn April 14, 2005, the United States Geological Survey released a map detailing the results of a new tool that measures ground shaking during an earthquake. The map determined that the 1906 San Francisco earthquake was most powerful in an area between Santa Rosa and what is now Sebastopol, causing more damage in Santa Rosa (for its size) than any other city affected.[22]\\r\\nOn October 1, 1969, two earthquakes of magnitudes 5.6 and 5.7 shook Santa Rosa, damaging about 100 structures. They were the strongest quakes to affect the city since 1906. The epicenters were about two miles (3?km) north of Santa Rosa.\\r\\nDue to its population, much of Santa Rosa's remaining undisturbed area is on its urban fringe. However, the principal wildlife corridors of Santa Rosa Creek and its tributaries flow right through the heart of the town. Great blue herons, great egrets, snowy egrets and black-crowned herons nest in the trees of the median strip on West Ninth Street as well as along Santa Rosa Creek and downtown. Deer often are spotted roaming the neighborhoods nearer the eastern hills, as deep into town as Franklin Avenue and the McDonald area; rafters of wild turkeys are relatively common in some areas; and mountain lions are occasionally observed within city limits. Raccoons and opossums are a common sight throughout the city, while foxes, and rabbits may be regularly seen in the more rural areas. In addition, the city borders and then wraps around the northern end of Trione Annadel State Park, which itself extends into the Sonoma Mountains and Sonoma Valley. Trione Annadel State Park also adjoins Spring Lake County Park and Howarth Park, forming one contiguous park system that enables visitors to venture into wild native habitats.\\r\\nSanta Rosa can be seen as divided into four quadrants: Northeast, Southeast, Southwest, and Northwest. U.S. Route 101 runs roughly north and south through the city, and divides it into east and west sides.

Police shootings in 2007 led to calls for an independent civilian police review board.[53]\\r\\nNeighborhoods such as South Park in south Santa Rosa, and Roseland, West Ninth District, and Apple Valley in west Santa Rosa, are most vulnerable to criminal activity. Acts of crime in these neighborhoods are commonly burglaries, graffiti, and violent gang activity. Mexican American street gangs such as Sure?os and Norte?os have large concentrations throughout Santa Rosa.[33][54][55] In 2011, there were 5 homicides, 58 rapes, 134 robberies, 485 aggravated assaults, and 637 burglaries. The violent crime rate for Santa Rosa (401.7 per 100,000 people) is slightly lower than the rate of California (411.1 per 100,000 people) and higher than that of the entire U.S. (386.3 per 100,000 people).[56]\\r\\nOn May 9, 1878, Charles Henley, a 57-year-old farmer from Windsor, California, murdered his neighbor James Rowland after Rowland complained about Henley's pigs being loose on his property. Henley left Rowland's body to be eaten by his hogs, and the next day Henley turned himself in to the authorities. In the early morning hours of June 9, groups of men started to appear on the streets of Santa Rosa. One group went to the home of jailer Sylvester Wilson, where the men held his family hostage while Wilson was taken to the jail to hand over the keys to the lynch mob. Wilson and night guard R. Dryer were taken in a wagon and dropped off on the outskirts of Santa Rosa. Henley was found hanging from a tree not far from where the two men were released. The lynchers were never caught.[57]\\r\\nOn December 5, 1920, Santa Rosa native Terry Fitts, along with San Francisco hoodlums \\"Spanish\\" Charley Valento and George Boyd, got into a shootout with a joint police squad from Santa Rosa, Sonoma County and the San Francisco Police department. The outlaws were wanted in San Francisco for the gang rape of a young woman. Fitts, Valento, and Boyd were at the home of an acquaintance, looking for food or money, when the police caught up with them. As the police crashed through the door of the home, Boyd shot and killed San Francisco police detective Lester Dohrman, Sergeant Miles Jackson, and Sonoma County Sheriff Jim Petray. The three wanted men were then quickly taken into custody. On December 10, 1920, a group of men entered the jail without a struggle, took the men out of their cell, and drove them to Santa Rosa Rural Cemetery. They were strung up by their necks in their long underwear and left to swing in the wind. The inquest's verdict was \\"death by persons unknown\\". It was rumored that the lynch mob was made up of men from nearby Healdsburg, California who were friends of Sheriff Petray.[57]\\r\\nOn July 15, 1935, disgruntled rancher and hunting guide Al Chamberlain dressed up in his finest cowboy clothes, drove to his former ranch outside of Santa Rosa and shot John McCabe, the new owner of the property, leaving him for dead. He survived. Chamberlain drove his beat-up car to Santa Rosa where he walked into the Santa Rosa police station and killed Chief Charlie O'Neal. Chamberlain had owned a livery stable in downtown Santa Rosa for years, but was forced to vacate his business through eminent domain when the city wanted to build their new city hall on Chamberlain's property. Chief O'Neal personally signed and served Chamberlain his notice to vacate. Financially broken, Chamberlain had to sell his beloved ranch on Saint Helena Road. O'Neal continued to harass Chamberlain to the point where he got the prosecutor to sentence Chamberlain to thirty days and a hundred-dollar fine for accidentally hitting a pedestrian. He was never the same man after he was released from jail. After shooting O'Neal, Chamberlain calmly walked down the street with a pistol in each hand, searching for Sonoma County Sheriff Harry Patteson. Patteson heard the gunshots and bumped into Chamberlain, who did not recognize him. Patteson disarmed and tackled Chamberlain, with the help of Joe Schurman and Burnette Dibble. He was sentenced to life in prison and died in San Quentin Prison.[57]\\r\\nOn October 22, 2013, 13-year-old Andy Lopez was shot and killed by Sonoma County sheriff's deputy Erick Gelhaus in the Moorland neighborhood of Santa Rosa. Lopez was walking to his friend's house while carrying an airsoft gun replica of an AK-47. Gelhaus mistook the airsoft gun for a real rifle, and demanded that Lopez drop the weapon. Gelhaus then fired eight shots at Lopez, killing him. The shooting prompted protests in Santa Rosa, which attracted protesters from around Northern California.[58] The Lopez family filed a lawsuit at the District Court in November, claiming that Gelhaus shot Lopez \\"without reasonable cause.\\"[59][60] They amended their lawsuit in January 2014, claiming that the Sheriff's office had long known that Gelhaus had a \\"propensity ... to recklessly draw his firearm and to use excessive force\\". The deputy's attorney argued that Gelhaus \\"absolutely believed\\" that the gun was real and that his life was in danger.[61]\\r\\nNotable people who were born or have lived in Santa Rosa include botanist Luther Burbank, chef Guy Fieri, singer and actress Julie London, cartoonists Charles M. Schulz and Stephan Pastis, Ripley's Believe It or Not! creator Robert Ripley, international concert pianist and arts entrepreneur Kevin Kwan Loucks, and former professional road racing cyclist Levi Leipheimer.\\r\\nSanta Rosa has served as a location for many major films,[62] including:\\r\\nOn a clear October night the wind began to gust beyond 50 miles per hour. What started as a small fire in north east Sonoma county along Highway 128 became the third largest fires to hit Northern California. In a matter of a couple hours the gusting North Eastern wind drove the fire into the city limits. Across a six lane freeway into the middle-class neighborhood known as Coffey Park destroying thousands of homes in the early hours of the morning. The fire was fueled by dry brush, native oaktrees, and homes as it climbed up and over the well established Mark West and Fountaingrove skyline that over looked the city of Santa Rosa.\\r\\nThe well known Round Barn which sat along the beautiful hill side for over 100 years burned to the ground along with many other businesses. Before there was a Walmart or a Target in Sonoma county there was a Kmart where everyone shopped that was turned to a blaze that stretched as large as a football field. Cardinal Newman high school was along the fires path as it headed south along Old Redwood highway. A local gun store went up in fire as it filled the air with the sound of explosions for what seemed like an hour or more. Mountain Mikes pizza, McDonald's, Arby's, and many others were on the list of businesses that became ash.\\r\\nThe fire burned strong for over 7 days. Bringing the largest aerial attack in history to Sonoma County skies. Some of the airplanes include a massive 747, a C-130, S-2, OV-10, Blackhawk, and Chinook helicopter. Every police agency in the San Francisco Bay Area was called in to help. Fire support from clear across California and as far as Australia came to aid in the fight to end this fire.","input":"What part of california is santa rosa in?"},{"output":"AD 80","context":"The Colosseum or Coliseum (/k?l??si??m/ kol-?-SEE-?m), also known as the Flavian Amphitheatre (Latin: Amphitheatrum Flavium; Italian: Anfiteatro Flavio [a?fite?a?tro ?fla?vjo] or Colosseo [kolos?s??o]), is an oval amphitheatre in the centre of the city of Rome, Italy. Built of travertine, tuff, and brick-faced concrete,[1] it is the largest amphitheatre ever built. The Colosseum is situated just east of the Roman Forum. Construction began under the emperor Vespasian in AD 72,[2] and was completed in AD 80 under his successor and heir Titus.[3] Further modifications were made during the reign of Domitian (81ÿ96).[4] These three emperors are known as the Flavian dynasty, and the amphitheatre was named in Latin for its association with their family name (Flavius).\\r\\nThe Colosseum could hold, it is estimated, between 50,000 and 80,000 spectators,[5][6] having an average audience of some 65,000;[7][8] it was used for gladiatorial contests and public spectacles such as mock sea battles (for only a short time as the hypogeum was soon filled in with mechanisms to support the other activities), animal hunts, executions, re-enactments of famous battles, and dramas based on Classical mythology. The building ceased to be used for entertainment in the early medieval era. It was later reused for such purposes as housing, workshops, quarters for a religious order, a fortress, a quarry, and a Christian shrine.\\r\\nAlthough partially ruined because of damage caused by earthquakes and stone-robbers, the Colosseum is still an iconic symbol of Imperial Rome. It is one of Rome's most popular tourist attractions and also has links to the Roman Catholic Church, as each Good Friday the Pope leads a torchlit \\"Way of the Cross\\" procession that starts in the area around the Colosseum.[9]\\r\\nThe Colosseum is also depicted on the Italian version of the five-cent euro coin.\\r\\nThe Colosseum's original Latin name was Amphitheatrum Flavium, often anglicized as Flavian Amphitheatre. The building was constructed by emperors of the Flavian dynasty, following the reign of Nero.[10] This name is still used in modern English, but generally the structure is better known as the Colosseum. In antiquity, Romans may have referred to the Colosseum by the unofficial name Amphitheatrum Caesareum (with Caesareum an adjective pertaining to the title Caesar), but this name may have been strictly poetic[11][12] as it was not exclusive to the Colosseum; Vespasian and Titus, builders of the Colosseum, also constructed an amphitheater of the same name in Puteoli (modern Pozzuoli).[13]\\r\\nThe name Colosseum has long been believed to be derived from a colossal statue of Nero nearby[4] (the statue of Nero was named after the Colossus of Rhodes).[citation needed] This statue was later remodeled by Nero's successors into the likeness of Helios (Sol) or Apollo, the sun god, by adding the appropriate solar crown. Nero's head was also replaced several times with the heads of succeeding emperors. Despite its pagan links, the statue remained standing well into the medieval era and was credited with magical powers. It came to be seen as an iconic symbol of the permanence of Rome.\\r\\nIn the 8th century, a famous epigram attributed to the Venerable Bede celebrated the symbolic significance of the statue in a prophecy that is variously quoted: Quamdiu stat Colis?us, stat et Roma; quando cadet colis?us, cadet et Roma; quando cadet Roma, cadet et mundus (\\"as long as the Colossus stands, so shall Rome; when the Colossus falls, Rome shall fall; when Rome falls, so falls the world\\").[14] This is often mistranslated to refer to the Colosseum rather than the Colossus (as in, for instance, Byron's poem Childe Harold's Pilgrimage). However, at the time that the Pseudo-Bede wrote, the masculine noun coliseus was applied to the statue rather than to what was still known as the Flavian amphitheatre.\\r\\nThe Colossus did eventually fall, possibly being pulled down to reuse its bronze. By the year 1000 the name \\"Colosseum\\" had been coined to refer to the amphitheatre. The statue itself was largely forgotten and only its base survives, situated between the Colosseum and the nearby Temple of Venus and Roma.[15]\\r\\nThe name further evolved to Coliseum during the Middle Ages. In Italy, the amphitheatre is still known as il Colosseo, and other Romance languages have come to use similar forms such as Coloseumul (Romanian), le Colise (French), el Coliseo (Spanish) and o Coliseu (Portuguese).\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe site chosen was a flat area on the floor of a low valley between the Caelian, Esquiline and Palatine Hills, through which a canalised stream ran. By the 2nd century BC the area was densely inhabited. It was devastated by the Great Fire of Rome in AD 64, following which Nero seized much of the area to add to his personal domain. He built the grandiose Domus Aurea on the site, in front of which he created an artificial lake surrounded by pavilions, gardens and porticoes. The existing Aqua Claudia aqueduct was extended to supply water to the area and the gigantic bronze Colossus of Nero was set up nearby at the entrance to the Domus Aurea.[15]\\r\\nAlthough the Colossus was preserved, much of the Domus Aurea was torn down. The lake was filled in and the land reused as the location for the new Flavian Amphitheatre. Gladiatorial schools and other support buildings were constructed nearby within the former grounds of the Domus Aurea. Vespasian's decision to build the Colosseum on the site of Nero's lake can be seen as a populist gesture of returning to the people an area of the city which Nero had appropriated for his own use. In contrast to many other amphitheatres, which were located on the outskirts of a city, the Colosseum was constructed in the city centre; in effect, placing it both symbolically and precisely at the heart of Rome.\\r\\nConstruction was funded by the opulent spoils taken from the Jewish Temple after the Great Jewish Revolt in 70 AD led to the Siege of Jerusalem. According to a reconstructed inscription found on the site, \\"the emperor Vespasian ordered this new amphitheatre to be erected from his general's share of the booty.\\" Along with the spoils, estimated 100,000 Jewish prisoners were brought back to Rome after the war, and many contributed to the massive workforce needed for construction. The slaves undertook manual labor such as working in the quarries at Tivoli where the travertine was quarried, along with lifting and transporting the quarried stones 20 miles from Tivoli to Rome.[16] Along with this free source of unskilled labor, teams of professional Roman builders, engineers, artists, painters and decorators undertook the more specialized tasks necessary for building the Colosseum.\\r\\nConstruction of the Colosseum began under the rule of Vespasian[4] in around 70ÿ72 AD (73-75 AD according to some sources)[16] The Colosseum had been completed up to the third story by the time of Vespasian's death in 79. The top level was finished by his son, Titus, in 80,[4] and the inaugural games were held in A.D. 80 or 81.[16] Dio Cassius recounts that over 9,000 wild animals were killed during the inaugural games of the amphitheatre. Commemorative coinage was issued celebrating the inauguration.[17] The building was remodelled further under Vespasian's younger son, the newly designated Emperor Domitian, who constructed the hypogeum, a series of underground tunnels used to house animals and slaves. He also added a gallery to the top of the Colosseum to increase its seating capacity.[18]\\r\\nIn 217, the Colosseum was badly damaged by a major fire (caused by lightning, according to Dio Cassius[19]) which destroyed the wooden upper levels of the amphitheatre's interior. It was not fully repaired until about 240 and underwent further repairs in 250 or 252 and again in 320. Gladiatorial fights are last mentioned around 435. An inscription records the restoration of various parts of the Colosseum under Theodosius II and Valentinian III (reigned 425ÿ455), possibly to repair damage caused by a major earthquake in 443; more work followed in 484[20] and 508. The arena continued to be used for contests well into the 6th century. Animal hunts continued until at least 523, when Anicius Maximus celebrated his consulship with some venationes, criticised by King Theodoric the Great for their high cost.[15]\\r\\nThe Colosseum underwent several radical changes of use during the medieval period. By the late 6th century a small chapel had been built into the structure of the amphitheater, though this apparently did not confer any particular religious significance on the building as a whole. The arena was converted into a cemetery. The numerous vaulted spaces in the arcades under the seating were converted into housing and workshops, and are recorded as still being rented out as late as the 12th century. Around 1200 the Frangipani family took over the Colosseum and fortified it, apparently using it as a castle.\\r\\nSevere damage was inflicted on the Colosseum by the great earthquake in 1349, causing the outer south side, lying on a less stable alluvial terrain, to collapse. Much of the tumbled stone was reused to build palaces, churches, hospitals and other buildings elsewhere in Rome. A religious order moved into the northern third of the Colosseum in the mid-14th century [21] and continued to inhabit it until as late as the early 19th century. The interior of the amphitheater was extensively stripped of stone, which was reused elsewhere, or (in the case of the marble fa?ade) was burned to make quicklime.[15] The bronze clamps which held the stonework together were pried or hacked out of the walls, leaving numerous pockmarks which still scar the building today.\\r\\nDuring the 16th and 17th century, Church officials sought a productive role for the Colosseum. Pope Sixtus V (1585ÿ1590) planned to turn the building into a wool factory to provide employment for Rome's prostitutes, though this proposal fell through with his premature death.[22] In 1671 Cardinal Altieri authorized its use for bullfights; a public outcry caused the idea to be hastily abandoned.\\r\\nIn 1749, Pope Benedict XIV endorsed the view that the Colosseum was a sacred site where early Christians had been martyred. He forbade the use of the Colosseum as a quarry and consecrated the building to the Passion of Christ and installed Stations of the Cross, declaring it sanctified by the blood of the Christian martyrs who perished there (see Significance in Christianity). However, there is no historical evidence to support Benedict's claim, nor is there even any evidence that anyone before the 16th century suggested this might be the case; the Catholic Encyclopedia concludes that there are no historical grounds for the supposition, other than the reasonably plausible conjecture that some of the many martyrs may well have been.[23]\\r\\nLater popes initiated various stabilization and restoration projects, removing the extensive vegetation which had overgrown the structure and threatened to damage it further. The fa?ade was reinforced with triangular brick wedges in 1807 and 1827, and the interior was repaired in 1831, 1846 and in the 1930s. The arena substructure was partly excavated in 1810ÿ1814 and 1874 and was fully exposed under Benito Mussolini in the 1930s.[15]\\r\\nThe Colosseum is today one of Rome's most popular tourist attractions, receiving millions of visitors annually. The effects of pollution and general deterioration over time prompted a major restoration programme carried out between 1993 and 2000, at a cost of 40?billion Italian lire ($19.3m / ?20.6m at 2000 prices).\\r\\nIn recent years the Colosseum has become a symbol of the international campaign against capital punishment, which was abolished in Italy in 1948. Several antiÿdeath penalty demonstrations took place in front of the Colosseum in 2000. Since that time, as a gesture against the death penalty, the local authorities of Rome change the color of the Colosseum's night time illumination from white to gold whenever a person condemned to the death penalty anywhere in the world gets their sentence commuted or is released,[24] or if a jurisdiction abolishes the death penalty. Most recently, the Colosseum was illuminated in gold in November 2012 following the abolishment of capital punishment in the American state of Connecticut in April 2012.[25]\\r\\nBecause of the ruined state of the interior, it is impractical to use the Colosseum to host large events; only a few hundred spectators can be accommodated in temporary seating. However, much larger concerts have been held just outside, using the Colosseum as a backdrop. Performers who have played at the Colosseum in recent years have included Ray Charles (May 2002),[26] Paul McCartney (May 2003),[27] Elton John (September 2005),[28] and Billy Joel (July 2006).\\r\\nUnlike earlier Greek theatres that were built into hillsides, the Colosseum is an entirely free-standing structure. It derives its basic exterior and interior architecture from that of two Roman theatres back to back. It is elliptical in plan and is 189 meters (615?ft / 640 Roman feet) long, and 156 meters (510?ft / 528 Roman feet) wide, with a base area of 24,000 square metres (6 acres). The height of the outer wall is 48 meters (157?ft / 165 Roman feet). The perimeter originally measured 545 meters (1,788?ft / 1,835 Roman feet). The central arena is an oval 87?m (287?ft) long and 55?m (180?ft) wide, surrounded by a wall 5?m (15?ft) high, above which rose tiers of seating.\\r\\nThe outer wall is estimated to have required over 100,000 cubic metres (3,531,467 cubic feet) of travertine stone which were set without mortar; they were held together by 300 tons of iron clamps.[15] However, it has suffered extensive damage over the centuries, with large segments having collapsed following earthquakes. The north side of the perimeter wall is still standing; the distinctive triangular brick wedges at each end are modern additions, having been constructed in the early 19th century to shore up the wall. The remainder of the present-day exterior of the Colosseum is in fact the original interior wall.\\r\\nThe surviving part of the outer wall's monumental fa?ade comprises three stories of superimposed arcades surmounted by a podium on which stands a tall attic, both of which are pierced by windows interspersed at regular intervals. The arcades are framed by half-columns of the Doric, Ionic, and Corinthian orders, while the attic is decorated with Corinthian pilasters.[29] Each of the arches in the second- and third-floor arcades framed statues, probably honoring divinities and other figures from Classical mythology.\\r\\nTwo hundred and forty mast corbels were positioned around the top of the attic. They originally supported a retractable awning, known as the velarium, that kept the sun and rain off spectators. This consisted of a canvas-covered, net-like structure made of ropes, with a hole in the center.[4] It covered two-thirds of the arena, and sloped down towards the center to catch the wind and provide a breeze for the audience. Sailors, specially enlisted from the Roman naval headquarters at Misenum and housed in the nearby Castra Misenatium, were used to work the velarium.[30]\\r\\nThe Colosseum's huge crowd capacity made it essential that the venue could be filled or evacuated quickly. Its architects adopted solutions very similar to those used in modern stadiums to deal with the same problem. The amphitheatre was ringed by eighty entrances at ground level, 76 of which were used by ordinary spectators.[4] Each entrance and exit was numbered, as was each staircase. The northern main entrance was reserved for the Roman Emperor and his aides, whilst the other three axial entrances were most likely used by the elite. All four axial entrances were richly decorated with painted stucco reliefs, of which fragments survive. Many of the original outer entrances have disappeared with the collapse of the perimeter wall, but entrances XXIII (23) to LIV (54) survive.[15]\\r\\nSpectators were given tickets in the form of numbered pottery shards, which directed them to the appropriate section and row. They accessed their seats via vomitoria (singular vomitorium), passageways that opened into a tier of seats from below or behind. These quickly dispersed people into their seats and, upon conclusion of the event or in an emergency evacuation, could permit their exit within only a few minutes. The name vomitoria derived from the Latin word for a rapid discharge, from which English derives the word vomit.\\r\\nAccording to the Codex-Calendar of 354, the Colosseum could accommodate 87,000 people, although modern estimates put the figure at around 50,000. They were seated in a tiered arrangement that reflected the rigidly stratified nature of Roman society. Special boxes were provided at the north and south ends respectively for the Emperor and the Vestal Virgins, providing the best views of the arena. Flanking them at the same level was a broad platform or podium for the senatorial class, who were allowed to bring their own chairs. The names of some 5th century senators can still be seen carved into the stonework, presumably reserving areas for their use.\\r\\nThe tier above the senators, known as the maenianum primum, was occupied by the non-senatorial noble class or knights (equites). The next level up, the maenianum secundum, was originally reserved for ordinary Roman citizens (plebeians) and was divided into two sections. The lower part (the immum) was for wealthy citizens, while the upper part (the summum) was for poor citizens. Specific sectors were provided for other social groups: for instance, boys with their tutors, soldiers on leave, foreign dignitaries, scribes, heralds, priests and so on. Stone (and later marble) seating was provided for the citizens and nobles, who presumably would have brought their own cushions with them. Inscriptions identified the areas reserved for specific groups.\\r\\nAnother level, the maenianum secundum in legneis, was added at the very top of the building during the reign of Domitian. This comprised a gallery for the common poor, slaves and women. It would have been either standing room only, or would have had very steep wooden benches. Some groups were banned altogether from the Colosseum, notably gravediggers, actors and former gladiators.[15]\\r\\nEach tier was divided into sections (maeniana) by curved passages and low walls (praecinctiones or baltei), and were subdivided into cunei, or wedges, by the steps and aisles from the vomitoria. Each row (gradus) of seats was numbered, permitting each individual seat to be exactly designated by its gradus, cuneus, and number.[31]\\r\\nThe arena itself was 83?meters by 48?meters (272?ft by 157?ft / 280 by 163?Roman feet).[15] It comprised a wooden floor covered by sand (the Latin word for sand is harena or arena), covering an elaborate underground structure called the hypogeum (literally meaning \\"underground\\"). The hypogeum was not part of the original construction but was ordered to be built by Emperor Domitian. Little now remains of the original arena floor, but the hypogeum is still clearly visible. It consisted of a two-level subterranean network of tunnels and cages beneath the arena where gladiators and animals were held before contests began. Eighty vertical shafts provided instant access to the arena for caged animals and scenery pieces concealed underneath; larger hinged platforms, called hegmata, provided access for elephants and the like. It was restructured on numerous occasions; at least twelve different phases of construction can be seen.[15]\\r\\nThe hypogeum was connected by underground tunnels to a number of points outside the Colosseum. Animals and performers were brought through the tunnel from nearby stables, with the gladiators' barracks at the Ludus Magnus to the east also being connected by tunnels. Separate tunnels were provided for the Emperor and the Vestal Virgins to permit them to enter and exit the Colosseum without needing to pass through the crowds.[15]\\r\\nSubstantial quantities of machinery also existed in the hypogeum. Elevators and pulleys raised and lowered scenery and props, as well as lifting caged animals to the surface for release. There is evidence for the existence of major hydraulic mechanisms[15] and according to ancient accounts, it was possible to flood the arena rapidly, presumably via a connection to a nearby aqueduct. However, the construction of the hypogeum at Domitian's behest put an end to the practise of flooding, and thus also to naval battles, early in the Colosseum's existence.\\r\\nThe Colosseum and its activities supported a substantial industry in the area. In addition to the amphitheatre itself, many other buildings nearby were linked to the games. Immediately to the east is the remains of the Ludus Magnus, a training school for gladiators. This was connected to the Colosseum by an underground passage, to allow easy access for the gladiators. The Ludus Magnus had its own miniature training arena, which was itself a popular attraction for Roman spectators. Other training schools were in the same area, including the Ludus Matutinus (Morning School), where fighters of animals were trained, plus the Dacian and Gallic Schools.\\r\\nAlso nearby were the Armamentarium, comprising an armory to store weapons; the Summum Choragium, where machinery was stored; the Sanitarium, which had facilities to treat wounded gladiators; and the Spoliarium, where bodies of dead gladiators were stripped of their armor and disposed of.\\r\\nAround the perimeter of the Colosseum, at a distance of 18?m (59?ft) from the perimeter, was a series of tall stone posts, with five remaining on the eastern side. Various explanations have been advanced for their presence; they may have been a religious boundary, or an outer boundary for ticket checks, or an anchor for the velarium or awning.[15]\\r\\nRight next to the Colosseum is also the Arch of Constantine.\\r\\nThe Colosseum was used to host gladiatorial shows as well as a variety of other events. The shows, called munera, were always given by private individuals rather than the state. They had a strong religious element but were also demonstrations of power and family prestige, and were immensely popular with the population. Another popular type of show was the animal hunt, or venatio. This utilized a great variety of wild beasts, mainly imported from Africa and the Middle East, and included creatures such as rhinoceros, hippopotamuses, elephants, giraffes, aurochs, wisents, Barbary lions, panthers, leopards, bears, Caspian tigers, crocodiles and ostriches. Battles and hunts were often staged amid elaborate sets with movable trees and buildings. Such events were occasionally on a huge scale; Trajan is said to have celebrated his victories in Dacia in 107 with contests involving 11,000 animals and 10,000 gladiators over the course of 123 days. During lunch intervals, executions ad bestias would be staged. Those condemned to death would be sent into the arena, naked and unarmed, to face the beasts of death which would literally tear them to pieces. Other performances would also take place by acrobats and magicians, typically during the intervals.\\r\\nDuring the early days of the Colosseum, ancient writers recorded that the building was used for naumachiae (more properly known as navalia proelia) or simulated sea battles. Accounts of the inaugural games held by Titus in AD 80 describe it being filled with water for a display of specially trained swimming horses and bulls. There is also an account of a re-enactment of a famous sea battle between the Corcyrean (Corfiot) Greeks and the Corinthians. This has been the subject of some debate among historians; although providing the water would not have been a problem, it is unclear how the arena could have been waterproofed, nor would there have been enough space in the arena for the warships to move around. It has been suggested that the reports either have the location wrong, or that the Colosseum originally featured a wide floodable channel down its central axis (which would later have been replaced by the hypogeum).[15]\\r\\nSylvae or recreations of natural scenes were also held in the arena. Painters, technicians and architects would construct a simulation of a forest with real trees and bushes planted in the arena's floor, and animals would then be introduced. Such scenes might be used simply to display a natural environment for the urban population, or could otherwise be used as the backdrop for hunts or dramas depicting episodes from mythology. They were also occasionally used for executions in which the hero of the story ÿ played by a condemned person ÿ was killed in one of various gruesome but mythologically authentic ways, such as being mauled by beasts or burned to death.\\r\\nThe Colosseum today is now a major tourist attraction in Rome with thousands of tourists each year paying to view the interior arena, though entrance for citizens of the European Union (EU) is partially subsidised, and entrance is free for EU citizens under eighteen or over sixty-five years of age.[32] There is now a museum dedicated to Eros located in the upper floor of the outer wall of the building. Part of the arena floor has been re-floored. Beneath the Colosseum, a network of subterranean passageways once used to transport wild animals and gladiators to the arena opened to the public in summer 2010.[33]\\r\\nThe Colosseum is also the site of Roman Catholic ceremonies in the 20th and 21st centuries. For instance, Pope Benedict XVI led the Stations of the Cross called the Scriptural Way of the Cross (which calls for more meditation) at the Colosseum[34][35] on Good Fridays.[9]\\r\\nIn 2011 Diego Della Valle, head of the shoe firm Tod's, entered into an agreement with local officials to sponsor a ?25?million restoration of the Colosseum. Work was planned to begin at the end of 2011, taking up to two and a half years.[36] Due to the controversial nature of using a publicÿprivate partnership to fund the restoration, work was delayed and began in 2013. The restoration is the first full cleaning and repair in the Colosseum's history.[37] The first stage is to clean and restore the Colosseum's arcaded fa?ade and replace the metal enclosures that block the ground-level arches. Taking three years, the final product of this work was unveiled July 1, 2016, when the Italian minister of culture, Dario Franceschini, also announced that the funds have been committed to replace the floors by the end of 2018. These will provide a stage that Franceschini says will be used for \\"cultural events of the highest level.\\"[38] The project also plans to create a services center and to restore the galleries and underground spaces inside the Colosseum.[39]. New to tours of the restored marvel beginning November 1, 2017, the top two levels have been opened for guided visits. The fourth level held the marketplace, and the top fifth tier is where the poorest citizens, the plebians, gathered and watched the show, bringing picnics for the day-long event.

Martinelli's book evidently had an effect on public opinion; in response to Cardinal Altieri's proposal some years later to turn the Colosseum into a bullring, Carlo Tomassi published a pamphlet in protest against what he regarded as an act of desecration. The ensuing controversy persuaded Pope Clement X to close the Colosseum's external arcades and declare it a sanctuary.[57]\\r\\nAt the insistence of St. Leonard of Port Maurice, Pope Benedict XIV (1740ÿ1758) forbade the quarrying of the Colosseum and erected Stations of the Cross around the arena, which remained until February 1874.[58] Benedict Joseph Labre spent the later years of his life within the walls of the Colosseum, living on alms, before he died in 1783.[58] Several 19th century popes funded repair and restoration work on the Colosseum, and it still retains its Christian connection today. A Christian cross stands in the Colosseum, with a plaque, stating:\\r\\nThe amphitheater, one consecrated to triumphs, entertainments, and the impious worship of pagan gods, is now dedicated to the sufferings of the martyrs purified from impious superstitions.[48]\\r\\nOther Christian crosses stand in several points around the arena and every Good Friday the Pope leads a Via Crucis procession to the amphitheater.\\r\\nThe Colosseum has a wide and well-documented history of flora ever since Domenico Panaroli made the first catalogue of its plants in 1643. Since then, 684 species have been identified there. The peak was in 1855 (420 species). Attempts were made in 1871 to eradicate the vegetation, because of concerns over the damage that was being caused to the masonry, but much of it has returned.[15] 242 species have been counted today and of the species first identified by Panaroli, 200 remain.\\r\\nThe variation of plants can be explained by the change of climate in Rome through the centuries. Additionally, bird migration, flower blooming, and the growth of Rome that caused the Colosseum to become embedded within the modern city centre rather than on the outskirts of the ancient city, as well as deliberate transport of species, are also contributing causes. Another reason often given is their seeds being unwittingly transported either on the fur or in the feces of animals brought there from all corners of the empire.[59]\\r\\nCoordinates: 415324.61N 122932.17E? / ?41.8901694N 12.4922694E? / 41.8901694; 12.4922694","input":"When was the first coliseum built in rome?"},{"output":"18 years or older","context":"In the United States, there is no federal law regulating the practice of tattooing.

Legally, it often includes any alcoholic beverage with 5% or more alcohol by volume made with malted barley. In common usage, it refers to beers containing a high alcohol content, generally above 6%, which are made with ingredients and processes resembling those for American-style lagers.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMalt liquor is a strong lager or ale in which sugar, corn or other adjuncts are added to the malted barley to boost the total amount of fermentable sugars in the wort, and thus boost the final alcohol concentration without creating a heavier or sweeter taste. These beers tend to be mildly hopped; that is, they are not very bitter.\\r\\nMalt liquor is typically straw to pale amber in color. While typical beer is made primarily from barley, water, and hops, malt liquors tend to make much greater use of inexpensive adjuncts such as corn, rice, or dextrose. Use of these adjuncts, along with the addition of special enzymes, results in a higher percentage of alcohol than an average beer. Higher alcohol versions, sometimes called \\"high-gravity\\" or just \\"HG\\", may contain high levels of fusel alcohols, which gives off solvent- or fuel-like aromas and flavors.[1]\\r\\nThe confusing and inconsistent use of the term \\"malt liquor\\" has to do with the vagaries of American alcoholic beverage regulations, which can vary from state to state. In some states, \\"malt liquor\\" refers to any alcoholic beverage made by fermenting grain and water; in these states a non-alcoholic beer may also be called a non-alcoholic or non-intoxicating malt liquor. In some states, products labeled \\"beer\\" must fall below a certain alcohol content, and beers that exceed the mark must be labeled as \\"malt liquor\\". While ordinary beers in the United States average around 5% alcohol by volume, malt liquors typically range from 6% up to 9% alcohol by volume. A typical legal definition is Colorado's Rev. Stat. ss. 12-47-103(19), which provides that:\\r\\n\\"Malt Liquors\\" includes beer and shall be construed to mean any beverage obtained by the alcoholic fermentation of any infusion or decoction of barley, malt, hops or any other similar products, or any combination thereof, in water containing more than three and two-tenths percent of alcohol by weight.\\r\\nAlcohol percentages measured by weight translate into larger figures when re-expressed as alcohol percentages by volume, because ethanol is less dense than water.\\r\\nThe term \\"malt liquor\\" is documented in England in 1690 as a general term encompassing both beer and ale.[2] The first mention of the term in North America appears in a patent issued by the Canadian government on July 6, 1842, to one G. Riley for \\"an improved method of brewing ale, beer, porter, and other maltliquors.\\"\\r\\nWhile Colt 45, St. Ides, Mickey's, Steel Reserve, King Cobra, and Olde English 800 are most closely associated with malt liquors in the United States, the beverage itself is older than these products. Clix is often credited as the first malt liquor made in the United States, granted a patent in 1948.[3] The first widely successful malt liquor brand in America was Country Club, which was produced in the early 1950s by the M. K. Goetz Brewing Company in St. Joseph, Missouri.\\r\\nThe core market for malt liquor brewers in the United States has been the African-American and Hispanic populations.[4] Brewers' use of target marketing in advertising malt liquor primarily to young, inner-city, African-American males has been controversial, due to the drink's higher alcohol content and the perceived vulnerability of the target audience. Brewers and advertisers have stated that they simply advertise to those who already buy their products. Critics have objected to the targeting of a segment of the population suffering disproportionately from alcohol-related disease and poor access to medical care.[5]\\r\\nIn order to highlight the potency of malt liquor, brand names have stressed powerful imagery such as Colt 45, Big Bear, and Power Master,[6] and used slogans such as \\"It's got more\\" or \\"The Real Power\\".[7] Power and sexual dominance have been common themes in advertising.[6][8] Ads for Power Master were eventually banned in the United States due to regulations against advertising the strength of alcoholic beverages.[4][9][10]\\r\\nThe National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) has reported that African Americans suffer disproportionate rates of cirrhosis of the liver and other alcohol-related health problems. In light of such statistics, African-American community leaders and some health officials have concluded that targeting high-alcohol beverage ads at this segment of the population is unethical and socially irresponsible.[5][10] In 1991, U.S. Surgeon General Antonia Novello criticized all alcoholic beverage companies for \\"unabashedly targeting teenagers\\" with \\"sexual imagery, cartoons, and rock and rap music\\" in television and print ads.[5]\\r\\nIn the American vernacular, a forty-ounce or simply forty is a glass or plastic bottle that holds 40 fluid ounces (1.18 litres, or 2.5 U.S. pints) of malt liquor.[1] Malt liquors are commonly sold in 40 fluid ounce bottles, among other sizes, as opposed to the standard twelve ounce (355 mL) bottle that contains a single serving of beer, although many malt liquors are offered in varying volumes.\\r\\nAfter the introduction of 40-ounce containers, which contain roughly the same amount of alcohol as five regular cocktails, \\"40s\\" became a favorite high of many youth in inner-city areas. When American suburban youth adopted the habit of drinking malt liquor, drug counselors began to refer to \\"40s\\" as \\"liquid crack\\" and \\"date-rape brew\\".[7]\\r\\nExamples of malt liquors sold in forty ounce bottles include Olde English 800, Colt 45, Mickey's, Camo 40, Black Fist, Country Club, Black Bull, Labatt Blue Dry 6.1/7.1/8.1/9.1/10.1, WildCat, Molson Dry 6.5/7.5/8.5/10.1, Private Stock, Big Bear, St. Ides, Steel Reserve 211, B40 Bull Max, King Cobra, Jeremiah Weed, and Hurricane. Dogfish Head Brewery has sporadically produced a high-end bottle-conditioned forty called \\"Liquor de Malt\\".[11] Ballantine markets its ale in a forty-ounce bottle as well.\\r\\nForties are often mentioned in hip-hop and rap culture by rap stars endorsing the \\"40\\" Ounce tradition. A similar trend was common around the late 1990s' and early 2000s' punk scene, with such songs as \\"40.oz Casualty\\" by The Casualties and \\"Rock the 40. Oz.\\" by Left?ver Crack; and \\"40oz. to Freedom\\" by Sublime.\\r\\nAt least for a brief period in the mid-1990s, some brands of malt liquor, including Olde English 800, Colt 45, and Mickey's, were available in even larger, 64-ounce glass bottles. Forty-ounce bottles are not permitted in some US states, such as Florida, where the largest container that a malt beverage may be sold at retail is 32 US fluid ounces.[12]\\r\\nWhile American malt liquor brands are rarely, if ever, exported to Europe, similar inexpensive high-alcohol beers are available in many areas there; these include the \\"super-strength lagers\\" such as Tennent's Super and Carlsberg Special Brew in the United Kingdom, and in France the \\"bires fortes\\" Amsterdam Navigator, Amsterdam Maximator and Bavaria 8.6; Arboga 10.2% of Sweden or Olvi Tuplapukki and Karhu Tosi Vahva in Finland.\\r\\nAnother example of an imported beer labeled as \\"malt liquor\\" is German brewer Spaten's Optimator, a doppelbock that weighs in at 7.6 ABV.\\r\\nThere was a short lived fashion for brewing American style malt liquors in Britain in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Some of these were genuine American brands brewed under license, notably Colt 45, and some were simply inspired by the style. They generally contained 5% ABV. These beers were heavily marketed for a few years but failed to make a lasting impact and are no longer produced.","input":"How much is a 40 ounce of beer?"},{"output":"Twelve","context":"According to the Hebrew Bible, the Twelve Tribes of Israel or Tribes of Israel (Hebrew: ???? ??????) were said to have descended from the 12 sons of the patriarch Jacob (who was later named Israel) by two wives, Leah and Rachel, and two concubines, Zilpah and Bilhah.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nDeuteronomy 33:6ÿ25 and Judges 5:14ÿ18 present parallel listings of the twelve tribes:\\r\\nJacob elevated the descendants of Ephraim and Manasseh (the two sons of Joseph and his Egyptian wife Asenath)[1] to the status of full tribes in their own right, replacing the tribe of Joseph.[2]\\r\\nIn the Bible's version of events, the period from the conquest of Canaan under the leadership of Joshua until the formation of the first Kingdom of Israel, passed with the tribes forming a loose confederation, described in the Book of Judges.

It is the sixth main entry in the Marvel vs. Capcom series of crossover games. Like previous installments, players control characters from both the Marvel Comics and Capcom universes to compete in tag team battles. Infinite features two-on-two fights, as opposed to the three-on-three format used in its preceding titles. The series' traditional character assists have been removed; instead, the game incorporates a tag-based combo system, which allows players to instantly switch between their two characters to form continuous combos. It also introduces a new gameplay mechanic in the form of the Infinity Stones, which temporarily bestow players with unique abilities and stat boosts depending on the type of stone selected.\\r\\nInfinite was announced during Sony's PlayStation Experience event in December 2016. Capcom initially lost the use of the Marvel license in 2012, after The Walt Disney Company decided to focus on self-publishing its own gaming titles; however, Capcom was able to reacquire the license after Disney dissolved its console publishing division. Infinite was designed to be more accessible than previous Marvel vs. Capcom games, resulting in several changes to the series' fundamental mechanics. The game also features a larger emphasis on storytelling, with the series' first cinematic story mode. The plot follows the heroes of the Marvel and Capcom universes, who must work together to save their merged worlds against a new threat, Ultron Sigma.\\r\\nInfinite was released in September 2017 for PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Microsoft Windows. The game received mixed reviews; critics praised its new gameplay elements, but criticized its presentation, particularly its art direction, and initial character roster. Capcom originally expected the game to sell two million units; however, it missed its sales target, selling approximately one million copies by the end of December 2017.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLike its predecessors, Marvel vs. Capcom: Infinite is a 2D fighting game in which players compete against each other in tag team combat using characters from both the Marvel Comics and Capcom universes.[1] Players must knock out the opposing team by repeatedly attacking the opponent and draining their health bar.[2] Infinite features two-on-two partner battles, similar to Marvel vs. Capcom: Clash of Super Heroes and earlier installments in the franchise.[3][4] Unlike past entries, the game does not allow players to use traditional call-in assist attacks from off-screen characters; instead, Infinite utilizes a \\"free-form\\" tag system, known as \\"Active Switch\\", which shares similarities with Marvel vs. Capcom 3's \\"Team Aerial Combo\\" system and Street Fighter X Tekken's \\"Switch Cancel\\" system.[4][5][6] Players can immediately switch between their team members at any point, even while mid-air or during attack animations.[4][5][7] This provides players with the abilities to create their own offensive or defensive assists through the tag system and form continuous combos between their two characters.[6][8]\\r\\nAs with previous Marvel vs. Capcom titles, players will charge their \\"Hyper Combo Gauge\\" as their characters deal or receive damage during the fight.[9][10] Players can then expend the accrued meter from their Hyper Combo Gauge to perform \\"Hyper Combos\\", cinematic attacks which deal larger amounts of damage to the opponent.[9][11] Alternatively, players can sacrifice meter from their Hyper Combo Gauge to perform the newly introduced \\"Counter Switch\\" mechanic, which tags in their partner character while the opponent is attacking them.[1][12] This provides players with the opportunity to counterattack and free the character trapped in the enemy's combo.[1][12] The Hyper Combo Gauge in Infinite is limited to four bars of meter, as opposed to the five-bar maximum used in Marvel vs. Capcom 2 and 3.[9][10]\\r\\nInfinite moves away from the button layout previously used in Marvel vs. Capcom 3, and instead employs a control scheme more similar to Marvel vs. Capcom 2, which includes four attack buttons, consisting of two pairs of light and heavy punches and kicks, and two additional buttons used for swapping characters and activating Infinity Stone powers.[13] To improve accessibility, the game includes an \\"auto-combo\\" system which allows players to repeatedly press the light punch button to automatically perform both ground and air combos.[12] In addition, certain Hyper Combos can now be activated by simply pressing the two heavy attack buttons, as opposed to the specific joystick and button combinations required in previous titles.[14]\\r\\nInfinite also implements the Infinity Stones as a gameplay mechanic, similar to Marvel Super Heroes, where each stone grants unique abilities.[4] Before the match begins, players select one of the six Infinity Stones.[12] Each Infinity Stone bestows one ability that can be activated at any time, known as the \\"Infinity Surge\\".[5][12] For example, the Power Stone produces a knockback effect when used, while the Space Stone pulls an opponent closer to the player character.[1] A second, stronger ability called the \\"Infinity Storm\\" can be activated after players fill their Infinity meter at least halfway, giving them a significant boost for a limited time, similar to the X-Factor system from Marvel vs. Capcom 3.[1] The boost is determined by the chosen Infinity Stone; for example, the Power Stone increases the user's damage output and combo ability, while the Space Stone traps an opponent within a confined area that severely limits their movement.[1][5]\\r\\nThe game offers various offline and online single-player and multiplayer game modes.[15] The offline features include Story Mode, a two-hour cinematic story campaign; Arcade Mode, a classic arcade game experience where players fight against several AI-controlled opponents before confronting the final boss characters Ultron Sigma and Ultron Omega; Mission Mode, where players can complete tutorial missions and character-specific challenges; Training Mode, where players can practice their fighting abilities and adjust various training field parameters; Versus Player 2, where two players can battle against each other locally; Versus CPU, where players can battle solo against an AI-controlled opponent; and Collection Mode, where extras unlocked through gameplay are stored, including story cutscenes, character and stage information, concept artwork, and audio tracks.[15][16] Online multiplayer includes ranked and casual matches, global leaderboards, replays, and eight-player lobbies with spectating.[3][15] The online mode also introduces the Beginners League, a special league designated for low-ranking players to compete for graduation into higher ranks.[15][17]\\r\\nMarvel vs. Capcom: Infinite features a base roster of 30 playable characters, consisting of both new and returning heroes and villains in the Marvel vs. Capcom series.[18][19] Additional characters will also be released post-launch as downloadable content (DLC).[20]\\r\\nNew characters to the franchise are listed below in bold.\\r\\n^?: Available as downloadable content.\\r\\nDeath is visited by Jedah Dohma, who proposes an alliance to achieve equilibrium between life and death on both their worlds. Needing the six Infinity Stones to do so, Death deceives Thanos and Ultron into aiding her, granting Thanos the Space Stone and sending Ultron to retrieve the Reality Stone from Abel City. Sigma intercepts Ultron, and the two forge an alliance. They betray the others and use the Space and Reality Stones to merge the two dimensions and fuse themselves into a single being named \\"Ultron Sigma\\". To wipe out biological life, they begin unleashing an evolved form of the Sigma Virus that turns organic creatures into synthetic beings under their control. An alliance of heroes from both worlds is then formed. They rescue Thanos from Ultron Sigma's imprisonment and secure him in a containment field at Avengers Tower. To gain their trust, Thanos reveals the locations of the remaining four Infinity Stones, and teams of heroes are dispatched to find them.\\r\\nRyu, Chun-Li, Captain America, and Hulk travel to Valkanda to obtain the Time Stone. Despite Captain America's warnings, Black Panther, the ruler of Valkanda, refuses to surrender it. Ultron Sigma's drones arrive and spread the virus, infecting a Dah'ren Mohran. After Ryu and Hulk defeat the creature, Panther agrees to give them the Stone. Next, Dante, Morrigan, Ghost Rider, Arthur, and Doctor Strange travel to the Dark Kingdom, where they encounter Jedah, who is using the Soul Stone to feed souls to a Symbiote creature, hoping to use it against Ultron Sigma. While the heroes battle Dormammu and Firebrand, Jedah escapes with the Stone. Meanwhile, Iron Man sends Spider-Man to assist Chris Redfield in infiltrating an A.I.M.brella facility. There, they find Frank West and Mike Haggar, and discover M.O.D.O.K. turning people into bio-organic weapons, infused with Symbiotes at Jedah's demand. The heroes defeat M.O.D.O.K.'s enforcer, Nemesis, and retrieve the Mind Stone. However, they are soon attacked by Jedah and his giant Symbiote. On Knowmoon, Captain Marvel, Rocket Raccoon, Gamora, Nova, Strider Hiryu, and X defeat Ultron Sigma's ally, Grandmaster Meio, and rescue Zero from his control. Upon taking the Power Stone, the station ejects its core, which falls towards New Metro City carrying a massive Sigma Virus payload.\\r\\nWhile Doctor Light, Iron Man, Nathan Spencer, and Hawkeye build a weapon to harness the Infinity Stones, Ultron Sigma attacks Avengers Tower. In the chaos, Thanos is released and attacks Ultron Sigma, cracking the Reality Stone and forcing them to retreat. The heroes use their Stones to destroy the Symbiote and the falling core, but are infected in the process. The infected heroes then head for Xgard to infiltrate Sigmas laboratory to finish their weapon, the Infinity Buster. When Thanos learns of Death and Jedahs partnership, he becomes enraged and betrays the heroes, creating a mechanized gauntlet that absorbs Ryus Satsui no Had before departing for revenge. After reclaiming the Soul Stone from Jedah, Dante arrives in Xgard and pretends to surrender the Stone. Since they have no souls, Ultron Sigma is overwhelmed by the Stone and transforms into Ultron Omega. The Infinity Buster is installed into X, who uses it to destroy Ultron Omega.\\r\\nIn the aftermath, the virus is neutralized, but since the Reality Stone was cracked, the universes cannot be separated again. The heroes agree to protect the new world and split the Infinity Stones between them to keep them safe. In a post-credits scene, Jedah tells Death that he has another plan, but Thanos arrives seeking vengeance against them. Believing the Satsui no Had is capable of killing immortals like Death and Jedah, he prepares to attack them with a Gohadouken.\\r\\nFollowing the release of Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3 for the PlayStation Vita in 2012, Marvel's new parent company, The Walt Disney Company, which acquired Marvel in 2009, chose not to renew their licensing deal with Capcom, instead opting to move its viable properties towards their self-published game titles, such as the Disney Infinity series; this resulted in Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3, Marvel vs. Capcom 2: New Age of Heroes and Marvel vs. Capcom Origins being removed from the Xbox Live Arcade and PlayStation Network in 2013.[22][23]\\r\\nHowever, in May 2016, Disney announced its decision to discontinue self-publishing efforts and switch over to a licensing-only model, allowing third-party game developers, including Capcom, to negotiate licenses with Marvel once again.[24][25] On December 3, 2016, Marvel vs. Capcom: Infinite was officially unveiled during Sony's PlayStation Experience event; its first gameplay footage debuted on the same day following the conclusion of Capcom Cup 2016.[26][27] Norio Hirose, a programmer who had previously worked on X-Men vs. Street Fighter, Marvel Super Heroes vs. Street Fighter, and Marvel vs. Capcom: Clash of Super Heroes, as well as other Capcom fighting games, such as Project Justice and Capcom vs. SNK: Millennium Fight 2000, served as Infinite's director.[28][29]\\r\\nGame development involved Capcom Japan, Capcom USA, and Marvel Games.[30] According to Mike Jones, Executive Producer at Marvel Games, Infinite was designed to be a \\"more elegant and simplified\\" game which remained as \\"complex and hardcore\\" as past Marvel vs. Capcom installments.[31][32] While the developers sought to keep the core elements of the series intact, such as air combos, they also wanted Infinite to push away from its predecessors, resulting in several changes to the series' traditional formula.[12] The decision to change the three-on-three battle system used in Marvel vs. Capcom 2 and 3 was considered for a long time before ultimately settling on two-on-two fights for the sake of accessibility.[5] Producer Mike Evans hoped that introducing a more manageable two-character system would give casual Marvel vs. Capcom fans the ability to play the game without becoming overwhelmed.[12][5]\\r\\nTo offset the streamlined character select system and removal of call-in assist attacks, the six Infinity Stones were implemented to provide teams with additional customization options and increase gameplay depth.[5][31] Marvel and Capcom compared the Infinity Stones to the \\"Groove System\\" used in Capcom vs. SNK 2.[5] The primary goal with the Infinity Stones was to create a level playing field by acting as a comeback enabler, and allowing players to compensate for their characters' deficiencies and enhance their strong points.[5] According to developers, the inclusion of the Infinity Stones and the theme of \\"infinite [gameplay] possibilities\\" influenced their decision to use Marvel vs. Capcom: Infinite as the game's title, rather than Marvel vs. Capcom 4.[33] To further differentiate Infinite, the developers opted to use the Unreal Engine 4 to develop more cinematic and modern visuals, as opposed to the stylized art direction used in Marvel vs. Capcom 3.[12]\\r\\nAccording to Producer Evans and Associate Producer Peter Rosas, the development team examined the strengths and weaknesses of each returning character and adjusted them by providing new moves and abilities, hoping to make every fighter viable.[13][34] In terms of roster selection, characters were chosen based on two aspects: their potential interactions within the story and their gameplay style.[34] The developers sought to include a variety of different character archetypes, from small, nimble characters, such as Strider Hiryu, to large, brawler-type characters, such as the Hulk.[34] The Marvel characters' designs were proposed by Capcom's research and development team in Japan, who took inspiration from both the characters' comic book and film appearances.[35] Marvel staff members worked closely with the team, providing feedback to maintain the authenticity of their characters' portrayals.[34] While speaking at E3 2017, Evans explained how they picked the roster based on which characters Marvel was currently pushing or planning to push in the future.[36][37]\\r\\nBeyond appealing to genre and series fans, Capcom sought to target a diverse audience with Infinite and bring in casual players who were fans of Marvel's movies, comic books, and television shows.[38] To this end, the developers wanted to introduce a more robust, cinematic story compared to previous Marvel vs. Capcom titles.[38] Bill Rosemann, Creative Director at Marvel Games, stated that Infinite's increased emphasis on storytelling was influenced by Marvel's story and character-centric approach to their recent projects in games, film, and television; Rosemann and Jones cited Insomniac Games' Spider-Man video game, Telltale Games' Guardians of the Galaxy title, and Marvel's successful Netflix series as examples.[5][32] While speaking at the 2017 D.I.C.E. Summit, Rosemann also explained that Marvel Games would not force its development partners to tie their games into existing storylines throughout Marvel's universes, giving them more freedom to craft their own original stories and create new visions for their characters.[39] Infinite's story mode script was penned by writer Paul Gardner, with oversight from Rosemann and Marvel's gaming division.[36] Gardner first became involved with the project beginning in 2015 and finished writing the script in 2016.[40] Marvel provided feedback to Capcom on the revisions, animations, music, and presentation of the overall story mode experience.[41] Frank Tieri, the lead writer for Marvel vs. Capcom 3, has also confirmed his involvement with Infinite.[4]\\r\\nAccording to developers, Capcom's struggle with the launch of Street Fighter V influenced several decisions during Infinite's development.[34] The heavy criticism towards Street Fighter V's lack of content prompted Capcom to promise a larger variety of single-player and multiplayer content for Infinite upon release.[31][38] As a result of Street Fighter V's initial online multiplayer server issues, the developers plan to forgo their own servers in favor of dedicated servers by Sony and Microsoft, aiming to provide more stable online play for Infinite.[1] The game does not feature cross-platform play, with Evans citing Capcom's trouble with implementing the Capcom Fighters Network cross-platform structure into Street Fighter V.[34][42] Infinite also does not include any currency systems similar to Street Fighter V's \\"Fight Money\\".[34]\\r\\nMarvel vs. Capcom: Infinite was released for the PlayStation 4, Xbox One and Microsoft Windows, on September 19, 2017, in North America and Europe, and September 21, 2017, in Japan.[43][44][45] The game was available in three editions: a standard edition, a Deluxe Edition, and a Collector's Edition.[46] Pre-orders for the standard edition include the Evil Ryu and Warrior Thor alternate in-game costumes.[46] Pre-orders for the Deluxe Edition include the Evil Ryu, Warrior Thor, Gladiator Hulk and Command Mission X alternate costumes, in addition to the \\"2017 Character Pass\\".[46] The Collector's Edition, which includes the Deluxe Edition and its pre-order incentives, features four character dioramas of Iron Man, Captain Marvel, Mega Man X and Chun-Li by TriForce, and a case filled with six LED-powered Infinity Stone replicas.[46] The Major Carol Danvers alternate costume was also packaged exclusively with the PlayStation 4 version.[47] A story mode demo was released on June 12, 2017, following Sony's press conference at the Electronic Entertainment Expo.[48] On February 27, 2018, Infinite was listed on the Microsoft Store as an Xbox Play Anywhere title.[49]\\r\\nTo coincide with the game's release, Capcom announced their first global tournament series for Infinite called Battle for the Stones.[50] In addition to extending special invitations to the Evolution Championship Series' seven Marvel vs. Capcom 3 champions, Capcom selected six community events to act as \\"Infinity Stone Tournaments\\".[50] The winner of each event, in addition to qualifying for the Battle for the Stones finals, received an Infinity Stone that could be used to gain a unique advantage during the competition.[51] For example, the Space Stone allowed its bearer to swap their position within the tournament bracket to face a different opponent, while the Mind Stone allowed its bearer to pick their opponent's team.[52] Fellow competitors could steal Infinity Stones by successfully defeating their current owners.[50] Capcom also held three regional online tournaments to fill out the remaining bracket spots.[50] The finals were held in Anaheim, California on December 9ÿ10, 2017, and included a US$30,000 prize pool.[50][51] The winner of the tournament was Jonathan \\"Cloud805\\" Morales, who received US$20,000 and an Infinity Gauntlet trophy.[53][54]\\r\\nThe \\"2017 Character Pass\\" includes six DLC fighters: Black Panther, Black Widow, Monster Hunter, Sigma, Venom, and Winter Soldier.[55][56] Black Panther, Monster Hunter, and Sigma were released on October 17, 2017, while Black Widow, Venom, and Winter Soldier were released on December 5, 2017.[56][57][58] Players could also obtain the Superior Spider-Man alternate costume by pre-ordering Spider-Man: Homecoming through the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One online stores before October 24, 2017.[59] On October 17, 2017, Capcom released three themed costume packs, each containing six outfits: the Avenging Army Pack (Iron Man, Hawkeye, Thor, Dante, Spencer, Arthur), the World Warriors Pack (Captain America, Captain Marvel, Hulk, Chris, Ryu, Chun-Li), and the Mystic Masters Pack (Doctor Strange, Dormammu, Ghost Rider, Morrigan, Firebrand, Nemesis).[60] The costumes can also be purchased individually or altogether with the \\"Premium Costume Pass\\".[60] The Premium Costume Pass gives players additional access to the Stone Seekers Pack (Spider-Man, Ultron, Thanos, Jedah, Frank, Haggar) and the Cosmic Crusaders Pack (Rocket Raccoon, Gamora, Nova, Strider Hiryu, X, Zero), which were released on December 5, 2017.[60][61]\\r\\nIn February 2017, Hasbro announced a Marvel vs. Capcom: Infinite toy line during their presentation at the American International Toy Fair.[62] In May 2017, Marvel announced a series of Marvel vs. Capcom-themed comic book variant covers, which became available in comic stores throughout August.[63] In September 2017, Marvel revealed a new wave of Funko Pop! collectibles, featuring the playable cast from Infinite in their premium alternate costumes.[64] The collectibles were released in November 2017.[64]\\r\\nIn pre-release coverage, Infinite's departure from some of the series' long-standing gameplay mechanics, namely three-on-three battles and character assist moves, for the sake of accessibility was met with mixed reception. Suriel Vazquez of Game Informer and Wesley Yin-Poole of Eurogamer stated that Infinite could end up being a divisive game, especially to the hardcore audience, since both mechanics had defined the Marvel vs. Capcom series for nearly two decades.[5][12] The issue was mirrored by IGN's Daniel Krupa, who mentioned that the shifts in the series' formula could lead to a feeling among fans that their game was being \\"diluted\\" for newer players.[32] Vazquez and Krupa, however, appreciated the changes, with Vazquez saying that he preferred the series \\"go for broke\\", rather than play it safe.[5][32] GamesRadar's David Houghton and Kotaku's Ian Walker gave positive remarks in their impressions of the press preview build, with both praising the development team's attempt to create an accessible environment for newcomers while also pleasing the competitive community.[1][65]\\r\\nEarly criticism was directed at Infinite's less stylized art direction. Alex Donaldson of VG247 stated that \\"the art style just feels off  or at worst, unfinished...as it stands right now the art style is a mistake when compared to Marvel vs. Capcom 3.\\"[42] Sergio Figueroa of Gamereactor and Nick Valdez of Destructoid also expressed disappointment with the visuals, particularly the in-game character models and the HUD.[14][66] Figueroa wrote that \\"the developers have chosen a simplistic and, in our opinion, insufficiently detailed character design that we think diminishes the fighters' personalities.\\"[14] The release of the story mode demo was also criticized. Polygon's David Cabrera felt the demo was a \\"squandered opportunity\\" by Capcom that \\"actively [hid] the good points of the game and [highlighted] its failings,\\" such as unpolished character models and awkward voice acting, while Game Informer's Ben Reeves thought the demo lacked entertaining moments and failed to showcase Marvel and Capcom's \\"dream matchups\\" in any meaningful or creative way.[67][68] Following complaints about the quality of certain character models, particularly on the Capcom side of the roster, the developers announced plans for a day-one patch that would focus on artistic improvements.[69][70]\\r\\nMarvel vs. Capcom: Infinite was released to mixed or average reviews, according to Metacritic, which provided aggregated scores of 77, 72, and 69 for the Xbox One, PlayStation 4, and Microsoft Windows versions, respectively.[71][72][73]\\r\\nThe game received praise for its gameplay, including its changes to the series' traditional tag team system and the addition of the Infinity Stones.[75][76][78][79] GameSpot's Tamoor Hussain complimented the developers for simplifying tagging without sacrificing gameplay depth.[76] He appreciated the game's more open-ended fighting systems, comparing Infinite to \\"a blank canvas\\" and its mechanics \\"as the brushes for painting your unique superhero squad.\\"[76] Polygon's Chelsea Stark and Jeff Ramos also praised the revised core mechanics, saying that the new tag system opened more options for clever combo creation.[79] Similarly, IGN's Darry Huskey was impressed by the game's willingness to \\"completely [upend] traditions fans have known since X-Men vs. Street Fighter in 1996\\" by overhauling time-honored game mechanics, such as the assist system.[78] Additionally, Huskey described the decision to replace each team's third character with an Infinity Stone as the \\"crown jewel\\" of Infinite's design, claiming that it \\"works so well, it makes the very idea of a three-character team now seem like old news.\\"[78] Game Informer's Ben Reeves wrote that the streamlined fighting system and the inclusions of automatic combos and simplified super attacks would allow newcomers \\"to feel right at home.\\"[75]\\r\\nReviewers frequently criticized the game for its presentation.[74][76][77][79][81][82] Huskey labeled the character design as \\"distractingly bad and stiff\\", and found the orchestral soundtrack to be \\"forgettable and easily ignored.\\"[76] Stark and Ramos proclaimed that the aesthetics were \\"the stalest the franchise has ever seen\\", and compared the user interface to \\"placeholder graphics that were never changed for the final product.\\"[79] Destructoid's Chris Carter also loathed the visuals, describing the art style as \\"a crime against humanity.\\"[74] GamesRadar's Sam Prell felt that Infinite's presentation, in comparison to \\"the flashy cel-shaded art direction and over-the-top tone of Marvel vs. Capcom 3\\" and \\"the silky smooth sprites and technical precision of Marvel vs. Capcom 2,\\" made the game fall \\"hopelessly short...in the shadow of its own pedigree.\\"[77] Eurogamer's Wesley Yin-Poole reproached the art style, calling it a \\"desperate attempt to appeal to fans of Marvel's all-encompassing cinematic universe\\" and \\"an abomination of a look that neither appeals to movie nor comic book fans.\\"[82] GameCentral for Metro faulted the game for its \\"bland visuals\\", \\"drab menus\\", and \\"uniformly dull backdrops.\\"[81]\\r\\nInfinite was also criticized for its playable roster at launch, which was smaller than the previous installment, Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3, and recycled many of its characters.[77][80][81][82][83] VentureBeat's Mike Minotti expressed his disappointment with the game's smaller selection of fighters, especially compared to its predecessors, and the meager amount of newcomers.[80] Yin-Poole pointed out the lack of diversity in the roster, particularly the lack of playable female characters.[82] GameCentral stated that the roster \\"smacks of laziness and/or a lack of budget\\" and suspected that most of the final roster decisions were made by lawyers and marketing people.[81] The omission of characters from the X-Men and Fantastic Four franchises was also chastised by critics, who speculated that the then-ongoing legal dispute between The Walt Disney Company, Marvel Studios, and 20th Century Fox over their film rights was the main motive behind their exclusion.[78][80][82][83] Prell and Yin-Poole both lamented the lack of X-Men characters, highlighting the franchise's significance in establishing the Marvel vs. Capcom series.[77][82] The latter declared their omission as \\"a dagger in the heart of every [Marvel vs. Capcom] fan -

The list of Angels survived only as part of oral traditions that differed to one another depending on the geographical area that they were present, and thus many different lists of angels (termed \\"Archangels\\") exist, but to different levels of acceptance.\\r\\nIn all of the scriptures from Judeo-Christian traditions, only Michael is called \\"The Archangel\\" (Biblical Greek: ϫ? ? ??ۚ?) by Jude the Apostle in the epistle attributed to his authorship; And in the Book of Enoch, the Jewish traditions make him \\"one of the Archangels\\", although none of the others is referred to as by name. In most Protestant Christian traditions only Michael and Gabriel are referred to as \\"Archangels\\", whereas in the Roman Catholic and Orthodox traditions Raphael is included, resulting in a group of three.\\r\\nJewish people borrowed the names for angels from Babylonian star catalogues, a part of its folklore and cosmology, during their forced exile known as the Babylonian captivity starting in 605 BCE, first with the prophet Daniel, then later with Authors such as Ezekiel who styled the star constellations, that were held as \\"sons of the gods\\" (Sons of the Sky Father deity in Babylonia), as angels from the Lord of Israel, in fact living animals in the heaven (the abstract forms of the constellations) that were referred to as Cherubim, and with that he styled what was revered as the sons of the gods in Babylonia as servants of the Lord of Israel. The 2 BC Book of the Parables, chapter XL, echoes such folkloric representations, and gives the name of the four angels with whom the Ancient of Days comes, the ones standing before the Lord of Spirits, the voices of those upon the four sides magnifying the Lord of Glory as: Michael, Raphael, Gabriel, and Phanuel.\\r\\nFrom the Book of the Watchers chapter IX, a first list of group of angels is given, in this case, the ones who saw the quantity of blood which was shed on earth in account of the transgression of the \\"sons of the gods\\", a group of rogue celestial spirits, termed \\"the Watchers\\", that arrived to earth during the antediluvian times, and it is given as a group of five that interceded on behalf of humankind to the Most High: Michael, Gabriel, Raphael, Suryal (see Sarakiel), and Uriel. Whereas the most popular tradition was borrowed from chapter XX, in which a list of seven angels who watch is given as: Uriel, Raphael, Raguel, Michael, Sarakiel, Gabriel, and Remiel.\\r\\nThe earliest specific Christian references are in the late 5th to early 6th century: Pseudo-Dionysius gives them as Michael, Gabriel, Raphael, Uriel, Camael, Jophiel, and Zadkiel.[1] Pope Saint Gregory I lists them as Michael, Gabriel, Raphael, Uriel (or Anael), Simiel, Oriphiel, and Raguel.\\r\\nLists of characters referred to as \\"angels\\" also exist in traditions foreign to the largest religious groups, and are usually regarded as occultist or superstitious. A later reference to seven archangels appeared in an 8th or 9th-century talisman attributed to Auriolus, a \\"servant of God\\" in north-western Spain. He issues a prayer to \\"all you patriarchs Michael, Gabriel, Cecitiel, Oriel, Raphael, Ananiel, Marmoniel.[2]\\r\\nIn the Catholic Church, three archangels are mentioned by name in its canon of scripture: Michael, Gabriel, and Raphael. Raphael appears in the deuterocanonical Book of Tobit, where Raphael is described as \\"one of the seven angels who stand ready and enter before the glory of the lord of spirits\\",[3] a phrase recalled in Revelation 8:2-6.\\r\\nSome strands of the Eastern Orthodox Church, exemplified in the Orthodox Slavonic Bible (Ostrog Bible, Elizabeth Bible, and later consequently Russian Synodal Bible), recognize as authoritative also 2 Esdras, which mentions Uriel. The Eastern Orthodox Church and Eastern Catholic Churches of the Byzantine tradition, venerate seven archangels and sometimes an eighth. Michael, Gabriel, Raphael, Uriel, Selaphiel (Salathiel), Jegudiel (Jehudiel), Barachiel, and the eighth, Jerahmeel (Jeremiel) (The Synaxis of the Chief of the Heavenly Hosts, Archangel Michael and the Other Heavenly Bodiless Powers: Feast Day: November 8). [4]\\r\\nAs well as Uriel, the Book of Enoch, not regarded as canonical by any of these Christian churches, mentions (chapter 21) Raguel, Sariel, and Jerahmeel, while other apocryphal sources give instead the names Izidkiel, Hanael, and Kepharel.[5]\\r\\nIn the Coptic Orthodox tradition the seven archangels are named as Michael, Gabriel, Raphael, Suriel, Zadkiel, Sarathiel, and Aniel.[6][7][8]\\r\\nIn Anglican and Episcopal tradition, there are three or four archangels in the calendar for September 29, the feast of St Michael and All Angels (also called Michaelmas), namely Michael, Gabriel, and Raphael,[9] and often also Uriel.[10][11][12][13][14]\\r\\nAlthough in the Book of Enoch, Ramiel is described as one of the leaders of the 200 Grigori, the fallen angels, the leader is identified as Semjaza. Other names derived from pseudepigrapha and recognized by Eastern Orthodox and Oriental Orthodox churches are Selaphiel, Jegudiel, and Raguel.\\r\\nSeven angels or archangels are given as related to the seven days of the week: Michael (Sunday), Gabriel (Monday), Raphael (Tuesday), Uriel (Wednesday), Selaphiel (Thursday), Raguel or Jegudiel (Friday), and Barachiel (Saturday).[citation needed]\\r\\nVarious occult systems associate each archangel with one of the traditional \\"seven luminaries\\" (the seven naked-eye moving objects in the sky: the seven classical planets): the sun, the moon, Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn;[15] but there is disagreement as to which archangel corresponds to which body.\\r\\nAccording to Rudolf Steiner, four important archangels also display periodic spiritual activity over the seasons: Spring is Raphael, summer is Uriel, autumn is Michael, and winter is Gabriel.[16] Following this line of reasoning, Aries (astrologically ruled by Mars) represents spring, Cancer (ruled by the moon) represents summer, Libra (ruled by Venus) represents autumn, and Capricorn (ruled by Saturn) represents winter. Therefore, by association, Raphael is Mars, Uriel is the moon, Michael is Venus, and Gabriel is Saturn. Rudolf Steiner's Northern Hemisphere indications regarding the seasons and their placement in the Zodiac will be the opposite in the Southern Hemisphere, making Michael the autumn archangel?ÿ with Mars in Aries; Raphael the spring archangel?ÿ with Venus in Libra; and in mid-winter Gabriel in Cancer; Uriel presides in Capricorn during mid-summer in the south.\\r\\nThe seven archangels figure in some systems of ritual magic, each archangel bearing a specific seal.[citation needed]","input":"How many arch angels are in the bible?"},{"output":"Muhammad Iqbal","context":"\\"Sare Jahan se Accha\\" (Urdu: ???? ???? ?? ??????; Sre Jahn? se Acch), formally known as \\"Tarnah-i-Hindi\\" (Urdu: ????? ??????; \\"Anthem of the People of India\\"), is an Urdu language patriotic song written for children by poet Muhammad Iqbal in the ghazal style of Urdu poetry.[a] The poem was published in the weekly journal Ittehad on 16 August 1904.[1] Publicly recited by Iqbal the following year at Government College, Lahore, British India (now in Pakistan) it quickly became an anthem of opposition to the British Raj. The song, an ode to Hindustanthe land comprising present-day Bangladesh, India and Pakistan, was later published in 1924 in the Urdu book Bang-i-Dara.[2]\\r\\nThe song has remained popular, especially in India. An abridged version is sung and played frequently as a patriotic song and as a marching song of the Indian Armed Forces. A satirical version of the same from a 1958 Hindi movie also remains popular.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIqbal was a lecturer at the Government College, Lahore at that time, and was invited by a student Lala Har Dayal to preside over a function. Instead of delivering a speech, Iqbal sang \\"Saare Jahan Se Achcha\\". The song, in addition to embodying yearning and attachment to the land of Hindustan, expressed \\"cultural memory\\" and had an elegiac quality. In 1905, the 27-year-old Iqbal viewed the future society of the subcontinent as both a pluralistic and composite Hindu-Muslim culture. Later that year he left for Europe for a three-year sojourn that was to transform him into an Islamic philosopher and a visionary of a future Islamic society.[2]\\r\\nIn 1910, Iqbal wrote another song for children, \\"Tarana-e-Milli\\" (Anthem of the Religious Community), which was composed in the same metre and rhyme scheme as \\"Saare Jahan Se Achcha\\", but which renounced much of the sentiment of the earlier song.[4] The sixth stanza of \\"Saare Jahan Se Achcha\\" (1904), which is often quoted as proof of Iqbal's secular outlook:\\r\\nMaz?hab nahؐn? sikht pas men? bair rakhn\\r\\nHindؐ hain? ham, wat?an hai Hindstn? hamr\\r\\nReligion does not teach us to bear ill-will among ourselves\\r\\nWe are of Hind, our homeland is Hindustan.\\r\\ncontrasted significantly with the first stanza of Tarana-e-Milli (1910) reads:[4]\\r\\nCؐn o-?Arab hamr, Hindstn? hamr\\r\\nMuslim hain? ham, wat?an hai sr jahn? hamr\\r\\nCentral Asia[5] and Arabia are ours, Hindustan is ours\\r\\nWe are Muslims, the whole world is our homeland.[4]\\r\\nIqbal's world view had now changed; it had become both global and Islamic.

It comprises two island groups, the Andaman Islands and the Nicobar Islands, separated by the 10N parallel, with the Andamans to the north of this latitude, and the Nicobars to the south (or by 179?km). The Andaman Sea lies to the east and the Bay of Bengal to the west.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe territory's capital is the city of Port Blair. The total land area of these islands is approximately 8,249?km2 (3,185?sq?mi). The capital of Nicobar Islands is Car Nicobar. The islands host the Andaman and Nicobar Command, the only tri-service geographical command of the Indian Armed Forces.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Andaman Islands are home to the Sentinelese people, an uncontacted people. The Sentinelese are the only people currently known to not have reached further than a Paleolithic level of technology.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe earliest archaeological evidence documents some 2,200 years. However, genetic and cultural studies suggest that the indigenous Andamanese people may have been isolated from other populations during the Middle Paleolithic, which ended 30,000 years ago.[7] Since that time, the Andamanese have diversified into linguistically and culturally distinct, territorial groups.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Nicobar Islands appear to have been populated by people of various backgrounds. By the time of European contact, the indigenous inhabitants had coalesced into the Nicobarese people, speaking a Mon-Khmer language; and the Shompen, whose language is of uncertain affiliation. Both are unrelated to the Andamanese, but being closely related to the Austroasiatic languages in mainland Southeast Asia.\\r\\n\\r\\nRajendra Chola I (1014 to 1042 AD), used the Andaman and Nicobar Islands as a strategic naval base to launch an expedition against the Sriwijaya Empire (Indonesia). The Cholas called the island Ma-Nakkavaram (\\"great open/naked land\\"), found in the Thanjavur inscription of 1050 AD. European traveller Marco Polo (12thÿ13th century) also referred to this island as 'Necuverann' and a corrupted form of the Tamil name Nakkavaram would have led to the modern name Nicobar during the British colonial period.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe history of organised European colonisation on the islands began when settlers from the Danish East India Company arrived in the Nicobar Islands on 12 December 1755. On 1 January 1756, the Nicobar Islands were made a Danish colony, first named New Denmark,[9] and later (December 1756) Frederick's Islands (Frederiks?erne). During 1754ÿ1756 they were administrated from Tranquebar (in continental Danish India). The islands were repeatedly abandoned due to outbreaks of malaria between 14 April 1759 and 19 August 1768, from 1787 to 1807/05, 1814 to 1831, 1830 to 1834 and gradually from 1848 for good.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom 1 June 1778 to 1784, Austria mistakenly assumed that Denmark had abandoned its claims to the Nicobar Islands and attempted to establish a colony on them,[10] renaming them Theresia Islands.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1789 the British set up a naval base and penal colony on Chatham Island next to Great Andaman, where now lies the town of Port Blair. Two years later the colony was moved to Port Cornwallis on Great Andaman, but it was abandoned in 1796 due to disease.\\r\\n\\r\\nDenmark's presence in the territory ended formally on 16 October 1868 when it sold the rights to the Nicobar Islands to Britain,[10] which made them part of British India in 1869.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1858 the British again established a colony at Port Blair, which proved to be more permanent. The primary purpose was to set up a penal colony for criminal convicts from the Indian subcontinent. The colony came to include the infamous Cellular Jail.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1872 the Andaman and Nicobar islands were united under a single chief commissioner at Port Blair.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring World War II, the islands were practically under Japanese control, only nominally under the authority of the Arzi Hukumate Azad Hind of Subhash Chandra Bose. Bose visited the islands during the war, and renamed them as \\"Shaheed-dweep\\" (Martyr Island) and \\"Swaraj-dweep\\" (Self-rule Island).\\r\\n\\r\\nGeneral Loganathan, of the Indian National Army was made the Governor of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands. On 22 February 1944 he along with four INA officersMajor Mansoor Ali Alvi, Sub. Lt. Md. Iqbal, Lt. Suba Singh and stenographer Srinivasanarrived at Lambaline Airport in Port Blair. On 21 March 1944 the Headquarters of the Civil Administration was established near the Gurudwara at Aberdeen Bazaar. On 2 October 1944, Col. Loganathan handed over the charge to Maj. Alvi and left Port Blair, never to return.[11] The islands were reoccupied by British and Indian troops of the 116th Indian Infantry Brigade on 7 October 1945, to whom the remaining Japanese garrison surrendered.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the independence of both India (1947) and Burma (1948), the departing British announced their intention to resettle all Anglo-Indians and Anglo-Burmese on these islands to form their own nation, although this never materialised. It became part of India in 1950 and was declared as a union territory of the nation in 1956.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nIndia has been developing defence facilities on the islands since the 1980s. The islands now have a key position in India's strategic role in the Bay of Bengal and the Malacca Strait.[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 26 December 2004 the coasts of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands were devastated by a 10?m (33?ft) high tsunami following the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake. More than 2,000 people lost their lives, more than 4,000 children were orphaned or suffered the loss of one parent, and a minimum of 40,000 people were rendered homeless. More than 46,000 people were injured.[14] The worst affected Nicobar islands were Katchal and Indira Point; the latter subsided 4.25 metres (13.9 feet) and was partially submerged in the ocean. The lighthouse at Indira Point was damaged but has been repaired since then.\\r\\nThe territory lost a large amount of area which is now submerged. The territory which was at 8,073?km2 (3,117?sq?mi) is now at 7,950?km2 (3,070?sq?mi).[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile locals and tourist of the islands suffered the greatest casualties from the tsunami, most of the aboriginal people survived because oral traditions passed down from generations ago warned them to evacuate from large waves that follow large earthquakes.[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are 572 islands [17] in the territory having an area of 8,249?km2 (3,185?sq?mi). Of these, about 38 are permanently inhabited. The islands extend from 6 to 14 North latitudes and from 92 to 94 East longitudes. The Andamans are separated from the Nicobar group by a channel (the Ten Degree Channel) some 150?km (93?mi) wide. The highest point is located in North Andaman Island (Saddle Peak at 732?m (2,402?ft)). The Andaman group has 325 islands which cover an area of 6,170?km2 (2,382?sq?mi) while the Nicobar group has only 247 islands with an area of 1,765?km2 (681?sq?mi).[12]:33\\r\\n\\r\\nThe capital of the union territory, Port Blair, is located 1,255?km (780?mi) from Kolkata, 1,200?km (750?mi) from Visakhapatnam and 1,190?km (740?mi) from Chennai.[12]:33 The northernmost point of the Andaman and Nicobars group is 901?km (560?mi) away from the mouth of the Hooghly River and 190?km (120?mi) from Myanmar. Indira Point at 64510N and 934936E at the southern tip of the southernmost island, Great Nicobar, is the southernmost point of India and lies only 150?km (93?mi) from Sumatra in Indonesia. The only volcano in India, Barren Island, is located in Andaman and Nicobar. It is an active volcano and erupted in 2017.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Andaman and Nicobar Islands have a tropical rainforest canopy, made of a mixed flora with elements from Indian, Myanmar, Malaysian and endemic floral strains. So far, about 2,200 varieties of plants have been recorded, out of which 200 are endemic and 1,300 do not occur in mainland India.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe South Andaman forests have a profuse growth of epiphytic vegetation, mostly ferns and orchids. The Middle Andamans harbours mostly moist deciduous forests. North Andamans is characterised by the wet evergreen type, with plenty of woody climbers. The North Nicobar Islands (including Car Nicobar and Battimalv) are marked by the complete absence of evergreen forests, while such forests form the dominant vegetation in the central and southern islands of the Nicobar group. Grasslands occur only in the Nicobars, and while deciduous forests are common in the Andamans, they are almost absent in the Nicobars. The present forest coverage is claimed to be 86.2% of the total land area.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis atypical forest coverage is made up of twelve types, namely:\\r\\n\\r\\nThis tropical rain forest, despite its isolation from adjacent land masses, is surprisingly rich with a diversity of animal life.\\r\\n\\r\\nAbout 50 varieties of forest mammals are found to occur in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands. Some are endemic, including the Andaman wild boar. Rodents are the largest group with 26 species, followed by 14 species of bat. Among the larger mammals there are two endemic[citation needed] varieties of wild boar, Sus scrofa andamanensis from Andaman and Sus scrofa nicobaricus from Nicobar, which are protected by the Wildlife Protection Act 1972 (Sch I). Saltwater crocodile is also found in abundance. The State Animal of Andaman is the dugong, also known as the sea cow, which can be found in Little Andaman. Around 1962 there was an attempt to introduce the leopard, which was unsuccessful because of unsuitable habitat. These were ill-considered moves as exotic introductions can cause havoc to island flora and fauna.\\r\\n\\r\\nAbout 270 species of birds are found in the territory; 14 of them are endemic, the majority to the Nicobar island group. The islands' many caves are nesting grounds for the edible-nest swiftlet, whose nests are prized in China for bird's nest soup.[18]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe territory is home to about 225 species of butterflies and moths. Ten species are endemic to these Islands. Mount Harriet National Park is one of the richest areas of butterfly and moth diversity on these islands.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe islands are well known for prized shellfish, especially from the genera Turbo, Trochus, Murex and Nautilus. Earliest recorded commercial exploitation began during 1929. Many cottage industries produce a range of decorative shell items. Giant clams, green mussels and oysters support edible shellfishery. The shells of scallops, clams, and cockle are burnt in kilns to produce edible lime.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are 96 wildlife sanctuaries, nine national parks and one biosphere reserve in these islands.[19]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs of  2011[update] Census of India, the population of the Union Territory of Andaman and Nicobar Islands was 379,944, of which 202,330 (53.25%) were male and 177,614 (46.75%) were female. The sex ratio was 878 females per 1,000 males.[21] Only 10% of the population lived in Nicobar islands.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe areas and populations (at the 2001 and 2011 Censuses) of the three districts[22] are:\\r\\n\\r\\nThere remain approximately 400ÿ450 indigenous Andamanese in the Andaman islands, the Jarawa and Sentinelese in particular maintaining a steadfast independence and refusing most attempts at contact. In the Nicobar Islands, the indigenous people are the Nicobarese, or Nicobari, living throughout many of the islands, and the Shompen, restricted to the hinterland of Great Nicobar. More than 2,000 people belonging to the Karen tribe live in the Mayabunder tehsil of North Andaman district, almost all of whom are Christians. Despite their tribal origins, the Karen of Andamans have Other Backward Class (OBC) status in the Andamans.\\r\\n\\r\\nLanguages of Andaman and Nicobar Islands 2011\\r\\n\\r\\nBengali is the most spoken language in Andaman and Nicobar Islands. [3] Hindi is official language of Andaman and Nicobar Islands, while English is declared an additional official language for communication purposes.[6]  As of 2011 census, Bengali is spoken as the first language by 28.49 percent of the Union Territory's population followed by Hindi (19.29%), Tamil (15.20%), Telugu (13.24%), Nicobarese (7.65) and Malayalam (7.22%).[23]\\r\\n\\r\\nReligion in Andaman and Nicobar (2011)[24]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe majority of people of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands are Hindus (69.44%), with Christians forming a large minority of 21.7% of the population, according to the 2011 census of India. There is a small but significant Muslim (8.51%) minority.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1874, the British had placed the Andaman and Nicobar Islands in one administrative territory headed by a Chief Commissioner as its judicial administrator. On 1 August 1974, the Nicobar islands were hived off into another revenue district with district headquarters at Car Nicobar under a Deputy Commissioner. In 1982, the post of Lieutenant Governor was created who replaced the Chief Commissioner as the head of administration. Subsequently, a \\"Pradesh council\\" with Councillors as representatives of the people was constituted to advise the Lieutenant Governor.[12] The Islands sends one representative to Lok Sabha from its Andaman and Nicobar Islands (Lok Sabha constituency).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Andaman and Nicobar Islands is divided into three districts. Each district is further divided into sub-divisions and taluks:\\r\\n\\r\\nNorth and Middle Andaman\\r\\n\\r\\nSouth Andaman\\r\\n\\r\\nNicobar\\r\\n\\r\\nA total of 48,675 hectares (120,280 acres) of land is used for agriculture purposes. Paddy, the main food crop, is mostly cultivated in Andaman group of islands, whereas coconut and arecanut are the cash crops of Nicobar group of islands. Field crops, namely pulses, oilseeds and vegetables are grown, followed by paddy during Rabi season. Different kinds of fruits such as mango, sapota, orange, banana, papaya, pineapple and root crops are grown on hilly land owned by farmers. Spices such as pepper, clove, nutmeg, and cinnamon are grown under a multi-tier cropping system. Rubber, red oil, palm, noni and cashew are grown on a limited scale in these islands.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are 1,374 registered small-scale, village and handicraft units. Two units are export-oriented in the line of fish processing activity. Apart from this, there are shell and wood based handicraft units. There are also four medium-sized industrial units. SSI units are engaged in the production of polythene bags, PVC conduit pipes and fittings, paints and varnishes, fibre glass and mini flour mills, soft drinks and beverages, etc. Small scale and handicraft units are also engaged in shell crafts, bakery products, rice milling, furniture making, etc.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Andaman and Nicobar Islands Integrated Development Corporation has spread its wings in the field of tourism, fisheries, industries and industrial financing and functions as authorised agents for Alliance Air/Jet Airways. The Islands have become a tourist destination, due to the draw of their largely unspoiled virgin beaches and waters.[25]\\r\\n\\r\\nAndaman and Nicobar Islands are developing into a major tourism hub with exotic-looking beaches and pristine islands having equally exotic names, wonderful opportunities for adventure sports like snorkelling and sea-walking.[26]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Port Blair, the main places to visit are the Cellular Jail, Mahatma Gandhi Marine National Park, Andaman Water sports complex, Chatham Saw Mill, Mini Zoo, Corbyn's cove, Chidiya Tapu, Wandoor Beach, Forest Museum, Anthropological Museum, Fisheries Museum, Naval Museum (Samudrika), Ross Island and Viper Island. Other places include Havelock island famous for Radhanagar Beach, Neil Island for Scuba diving/snorkelling, Cinque island, Saddle peak, Mt Harriet and Mud Volcano. The southern group (Nicobar islands) is mostly inaccessible to tourists.\\r\\n\\r\\nIndian tourists do not require a permit to visit the Andaman islands but if they wish to visit any tribal areas they need a special permit from the Deputy Commissioner, Port Blair. Permits are required for foreign nationals. For foreign nationals arriving by air, these are granted upon arrival at Port Blair.\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to official estimates, the flow of tourists doubled to nearly 300,000 in 2012 from 130,000 in 2008ÿ09. The Radha Nagar beach of Andamans was chosen as Asias best Beach in 2004.[26]\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is a chart of trend of gross state domestic product (GSDP) of Andaman and Nicobar Islands at market prices, estimated by the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation, with figures in millions of Indian rupees.[27]\\r\\n\\r\\nAndaman and Nicobar Islands' gross state domestic product for 2004 was estimated at $354 million in current prices.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith Japanese assistance, Southern Andaman Island will now have a 15-Megawatt Diesel power plant. This would be the first foreign investment of any kind allowed at this strategically significant island chain. This is believed to be an Indo-Japanese strategic initiative to strengthen civilian infrastructure in the vicinity of the Strait of Malacca ÿ a strategically important choke-point for the Chinese oil supply.[28][29]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Sisters are small uninhabited islands in the Andaman Archipelago, at the northern side of the Duncan Passage, about 6?km (3.2?nmi) southeast of Passage Island and 18?km (9.7?nmi) north of North Brother: East Sister Island and West Sister Island. The islands are about 250 metres (820 feet) apart, connected by a coral reef. They are covered by forests, and have rocky shores except for a beach on the northwest side of East Sister.\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore the British established a colony on the Andaman, the Sister islands were visited occasionally by the Onge people of Little Andaman Island for fishing. They may have been a waystation for their temporary settlement of Rutland Island between 1890 and 1930.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe islands have been a wildlife refuge since 1987, with an area of 0.36 square kilometres (0.14?sq?mi).","input":"What is the capital of andaman and nicobar?"},{"output":"December 28, 2016","context":"Bears Ears National Monument is a United States national monument located in San Juan County in southeastern Utah, established by President Barack Obama by presidential proclamation on December 28, 2016.

Lyman was concerned the Monument designation would \\"lock him and his neighbors out of their own backyards\\".[70]\\r\\nThe Salt Lake Tribune reported that reactions to the monument's designation ranged \\"from scathing to celebratory\\" within the state.[71] The designation was praised by the Bears Ears Inter-Tribal Coalition (BEITC) of Native Americans and environmentalists who had led the campaign to protect the land.[72] Navajo Nation President Russell Begaye wrote that the president's decision will \\"protect this land as a national monument for future generations of Navajo people and for all Americans\\", while collaborative land management provisions \\"strengthened the relationship between our Navajo and American nations.\\"[73] Arizona state Representative Eric Descheenie, a member of the Navajo Nation, said \\"At the end of the day, there's only a certain place in this entire world, on earth, where we as indigenous peoples belong. And to be able to secure that, you can't put any money value on it.\\"[71] The establishment of the monument was also praised by the Mormon Environmental Stewardship Alliance.[71]\\r\\nRepublican leaders reacted to the designation of the monument with disappointment. Some researchers and observers said that it was possible that president-elect Donald Trump or other Republicans might make an attempt to withdraw the designation and abolish the monument, though there is no clear legal mechanism for the president to do so unilaterally.[74] Utah's Republican governor, Gary Herbert, said that he was \\"more than disappointed\\" and \\"deeply disturbed\\" by President Obama's unilateral decision.[71] Congressman Jason Chaffetz reacted similarly.[75] Utah Attorney General Sean Reyes, also a Republican, stated that \\"By significantly restricting access to a large portion of public lands in Utah, the President weakens land management capabilities and fails to protect those the Antiquities Act intended to benefit\\", and announced that he planned a lawsuit regarding the issue.[75] A lawsuit against the FBI and BLM for its \\"heavy-handed and overzealous\\" looting raid in 2009, was rejected in February 2017 but \\"remains a point of contention for people in [Blanding], many of whom are also frustrated by the creation of the nearby Bears Ears National Monument.\\"[44] \\"Utah politicians such as Utah Senator Mike Lee (R), \\"ranchers, and business groups\\" also strongly opposed the monument.[43]\\r\\nIn February 2017, Utah Governor Herbert signed a resolution passed by the Utah State Legislature asking President Donald Trump to rescind the designation of Bears Ears as a national monument. There is uncertainty about the authority for a president to completely rescind a monument designated under the Antiquities Act, as it has never been done before.[76]\\r\\nIn response, the outdoor clothing company Patagonia announced that it would not be attending the Outdoor Retailer Market in Salt Lake City in 2017 or subsequent years due to the Utah government's opposition to Bears Ears. Patagonia urged other retailers to join it in moving to a state that \\"values our industry and promotes public land conservation.\\"[77][78] On February 16, the Outdoor Retailer Market announced that, after talking to the Governor, it would no longer schedule its annual trade show in Utah (as it has done for 20 years) due to the Utah government's opposition to Bears Ears National Monument.[79] The Outdoor Retailer show has 50,000 visitors and generates $45 million in local spending annually.[80]\\r\\nAfter the pullout from Utah, Colorado attempted to become the host of upcoming Outdoor Retailer shows. The organization Colorado Conservation put advertisements in Utah papers stating, \\"We have stronger beer. We have taller peaks. We have higher recreation. But most of all we love our public lands.\\"[80]\\r\\nOn February 21, 2017, the Southern Utah Wilderness Alliance announced that it would begin a statewide television advertisement campaign to build support for Bears Ears National Monument.[81]\\r\\nOn April 26, 2017, the President Trump directed the Interior Department to review 27 monuments of at least 100,000 acres in size through Executive Order 13792.[82] The order directed the department to consider the Antiquities Act \\"requirement that reservations of land not exceed 'the smallest area compatible with the proper care and management of the objects to be protected.'\\"\\r\\nOn June 10, 2017, Zinke issued an interim report as requested in the Executive Order. He proposed a scaling back of the Bears Ears National Monument.[83][84] On August 24, 2017, Zinke delivered a final report to Trump. The report calls for the reduction of Bears Ears, CascadeÿSiskiyou, Gold Butte, Grand Staircase-Escalante, Pacific Remote Islands Marine, and Rose Atoll Marine.[85]\\r\\nOn December 4, 2017, President Donald Trump ordered an 85 percent (about 1.3 million acres) reduction in the size of the monument. The boundaries were redrawn with two noncontiguous units named Indian Creek and Shash Ja; the latter unit includes the Bears Ears buttes. Trump also reduced the size of Utah's Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument by nearly 47 percent on the same day.[6]\\r\\nThe monument's reduction was seen as a victory for Republican officials and energy companies with mining leases for fossil fuel and uranium deposits, and a defeat for environmentalists and Native American tribes.[86][87] Internal documents of the Interior Department obtained by The New York Times include the state of Utah's interest in potential mining revenue on state trust lands within the original monument. Any such revenue would benefit the state's public school system. About a month before Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke began his review of national monuments, Senator Orrin Hatchs office sent a map with reduced monument boundaries to Interior Department officials. Those proposed new boundaries were mostly incorporated into the actual reduction.[88]\\r\\nMore than 300 uranium mining claims are located inside the original monument boundaries, with the large majority of those claims being located outside the reduced boundaries. Energy Fuels, a Canadian uranium producer which operates the only uranium mine and mill near the monument's original boundaries via their US subsidiary Energy Fuels Resources, holds about one third of those claims. The company, along with other mining firms, had lobbied hard for the reduction.[89][87]\\r\\nOn December 4, 2017, Utah Congressman John Curtis, along with fellow Utah representatives Rob Bishop, Chris Stewart and Mia Love, introduced a bill that would codify the Trump administration's reduction of Bears Ears National Monument by creating two new national monuments in the remaining areas defined by the president. The monuments would be named Shash Ja National Monument and Indian Creek National Monument. Shash Ja would be managed by a council of seven members, including four from Native American tribes, while Indian Creek would be managed by a council of five with just one Native American member.[90]\\r\\nOn January 9, 2018, members of the Tribes of the Bears Ears Inter-Tribal Coalition testified against the bill with Shaun Chapoose, a member of the Ute Indian Tribe and Utah Business Committee, stating \\"Congressman Bishops [committee chairman] contempt for the United States government-to-government relationship with Indian tribes and the legislative process in his own Committee was on full display during the hearing.\\" The bill, if passed by Congress and signed by the president, would effectively negate any legal challenges to the reduction.[91]\\r\\nThree separate federal lawsuits were filed by December 7, 2017 challenging the reduction of Bears Ears National Monument.[92] The plaintiffs include five Native American tribes, a private corporation, conservation groups, and several non-profit organizations and NGOs. The groups have argued that the reduction is not authorized by law.[6]\\r\\nThe three federal lawsuits are:\\r\\nSixteen national monuments were reduced in 18 separate acts by previous presidents, but not by any president since 1963.[7][85] The largest previous reduction by acreage was President Woodrow Wilson's 1915 removal of 313,280 acres (126,780?ha) from the Mount Olympus National Monument established by Theodore Roosevelt in 1909. The largest reduction by percentage was Navajo National Monument by 90% (from about 3715 acres[98] to 360 acres[99]) by President William Howard Taft in 1912 after he established it three years prior.","input":"When did bears ears become a national monument?"},{"output":"776 BC","context":"The ancient Olympic Games were originally a festival, or celebration of and for Zeus; later, events such as a footrace, a javelin contest, and wrestling matches were added. The Olympic Games (Ancient Greek: ??ϫ Olympia[1][2][3][4][5][6] \\"the Olympics\\"; also ??? Olympias[7][4][5][6] \\"the Olympiad\\") were a series of athletic competitions among representatives of city-states and one of the Panhellenic Games of ancient Greece. They were held in honor of Zeus, and the Greeks gave them a mythological origin. The first Olympics is traditionally dated to 776 BC.[8] They continued to be celebrated when Greece came under Roman rule, until the emperor Theodosius I suppressed them in AD?393 as part of the campaign to impose Christianity as the State religion of Rome. The games were held every four years, or olympiad, which became a unit of time in historical chronologies.\\r\\nDuring the celebration of the games, an Olympic Truce was enacted so that athletes could travel from their cities to the games in safety. The prizes for the victors were olive leaf wreaths or crowns. The games became a political tool used by city-states to assert dominance over their rivals. Politicians would announce political alliances at the games, and in times of war, priests would offer sacrifices to the gods for victory. The games were also used to help spread Hellenistic culture throughout the Mediterranean. The Olympics also featured religious celebrations. The statue of Zeus at Olympia was counted as one of the seven wonders of the ancient world. Sculptors and poets would congregate each olympiad to display their works of art to would-be patrons.\\r\\nThe ancient Olympics had fewer events than the modern games, and only freeborn Greek men were allowed to participate,[9] although there were victorious women chariot owners. As long as they met the entrance criteria, athletes from any Greek city-state and kingdom were allowed to participate, although the Hellanodikai, the officials in charge, allowed king Alexander I of Macedon to participate in the games only after he had proven his Greek ancestry.[10][11] The games were always held at Olympia rather than moving between different locations as is the practice with the modern Olympic Games.[12] Victors at the Olympics were honored, and their feats chronicled for future generations.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTo the Greeks, it was important to root the Olympic Games in mythology.[13] During the time of the ancient games their origins were attributed to the gods, and competing legends persisted as to who actually was responsible for the genesis of the games.[14] These origin traditions have become nearly impossible to untangle, yet a chronology and patterns have arisen that help people understand the story behind the games.[15]\\r\\nThe earliest myths regarding the origin of the games are recounted by the Greek historian, Pausanias. According to the story, the dactyl Heracles (not to be confused with the son of Zeus and the Roman god Hercules) and four of his brothers, Paeonaeus, Epimedes, Iasius and Idas, raced at Olympia to entertain the newborn Zeus. He crowned the victor with an olive tree wreath (which thus became a peace symbol), which also explains the four year interval, bringing the games around every fifth year (counting inclusively).[16][17] The other Olympian gods (so named because they lived permanently on Mount Olympus) would also engage in wrestling, jumping and running contests.[18]\\r\\nAnother myth of the origin of the games is the story of Pelops, a local Olympian hero. The story of Pelops begins with Oenomaus, the king of Pisa, Greece, who had a beautiful daughter named Hippodamia. According to an oracle, the king would be killed by her husband. Therefore, he decreed that any young man who wanted to marry his daughter was required to drive away with her in his chariot, and Oenomaus would follow in another chariot, and spear the suitor if he caught up with them. Now, the king's chariot horses were a present from the god Poseidon and were therefore supernaturally fast. Pelops was a very handsome young man and the king's daughter fell in love with him. Before the race, she persuaded her father's charioteer Myrtilus to replace the bronze axle pins of the king's chariot with wax ones. Naturally, during the race, the wax melted and the king fell from his chariot and was killed. At the same time, the king's palace was struck by lightning and reduced to ashes, save for one wooden pillar that was revered in the Altis for centuries, and stood near what was to be the site of the temple of Zeus. Pelops was proclaimed the winner and married Hippodamia. After his victory, Pelops organized chariot races as thanksgiving to the gods and as funeral games in honor of King Oenomaus, in order to be purified of his death. It was from this funeral race held at Olympia that the beginnings of the Olympic Games were inspired. Pelops became a great king, a local hero, and he gave his name to the Peloponnese.\\r\\nOne other myth, this one occurring after the aforementioned myth, is attributed to Pindar. He claims the festival at Olympia involved Heracles, the son of Zeus. The story goes that after completing his labors, Heracles established an athletic festival to honor his father.\\r\\nThe games of previous millennia were discontinued and then revived by Lycurgus of Sparta, Iphitos of Elis, and Cleisthenes of Pisa at the behest of the Oracle of Delphi who claimed that the people had strayed from the gods, which had caused a plague and constant war. Restoration of the games would end the plague, usher in a time of peace, and signal a return to a more traditional lifestyle.[19] The patterns that emerge from these myths are that the Greeks believed the games had their roots in religion, that athletic competition was tied to worship of the gods, and the revival of the ancient games was intended to bring peace, harmony and a return to the origins of Greek life.[20]\\r\\nSince these myths were documented by historians like Pausanias, who lived during the reign of Marcus Aurelius in the AD?160, it is likely that these stories are more fable than fact. It was often supposed that the origins of many aspects of the Olympics date to funeral games of the Mycenean period and later.[21] Alternatively, the games were thought to derive from some kind of vegetation magic or from initiation ceremonies. The most recent theory traces the origins of the games to large game hunting and related animal ceremonialism.[22]\\r\\nThe Olympic games were held to be one of the two central rituals in ancient Greece, the other being the much older religious festival, the Eleusinian Mysteries.[23]\\r\\nThe games started in Olympia, Greece, in a sanctuary site for the Greek deities near the towns of Elis and Pisa (both in Elis on the peninsula of Peloponnesos). The first games began as an annual foot race of young women in competition for the position of the priestess for the goddess, Hera,[24] and a second race was instituted for a consort for the priestess who would participate in the religious traditions at the temple.[25]\\r\\nThe Heraean Games, the first recorded competition for women in the Olympic Stadium, were held as early as the sixth century BC. It originally consisted of foot races only, as did the competition for males. Some texts, including Pausanias's Description of Greece, c.?AD?175, state that Hippodameia gathered a group known as the \\"Sixteen Women\\" and made them administrators of the Heraea Games, out of gratitude for her marriage to Pelops. Other texts related to the Elis and Pisa conflict indicate that the \\"Sixteen Women\\" were peacemakers from Pisa and Elis and, because of their political competence, became administrators of the Heraea. Being the consort of Hera in Classical Greek mythology, Zeus was the father of the deities in the pantheon of that era. The Sanctuary of Zeus in Olympia housed a 13-metre-high (43?ft) statue in ivory and gold of Zeus that had been sculpted by Phidias circa 445?BC. This statue was one of the ancient Seven Wonders of the World. By the time of the Classical Greek culture, in the fifth and fourth centuries BC, the games were restricted to male participants.\\r\\nThe historian Ephorus, who lived in the fourth century BC, is one potential candidate for establishing the use of Olympiads to count years, although credit for codifying this particular epoch usually falls to Hippias of Elis, to Eratosthenes, or even to Timaeus, whom Eratosthenes may have imitated.[26][27][28] The Olympic Games were held at four-year intervals, and later, the ancient historians' method of counting the years even referred to these games, using the term Olympiad for the period between two games. Previously, the local dating systems of the Greek states were used (they continued to be used by everyone except the historians), which led to confusion when trying to determine dates. For example, Diodorus states that there was a solar eclipse in the third year of the 113th Olympiad, which must be the eclipse of 316?BC. This gives a date of (mid-summer) 765?BC for the first year of the first Olympiad.[29] Nevertheless, there is disagreement among scholars as to when the games began.[30]\\r\\nThe only competition held then was, according to the later Greek traveller Pausanias who wrote in AD?175, the stadion race, a race over about 190 metres (620 feet), measured after the feet of Hercules. The word stadium is derived from this foot race.\\r\\nThe Greek tradition of athletic nudity (gymnos)[31] was introduced in 720?BC, either by the Spartans or by the Megarian Orsippus, and this was adopted early in the Olympics as well.\\r\\nSeveral groups fought over control of the sanctuary at Olympia, and hence the games, for prestige and political advantage. Pausanias later writes that in 668?BC, Pheidon of Argos was commissioned by the town of Pisa to capture the sanctuary from the town of Elis, which he did and then personally controlled the games for that year. The next year, Elis regained control.\\r\\nThe Olympic Games were part of the Panhellenic Games, four separate games held at two- or four-year intervals, but arranged so that there was at least one set of games every year. The Olympic Games were more important and more prestigious than the Pythian, Nemean, and Isthmian Games.\\r\\nThe games were in decline for many years but continued past AD?385, by which time flooding and earthquakes had damaged the buildings and invasions by barbarians had reached Olympia.[32] In 394 Theodosius I banned all pagan festivals, but archeological evidence indicates that some games were still held.[33]\\r\\nThe ancient Olympics were as much a religious festival as an athletic event. The games were held in honor of the Greek god Zeus, and on the middle day of the games, 100 oxen would be sacrificed to him.[12] Over time Olympia, the site of the games, became a central spot for the worship of the head of the Greek pantheon and a temple, built by the Greek architect Libon, was erected on the mountaintop. The temple was one of the largest Doric temples in Greece.[12] The sculptor Pheidias created a statue of the god made of gold and ivory. It stood 42 feet (13?m) tall. It was placed on a throne in the temple. The statue became one of the seven wonders of the ancient world.[12] As the historian Strabo put it,\\r\\n... the glory of the temple persisted?... on account both of the festal assembly and of the Olympian Games, in which the prize was a crown and which were regarded as sacred, the greatest games in the world. The temple was adorned by its numerous offerings, which were dedicated there from all parts of Greece.[12]\\r\\nArtistic expression was a major part of the games. Sculptors, poets, painters and other artisans would come to the games to display their works in what became an artistic competition. Sculptors created works like Myron's Diskobolos or Discus Thrower. Their aim was to highlight natural human movement and the shape of muscles and the body. Poets would be commissioned to write poems in praise of the Olympic victors. Such victory songs or epinicians, were passed on from generation to generation and many of them have lasted far longer than any other honor made for the same purpose.[34] Pierre de Coubertin, one of the founders of the modern Olympic Games, wanted to fully imitate the ancient Olympics in every way. Included in his vision was an artistic competition modeled on the ancient Olympics and held every four years, during the celebration of the Olympic Games.[35] His desire came to fruition at the Olympics held in Athens in 1896.[36]\\r\\nPower in ancient Greece became centered around the city-state in the 8th?century BC.[37] The city-state was a population center organized into a self-contained political entity.[38] These city-states often lived in close proximity to each other, which created competition for limited resources. Though conflict between the city-states was ubiquitous, it was also in their self-interest to engage in trade, military alliances and cultural interaction.[39] The city-states had a dichotomous relationship with each other: On one hand, they relied on their neighbors for political and military alliances, while on the other they competed fiercely with those same neighbors for vital resources.[40] The Olympic Games were established in this political context and served as a venue for representatives of the city-states to peacefully compete against each other.[41]\\r\\nIn the first 200 years of the games' existence, they only had regional religious importance. Only Greeks in proximity to the mountain competed in these early games. This is evidenced by the dominance of Peloponnesian athletes in the victors' rolls.[42] The spread of Greek colonies in the 5th and 6th centuries BC is repeatedly linked to successful Olympic athletes. For example, Pausanias recounts that Cyrene was founded c. 630?BC by settlers from Thera with Spartan support. The support Sparta gave was primarily the loan of three-time Olympic champion Chionis. The appeal of settling with an Olympic champion helped to populate the colonies and maintain cultural and political ties with the city-states near Olympia. Thus, Hellenic culture and the games spread while the primacy of Olympia persisted.[43]\\r\\nThe games faced a serious challenge during the Peloponnesian War, which primarily pitted Athens against Sparta, but, in reality, touched nearly every Hellenic city-state.[44] The Olympics were used during this time to announce alliances and offer sacrifices to the gods for victory.[12][45]\\r\\nDuring the Olympic Games, a truce, or ekecheiria was observed. Three runners, known as spondophoroi were sent from Elis to the participant cities at each set of games to announce the beginning of the truce.[46] During this period, armies were forbidden from entering Olympia and legal disputes and the use of the death penalty were forbidden. The truce was primarily designed to allow athletes and visitors to travel safely to the games and was, for the most part, observed.[46] Thucydides wrote of a situation when the Spartans were forbidden from attending the games, and the violators of the truce were fined 2,000 minae for assaulting the city of Lepreum during the period of the ekecheiria. The Spartans disputed the fine and claimed that the truce had not yet taken hold.[45][47]\\r\\nWhile a martial truce was observed by all participating city-states, no such reprieve from conflict existed in the political arena. The Olympic Games evolved the most influential athletic and cultural stage in ancient Greece, and arguably in the ancient world.[48] As such the games became a vehicle for city-states to promote themselves. The result was political intrigue and controversy. For example, Pausanias, a Greek historian, explains the situation of the athlete Sotades,\\r\\nSotades at the ninety-ninth Festival was victorious in the long race and proclaimed a Cretan, as in fact he was. But at the next Festival he made himself an Ephesian, being bribed to do so by the Ephesian people. For this act he was banished by the Cretans.[12]\\r\\nApparently starting with just a single foot race, the program gradually increased to twenty-three contests, although no more than twenty featured at any one Olympiad.[49] Participation in most events was limited to male athletes except for women who were allowed to take part by entering horses in the equestrian events. Youth events are recorded as starting in 632 BC. Our knowledge of how the events were performed primarily derives from the paintings of athletes found on many vases, particularly those of the Archaic and Classical periods.[50]\\r\\nThe only event recorded at the first thirteen games was the stade, a straight-line sprint of just over 192 metres.[51] The diaulos (lit. \\"double pipe\\"), or two-stade race, is recorded as being introduced at the 14th Olympiad in 724 BC. It is thought that competitors ran in lanes marked out with lime or gypsum for the length of a stade then turned around separate posts (kampteres), before returning to the start line.[52] Xenophanes wrote that \\"Victory by speed of foot is honored above all.\\"\\r\\nA third foot race, the dolichos (\\"long race\\"), was introduced in the next Olympiad. Accounts of the race's distance differ, it seems to have been from twenty to twenty-four laps of the track, around 7.5?km to 9?km, although it may have been lengths rather than laps and thus half as far.[53][54]\\r\\nThe last running event added to the Olympic program was the hoplitodromos, or \\"Hoplite race\\", introduced in 520 BC and traditionally run as the last race of the games. Competitors ran either a single or double diaulos (approximately 400 or 800 metres) in full military armour.[55] The hoplitodromos was based on a war tactic of soldiers running in full armor to surprise the enemy.\\r\\nWrestling (pale) is recorded as being introduced at the 18th Olympiad. Three throws were necessary for a win. A throw was counted if the body, hip, back or shoulder (and possibly knee) touched the ground. If both competitors fell nothing was counted. Unlike its modern counterpart Greco-Roman wrestling, it is likely that tripping was allowed.[56]\\r\\nBoxing (pygmachia) was first listed in 688 BC,[57] the boys event sixty years later. The laws of boxing were ascribed to the first Olympic champion Onomastus of Smyrna.[58] It appears body-blows were either not permitted or not practised.[59][60] The Spartans, who claimed to have invented boxing, quickly abandoned it and did not take part in boxing competitions.[58] At first the boxers wore himantes (sing. himas), long leather strips which were wrapped around their hands.[57]\\r\\nThe pankration was introduced in the 33rd Olympiad (648 BC).[61] Boys' pankration became an Olympic event in 200 BC, in the 145th Olympiad.[62] As well as techniques from boxing and wrestling, athletes used kicks,[63] locks, and chokes on the ground. Although the only prohibitions were against biting and gouging, the pankration was regarded as less dangerous than boxing.[64]\\r\\nIt was one of the most popular events: Pindar wrote eight odes praising victors of the pankration.[65] A famous event in the sport was the posthumous victory of Arrhichion of Phigaleia who \\"expired at the very moment when his opponent acknowledged himself beaten.\\"[66][67]\\r\\nThe pentathlon was a competition made up of five events: running, long jump, discus throw, javelin throw and wrestling.[68] The pentathlon is said to have first appeared at the 18th Olympiad in 708 BC.[69] The competition was held on a single day,[70] but it is not known how the victor was decided,[71][72] or in what order the events occurred,[73] except that it finished with the wrestling.[74]\\r\\nHorse racing and chariot racing were the most prestigious competitions in the games, due to only the wealthy being able to afford the maintenance and transportation of horses. These races consisted of different events: the four-horse chariot race, the two-horse chariot race, and the horse with rider race, the rider being hand picked by the owner. The four-horse chariot race was the first equestrian event to feature in the Olympics, being introduced in 680 BC. It consisted of two horses that were harnessed under a Yoke in the middle, and two outer horses that were attached with a rope.[75] The two-horse chariot was introduced in 408 BC.[76] The horse with rider competition on the other hand, was introduced in 648 BC. In this race, Greeks didn't use saddles or stirrups, so they required good grip and balance.[77]\\r\\nIn AD?67, the Roman Emperor Nero competed in the chariot race at Olympia. He was thrown from his chariot and was thus unable to finish the race. Nevertheless, he was declared the winner on the basis that he would have won if he had finished the race.[78]\\r\\nAthletic festivals under the name of \\"Olympic games\\", named in imitation of the original festival at Olympia, were established over time in various places all over the Greek world. Some of these are only known to us by inscriptions and coins; but others, as the Olympic festival at Antioch, obtained great celebrity. After these Olympic festivals had been established in several places, the great Olympic festival itself was sometimes designated in inscriptions by the addition of Pisa.[87]","input":"What was the date of the first olympics?"},{"output":"1.51 times the Moon's","context":"Ganymede /??n?mi?d/[11] (Jupiter III) is the largest and most massive moon of Jupiter and in the Solar System. The ninth largest object in the Solar System, it is the largest without a substantial atmosphere. It has a diameter of 5,268?km (3,273?mi) and is 8% larger than the planet Mercury, although only 45% as massive.[12] Possessing a metallic core, it has the lowest moment of inertia factor of any solid body in the Solar System and is the only moon known to have a magnetic field. It is the third of the Galilean moons, the first group of objects discovered orbiting another planet, and the seventh satellite outward from Jupiter,[13] Ganymede orbits Jupiter in roughly seven days and is in a 1:2:4 orbital resonance with the moons Europa and Io, respectively.\\r\\nGanymede is composed of approximately equal amounts of silicate rock and water ice.[14] It is a fully differentiated body with an iron-rich, liquid core, and an internal ocean that may contain more water than all of Earth's oceans combined.[15][16][17][18][19] Its surface is composed of two main types of terrain. Dark regions, saturated with impact craters and dated to four billion years ago, cover about a third of the satellite. Lighter regions, crosscut by extensive grooves and ridges and only slightly less ancient, cover the remainder. The cause of the light terrain's disrupted geology is not fully known, but was likely the result of tectonic activity due to tidal heating.[4]\\r\\nGanymede's magnetic field is probably created by convection within its liquid iron core.[20] The meager magnetic field is buried within Jupiter's much larger magnetic field and would show only as a local perturbation of the field lines. The satellite has a thin oxygen atmosphere that includes O, O2, and possibly O3 (ozone).[10] Atomic hydrogen is a minor atmospheric constituent. Whether the satellite has an ionosphere associated with its atmosphere is unresolved.[21]\\r\\nGanymede's discovery is credited to Galileo Galilei, who was the first to observe it on January 7, 1610.[1] The satellite's name was soon suggested by astronomer Simon Marius, after the mythological Ganymede, cupbearer of the Greek gods and Zeus's lover.[22] Beginning with Pioneer 10, several spacecraft have explored Ganymede.[23] The Voyager probes refined measurements of its size, while Galileo discovered its underground ocean and magnetic field. The next planned mission to the Jovian system is the European Space Agency's Jupiter Icy Moon Explorer (JUICE), due to launch in 2022. After flybys of all three icy Galilean moons, the probe is planned to enter orbit around Ganymede.[24]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChinese astronomical records report that in 365 BC, Gan De detected what appears to have been a moon of Jupiter, probably Ganymede, with the naked eye.[25][26] However, Gan De reported the color of the companion as reddish, which is puzzling since the moons are too faint for their color to be perceived with the naked eye.[27] Shi Shen and Gan De together made fairly accurate observations of the five major planets.[28][29]\\r\\nOn January 7, 1610, Galileo Galilei observed what he thought were three stars near Jupiter, including what turned out to be Ganymede, Callisto, and one body that turned out to be the combined light from Io and Europa; the next night he noticed that they had moved. On January 13, he saw all four at once for the first time, but had seen each of the moons before this date at least once. By January 15, Galileo came to the conclusion that the stars were actually bodies orbiting Jupiter.[1][2] He claimed the right to name the moons; he considered \\"Cosmian Stars\\" and settled on \\"Medicean Stars\\".[22]\\r\\nThe French astronomer Nicolas-Claude Fabri de Peiresc suggested individual names from the Medici family for the moons, but his proposal was not taken up.[22] Simon Marius, who had originally claimed to have found the Galilean satellites,[30] tried to name the moons the \\"Saturn of Jupiter\\", the \\"Jupiter of Jupiter\\" (this was Ganymede), the \\"Venus of Jupiter\\", and the \\"Mercury of Jupiter\\", another nomenclature that never caught on. From a suggestion by Johannes Kepler, Marius once again tried to name the moons:[22]\\r\\n[] Then there was Ganymede, the handsome son of King Tros, whom Jupiter, having taken the form of an eagle, transported to heaven on his back, as poets fabulously tell [] the Third, on account of its majesty of light, Ganymede [][31]\\r\\nThis name and those of the other Galilean satellites fell into disfavor for a considerable time, and were not in common use until the mid-20th century. In much of the earlier astronomical literature, Ganymede is referred to instead by its Roman numeral designation, Jupiter III (a system introduced by Galileo), in other words \\"the third satellite of Jupiter\\". Following the discovery of moons of Saturn, a naming system based on that of Kepler and Marius was used for Jupiter's moons.[22] Ganymede is the only Galilean moon of Jupiter named after a male figurelike Io, Europa, and Callisto, he was a lover of Zeus.\\r\\nGanymede orbits Jupiter at a distance of 1,070,400?km, third among the Galilean satellites,[13] and completes a revolution every seven days and three hours. Like most known moons, Ganymede is tidally locked, with one side always facing toward the planet, hence its day is seven days and three hours.[32] Its orbit is very slightly eccentric and inclined to the Jovian equator, with the eccentricity and inclination changing quasi-periodically due to solar and planetary gravitational perturbations on a timescale of centuries. The ranges of change are 0.0009ÿ0.0022 and 0.05ÿ0.32, respectively.[33] These orbital variations cause the axial tilt (the angle between rotational and orbital axes) to vary between 0 and 0.33.[5]\\r\\nGanymede participates in orbital resonances with Europa and Io: for every orbit of Ganymede, Europa orbits twice and Io orbits four times.[33][34] The superior conjunction between Io and Europa always occurs when Io is at periapsis and Europa at apoapsis. The superior conjunction between Europa and Ganymede occurs when Europa is at periapsis.[33] The longitudes of the IoÿEuropa and EuropaÿGanymede conjunctions change with the same rate, making triple conjunctions impossible. Such a complicated resonance is called the Laplace resonance.[35]\\r\\nThe current Laplace resonance is unable to pump the orbital eccentricity of Ganymede to a higher value.[35] The value of about 0.0013 is probably a remnant from a previous epoch, when such pumping was possible.[34] The Ganymedian orbital eccentricity is somewhat puzzling; if it is not pumped now it should have decayed long ago due to the tidal dissipation in the interior of Ganymede.[35] This means that the last episode of the eccentricity excitation happened only several hundred million years ago.[35] Because Ganymede's orbital eccentricity is relatively lowon average 0.0015[34]tidal heating is negligible now.[35] However, in the past Ganymede may have passed through one or more Laplace-like resonances[g] that were able to pump the orbital eccentricity to a value as high as 0.01ÿ0.02.[4][35] This probably caused a significant tidal heating of the interior of Ganymede; the formation of the grooved terrain may be a result of one or more heating episodes.[4][35]\\r\\nThere are two hypotheses for the origin of the Laplace resonance among Io, Europa, and Ganymede: that it is primordial and has existed from the beginning of the Solar System;[37] or that it developed after the formation of the Solar System. A possible sequence of events for the latter scenario is as follows: Io raised tides on Jupiter, causing Io's orbit to expand (due to conservation of momentum) until it encountered the 2:1 resonance with Europa; after that the expansion continued, but some of the angular moment was transferred to Europa as the resonance caused its orbit to expand as well; the process continued until Europa encountered the 2:1 resonance with Ganymede.[35] Eventually the drift rates of conjunctions between all three moons were synchronized and locked in the Laplace resonance.[35]\\r\\nGanymede is the largest and most massive moon in the Solar System. Its diameter of 5,268?km is 0.41 times that of Earth, 2% larger than that of Saturn's Titan (the second-largest moon), 1.08 times Mercury's, 1.09 times Callisto's, 1.45 times Io's and 1.51 times the Moon's. Its mass is 10% greater than Titan's, 38% greater than Callisto's, 66% greater than Io's and 2.02 times that of the Moon.[38]\\r\\nThe average density of Ganymede, 1.936 g/cm3, suggests a composition of about equal parts rocky material and mostly water-ices.[4] The mass fraction of ices is between 46ÿ50?%, which is slightly lower than that in Callisto.[39] Some additional volatile ices such as ammonia may also be present.[39][40] The exact composition of Ganymede's rock is not known, but is probably close to the composition of L/LL type ordinary chondrites, which are characterized by less total iron, less metallic iron and more iron oxide than H chondrites. The weight ratio of iron to silicon ranges between 1.05 and 1.27 in Ganymede, whereas the solar ratio is around 1.8.[39]\\r\\nGanymede's surface has an albedo of about 43%.[41] Water ice seems to be ubiquitous on its surface, with a mass fraction of 50ÿ90?%,[4] significantly more than in Ganymede as a whole. Near-infrared spectroscopy has revealed the presence of strong water ice absorption bands at wavelengths of 1.04, 1.25, 1.5, 2.0 and 3.0 m.[41] The grooved terrain is brighter and has a more icy composition than the dark terrain.[42] The analysis of high-resolution, near-infrared and UV spectra obtained by the Galileo spacecraft and from Earth observations has revealed various non-water materials: carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide and, possibly, cyanogen, hydrogen sulfate and various organic compounds.[4][43] Galileo results have also shown magnesium sulfate (MgSO4) and, possibly, sodium sulfate (Na2SO4) on Ganymede's surface.[32][44] These salts may originate from the subsurface ocean.[44]\\r\\nThe Ganymedian surface albedo is very asymmetric; the leading hemisphere[h] is brighter than the trailing one.[41] This is similar to Europa, but the reverse for Callisto.[41] The trailing hemisphere of Ganymede appears to be enriched in sulfur dioxide.[45][46] The distribution of carbon dioxide does not demonstrate any hemispheric asymmetry, although it is not observed near the poles.[43][47] Impact craters on Ganymede (except one) do not show any enrichment in carbon dioxide, which also distinguishes it from Callisto. Ganymede's carbon dioxide gas was probably depleted in the past.[47]\\r\\nGanymede's surface is a mix of two types of terrain: very old, highly cratered, dark regions and somewhat younger (but still ancient), lighter regions marked with an extensive array of grooves and ridges. The dark terrain, which comprises about one-third of the surface,[49] contains clays and organic materials that could indicate the composition of the impactors from which Jovian satellites accreted.[50]\\r\\nThe heating mechanism required for the formation of the grooved terrain on Ganymede is an unsolved problem in the planetary sciences. The modern view is that the grooved terrain is mainly tectonic in nature.[4] Cryovolcanism is thought to have played only a minor role, if any.[4] The forces that caused the strong stresses in the Ganymedian ice lithosphere necessary to initiate the tectonic activity may be connected to the tidal heating events in the past, possibly caused when the satellite passed through unstable orbital resonances.[4][51] The tidal flexing of the ice may have heated the interior and strained the lithosphere, leading to the development of cracks and horst and graben faulting, which erased the old, dark terrain on 70% of the surface.[4][52] The formation of the grooved terrain may also be connected with the early core formation and subsequent tidal heating of Ganymede's interior, which may have caused a slight expansion of Ganymede by 1ÿ6?% due to phase transitions in ice and thermal expansion.[4] During subsequent evolution deep, hot water plumes may have risen from the core to the surface, leading to the tectonic deformation of the lithosphere.[53] Radiogenic heating within the satellite is the most relevant current heat source, contributing, for instance, to ocean depth. Research models have found that if the orbital eccentricity were an order of magnitude greater than currently (as it may have been in the past), tidal heating would be a more substantial heat source than radiogenic heating.[54]\\r\\nCratering is seen on both types of terrain, but is especially extensive on the dark terrain: it appears to be saturated with impact craters and has evolved largely through impact events.[4] The brighter, grooved terrain contains many fewer impact features, which have been only of a minor importance to its tectonic evolution.[4] The density of cratering indicates an age of 4?billion years for the dark terrain, similar to the highlands of the Moon, and a somewhat younger age for the grooved terrain (but how much younger is uncertain).[55] Ganymede may have experienced a period of heavy cratering 3.5 to 4?billion years ago similar to that of the Moon.[55] If true, the vast majority of impacts happened in that epoch, whereas the cratering rate has been much smaller since.[38] Craters both overlay and are crosscut by the groove systems, indicating that some of the grooves are quite ancient. Relatively young craters with rays of ejecta are also visible.[38][56] Ganymedian craters are flatter than those on the Moon and Mercury. This is probably due to the relatively weak nature of Ganymede's icy crust, which can (or could) flow and thereby soften the relief. Ancient craters whose relief has disappeared leave only a \\"ghost\\" of a crater known as a palimpsest.[38]\\r\\nOne significant feature on Ganymede is a dark plain named Galileo Regio, which contains a series of concentric grooves, or furrows, likely created during a period of geologic activity.[57]\\r\\nGanymede also has polar caps, likely composed of water frost. The frost extends to 40 latitude.[32] These polar caps were first seen by the Voyager spacecraft. Theories on the formation of the caps include the migration of water to higher latitudes and bombardment of the ice by plasma. Data from Galileo suggests the latter is correct.[58] The presence of a magnetic field on Ganymede results in more intense charged particle bombardment of its surface in the unprotected polar regions; sputtering then leads to redistribution of water molecules, with frost migrating to locally colder areas within the polar terrain.[58]\\r\\nA crater named Anat provides the reference point for measuring longitude on Ganymede. By definition, Anat is at 128 longitude.[59] The 0 longitude directly faces Jupiter, and unless stated otherwise longitude increases toward the west.[60]\\r\\nGanymede appears to be fully differentiated, with an internal structure consisting of an iron-sulfideÿiron core, a silicate mantle and outer layers of water ice and liquid water.[4][61][62]. The precise thicknesses of the different layers in the interior of Ganymede depend on the assumed composition of silicates (fraction of olivine and pyroxene) and amount of sulfur in the core.[39][61][63] Ganymede has the lowest moment of inertia factor, 0.31,[4] among the solid Solar System bodies. This is a consequence of its substantial water content and fully differentiated interior\\r\\nIn the 1970s, NASA scientists first suspected that Ganymede has a thick ocean between two layers of ice, one on the surface and one beneath a liquid ocean and atop the rocky mantle.[4][17][61][64][65] In the 1990s, NASA's Galileo mission flew by Ganymede, confirming the moon's sub-surface ocean. An analysis published in 2014, taking into account the realistic thermodynamics for water and effects of salt, suggests that Ganymede might have a stack of several ocean layers separated by different phases of ice, with the lowest liquid layer adjacent to the rocky mantle.[17][18][19][66] Waterÿrock contact may be an important factor in the origin of life.[17] The analysis also notes that the extreme depths involved (~800?km to the rocky \\"seafloor\\") mean that temperatures at the bottom of a convective (adiabatic) ocean can be up to 40 K higher than those at the iceÿwater interface. In March 2015, scientists reported that measurements with the Hubble Space Telescope of how the aurorae moved over Ganymede's surface suggest it has a subsurface ocean. A large salt-water ocean affects Ganymede's magnetic field, and consequently, its aurora.[15][66][67][68] The evidence suggests that Ganymede's oceans might be the largest in the entire Solar System.[69]\\r\\nThere is some speculation on the potential habitability of Ganymede's ocean.[65][70]\\r\\nThe existence of a liquid, ironÿnickel-rich core[62] provides a natural explanation for the intrinsic magnetic field of Ganymede detected by Galileo spacecraft.[71] The convection in the liquid iron, which has high electrical conductivity, is the most reasonable model of magnetic field generation.[20] The density of the core is 5.5ÿ6 g/cm3 and the silicate mantle is 3.4ÿ3.6 g/cm3.[39][61][63][71] The radius of this core may be up to 500?km.[71] The temperature in the core of Ganymede is probably 1500ÿ1700 K and pressure up to 10?GPa (99,000?atm).[61][71]\\r\\nIn 1972, a team of Indian, British and American astronomers working in Java (Indonesia) and Kavalur (India) claimed that they had detected a thin atmosphere during an occultation, when it and Jupiter passed in front of a star.[72] They estimated that the surface pressure was around 0.1 Pa.[72] However, in 1979, Voyager 1 observed an occultation of the star  Centauri during its flyby of Jupiter, with differing results.[73] The occultation measurements were conducted in the far-ultraviolet spectrum at wavelengths shorter than 200 nm, which were much more sensitive to the presence of gases than the 1972 measurements made in the visible spectrum. No atmosphere was revealed by the Voyager data. The upper limit on the surface particle number density was found to be 1.5G109 cm?3, which corresponds to a surface pressure of less than 2.5 Pa.[73] The latter value is almost five orders of magnitude less than the 1972 estimate.[73]\\r\\nDespite the Voyager data, evidence for a tenuous oxygen atmosphere (exosphere) on Ganymede, very similar to the one found on Europa, was found by the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) in 1995.[10][74] HST actually observed airglow of atomic oxygen in the far-ultraviolet at the wavelengths 130.4?nm and 135.6?nm. Such an airglow is excited when molecular oxygen is dissociated by electron impacts,[10] which is evidence of a significant neutral atmosphere composed predominantly of O2 molecules. The surface number density probably lies in the (1.2ÿ7)G108 cm?3 range, corresponding to the surface pressure of 0.2ÿ1.2 Pa.[10][i] These values are in agreement with the Voyager's upper limit set in 1981. The oxygen is not evidence of life; it is thought to be produced when water ice on Ganymede's surface is split into hydrogen and oxygen by radiation, with the hydrogen then being more rapidly lost due to its low atomic mass.[74] The airglow observed over Ganymede is not spatially homogeneous like that over Europa. HST observed two bright spots located in the northern and southern hemispheres, near I 50 latitude, which is exactly the boundary between the open and closed field lines of the Ganymedian magnetosphere (see below).[75] The bright spots are probably polar auroras, caused by plasma precipitation along the open field lines.[76]\\r\\nThe existence of a neutral atmosphere implies that an ionosphere should exist, because oxygen molecules are ionized by the impacts of the energetic electrons coming from the magnetosphere[77] and by solar EUV radiation.[21] However, the nature of the Ganymedian ionosphere is as controversial as the nature of the atmosphere. Some Galileo measurements found an elevated electron density near Ganymede, suggesting an ionosphere, whereas others failed to detect anything.[21] The electron density near the surface is estimated by different sources to lie in the range 400ÿ2,500?cm?3.[21] As of 2008, the parameters of the ionosphere of Ganymede are not well constrained.\\r\\nAdditional evidence of the oxygen atmosphere comes from spectral detection of gases trapped in the ice at the surface of Ganymede. The detection of ozone (O3) bands was announced in 1996.[78] In 1997 spectroscopic analysis revealed the dimer (or diatomic) absorption features of molecular oxygen. Such an absorption can arise only if the oxygen is in a dense phase. The best candidate is molecular oxygen trapped in ice. The depth of the dimer absorption bands depends on latitude and longitude, rather than on surface albedothey tend to decrease with increasing latitude on Ganymede, whereas O3 shows an opposite trend.[79] Laboratory work has found that O2 would not cluster or bubble but dissolve in ice at Ganymede's relatively warm surface temperature of 100 K (?173.15?C).[80]\\r\\nA search for sodium in the atmosphere, just after such a finding on Europa, turned up nothing in 1997. Sodium is at least 13 times less abundant around Ganymede than around Europa, possibly because of a relative deficiency at the surface or because the magnetosphere fends off energetic particles.[81] Another minor constituent of the Ganymedian atmosphere is atomic hydrogen. Hydrogen atoms were observed as far as 3,000?km from Ganymede's surface. Their density on the surface is about 1.5G104 cm?3.[82]\\r\\nThe Galileo craft made six close flybys of Ganymede from 1995ÿ2000 (G1, G2, G7, G8, G28 and G29)[20] and discovered that Ganymede has a permanent (intrinsic) magnetic moment independent of the Jovian magnetic field.[83] The value of the moment is about 1.3?G?1013 T{m3,[20] which is three times larger than the magnetic moment of Mercury. The magnetic dipole is tilted with respect to the rotational axis of Ganymede by 176, which means that it is directed against the Jovian magnetic moment.[20] Its north pole lies below the orbital plane. The dipole magnetic field created by this permanent moment has a strength of 719 I 2 nT at Ganymede's equator,[20] which should be compared with the Jovian magnetic field at the distance of Ganymedeabout 120 nT.[83] The equatorial field of Ganymede is directed against the Jovian field, meaning reconnection is possible. The intrinsic field strength at the poles is two times that at the equator1440 nT.[20]\\r\\nThe permanent magnetic moment carves a part of space around Ganymede, creating a tiny magnetosphere embedded inside that of Jupiter; it is the only moon in the Solar System known to possess the feature.[83] Its diameter is 4ÿ5 RG (RG = 2,631.2?km).[84] The Ganymedian magnetosphere has a region of closed field lines located below 30 latitude, where charged particles (electrons and ions) are trapped, creating a kind of radiation belt.[84] The main ion species in the magnetosphere is single ionized oxygenO+[21]which fits well with Ganymede's tenuous oxygen atmosphere. In the polar cap regions, at latitudes higher than 30, magnetic field lines are open, connecting Ganymede with Jupiter's ionosphere.[84] In these areas, the energetic (tens and hundreds of kiloelectronvolt) electrons and ions have been detected,[77] which may cause the auroras observed around the Ganymedian poles.[75] In addition, heavy ions precipitate continuously on Ganymede's polar surface, sputtering and darkening the ice.[77]\\r\\nThe interaction between the Ganymedian magnetosphere and Jovian plasma is in many respects similar to that of the solar wind and Earth's magnetosphere.[84][85] The plasma co-rotating with Jupiter impinges on the trailing side of the Ganymedian magnetosphere much like the solar wind impinges on the Earth's magnetosphere. The main difference is the speed of plasma flowsupersonic in the case of Earth and subsonic in the case of Ganymede. Because of the subsonic flow, there is no bow shock off the trailing hemisphere of Ganymede.[85]\\r\\nIn addition to the intrinsic magnetic moment, Ganymede has an induced dipole magnetic field.[20] Its existence is connected with the variation of the Jovian magnetic field near Ganymede. The induced moment is directed radially to or from Jupiter following the direction of the varying part of the planetary magnetic field. The induced magnetic moment is an order of magnitude weaker than the intrinsic one. The field strength of the induced field at the magnetic equator is about 60 nThalf of that of the ambient Jovian field.[20] The induced magnetic field of Ganymede is similar to those of Callisto and Europa, indicating that Ganymede also has a subsurface water ocean with a high electrical conductivity.[20]\\r\\nGiven that Ganymede is completely differentiated and has a metallic core,[4][71] its intrinsic magnetic field is probably generated in a similar fashion to the Earth's: as a result of conducting material moving in the interior.[20][71] The magnetic field detected around Ganymede is likely to be caused by compositional convection in the core,[71] if the magnetic field is the product of dynamo action, or magnetoconvection.[20][86]\\r\\nDespite the presence of an iron core, Ganymede's magnetosphere remains enigmatic, particularly given that similar bodies lack the feature.[4] Some research has suggested that, given its relatively small size, the core ought to have sufficiently cooled to the point where fluid motions, hence a magnetic field would not be sustained. One explanation is that the same orbital resonances proposed to have disrupted the surface also allowed the magnetic field to persist: with Ganymede's eccentricity pumped and tidal heating of the mantle increased during such resonances, reducing heat flow from the core, leaving it fluid and convective.[52] Another explanation is a remnant magnetization of silicate rocks in the mantle, which is possible if the satellite had a more significant dynamo-generated field in the past.[4]\\r\\nGanymede probably formed by an accretion in Jupiter's subnebula, a disk of gas and dust surrounding Jupiter after its formation.[87] The accretion of Ganymede probably took about 10,000 years,[88] much shorter than the 100,000 years estimated for Callisto. The Jovian subnebula may have been relatively \\"gas-starved\\" when the Galilean satellites formed; this would have allowed for the lengthy accretion times required for Callisto.[87] In contrast Ganymede formed closer to Jupiter, where the subnebula was denser, which explains its shorter formation timescale.[88] This relatively fast formation prevented the escape of accretional heat, which may have led to ice melt and differentiation: the separation of the rocks and ice. The rocks settled to the center, forming the core [62]. In this respect, Ganymede is different from Callisto, which apparently failed to melt and differentiate early due to loss of the accretional heat during its slower formation.[89] This hypothesis explains why the two Jovian moons look so dissimilar, despite their similar mass and composition.[64][89] Alternative theories explain Ganymede's greater internal heating on the basis of tidal flexing[90] or more intense pummeling by impactors during the Late Heavy Bombardment.[91][92][93][94] In the latter case, modeling suggests that differentiation would become a runaway process at Ganymede but not Callisto.[93][94]\\r\\nAfter formation, Ganymede's core largely retained the heat accumulated during accretion and differentiation, only slowly releasing it to the ice mantle [89]. The mantle, in turn, transported it to the surface by convection.[64] The decay of radioactive elements within rocks further heated the core, causing increased differentiation: an inner, ironÿiron-sulfide core and a silicate mantle formed.[71][89] With this, Ganymede became a fully differentiated body [62]. By comparison, the radioactive heating of undifferentiated Callisto caused convection in its icy interior, which effectively cooled it and prevented large-scale melting of ice and rapid differentiation.[95] The convective motions in Callisto have caused only a partial separation of rock and ice.[95] Today, Ganymede continues to cool slowly.[71] The heat being released from its core and silicate mantle enables the subsurface ocean to exist,[40] whereas the slow cooling of the liquid FeÿFeS core causes convection and supports magnetic field generation.[71] The current heat flux out of Ganymede is probably higher than that out of Callisto.[89]\\r\\nSeveral probes flying by or orbiting Jupiter have explored Ganymede more closely, including four flybys in the 1970s, and multiple passes in the 1990s to 2000s.\\r\\nPioneer 10 approached in 1973 and Pioneer 11 in 1974,[23] and they returned information about the satellite.[96] This included more specific determination on physical characteristics and resolving features to 400?km (250?mi) on its surface.[97] Pioneer 10's closest approach was 446,250?km.[98]\\r\\nVoyager 1 and Voyager 2 were next, passing by Ganymede in 1979. They refined its size, revealing it was larger than Saturn's moon Titan, which was previously thought to have been bigger.[99] The grooved terrain was also seen.[100]\\r\\nIn 1995, the Galileo spacecraft entered orbit around Jupiter and between 1996 and 2000 made six close flybys to explore Ganymede.[32] These flybys are G1, G2, G7, G8, G28 and G29.[20] During the closest flybyG2Galileo passed just 264?km from the surface of Ganymede.[20] During a G1 flyby in 1996, the Ganymedian magnetic field was discovered,[101] while the discovery of the ocean was announced in 2001.[20][32] Galileo transmitted a large number of spectral images and discovered several non-ice compounds on the surface of Ganymede.[43] The most recent close observations of Ganymede were made by New Horizons, which recorded topographic and compositional mapping data of Europa and Ganymede during its flyby of Jupiter in 2007 en route to Pluto.[102][103]\\r\\nThe Europa Jupiter System Mission (EJSM) had a proposed launch date in 2020, and was a joint NASA and ESA proposal for exploration of many of Jupiter's moons including Ganymede. In February 2009 it was announced that ESA and NASA had given this mission priority ahead of the Titan Saturn System Mission.[104] EJSM consisted of the NASA-led Jupiter Europa Orbiter, the ESA-led Jupiter Ganymede Orbiter, and possibly a JAXA-led Jupiter Magnetospheric Orbiter. ESA's contribution faced funding competition from other ESA projects,[105] but on 2 May 2012 the European part of the mission, renamed Jupiter Icy Moon Explorer (JUICE), obtained a L1 launch slot in 2022 with an Ariane 5 in the ESA's Cosmic Vision science programme.[106] The spacecraft will orbit Ganymede and conduct multiple flyby investigations of Callisto and Europa.[107]\\r\\nThe Russian Space Research Institute is currently evaluating the Ganymede Lander (GL) mission, with emphasis on astrobiology.[108] The Ganymede Lander would be a partner mission for JUpiter ICy moon Explorer (JUICE).[108][109] If selected, it would be launched in 2024, though this schedule might be revised and aligned with JUICE.[108]\\r\\nA Ganymede orbiter based on the Juno probe was proposed in 2010 for the Planetary Science Decadal Survey.[110] Possible instruments include Medium Resolution Camera, Flux Gate Magnetometer, Visible/NIR Imaging Spectrometer, Laser Altimeter, Low and High Energy Plasma Packages, Ion and Neutral Mass Spectrometer, UV Imaging Spectrometer, Radio and Plasma Wave sensor, Narrow Angle Camera, and a Sub-Surface Radar.[110]\\r\\nAnother canceled proposal to orbit Ganymede was the Jupiter Icy Moons Orbiter. It was designed to use nuclear fission for power, ion engine propulsion, and would have studied Ganymede in greater detail than previously.[111] However, the mission was canceled in 2005 because of budget cuts.[112] Another old proposal was called The Grandeur of Ganymede.[50]","input":"How big is ganymede compared to earth's moon?"},{"output":"Jeanne Calment of France (1875ÿ1997), who lived to the age of 122 years, 164 days","context":"This is a list of tables of the oldest people in the world in ordinal ranks.

(1 Cor 12)\\r\\n\\r\\nIn canonical and general usage, it refers to those who exercise authority within a Christian church.[3] In the Catholic Church, authority rests chiefly with the bishops,[4] while priests and deacons serve as their assistants, co-workers or helpers.[5] Accordingly, \\"hierarchy of the Catholic Church\\" is also used to refer to the bishops alone.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs of 31st of December 2014, the Catholic Church consisted of 2,998 dioceses or equivalent jurisdictions,[7] each overseen by a bishop. Dioceses are divided into individual communities called parishes, each staffed by one or more priest, deacon, or lay ecclesial minister.[8] Ordinarily, care of a parish is entrusted to a priest, though there are exceptions. Approximately 22% of all parishes do not have a resident pastor, and 3,485 parishes worldwide  are entrusted to a deacon or lay ecclesial minister.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nAll clergy, including deacons, priests, and bishops, may preach, teach, baptize, witness marriages, and conduct funeral liturgies.[10] Only priests and bishops can celebrate the sacraments of the Eucharist (though others may be ministers of Holy Communion),[11] Penance (Reconciliation, Confession), Confirmation (priests may administer this sacrament with prior ecclesiastical approval), and Anointing of the Sick.[12][13] Only bishops can administer the sacrament of Holy Orders, by which men are ordained as bishops, priests or deacons.[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe bishops, who possess the fullness of orders, and therefore the fullness of both priesthood and diaconate, are as a body (the College of Bishops) considered the successors of the Apostles[15][16] and are \\"constituted Pastors in the Church, to be the teachers of doctrine, the priests of sacred worship and the ministers of governance\\"[17] and \\"represent the Church.\\"[18] In the year 2012, there were 5,133 Catholic bishops;[19] at the end of 2014, there were 5,237 Catholic bishops.[20] The Pope himself is a bishop (the bishop of Rome) and traditionally uses the title \\"Venerable Brother\\" when writing formally to another bishop.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe typical role of a bishop is to provide pastoral governance for a diocese.[16] Bishops who fulfill this function are known as diocesan ordinaries, because they have what canon law calls ordinary (i.e. not delegated) authority for a diocese. These bishops may be known as hierarchs in the Eastern Catholic Churches. Other bishops may be appointed to assist ordinaries (auxiliary bishops and coadjutor bishops) or to carry out a function in a broader field of service to the Church, such as appointments as papal nuncios or as officials in the Roman Curia.\\r\\n\\r\\nBishops of a country or region may form an episcopal conference and meet periodically to discuss current problems. Decisions in certain fields, notably liturgy, fall within the exclusive competence of these conferences. The decisions of the conferences are binding on the individual bishops only if agreed to by at least two-thirds of the membership and confirmed by the Holy See.\\r\\n\\r\\nBishops are normally ordained to the episcopate by at least three other bishops,[17] though for validity only one is needed[21] and a mandatum from the Holy See is required.[22] Ordination to the episcopate is considered the completion of the sacrament of Holy Orders; even when a bishop retires from his active service, he remains a bishop, since the ontological effect of Holy Orders is permanent. On the other hand, titles such as archbishop or patriarch imply no ontological alteration, and existing bishops who rise to those offices do not require further ordination.\\r\\n\\r\\nSacramentally, all bishops are equal. According to jurisdiction, office, and privileges, however, various ranks are distinguished, as indicated below. All bishops are \\"vicars of Christ\\".[23]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe pope is the bishop of Rome. He is also, by virtue of that office:\\r\\n\\r\\nVicar of Jesus Christ, Successor of the Prince of the Apostles, Supreme Pontiff of the Universal Church, Patriarch of the Latin Church, Primate of Italy, Archbishop and Metropolitan of the Roman Province, Sovereign of the Vatican City State, Servant of the servants of God.[24]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\"Pope\\" is a pronominal honorific, not an office or a title, meaning \\"Father\\" (the common honorific for all clergy). The honorific \\"pope\\" was from the early 3rd century used for any bishop in the West, and is known in Greek as far back as Homer's Odyssey (6:57).[18] In the East, \\"pope\\" is still a common form of address for clergy in the Russian Orthodox Church, and is the style of the Bishop of Alexandria. Pope Marcellinus (d. 304) is the first Bishop of Rome shown in sources to have had the title \\"pope\\" used of him. From the 6th century, the imperial chancery of Constantinople normally reserved this designation for the Bishop of Rome.[18] From the early 6th century, it began to be confined in the West to the Bishop of Rome, a practice that was firmly in place by the 11th century, when Pope Gregory VII declared it reserved for the Bishop of Rome.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs bishop of the Church of Rome, he is successor to the co-patrons of that local Church, Saint Peter and Saint Paul.[25]  As such, the Church of Rome, and its bishop, has always had a prominence in the Catholic communion and at least to some degree primacy among his peers, the other bishops,[26] as Peter had a certain primacy among his peers, the other apostles.[27] The exact nature of that primacy is one of the most significant ecumenical issues of the age, and has developed as a doctrine throughout the entire history of the Church.[28]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Catechism of the Catholic Church, quoting the Second Vatican Council's document Lumen gentium, states: \\"The pope, Bishop of Rome and Peter's successor, 'is the perpetual and visible source and foundation of the unity both of the bishops and of the whole company of the faithful.'\\"[29] Communion with bishop of Rome has become such a significant identifier of Catholic identity that at times the Catholic Church has been known in its entirety as \\"Roman Catholic\\", though this is inaccurate in Catholic theology (ecclesiology).[30]\\r\\n\\r\\nThree other of the pope's offices stem directly from his office as bishop of the Church of Rome. As the Latin Church owes its identity and development to its origins in the liturgical, juridical, and theological patrimony of Rome, the bishop of Rome is de facto the patriarch of the Latin Church. According to no less than Pope Benedict XVI, there has been much 'confusion' between the pope's primacy as patriarch of the western church and his primacy as first patriarch among equals, that this \\"failure to distinguish\\" between the roles and responsibilities of these two distinct positions lead in time to the \\"extreme centralization of the Catholic Church\\" and the schism between East and West.[31]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the first local Church of Italy, the bishop of Rome is the Primate of Italy and is empowered to appoint the president of the Italian Bishops' Conference.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Church of Rome is also the principal church of the Province of Rome, so the bishop of Rome is Archbishop and Metropolitan of the Roman province.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs a bishop, the pope is referred to as a Vicar of Christ. This title was common to all bishops from the fourth through twelfth centuries, reserved to the bishop of Rome from the twelfth through early twentieth centuries, and restored to all bishops at the Second Vatican Council.[32]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe pope resides in Vatican City, an independent state within the city of Rome, set up by the 1929 Lateran Pacts between the Holy See and Italy. As popes were sovereigns of the papal states (754ÿ1870), so do they exercise absolute civil authority in the microstate of Vatican City since 1929.\\r\\n\\r\\nAmbassadors are accredited not to Vatican City State but to the Holy See, which was a subject of international law even before the state was instituted. The body of officials that assist the Pope in governance of the Church as a whole is known as the Roman curia. The term \\"Holy See\\" (i.e. of Rome) is generally used only of Pope and curia, because the Code of Canon Law, which concerns governance of the Latin Church as a whole and not internal affairs of the see (diocese) of Rome itself, necessarily uses the term in this technical sense.\\r\\n\\r\\nFinally, the title \\"Servant of the servants of God\\" was an addition of Pope Gregory the Great, a reminder that in Christianity, leadership is always about service/ministry (diakonia).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe style of address for the bishop of Rome is \\"His Holiness\\".\\r\\n\\r\\nThe present rules governing the election of a pope are found in the apostolic constitution Universi Dominici Gregis.[33] This deals with the powers, from the death of a pope to the announcement of his successor's election, of the cardinals and the departments of the Roman curia; with the funeral arrangements for the dead pope; and with the place, time and manner of voting of the meeting of the cardinal electors, a meeting known as a conclave. This word is derived from Latin com- (together) and clavis (key) and refers to the locking away of the participants from outside influences, a measure that was introduced first as a means instead of forcing them to reach a decision.\\r\\n\\r\\nLike all bishops, the pope has the option of resigning, though unlike other bishops, it is not required. The best known cases are those of Pope Celestine V in 1294, Pope Gregory XII in 1415 and Pope Benedict XVI in 2013. Approximately 10% of all popes left or were removed from office before death.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe heads of some autonomous (in Latin, sui iuris) particular Churches consisting of several local Churches (dioceses) have the title of Patriarch.[34]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe pope, as patriarch of the Latin Church, is the head of the only sui iuris Church in the West, leading to the relatively short-lived title Patriarch of the West (in use 1863ÿ2006). Eastern patriarchs are elected by the synod of bishops of their particular Church.[35]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Patriarchs who head autonomous particular Churches are:\\r\\n\\r\\nThese have authority not only over the bishops of their particular Church, including metropolitans, but also directly over all the faithful.[42] Eastern Catholic patriarchs have precedence over all other bishops, with the exceptions laid down by the Pope.[43] The honorary title prefixed to their names is \\"His Beatitude\\".\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are also titular patriarchs in the Latin Church, who, for various historical reasons, were granted the title, but never the corresponding office and responsibilities, of \\"patriarch\\". They include the Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem, the Patriarch of Venice, the Patriarch of Lisbon, and the Patriarch of the East Indies. All of these offices are honorary, and the patriarchs are not the heads of autonomous particular Churches.[44] The Patriarch of the East Indies is the archbishop of Goa, while the other patriarchs are the archbishops of the named cities. The title of Patriarch of the West Indies was in the past granted to some Spanish bishops (not always of the same see), but is long in abeyance.\\r\\n\\r\\nOther autonomous particular Churches are headed by a major archbishop.[45] The Syro-Malankara Catholic Church uses the title Catholicos for their major archbishop.[46] With few exceptions, the authority of a major archbishop in his sui iuris Church is equivalent to that of a patriarch in his Church.[47] This less prestigious office[48] was established in 1963 for those Eastern Catholic Churches which have developed in size and stability to allow full self-governance if historical, ecumenical, or political conditions do not allow their elevation to a patriarchate.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt present, there are four major archbishops:\\r\\n\\r\\nCardinals are princes of the Church appointed by the Pope.[49] He generally chooses bishops who head departments of the Roman Curia or important episcopal sees throughout the world. As a whole, the cardinals compose a College of Cardinals which advises the Pope, and those cardinals under the age of 80 at the death or resignation of a Pope elect his successor. Their heraldic achievement is surmounted by the red galero and tassels as a form of martyred position in the Church.\\r\\n\\r\\nNot all cardinals are bishops. Domenico Bartolucci, Karl Josef Becker, Roberto Tucci and Albert Vanhoye are examples of 21st-century non-bishop cardinals. The 1917 Code of Canon Law introduced the requirement that a cardinal must be at least a priest.[50] Previously, they need only be in minor orders and not even deacons. Teodolfo Mertel, who died in 1899, was the last non-priest cardinal. In 1962, Pope John XXIII made it a rule that a man who has been nominated a cardinal is required to be consecrated a bishop, if not one already,[51] but some ask for and obtain dispensation from this requirement. It is rare that the Pope will appoint Cardinals who are priests only and not consecrated as a bishop.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 1917 Code of Canon Law, continuing the tradition observed, for instance, at the First Vatican Council,[52] laid down that cardinals have precedence over all other prelates, even patriarchs.[53] The 1983 Code of Canon Law did not deal with questions of precedence.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe cardinalate is not an integral part of the theological structure of the Catholic Church, but largely an honorific distinction that has its origins in the 1059 assignation of the right of electing the Pope exclusively to the principal clergy of Rome and the bishops of the seven suburbicarian dioceses.[49] Because of their resulting importance, the term cardinal (from Latin cardo, meaning \\"hinge\\") was applied to them. In the 12th century the practice of appointing ecclesiastics from outside Rome as cardinals began. Each cardinal is still assigned a church in Rome as his \\"titular church\\" or is linked with one of the suburbicarian dioceses. Of these sees, the Dean of the College of Cardinals holds that of Ostia, while keeping his preceding link with one of the other six sees. Traditionally, only six cardinals held the rank of Cardinal Bishop, but when Eastern patriarchs are made cardinals, they too hold the rank of Cardinal Bishop, without being assigned a suburbicarian see. The other cardinals have the rank either of Cardinal Priest or Cardinal Deacon, the former rank being normally assigned to bishops in charge of dioceses, and the latter to officials of the Curia and to priests raised to the cardinalate.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Latin Church title of primate has in some countries been granted to the bishop of a particular (usually metropolitan) see.[54] It once involved authority over all the other sees in the country or region, but now only gives a \\"prerogative of honor\\" with no power of governance unless an exception is made in certain matters by a privilege granted by the Holy See or by an approved custom.[55] The title is usually assigned to the ordinary of the first diocese or the oldest archdiocese in the country.[54] Thus in Poland, the primate is the archbishop of the oldest archdiocese (Gniezno, founded in 1000), and not the oldest diocese (Pozna, founded in 968).\\r\\n\\r\\nNotably, the Archbishop of Baltimore is not formally considered a primate of the Catholic Church in the United States, but \\"prerogative of the place\\".\\r\\n\\r\\nThe closest equivalent position in Eastern Orthodoxy is an exarch holding authority over other bishops without being a patriarch.[54] In the Eastern Catholic Churches, exarchs, whether apostolic or patriarchal, do not hold authority over other bishops (see below, #Equivalents of diocesan bishops in law).\\r\\n\\r\\nA Latin Church Metropolitan is the bishop of the principal (the \\"metropolitan\\") see of an ecclesiastical province composed of several dioceses.  The metropolitan receives a pallium from the pope as a symbol of his office.\\r\\nThe metropolitan bishop has limited oversight authority over the suffragan dioceses in their province, including ensuring that the faith and ecclesiastical discipline are properly observed.[56]  He also has the power to name a diocesan administrator for a vacant suffragan see if the diocesan council of consultors fails to properly elect one.[57]  His diocesan tribunal additionally serves by default as the ecclesiastical court of appeal for suffragans (court of second instance),[58] and the metropolitan has the option of judging those appeals personally.[59]\\r\\n\\r\\nEastern metropolitans in patriarchal or major archiepiscopal churches have a level of authority similar to that of Latin metropolitans, subject to the specific laws and customs of their sui iuris church.[60] Eastern metropolitans who head a metropolitan sui iuris church have much greater authority within their church, although it is less than that of a major archbishop or patriarch.[61]\\r\\n\\r\\nAll metropolitans have the title of Archbishop, and the metropolitan see is usually referred to as an archdiocese or archeparchy, a title held not only by the 553 metropolitan sees but also by 77 other sees.[62] An exception is the metropolitan Diocese of Rome.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe title of archbishop is held not only by bishops who head metropolitan sees, but also by those who head archdioceses that are not metropolitan sees (most of these are in Europe and the Levant[63]). In addition, it is held by certain other bishops, referred to as \\"Titular Archbishops\\" (see \\"Other Bishops\\" below) who have been given no-longer-residential archdioceses as their titular seesmany of these in administrative or diplomatic posts, for instance as papal nuncios or secretaries of curial congregations. The bishop of a non-archiepiscopal see may be given the personal title of archbishop without also elevating his see (such a bishop is known as an archbishop ad personam), though this practice has seen significantly reduced usage since the Second Vatican Council.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe bishop or eparch of a see, even if he does not also hold a title such as Archbishop, Metropolitan, Major Archbishop, Patriarch or Pope, is the centre of unity for his diocese or eparchy, and, as a member of the College of Bishops, shares in responsibility for governance of the whole Church (cf. Catechism of the Catholic Church, 886). As each local particular Church is an embodiment of the whole Catholic Church, not just an administrative subdivision of something larger, the bishop who is its head is not a delegate of the Pope. Instead, he has of himself primary teaching, governance and sanctifying responsibility for the see for which he has been ordained bishop.\\r\\n\\r\\nWithin each diocese, even if the Eucharist is celebrated by another bishop, the necessary communion with the Bishop of the diocese is signified by the mention of his name. In Eastern eparchies the name of the patriarch, major archbishop or metropolitan is also mentioned, because these also have direct responsibility within all the eparchies of the particular Church in question. For the same reason, every Catholic celebration of the Eucharist has a mention of the Pope by name.\\r\\n\\r\\nOrdination to the episcopate is the fullness of the priesthood and the completion of the sacrament of Holy Orders. Bishops are considered the successors of the apostles.\\r\\n\\r\\nWithin the Catholic Church the following posts have similarities to that of a diocesan bishop, but are not necessarily held by a bishop.\\r\\n\\r\\nCanon 368 of the Code of Canon Law lists five Latin Church jurisdictional areas that are considered equivalent to a diocese. These are headed by:\\r\\n\\r\\nTo these may be added:\\r\\n\\r\\nOf somewhat similar standing is the Diocesan Administrator (formerly called a Vicar Capitular) elected to govern a diocese during a vacancy. Apart from certain limitations of nature and law, he has, on a caretaker basis, the same obligations and powers as a Diocesan Bishop (canons 427ÿ429 of the Code of Canon Law). Occasionally an Apostolic Administrator is appointed by the Holy See to run a vacant diocese, or even a diocese whose bishop is incapacitated or otherwise impeded.\\r\\n\\r\\nA Diocesan Bishop may have bishops who assist in his ministry. The Coadjutor Bishop of a see has the right of succession on the death or resignation of the Diocesan Bishop, and, if the see is an archdiocese, holds the title of Archbishop. Similarly, a retired Diocesan Bishop keeps his connection with the see to which he was appointed, and is known as Bishop (or Archbishop) Emeritus of that see. On the other hand, an Auxiliary Bishop, who may also hold posts such as vicar general or episcopal vicar, is appointed bishop of a titular see, a see that in the course of history has ceased to exist as an actual jurisdictional unit.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe titular seeswhich may be archiepiscopal or simply episcopalassigned to such bishops were once known as sees in partibus infidelium, because they were situated in areas lost to Christianity as a result of Muslim conquests. Now former sees even in Christian countries are assigned as titular sees. These sees are also assigned to bishops who serve in the Roman Curia, as Papal Nuncios, or as equivalents of Diocesan Bishops in law (see above), such as Vicars Apostolic and Apostolic Exarchs.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe term \\"Titular Bishop\\" is frequently used for such bishops, but is, strictly speaking, inaccurate, since they are indeed bishops, even if they do not serve the see to which they are appointed, and are not merely holders of an honorary title of bishop. They are members of the College of Bishops as much as the Diocesan Bishops.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn most English-speaking countries, the honorary title prefixed to the name of a bishop is \\"The Most Reverend\\". However, in the United Kingdom and in those countries most strongly influenced by English (not Irish) practice, \\"The Most Reverend\\" is reserved for archbishops, and other bishops are called \\"The Right Reverend\\".\\r\\n\\r\\nImportant titles or functions usually, but not necessarily, held by (arch)bishops who are not in charge of a diocese or an equivalent community include those of Apostolic Delegate, Apostolic Nuncio, Papal Legate, Patriarchal Vicar, Pontifical Delegate.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLocal ordinaries are placed over or exercise ordinary executive power in particular churches or equivalent communities.[66]\\r\\n\\r\\nMajor superiors of religious institutes (including abbots) and of societies of apostolic life are ordinaries of their respective memberships, but not local ordinaries.\\r\\n\\r\\nBishops are assisted by priests[70] and deacons. All priests and deacons are incardinated in a diocese or religious order. Parishes, whether territorial or person-based, within a diocese are normally in the charge of a priest, known as the parish priest or the pastor.[70]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the Latin Church, only celibate men, as a rule, are ordained as priests, while the Eastern Churches, again as a rule, ordain both celibate and married men. Among the Eastern particular Churches, the Ethiopic Catholic Church ordains only celibate clergy, while also having married priests who were ordained in the Orthodox Church, while other Eastern Catholic Churches, which do ordain married men, do not have married priests in certain countries. The Western or Latin Church does sometimes, though rarely, ordain married men, usually Protestant clergy who have become Catholics. All sui iuris Churches of the Catholic Church maintain the ancient tradition that, following ordination, marriage is not allowed. Even a married priest whose wife dies may not then marry again.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Catholic Church and the ancient Christian Churches see priestly ordination as a sacrament dedicating the person ordained to a permanent relationship of service, and, like Baptism and Confirmation, having an ontological effect on the person. It is for this reason that a person may be ordained to each of the three orders only once. They also consider that ordination can be conferred only on males.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough priests are incardinated into a diocese or order, they may obtain the permission of their diocesan ordinary or religious superior to serve outside the normal jurisdiction of the diocese or order. These assignments may be temporary or more permanent in nature.\\r\\n\\r\\nTemporary assignments may include studying for an advanced degree at a Pontifical University in Rome. They may also include short-term assignments to the faculty of a seminary located outside the diocese's territory.\\r\\n\\r\\nLong-term assignments include serving the universal church on the staff of a dicastery or tribunal of the Roman Curia or in the diplomatic corps of the Holy See. They may also be appointed the rector or to long-term teaching assignments to the faculty of a seminary or Catholic university. Priests may also serve on the staff of their episcopal conference, as military chaplains in the military ordinariates, or as missionaries.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe diocesan bishop appoints a vicar general to assist him in the governance of the diocese. Usually, only one vicar general is appointed; particularly large dioceses may have more than one vicar general. The vicar general or one of them is usually appointed moderator of the curia who coordinates the diocesan administrative offices and ministries.[71] A diocesan bishop can also appoint one or more episcopal vicars for the diocese. They have the same ordinary power as a vicar general, however, it is limited to a specified division of the diocese, to a specific type of activity, to the faithful of a particular rite, or to certain groups of people.[72] Vicars general and episcopal vicars must be priests or bishops. In the Eastern Catholic Churches, they are called protosyncelli and syncelli (canon 191 of the Code of Canons of the Eastern Churches).\\r\\n\\r\\nDiocesan bishops are required to appoint a judicial vicar to whom is delegated the bishop's ordinary power to judge cases (canon 1420 of the Code of Canon Law, canon 191 of the Code of Canons of the Eastern Churches). In the Latin church, the judicial vicar may also be called officialis. The person holding this post must be a priest, have earned a doctorate in canon law (or at least a license), be at least thirty years old, and, unless the smallness of the diocese or the limited number of cases suggests otherwise, must not be the vicar general. As one of the jobs of the judicial vicar is to preside over collegiate tribunals, many dioceses have adjutant judicial vicars who can preside over collegiate tribunals in place of the judicial vicar and must have the same qualifications.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe diocesan bishop appoints a chancellor, possibly a vice-chancellor, and notaries to the diocesan chancery. These officials maintain the records and archives of the diocese. They also serve as the secretaries of the diocesan curia. The bishop also appoints a finance officer and a finance council to oversee the budget, temporal goods, income, and expenses of the diocese.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe diocesan bishop may appoint priests to be members of the chapter of his cathedral or of a collegiate church (so called after their chapter). These priests are given the title of canon. He also appoints six to twelve priests from the presbyteral council to serve as a college of consultors.  They have the responsibility to elect the diocesan administrator in the event of the vacancy of the see.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe bishop appoints priests and other members of the faithful to various advisory bodies. These include the presbyteral council, the diocesan synod, and the pastoral council.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\"The Vicar Forane known also as the Dean or the Archpriest or by some other title, is the priest who is placed in charge of a vicariate forane\\" (canon 553 of the Code of Canon Law), namely of a group of parishes within a diocese. Unlike a regional Episcopal Vicar, a Vicar Forane acts as a help for the Parish Priests and other priests in the vicariate forane, rather than as an intermediate authority between them and the Diocesan Bishop.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis section concerns the priest who in the Code of Canon Law is referred to by the term parochus, which is some English-speaking countries is rendered as \\"the parish priest\\", in others as \\"the pastor\\". The English term \\"pastor\\" is also used in a more generic sense corresponding instead to the Latin term pastor:\\r\\n\\r\\nThe parish priest is the proper pastor of the parish entrusted to him. He exercises the pastoral care of the community entrusted to him under the authority of the diocesan Bishop, whose ministry of Christ he is called to share, so that for this community he may carry out the offices of teaching, sanctifying and ruling with the cooperation of other priests or deacons and with the assistance of lay members of Christ's faithful, in accordance with the law\\r\\n\\r\\nThe pastor (parochus) is the proper pastor (pastor) of the parish entrusted to him, exercising the pastoral care of the community committed to him under the authority of the diocesan bishop in whose ministry of Christ he has been called to share, so that for that same community he carries out the functions of teaching, sanctifying, and governing, also with the cooperation of other presbyters or deacons and with the assistance of lay members of the Christian faithful, according to the norm of law\\r\\n\\r\\nThe parish priest/pastor may be assisted by one or more other priests:\\r\\n\\r\\nWhenever it is necessary or opportune for the due pastoral care of the parish, one or more assistant priests can be joined with the parish priest.

As co-workers with the pastor and sharers in his solicitude, they are to offer service in the pastoral ministry by common counsel and effort with the pastor and under his authority\\r\\n\\r\\nThe honorary title of monsignor is conferred by the Pope upon diocesan priests (not members of religious institutes) in the service of the Holy See, and may be granted by him also to other diocesan priests at the request of the priest's bishop. The priest so honored is considered to be a member of the papal household. The title goes with any of the following three awards:\\r\\n\\r\\nIn December 2013, Pope Francis decided to make future grants of the title of Monsignor to priests not in the service of the Holy See only in the rank of Chaplain of His Holiness and only to priests aged 65 or over.[74]\\r\\n\\r\\nUnder legislation of Pope Pius X, vicars general and vicars capitular (the latter are now called diocesan administrators) are titular (not actual) Protonotaries durante munere, i.e., as long as they hold those offices, and so are entitled to be addressed as Monsignor,[75] as indicated also by the placing of the abbreviated title \\"Mons.\\" before the name of every member of the secular (diocesan) clergy listed as a vicar general in the Annuario Pontificio. (Honorary titles such as that of \\"Monsignor\\" are not considered appropriate for religious.)\\r\\n\\r\\nSome of the Eastern Catholic Churches of Syriac tradition use the title Chorbishop, roughly equivalent to the Western title of Monsignor. Other Eastern Catholic Churches bestow the honorific title of Archimandrite upon unmarried priests as a mark of respect or gratitude for their services. Married presbyters may be honored with the position of Archpriest, which has two grades, the higher is \\"Mitred Archpriest\\" which permits the priest to wear a mitre.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the Latin Church titles of Archpriest is sometimes attached to the pastor of a few number of historic churches including the major basilicas in Rome.  These archpriests are not presbyers, but bishops or cardinals.[76] Similarly, the title of Archdeacon is sometimes conferred on presbyters.\\r\\n\\r\\nDeacons are ordained ministers of the Church who are co-workers with the bishop alongside presbyters, but are intended to focus on the ministries of direct service and outreach to the poor and needy, rather than pastoral leadership. They are usually related to a parish, where they have a liturgical function as the ordinary minister of the Gospel and the Prayers of the Faithful, They may preach homilies, and in the Roman Rite, may preside at non-Eucharistic liturgies such as baptisms, weddings, funerals, and adoration/benediction. In the Eastern Catholic Churches, in the absence of a priest, deacons do not vest and may only lead services as a reader, never presiding at weddings or funerals.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe scriptural basis and description of the role and qualifications of the deacon can be found in Acts 6:1ÿ9, and in 1 Timothy 3:1ÿ13.[77]\\r\\n\\r\\nThey may be seminarians preparing for ordination to the priesthood, \\"transitional deacons\\", or \\"permanent deacons\\" who do not intend to be ordained as priests. To be ordained deacons, the latter must be at least 25 years old, if unmarried; if married, a prospective deacon must be at least 35 years old and have the consent of his wife. In the Latin Church, married deacons are permanent deacons. In most diocese there is a cut-off age for being accepted into formation for the diaconate.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe passage from membership of the laity to that of the clergy occurs with ordination to the diaconate.[78] Previously, the Latin Church rule was that one became a cleric on receiving clerical tonsure, which was followed by minor orders and by the subdiaconate, which was reckoned as one of the major orders. By his motu proprio Ministeria quaedam of 15 August 1972, Pope Paul VI decreed: \\"The orders hitherto called minor are henceforth to be spoken of as 'ministries'.\\"[79] The same motu proprio also decreed that the Latin Church would no longer have the major order of subdiaconate, but it permitted any episcopal conference that so desired to apply the term \\"subdeacon\\" to those who hold the ministry (formerly called the minor order) of \\"acolyte\\".[80] Even in those societies within the Latin Church that, with the approval of the Holy See, continue to administer the rites of tonsure, minor orders and subdiaconate, those who receive those rites remain lay people, becoming clerics only on being ordained as deacons.[81]\\r\\n\\r\\nMost of the people of God are the laity, a term derived from Greek ϫ?? ɚ? (Laos Theou), meaning \\"people of God\\". All Christian faithful have the right and duty to bring the gospel message increasingly to \\"all people in every age and every land\\".[82]  They all have a share in the Church's mission and have the right to undertake apostolic activity according to their own state and condition.[83]\\r\\n\\r\\nLay ministry can take the form of exercising the priesthood of all the baptized, and more specifically undertaking the work of catechists. serving the Church pastorally, administratively, and in other ways, including the liturgical services as acolytes, lectors, cantors, and the like,[84][85] initiation sponsors, pastoral care ministers, and members of parish and diocesan consultative bodies.[85][86]\\r\\n\\r\\nSome lay Catholics carry out full-time professional and vocational service in the name of the Church, rather than in a secular calling. Though the phenomenon is widespread in North America and much of Europe, the organization and definition of the ministry is left to national bishops conferences. The United States Conference of Catholic Bishops has adopted the term lay ecclesial ministry for these individuals, as intentionally distinct from the general apostolate or ministry of the laity described above.[87]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe consultative leadership of the church, in both the diocese and the parish, usually comprises a Pastoral Council[88][89] and a Finance Council,[90][91] as well as several Commissions usually focusing on major aspects of the church's life and mission, such as Faith Formation or Christian Education, Liturgy, Social Justice, Ecumenism, or Stewardship.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nReligiouswho can be either lay people or clergyare members of religious institutes, societies in which the members take public vows and live a fraternal life in common.[92] This is a form of consecrated life distinct from other forms, such as that of secular institutes.[93] It is distinct also from forms that do not involve membership of an institute, such as that of consecrated hermits,[94] that of consecrated virgins,[95] and other forms whose approval is reserved to the Holy See.[96]\\r\\n\\r\\nReligious institutes have historically been subdivided into the categories of orders and congregations.","input":"What is the hierarchy in the roman catholic church?"},{"output":"is a fortified wine made from white grapes that are grown near the city of Jerez de la Frontera in Andalusia, Spain.","context":"Sherry (English: /???ri/, Spanish: Jerez [xe??eĲ] or [xe??es]) is a fortified wine made from white grapes that are grown near the city of Jerez de la Frontera in Andalusia, Spain. Sherry is produced in a variety of styles made primarily from the Palomino grape, ranging from light versions similar to white table wines, such as Manzanilla and Fino, to darker and heavier versions that have been allowed to oxidise as they age in barrel, such as Amontillado and Oloroso. Sweet dessert wines are also made from Pedro Ximenez or Moscatel grapes, and are sometimes blended with Palomino-based Sherries.\\r\\nThe word \\"Sherry\\" is an anglicisation of Xeres (Jerez). Sherry was previously known as sack, from the Spanish saca, meaning \\"extraction\\" from the solera. In Europe, \\"Sherry\\" has protected designation of origin status, and under Spanish law, all wine labelled as \\"Sherry\\" must legally[1] come from the Sherry Triangle, an area in the province of Cdiz between Jerez de la Frontera, Sanl~car de Barrameda, and El Puerto de Santa Mara. In 1933 the Jerez Denominaci܇n de Origen was the first Spanish denominaci܇n to be officially recognised in this way, officially named D.O. Jerez-Xeres-Sherry and sharing the same governing council as D.O. Manzanilla Sanl~car de Barrameda.[2]\\r\\nAfter fermentation is complete, the base wines are fortified with grape spirit in order to increase their final alcohol content.[3] Wines classified as suitable for aging as Fino and Manzanilla are fortified until they reach a total alcohol content of 15.5 per cent by volume. As they age in barrel, they develop a layer of flora yeast-like growth that helps protect the wine from excessive oxidation. Those wines that are classified to undergo aging as Oloroso are fortified to reach an alcohol content of at least 17 per cent. They do not develop flor and so oxidise slightly as they age, giving them a darker colour. Because the fortification takes place after fermentation, most sherries are initially dry, with any sweetness being added later. In contrast, port wine is fortified halfway through its fermentation, which stops the process so that not all of the sugar is turned into alcohol.\\r\\nWines from different years are aged and blended using a solera system before bottling, so that bottles of sherry will not usually carry a specific vintage year and can contain a small proportion of very old wine. Sherry is regarded by many wine writers[4] as \\"underappreciated\\"[5] and a \\"neglected wine treasure\\".[6]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nJerez has been a centre of viniculture since wine-making was introduced to Spain by the Phoenicians in 1100 BC. The practice was carried on by the Romans when they took control of Iberia around 200 BC. The Moors conquered the region in AD 711 and introduced distillation, which led to the development of brandy and fortified wine.\\r\\nDuring the Moorish period, the town was called Sherish (a transliteration of the Arabic ????), from which both Sherry and Jerez are derived. Wines similar in style to Sherry have traditionally been made in the city of Shiraz in mid-southern Iran, but it is thought unlikely that the name derives from there.[7][8]\\r\\nWine production continued through five centuries of Arab Empire's rule. In 966, Al-Hakam II, the second Caliph of C܇rdoba, ordered the destruction of the vineyards, but the inhabitants of Jerez appealed on the grounds that the vineyards also produced raisins to feed the empire's soldiers, and the Caliph spared two-thirds of the vineyards.\\r\\nIn 1264 Alfonso X of Castile took the city. From this point on, the production of sherry and its export throughout Europe increased significantly. By the end of the 16th century, sherry had a reputation in Europe as the world's finest wine.\\r\\nChristopher Columbus brought sherry on his voyage to the New World and when Ferdinand Magellan prepared to sail around the world in 1519, he spent more on sherry than on weapons.\\r\\nSherry became very popular in Great Britain, especially after Francis Drake sacked Cadiz in 1587. At that time Cadiz was one of the most important Spanish seaports, and Spain was preparing an armada there to invade England. Among the spoils Drake brought back after destroying the fleet were 2,900 barrels of sherry that had been waiting to be loaded aboard Spanish ships.[9] This helped to popularize Sherry in the British Isles.[10]\\r\\nBecause sherry was a major wine export to the United Kingdom, many English companies and styles developed. Many of the Jerez cellars were founded by British families.\\r\\nIn 1894 the Jerez region was devastated by the insect phylloxera. Whereas larger vineyards were replanted with resistant vines, most smaller producers were unable to fight the infestation and abandoned their vineyards entirely.[11]\\r\\nOn 12 April 2012, the rules applicable to the sweet and fortified Denominations of Origen Montilla-Moriles and Jerez-Xrs-Sherry [15] were changed to prohibit sweet Oloroso and sweet Amontillado banning terms such as \\"Rich Oloroso\\", \\"Sweet Oloroso\\" and \\"Oloroso Dulce\\". Such wines are to be labelled as \\"Cream Sherry: Blend of Oloroso / Amontillado\\" or suchlike. The classification by sweetness is:\\r\\nSpanish producers have registered the names Jerez / Xrs / Sherry and will prosecute producers of similar fortified wines from other places using the same name. In 1933, Article 34 of the Spanish Estatuto del Vino (Wine Law) established the boundaries of sherry production as the first Spanish wine denominaci܇n. Today, sherry's official status is further recognized by wider EU legislation. Sherry must come from the triangular area of the province of Cdiz between Jerez de la Frontera, Sanl~car de Barrameda, and El Puerto de Santa Mara. However the name \\"sherry\\" is used as a semi-generic in the United States where it must be labeled with a region of origin such as American sherry or California sherry. However such wines cannot be exported to the EU. Australian wine makers now use the term Apera instead of Sherry,[16] whilst Australian consumers still use the term sherry. As of December 31, 2013 the term Apera is now also used by Canadian winemakers.\\r\\nThe Jerez district has a predictable climate, with approximately 70 days of rainfall and almost 300 days of sun per year. The rain mostly falls between the months of October and May, averaging 600 l/m2. The summer is dry and hot, with temperatures as high as 40?C (104?F), but winds from the ocean bring moisture to the vineyards in the early morning and the clays in the soil retain water below the surface. The average temperature across the year is approximately 18?C (64?F).\\r\\nThere are three types of soil in the Jerez district for growing the grapes for Sherry:[17]\\r\\nThe albariza soil is the best for growing the Palomino grape, and by law 40 percent of the grapes making up a sherry must come from albariza soil. The barros and arenas soil are mostly used for Pedro Ximnez and Moscatel grapes.\\r\\nThe benefits of the albariza soil is that it can reflect sunlight back up to the vine, aiding it in photosynthesis. The nature of the soil is very absorbent and compact so that it can retain and maximize the use of the little rainfall that the Jerez region receives.[17]\\r\\nBefore the phylloxera infestation in 1894, there were estimated to be over one hundred varieties of grape used in Spain for the production of sherry,[18] but now there are only three white grapes grown for sherry-making:\\r\\nSherry-style wines made in other countries often use other grape varieties.\\r\\nThe Palomino grapes are harvested in early September, and pressed lightly to extract the must. The must from the first pressing, the primera yema, is used to produce Fino and Manzanilla and the must from the second pressing, the segunda yema will be used for Oloroso; the product of additional pressings is used for lesser wines, distillation and vinegar. The must is then fermented in stainless steel vats until the end of November, producing a dry white wine with 11ÿ12 per cent alcohol content. Previously, the fermentation and initial aging was done in wood; now it is almost exclusively done in stainless steel, with the exception of one or two high-end wines.\\r\\nImmediately after fermentation, the wine is sampled and the first classification is performed. The casks are marked with the following symbols according to the potential of the wine:\\r\\nThe sherry is fortified using destilado, made by distilling wine, usually from La Mancha. The distilled spirit is first mixed with mature sherry to make a 50/50 blend known as mitad y mitad (half and half), and then the mitad y mitad is mixed with the younger sherry to the proper proportions. This two-stage procedure is performed so the strong alcohol will not shock the young sherry and spoil it.\\r\\nThe fortified wine is stored in 500-litre casks that are made of North American oak, which is more porous than French or Spanish oak. The casks, or butts, are filled five-sixths full, leaving \\"the space of two fists\\" empty at the top to allow flor to develop on top of the wine.\\r\\nSherry is then aged in the solera system where new wine is put into wine barrels at the beginning of a series of three to nine barrels. Periodically, a portion of the wine in a barrel is moved into the next barrel down, using tools called the canoa (canoe) and rociador (sprinkler) to move the wine gently and avoid damaging the layer of flor in each barrel. At the end of the series only a portion of the final barrel is bottled and sold. Depending on the type of wine, the portion moved may be between five and thirty percent of each barrel. This process is called \\"running the scales\\" because each barrel in the series is called a scale. Thus, the age of the youngest wine going in the bottle is determined by the number of barrels in the series, and every bottle also contains some much older wine than is stated. Sherry is aged in the solera for a minimum of three years. A large solera system may consist of scales that require more than one barrel to hold. The word 'solera' means 'on the ground'; this refers to the stacking system that was, and sometimes still is, used, with the youngest barrels at the top and the oldest scale, also somewhat ambiguously called 'the solera', at the bottom. Of late, Sherry producers and marketers have been bottling their wines en rama, with only a light filtration, and often a selection of a favored barrel from a larger solera. Such sherries can be considerably more complex in flavor than the standard bottlings, and, according to many, are worth seeking out.[19] In order to allow the sale of reliable average age-dated sherries, the regulating council has set up a system that accurately tracks the average age of the wines as they move through their solera. Two average age-dated categories are recognized: VOS ('Vinum Optimum Signatum'-20 years old average age minimum) and VORS ('Vinum Optimum Rare Signatum'-30 years old average age minimum).[20]\\r\\nSherry-seasoned casks are sold to the Scotch whisky industry for use in aging whisky Other spirits and beverages may also be aged in used sherry casks. Contrary to what most people think, these sherry-seasoned casks are specifically prepared for the whisky industry, they are not the same as the old (and largely inactive) butts used for the maturation of sherry.[21]\\r\\nOnce bottled, sherry does not generally benefit from further aging and may be consumed immediately, though the sherries that have been aged oxidatively may be stored for years without noticeable loss in flavour. Bottles should be stored upright to minimize the wine's exposed surface area. As with other wines, Sherry should be stored in a cool, dark place. The best fino sherries which have been aged for longer than normal prior to bottling, such as Manzanilla Pasada, will continue to develop in the bottle for some years.\\r\\nFino and Manzanilla are the most fragile types of Sherry and should usually be drunk soon after opening in the same way as unfortified wines. In Spain, Finos are often sold in half bottles, with any remaining wine being thrown out if it is not drunk the same day it is opened.[22] Amontillados and Olorosos will keep for longer, while sweeter versions such as PX, and blended cream Sherries, are able to last several weeks or even months after opening, since the sugar content acts as a preservative.\\r\\nSherry is traditionally drunk from a copita (also referred to as a catavino, a special tulip-shaped sherry glass. Sampling wine directly from a sherry butt may be performed with characteristic flourish by a venenciador, named after the special cup (the venencia) traditionally made of silver and fastened to a long whale whisker handle. The cup, narrow enough to pass though the bung hole, withdraws a measure of sherry which is then ceremoniously poured from head height into a copita held in the other hand.[23]\\r\\nVarious types are often mixed with lemonade (and usually ice). This long drink is now called Rebujito. Its typically ice-free equivalent in the Victorian age was the sherry-cobbler.[24]\\r\\nMany literary figures have written about sherry, including William Shakespeare, Benito Prez Gald܇s,[25] and Edgar Allan Poe (in his story \\"The Cask of Amontillado\\").\\r\\nIndian cricketer and politician Navjot Singh Sidhu's nickname is Sherry, given to him by his father.\\r\\nEarly in the film Diamonds Are Forever, James Bond samples a glass of sherry and, despite M's protest that sherry has no vintage year, he correctly guesses the vintage of the base wine: \\"1851. Unmistakable.\\"\\r\\nFrasier and Niles, the brothers Crane, frequently consume sherry on the TV sitcom Frasier.[26]\\r\\nSherry, and Amontillado specifically, is heavily featured in season 3, episode 10 of Monty Python's Flying Circus.\\r\\nSherry is frequently mentioned in the novel Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy, and plays an important role in the narrative: The spy Jim Prideaux is alerted to the presence of a double agent within his division when Russian KGB agents are able to correctly identify the brand of sherry that was consumed during a secret meeting of MI6 personnel.\\r\\nIn Arrietty, bottles of wine can be seen in Aunt Jessica's pantry.

There have been numerous theories of gravitation since ancient times.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the 4th century BC, the Greek philosopher Aristotle believed that there is no effect or motion without a cause. The cause of the downward motion of heavy bodies, such as the element earth, was related to their nature, which caused them to move downward toward the center of the universe, which was their natural place. Conversely, light bodies such as the element fire, move by their nature upward toward the inner surface of the sphere of the Moon. Thus in Aristotle's system heavy bodies are not attracted to the Earth by an external force of gravity, but tend toward the center of the universe because of an inner gravitas or heaviness.[1][2]\\r\\nIn Book VII of his De Architectura, the Roman engineer and architect Vitruvius contends that gravity is not dependent on a substance's \\"weight\\" but rather on its \\"nature\\" (cf. specific gravity).\\r\\nIf the quicksilver is poured into a vessel, and a stone weighing one hundred pounds is laid upon it, the stone swims on the surface, and cannot depress the liquid, nor break through, nor separate it. If we remove the hundred pound weight, and put on a scruple of gold, it will not swim, but will sink to the bottom of its own accord. Hence, it is undeniable that the gravity of a substance depends not on the amount of its weight, but on its nature.[3]\\r\\nAryabhata first identified the force to explain why objects do not fall when the earth rotates,and developed a geocentric solar system of gravitation, with an eccentric elliptical model of the planets, where the planets spin on their axes and follow elliptical orbits,the Sun and the moon revolving around the earth in epicycles. Indian astronomer and mathematician Brahmagupta described gravity as an attractive force and used the term \\"gurutvkar?a?\\" for gravity.[4][5][6]\\r\\nAl Hamdnؐ and Al Biruni quote Brahmagupta saying\\r\\n\\"Disregarding this, we say that the earth on all its sides is the same; all people on the earth stand upright, and all heavy things fall down to the earth by a law of nature, for it is the nature of the earth to attract and to keep things, as it is the nature of water to flow, that of fire to burn, and that of the wind to set in motion. If a thing wants to go deeper down than the earth, let it try. The earth is the only low thing, and seeds always return to it, in whatever direction you may throw them away, and never rise upwards from the earth.\\"[7][8]\\r\\nDuring the 17th century, Galileo found that, counter to Aristotle's teachings, all objects accelerated equally when falling.\\r\\nIn the late 17th century, as a result of Robert Hooke's suggestion that there is a gravitational force which depends on the inverse square of the distance,[9] Isaac Newton was able to mathematically derive Kepler's three kinematic laws of planetary motion, including the elliptical orbits for the six then known planets and the Moon:\\r\\n\\"I deduced that the forces which keep the planets in their orbs must be reciprocally as the squares of their distances from the centres about which they revolve, and thereby compared the force requisite to keep the moon in her orb with the force of gravity at the surface of the earth and found them to answer pretty nearly.\\"\\r\\nSo Newton's original formula was:\\r\\nwhere the symbol \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nQ\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n{\\\\displaystyle \\\\propto }\\r\\n\\r\\n means \\"is proportional to\\".\\r\\nTo make this into an equal-sided formula or equation, there needed to be a multiplying factor or constant that would give the correct force of gravity no matter the value of the masses or distance between them. This gravitational constant was first measured in 1797 by Henry Cavendish.\\r\\nIn 1907 Albert Einstein, in what was described by him as \\"the happiest thought of my life\\", realized that an observer who is falling from the roof of a house experiences no gravitational field. In other words, gravitation was exactly equivalent to acceleration. Between 1911 and 1915 this idea, initially stated as the equivalence principle, was formally developed into Einstein's theory of general relativity.\\r\\nIn 1687, English mathematician Sir Isaac Newton published Principia, which hypothesizes the inverse-square law of universal gravitation. In his own words, \\"I deduced that the forces which keep the planets in their orbs must be reciprocally as the squares of their distances from the centers about which they revolve; and thereby compared the force requisite to keep the Moon in her orb with the force of gravity at the surface of the Earth; and found them answer pretty nearly.\\"\\r\\nNewton's theory enjoyed its greatest success when it was used to predict the existence of Neptune based on motions of Uranus that could not be accounted by the actions of the other planets. Calculations by John Couch Adams and Urbain Le Verrier both predicted the general position of the planet, and Le Verrier's calculations are what led Johann Gottfried Galle to the discovery of Neptune.\\r\\nYears later, it was another discrepancy in a planet's orbit that showed Newton's theory to be inaccurate. By the end of the 19th century, it was known that the orbit of Mercury could not be accounted for entirely under Newtonian gravity, and all searches for another perturbing body (such as a planet orbiting the Sun even closer than Mercury) have been fruitless. This issue was resolved in 1915 by Albert Einstein's new general theory of relativity, which accounted for the discrepancy in Mercury's orbit.\\r\\nPaul Dirac developed the hypothesis that gravitation should have slowly and steadily decreased over the course of the history of the universe.[10]\\r\\nAlthough Newton's theory has been superseded, most modern non-relativistic gravitational calculations still use it because it is much easier to work with and is sufficiently accurate for most applications.\\r\\nThe mechanical theories or explanations of the gravitation are attempts to explain the law of gravity by aid of basic mechanical processes, such as pushes, and without the use of any action at a distance. These theories were developed from the 16th until the 19th century in connection with the aether theories.[11]\\r\\nRen Descartes (1644) and Christiaan Huygens (1690) used vortices to explain gravitation. Robert Hooke (1671) and James Challis (1869) assumed, that every body emits waves which lead to an attraction of other bodies. Nicolas Fatio de Duillier (1690) and Georges-Louis Le Sage (1748) proposed a corpuscular model, using some sort of screening or shadowing mechanism. Later a similar model was created by Hendrik Lorentz, who used electromagnetic radiation instead of the corpuscles. Isaac Newton (1675) and Bernhard Riemann (1853) argued that aether streams carry all bodies to each other. Newton (1717) and Leonhard Euler (1760) proposed a model, in which the aether loses density near the masses, leading to a net force directing to the bodies. Lord Kelvin (1871) proposed that every body pulsates, which might be an explanation of gravitation and the electric charges.\\r\\nHowever, those models were overthrown because most of them lead to an unacceptable amount of drag, which is not observed. Other models are violating the energy conservation law and are incompatible with modern thermodynamics.[12]\\r\\nIn general relativity, the effects of gravitation are ascribed to spacetime curvature instead of to a force. The starting point for general relativity is the equivalence principle, which equates free fall with inertial motion. The issue that this creates is that free-falling objects can accelerate with respect to each other. In Newtonian physics, no such acceleration can occur unless at least one of the objects is being operated on by a force (and therefore is not moving inertially).\\r\\nTo deal with this difficulty, Einstein proposed that spacetime is curved by matter, and that free-falling objects are moving along locally straight paths in curved spacetime. (This type of path is called a geodesic). More specifically, Einstein and Hilbert discovered the field equations of general relativity, which relate the presence of matter and the curvature of spacetime and are named after Einstein. The Einstein field equations are a set of 10 simultaneous, non-linear, differential equations. The solutions of the field equations are the components of the metric tensor of spacetime. A metric tensor describes the geometry of spacetime. The geodesic paths for a spacetime are calculated from the metric tensor.\\r\\nNotable solutions of the Einstein field equations include:\\r\\nGeneral relativity has enjoyed much success because of the way its predictions of phenomena which are not called for by the older theory of gravity have been regularly confirmed. For example:\\r\\nSeveral decades after the discovery of general relativity it was realized that it cannot be the complete theory of gravity because it is incompatible with quantum mechanics.[13] Later it was understood that it is possible to describe gravity in the framework of quantum field theory like the other fundamental forces. In this framework the attractive force of gravity arises due to exchange of virtual gravitons, in the same way as the electromagnetic force arises from exchange of virtual photons.[14][15] This reproduces general relativity in the classical limit, but only at the linearized level and postulating that the conditions for the applicability of Ehrenfest theorem holds, which is not always the case. Besides, this approach fails at short distances of the order of the Planck length.[13]\\r\\nIt is notable that in general relativity, gravitational radiation, which under the rules of quantum mechanics must be composed of gravitons, is created only in situations where the curvature of spacetime is oscillating, such as is the case with co-orbiting objects. The amount of gravitational radiation emitted by the solar system is far too small to measure.\\r\\nHowever, gravitational radiation has been observed both indirectly, as an energy loss over time in binary pulsar systems such as PSR 1913+16, and directly by the LIGO gravitational wave observatory, whose first detection (named GW150914) occurred on 14 September 2015[16] and matched theoretical predictions of signals due to the inward spiral and merger of a pair of black holes. It is believed that neutron star mergers (since detected in 2017)[17] and black hole formation may also create detectable amounts of gravitational radiation.","input":"Who came up with the theory of gravity?"},{"output":"Sucre","context":"","input":"What is the constitutional capital city of bolivia called?"},{"output":"31 August 1962","context":"","input":"When did trinidad and tobago gain its independence?"},{"output":"July 16, 1945","context":"Trinity was the code name of the first detonation of a nuclear weapon. It was conducted by the United States Army at 5:29 a.m. on July 16, 1945, as part of the Manhattan Project. The test was conducted in the Jornada del Muerto desert about 35 miles (56?km) southeast of Socorro, New Mexico, on what was then the USAAF Alamogordo Bombing and Gunnery Range (now part of White Sands Missile Range). The only structures originally in the vicinity were the McDonald Ranch House and its ancillary buildings, which scientists used as a laboratory for testing bomb components. A base camp was constructed, and there were 425 people present on the weekend of the test.\\r\\nThe code name \\"Trinity\\" was assigned by J. Robert Oppenheimer, the director of the Los Alamos Laboratory, inspired by the poetry of John Donne. The test was of an implosion-design plutonium device, informally nicknamed \\"The Gadget\\", of the same design as the Fat Man bomb later detonated over Nagasaki, Japan, on August 9, 1945. The complexity of the design required a major effort from the Los Alamos Laboratory, and concerns about whether it would work led to a decision to conduct the first nuclear test. The test was planned and directed by Kenneth Bainbridge.\\r\\nFears of a fizzle led to the construction of a steel containment vessel called Jumbo that could contain the plutonium, allowing it to be recovered, but Jumbo was not used. A rehearsal was held on May 7, 1945, in which 108 short tons (96 long tons; 98?t) of high explosive spiked with radioactive isotopes were detonated. The Gadget's detonation released the explosive energy of about 22 kilotons of TNT (92?TJ). Observers included Vannevar Bush, James Chadwick, James Conant, Thomas Farrell, Enrico Fermi, Richard Feynman, Leslie Groves, Robert Oppenheimer, Geoffrey Taylor, and Richard Tolman.\\r\\nThe test site was declared a National Historic Landmark district in 1965, and listed on the National Register of Historic Places the following year.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe creation of nuclear weapons arose from scientific and political developments of the 1930s. The decade saw many new discoveries about the nature of atoms, including the existence of nuclear fission. The concurrent rise of fascist governments in Europe led to a fear of a German nuclear weapon project, especially among scientists who were refugees from Nazi Germany and other fascist countries. When their calculations showed that nuclear weapons were theoretically feasible, the British and United States governments supported an all-out effort to build them.[3]\\r\\nThese efforts were transferred to the authority of the U.S. Army in June 1942, and became the Manhattan Project.[4] Brigadier General Leslie R. Groves, Jr., was appointed its director in September 1942.[5] The weapons development portion of this project was located at the Los Alamos Laboratory in northern New Mexico, under the directorship of physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer. The University of Chicago, Columbia University and the Radiation Laboratory at the University of California, Berkeley conducted other development work.[6]\\r\\nProduction of the fissile isotopes uranium-235 and plutonium-239 were enormous undertakings given the technology of the 1940s, and accounted for 80% of the total costs of the project. Uranium enrichment was carried out at the Clinton Engineer Works near Oak Ridge, Tennessee.[7] Theoretically, enriching uranium was feasible through pre-existing techniques, but it proved difficult to scale to industrial levels and was extremely costly. Only 0.71 percent of natural uranium was uranium-235, and it was estimated that it would take 27,000 years to produce a gram of uranium with mass spectrometers, but kilogram amounts were required.[8]\\r\\nPlutonium is a synthetic element with complicated physical, chemical and metallurgical properties. It is not found in nature in appreciable quantities. Until mid-1944, the only plutonium that had been isolated had been produced in cyclotrons in microgram amounts, whereas weapons required kilograms.[9] In April 1944, physicist Emilio Segr, the head of the Los Alamos Laboratory's P-5 (Radioactivity) Group,[10] received the first sample of reactor-bred plutonium from the X-10 Graphite Reactor at Oak Ridge. He discovered that, in addition to the plutonium-239 isotope, it also contained significant amounts of plutonium-240.[11] The Manhattan Project produced plutonium in nuclear reactors at the Hanford Engineer Works near Hanford, Washington.[7]\\r\\nThe longer the plutonium remained irradiated inside a reactornecessary for high yields of the metalthe greater the content of the plutonium-240 isotope, which undergoes spontaneous fission at thousands of times the rate of plutonium-239. The extra neutrons it released meant that there was an unacceptably high probability that plutonium in a gun-type fission weapon would detonate too soon after a critical mass was formed, producing a \\"fizzle\\"a nuclear explosion many times smaller than a full explosion.[11] This meant that the Thin Man bomb design that the laboratory had developed would not work properly.[12]\\r\\nThe Laboratory turned to an alternative, albeit more technically difficult, design, an implosion-type nuclear weapon. In September 1943, mathematician John von Neumann had proposed a design in which a fissile core would be surrounded by two different high explosives that produced shock waves of different speeds. Alternating the faster- and slower-burning explosives in a carefully calculated configuration would produce a compressive wave upon their simultaneous detonation. This so-called \\"explosive lens\\" focused the shock waves inward with enough force to rapidly compress the plutonium core to several times its original density. This reduced the size of a critical mass, making it supercritical. It also activated a small neutron source at the center of the core, which assured that the chain reaction began in earnest at the right moment. Such a complicated process required research and experimentation in engineering and hydrodynamics before a practical design could be developed.[13] The entire Los Alamos Laboratory was reorganized in August 1944 to focus on design of a workable implosion bomb.[14]\\r\\nThe idea of testing the implosion device was brought up in discussions at Los Alamos in January 1944, and attracted enough support for Oppenheimer to approach Groves. Groves gave approval, but he had concerns. The Manhattan Project had spent a great deal of money and effort to produce the plutonium and he wanted to know whether there would be a way to recover it. The Laboratory's Governing Board then directed Norman Ramsey to investigate how this could be done. In February 1944 Ramsey proposed a small-scale test in which the explosion was limited in size by reducing the number of generations of chain reactions, and that it take place inside a sealed containment vessel from which the plutonium could be recovered.[15]\\r\\nThe means of generating such a controlled reaction were uncertain, and the data obtained would not be as useful as that from a full-scale explosion.[15] Oppenheimer argued that the \\"implosion gadget must be tested in a range where the energy release is comparable with that contemplated for final use.\\"[16] In March 1944, he obtained Groves's tentative approval for testing a full-scale explosion inside a containment vessel, although Groves was still worried about how he would explain the loss of a billion dollars worth of plutonium to a Senate Committee in the event of a failure.[15]\\r\\nThe exact origin of the code name \\"Trinity\\" for the test is unknown, but it is often attributed to Oppenheimer as a reference to the poetry of John Donne, which in turn references the Christian notion of the Trinity (three-fold nature of God). In 1962, Groves wrote to Oppenheimer about the origin of the name, asking if he had chosen it because it was a name common to rivers and peaks in the West and would not attract attention, and elicited this reply:\\r\\nI did suggest it, but not on that ground?... Why I chose the name is not clear, but I know what thoughts were in my mind. There is a poem of John Donne, written just before his death, which I know and love. From it a quotation:\\r\\nThat still does not make a Trinity, but in another, better known devotional poem Donne opens,\\r\\nIn March 1944, planning for the test was assigned to Kenneth Bainbridge, a professor of physics at Harvard University, working under explosives expert George Kistiakowsky. Bainbridge's group was known as the E-9 (Explosives Development) Group.[20] Stanley Kershaw, formerly from the National Safety Council, was made responsible for safety.[20] Captain Samuel P. Davalos, the assistant post engineer at Los Alamos, was placed in charge of construction.[21] First Lieutenant Harold C. Bush became commander of the Base Camp at Trinity.[22] Scientists William Penney, Victor Weisskopf and Philip Moon were consultants. Eventually seven subgroups were formed:[23]\\r\\nThe E-9 group was renamed the X-2 (Development, Engineering and Tests) Group in the August 1944 reorganization.[20]\\r\\nSafety and security required a remote, isolated and unpopulated area. The scientists also wanted a flat area to minimize secondary effects of the blast, and with little wind to spread radioactive fallout. Eight candidate sites were considered: the Tularosa Valley; the Jornada del Muerto Valley; the area southwest of Cuba, New Mexico, and north of Thoreau; and the lava flats of the El Malpais National Monument, all in New Mexico; the San Luis Valley near the Great Sand Dunes National Monument in Colorado; the Desert Training Area and San Nicolas Island in Southern California; and the sand bars of Padre Island, Texas.[24]\\r\\nThe sites were surveyed by car and by air by Bainbridge, R. W. Henderson, Major W. A. Stevens and Major Peer de Silva. The site finally chosen, after consulting with Major General Uzal Ent, the commander of the Second Air Force on September 7, 1944,[24] lay at the northern end of the Alamogordo Bombing Range, in Socorro County near the towns of Carrizozo and San Antonio.(334038N 1062831W? / ?33.6773N 106.4754W? / 33.6773; -106.4754).[25]\\r\\nThe only structures in the vicinity were the McDonald Ranch House and its ancillary buildings, about 2 miles (3.2?km) to the southeast.[26] Like the rest of the Alamogordo Bombing Range, it had been acquired by the government in 1942. The patented land had been condemned and grazing rights suspended.[27][28] Scientists used this as a laboratory for testing bomb components.[26] Bainbridge and Davalos drew up plans for a base camp with accommodation and facilities for 160 personnel, along with the technical infrastructure to support the test. A construction firm from Lubbock, Texas built the barracks, officers' quarters, mess hall and other basic facilities.[21] The requirements expanded and, by July 1945, 250 people worked at the Trinity test site. On the weekend of the test, there were 425 present.[29]\\r\\nLieutenant Bush's twelve-man military police unit arrived at the site from Los Alamos on December 30, 1944. This unit established initial security checkpoints and horse patrols. The distances around the site proved too great for the horses, so they resorted to using jeeps and trucks for transportation. The horses were used for playing polo.[24][30] Maintenance of morale among men working long hours under harsh conditions along with dangerous reptiles and insects was a challenge. Bush strove to improve the food and accommodation, and to provide organized games and nightly movies.[31]\\r\\nThroughout 1945, other personnel arrived at the Trinity Site to help prepare for the bomb test. They tried to use water out of the ranch wells, but found the water so alkaline they could not drink it. They were forced to use U.S. Navy saltwater soap and hauled drinking water in from the firehouse in Socorro. Gasoline and diesel were purchased from the Standard Oil plant there.[30] Military and civilian construction personnel built warehouses, workshops, a magazine and commissary. The railroad siding at Pope, New Mexico, was upgraded by adding an unloading platform. Roads were built, and 200 miles (320?km) of telephone wire was strung. Electricity was supplied by portable generators.[32][33]\\r\\nDue to its proximity to the bombing range, the base camp was accidentally bombed twice in May. When the lead plane on a practice night raid accidentally knocked out the generator or otherwise doused the lights illuminating their target, they went in search of the lights, and since they had not been informed of the presence of the Trinity base camp, and it was lit, bombed it instead. The accidental bombing damaged the stables and the carpentry shop, and a small fire resulted.[34]\\r\\nResponsibility for the design of a containment vessel for an unsuccessful explosion, known as \\"Jumbo\\", was assigned to Robert W. Henderson and Roy W. Carlson of the Los Alamos Laboratory's X-2A Section. The bomb would be placed into the heart of Jumbo, and if the bomb's detonation was unsuccessful, the outer walls of Jumbo would not be breached, making it possible to recover the bomb's plutonium. Hans Bethe, Victor Weisskopf, and Joseph O. Hirschfelder, made the initial calculations, followed by a more detailed analysis by Henderson and Carlson.[22] They drew up specifications for a steel sphere 13 to 15 feet (3.96 to 4.57?m) in diameter, weighing 150 short tons (130 long tons; 140?t) and capable of handling a pressure of 50,000 pounds per square inch (340,000?kPa). After consulting with the steel companies and the railroads, Carlson produced a scaled-back cylindrical design that would be much easier to manufacture. Carlson identified a company that normally made boilers for the Navy, Babcock & Wilcox; they had made something similar and were willing to attempt its manufacture.[35]\\r\\nAs delivered in May 1945,[36] Jumbo was 10 feet (3.05?m) in diameter and 25 feet (7.62?m) long with walls 14 inches (356?mm) thick, and weighed 214 short tons (191 long tons; 194?t).[37][38] A special train brought it from Barberton, Ohio, to the siding at Pope, where it was loaded on a large trailer and towed 25 miles (40?km) across the desert by crawler tractors.[39] At the time, it was the heaviest item ever shipped by rail.[38]\\r\\nFor many of the Los Alamos scientists, Jumbo was \\"the physical manifestation of the lowest point in the Laboratory's hopes for the success of an implosion bomb.\\"[36] By the time it arrived, the reactors at Hanford produced plutonium in quantity, and Oppenheimer was confident that there would be enough for a second test.[35] The use of Jumbo would interfere with the gathering of data on the explosion, the primary objective of the test.[39] An explosion of more than 500 tons of TNT (2,100?GJ) would vaporize the steel and make it hard to measure the thermal effects. Even 100 tons of TNT (420?GJ) would send fragments flying, presenting a hazard to personnel and measuring equipment.[40] It was therefore decided not to use it.[39] Instead, it was hoisted up a steel tower 800 yards (732?m) from the explosion, where it could be used for a subsequent test.[35] In the end, Jumbo survived the explosion, although its tower did not.[37]\\r\\nThe development team also considered other methods of recovering active material in the event of a dud explosion. One idea was to cover it with a cone of sand. Another was to suspend the bomb in a tank of water. As with Jumbo, it was decided not to proceed with these means of containment either. The CM-10 (Chemistry and Metallurgy) group at Los Alamos also studied how the active material could be chemically recovered after a contained or failed explosion.[40]\\r\\nBecause there would be only one chance to carry out the test correctly, Bainbridge decided that a rehearsal should be carried out to allow the plans and procedures to be verified, and the instrumentation to be tested and calibrated. Oppenheimer was initially skeptical, but gave permission, and later agreed that it contributed to the success of the Trinity test.[33]\\r\\nA 20-foot (6.1?m) high wooden platform was constructed 800 yards (732?m) to the south-east of Trinity ground zero (334016N 1062820W? / ?33.67123N 106.47229W? / 33.67123; -106.47229) and 108 long tons (110?t) of TNT were stacked on top of it. Kistiakowsky assured Bainbridge that the explosives used were not susceptible to shock. This was proven correct when some boxes fell off the elevator lifting them up to the platform. Flexible tubing was threaded through the pile of boxes of explosives. A radioactive slug from Hanford with 1,000 curies (37?TBq) of beta ray activity and 400 curies (15?TBq) of gamma ray activity was dissolved, and Hempelmann poured it into the tubing.[33][41][42]\\r\\nThe test was scheduled for May 5, but was postponed for two days to allow for more equipment to be installed. Requests for further postponements had to be refused because they would have impacted the schedule for the main test. The detonation time was set for 04:00 Mountain War Time (MWT), on May 7, but there was a 37-minute delay to allow the observation plane,[43] a Boeing B-29 Superfortress from the 216th Army Air Forces Base Unit flown by Major Clyde \\"Stan\\" Shields,[44] to get into position.[43]\\r\\nThe fireball of the conventional explosion was visible from Alamogordo Army Air Field 60 miles (97?km) away, but there was little shock at the base camp 10 miles (16?km) away.[43] Shields thought that the explosion looked \\"beautiful\\", but it was hardly felt at 15,000 feet (4,572?m).[44] Herbert L. Anderson practiced using a converted M4 Sherman tank lined with lead to approach the 5-foot (1.52?m) deep and 30-foot (9.14?m) wide blast crater and take a sample of dirt, although the radioactivity was low enough to allow several hours of unprotected exposure. An electrical signal of unknown origin caused the explosion to go off 0.25 seconds early, ruining experiments that required split-second timing. The piezoelectric gauges developed by Anderson's team correctly indicated an explosion of 108 tons of TNT (450?GJ), but Luis Alvarez and Waldman's airborne condenser gauges were far less accurate.[41][45]\\r\\nIn addition to uncovering scientific and technological issues, the rehearsal test revealed practical concerns as well. Over 100 vehicles were used for the rehearsal test but it was realized more would be required for the main test, and they would need better roads and repair facilities. More radios were required, and more telephone lines, as the telephone system had become overloaded. Lines needed to be buried to prevent damage by vehicles. A teletype was installed to allow better communication with Los Alamos. A town hall was built to allow for large conferences and briefings, and the mess hall had to be upgraded. Because dust thrown up by vehicles interfered with some of the instrumentation, 20 miles (32?km) of road was sealed at a cost of $5,000 per mile ($3,100/km).[45][33]\\r\\nThe term \\"Gadget\\" was a laboratory euphemism for a bomb,[46] from which the laboratory's weapon physics division, \\"G Division\\", took its name in August 1944.[47] At that time it did not refer specifically to the Trinity Test device as it had yet to be developed,[48] but once it was, it became the laboratory code name.[47] The Trinity Gadget was officially a Y-1561 device, as was the Fat Man used a few weeks later in the bombing of Nagasaki. The two were very similar, with only minor differences, the most obvious being the absence of fuzing and the external ballistic casing. The bombs were still under development, and small changes continued to be made to the Fat Man design.[49]\\r\\nTo keep the design as simple as possible, a near solid spherical core was chosen rather than a hollow one, although calculations showed that a hollow core would be more efficient in its use of plutonium.[50][51] The core was compressed to prompt super-criticality by the implosion generated by the high explosive lens. This design became known as a \\"Christy Core\\"[52] or \\"Christy pit\\" after physicist Robert F. Christy, who made the solid pit design a reality after it was initially proposed by Edward Teller.[50][53][54] Along with the pit, the whole physics package was also informally nicknamed \\"Christy['s] Gadget\\".[47]\\r\\nOf the several allotropes of plutonium, the metallurgists preferred the malleable Ѵ phase. This was stabilized at room temperature by alloying it with gallium. Two equal hemispheres of plutonium-gallium alloy were plated with silver,[49] and designated by serial numbers HS-1 and HS-2.[55] The 6.19-kilogram (13.6?lb) radioactive core generated 15 W of heat, which warmed it up to about 100 to 110?F (38 to 43?C),[49] and the silver plating developed blisters that had to be filed down and covered with gold foil; later cores were plated with nickel instead. The Trinity core consisted of just these two hemispheres. Later cores also included a ring with a triangular cross-section to prevent jets forming in the gap between them.[56]\\r\\nA trial assembly of the Gadget without the active components or explosive lenses was carried out by the bomb assembly team headed by Norris Bradbury at Los Alamos on July 3. It was driven to Trinity and back. A set of explosive lenses arrived on July 7, followed by a second set on July 10. Each was examined by Bradbury and Kistiakowsky, and the best ones were selected for use.[57] The remainder were handed over to Edward Creutz, who conducted a test detonation at Pajarito Canyon near Los Alamos without nuclear material.[58] This test brought bad news: magnetic measurements of the simultaneity of the implosion seemed to indicate that the Trinity test would fail. Bethe worked through the night to assess the results, and reported that they were consistent with a perfect explosion.[59]\\r\\nAssembly of the nuclear capsule began on July 13 at the McDonald Ranch House, where the master bedroom had been turned into a clean room. The polonium-beryllium \\"Urchin\\" initiator was assembled, and Louis Slotin placed it inside the two hemispheres of the plutonium core. Cyril Smith then placed the core in the uranium tamper plug, or \\"slug.\\" Air gaps were filled with 0.5-mil (0.013?mm) gold foil, and the two halves of the plug were held together with uranium washers and screws which fit smoothly into the domed ends of the plug. The completed capsule was then driven to the base of the tower.[60]\\r\\nAt the tower a temporary eyebolt was screwed into the 105-pound (48?kg) capsule, and a chain hoist was used to lower the capsule into the gadget. As the capsule entered the hole in the uranium tamper, it stuck. Robert Bacher realized that the heat from the plutonium core had caused the capsule to expand, while the explosives assembly with the tamper had cooled during the night in the desert. By leaving the capsule in contact with the tamper, the temperatures equalized and in a few minutes the capsule had slipped completely into the tamper.[61] The eyebolt was then removed from the capsule and replaced with a threaded uranium plug, a boron disk was placed on top of the capsule, an aluminum plug was screwed into the hole in the pusher, and the two remaining high explosive lenses were installed. Finally, the upper Dural polar cap was bolted into place. Assembly was completed at about 16:45 on July 13.[62]\\r\\nThe Gadget was hoisted to the top of a 100-foot (30?m) steel tower. The height would give a better indication of how the weapon would behave when dropped from a bomber, as detonation in the air would maximize the amount of energy applied directly to the target (as the explosion expanded in a spherical shape) and would generate less nuclear fallout. The tower stood on four legs that went 20 feet (6.1?m) into the ground, with concrete footings. Atop it was an oak platform, and a shack made of corrugated iron that was open on the western side. The Gadget was hauled up with an electric winch.[63] A truckload of mattresses was placed underneath in case the cable broke and the Gadget fell.[64] The seven man arming party, consisting of Bainbridge, Kistiakowsky, Joseph McKibben and four soldiers including Lieutenant Bush, drove out to the tower to perform the final arming shortly after 22:00 on July 15.[64]\\r\\nIn the final two weeks before the test, some 250 personnel from Los Alamos were at work at the Trinity site,[65] and Lieutenant Bush's command had ballooned to 125 men guarding and maintaining the base camp. Another 160 men under Major T.O. Palmer were stationed outside the area with vehicles to evacuate the civilian population in the surrounding region should that prove necessary.[66] They had enough vehicles to move 450 people to safety, and had food and supplies to last them for two days. Arrangements were made for Alamogordo Army Air Field to provide accommodation.[67] Groves had warned the Governor of New Mexico, John J. Dempsey, that martial law might have to be declared in the southwestern part of the state.[68]\\r\\nShelters were established 10,000 yards (9,100?m) due north, west and south of the tower, known as N-10,000, W-10,000 and S-10,000. Each had its own shelter chief: Robert Wilson at N-10,000, John Manley at W-10,000 and Frank Oppenheimer at S-10,000.[69] Many other observers were around 20 miles (32?km) away, and some others were scattered at different distances, some in more informal situations. Richard Feynman claimed to be the only person to see the explosion without the goggles provided, relying on a truck windshield to screen out harmful ultraviolet wavelengths.[70]\\r\\nBainbridge asked Groves to keep his VIP list down to just ten. He chose himself, Oppenheimer, Richard Tolman, Vannevar Bush, James Conant, Brigadier General Thomas F. Farrell, Charles Lauritsen, Isidor Isaac Rabi, Sir Geoffrey Taylor and Sir James Chadwick.[66] The VIPs viewed the test from Compania Hill, about 20 miles (32?km) northwest of the tower.[71] The observers set up a betting pool on the results of the test. Edward Teller was the most optimistic, predicting 45 kilotons of TNT (190?TJ).[72] He wore gloves to protect his hands, and sunglasses underneath the welding goggles that the government had supplied everyone with.[71] Teller was also one of the few scientists to actually watch the test (with eye protection), instead of following orders to lie on the ground with his back turned.[73] He also brought suntan lotion, which he shared with the others.[74]\\r\\nOthers were less optimistic. Ramsey chose zero (a complete dud), Robert Oppenheimer chose 300 tons of TNT (1,300?GJ), Kistiakowsky 1,400 tons of TNT (5,900?GJ), and Bethe chose 8,000 tons of TNT (33,000?GJ).[72] Rabi, the last to arrive, took 18,000 tons of TNT (75,000?GJ) by default, which would win him the pool.[75] In a video interview, Bethe stated that his choice of 8 kt was exactly the value calculated by Segr, and he was swayed by Segr's authority over that of a more junior [but unnamed] member of Segr's group who had calculated 20 kt.[76] Enrico Fermi offered to take wagers among the top physicists and military present on whether the atmosphere would ignite, and if so whether it would destroy just the state, or incinerate the entire planet.[77] This last result had been previously calculated by Bethe to be almost impossible,[78][79] although for a while it had caused some of the scientists some anxiety. Bainbridge was furious with Fermi for scaring the guards who, unlike the physicists, did not have the advantage of their knowledge about the scientific possibilities. His own biggest fear was that nothing would happen, in which case he would have to head back to the tower to investigate.[80]\\r\\nJulian Mack and Berlyn Brixner were responsible for photography. The photography group employed some fifty different cameras, taking motion and still photographs. Special Fastax cameras taking 10,000 frames per second would record the minute details of the explosion. Spectrograph cameras would record the wavelengths of light emitted by the explosion, and pinhole cameras would record gamma rays. A rotating drum spectrograph at the 10,000-yard (9,100?m) station would obtain the spectrum over the first hundredth of a second. Another, slow recording one would track the fireball. Cameras were placed in bunkers only 800 yards (730?m) from the tower, protected by steel and lead glass, and mounted on sleds so they could be towed out by the lead-lined tank.[81] Some observers brought their own cameras despite the security. Segr brought in Jack Aeby's 35?mm Perfex 44. It would take the only known well-exposed color photograph of the detonation explosion.[71]\\r\\nThe scientists wanted good visibility, low humidity, light winds at low altitude and westerly winds at high altitude for the test. The best weather was predicted between July 18 and 21, but the Potsdam Conference was due to start on July 16 and President Harry S. Truman wanted the test to be conducted before the conference began. It was therefore scheduled for July 16, the earliest date at which the bomb components would be available.[82]\\r\\nThe detonation was initially planned for 04:00 MWT but was postponed because of rain and lightning from early that morning. It was feared that the danger from radiation and fallout would be increased by rain, and lightning had the scientists concerned about a premature detonation.[83] A crucial favorable weather report came in at 04:45,[57] and the final twenty-minute countdown began at 05:10, read by Samuel Allison.[84] By 05:30 the rain had gone.[57] There were some communication problems. The shortwave radio frequency for communicating with the B-29s was shared with the Voice of America, and the FM radios shared a frequency with a railroad freight yard in San Antonio, Texas.[80]\\r\\nTwo circling B-29s observed the test, with Shields again flying the lead plane. They carried members of Project Alberta, who would carry out airborne measurements during the atomic missions. These included Captain Deak Parsons, the Associate Director of the Los Alamos Laboratory and the head of Project Alberta; Luis Alvarez, Harold Agnew, Bernard Waldman, Wolfgang Panofsky and William Penney. The overcast sky obscured their view of the test site.[85]\\r\\nAt 05:29:21 MWT (I 2 seconds),[86] the device exploded with an energy equivalent to around 20 kilotons of TNT (84?TJ). The desert sand, largely made of silica, melted and became a mildly radioactive light green glass, which was named trinitite.[87] It left a crater in the desert 5 feet (1.5?m) deep and 30 feet (9.1?m) wide.[42] At the time of detonation, the surrounding mountains were illuminated \\"brighter than daytime\\" for one to two seconds, and the heat was reported as \\"being as hot as an oven\\" at the base camp. The observed colors of the illumination changed from purple to green and eventually to white. The roar of the shock wave took 40 seconds to reach the observers. It was felt over 100 miles (160?km) away, and the mushroom cloud reached 7.5 miles (12.1?km) in height.[88]\\r\\nRalph Carlisle Smith, watching from Compania Hill, wrote:\\r\\nI was staring straight ahead with my open left eye covered by a welder's glass and my right eye remaining open and uncovered. Suddenly, my right eye was blinded by a light which appeared instantaneously all about without any build up of intensity. My left eye could see the ball of fire start up like a tremendous bubble or nob-like mushroom. I dropped the glass from my left eye almost immediately and watched the light climb upward. The light intensity fell rapidly, hence did not blind my left eye but it was still amazingly bright. It turned yellow, then red, and then beautiful purple. At first it had a translucent character, but shortly turned to a tinted or colored white smoke appearance. The ball of fire seemed to rise in something of toadstool effect. Later the column proceeded as a cylinder of white smoke; it seemed to move ponderously. A hole was punched through the clouds, but two fog rings appeared well above the white smoke column. There was a spontaneous cheer from the observers. Dr. von Neumann said \\"that was at least 5,000 tons and probably a lot more.\\"[89]\\r\\nIn his official report on the test, Farrell wrote:\\r\\nThe lighting effects beggared description. The whole country was lighted by a searing light with the intensity many times that of the midday sun. It was golden, purple, violet, gray, and blue. It lighted every peak, crevasse and ridge of the nearby mountain range with a clarity and beauty that cannot be described but must be seen to be imagined?...[90]\\r\\nWilliam L. Laurence of The New York Times had been transferred temporarily to the Manhattan Project at Groves's request in early 1945.[91] Groves had arranged for Laurence to view significant events, including Trinity and the atomic bombing of Japan. Laurence wrote press releases with the help of the Manhattan Project's public relations staff.[92] He later recalled that\\r\\nA loud cry filled the air. The little groups that hitherto had stood rooted to the earth like desert plants broke into dance, the rhythm of primitive man dancing at one of his fire festivals at the coming of Spring.[93]\\r\\nAfter the initial euphoria of witnessing the explosion had passed, Bainbridge told Oppenheimer, \\"Now we are all sons of bitches.\\"[33] Rabi noticed Oppenheimer's reaction: \\"I'll never forget his walk;\\" Rabi recalled, \\"I'll never forget the way he stepped out of the car?... his walk was like High Noon?... this kind of strut. He had done it.\\"[94]\\r\\nOppenheimer later recalled that, while witnessing the explosion, he thought of a verse from the Hindu holy book, the Bhagavad Gita (XI,12):\\r\\n????????? ???????????????????? ????????????????? ?????????? ?????? ????? ? ?????????? ????? ??????????? ???????????? ????????- ???\\r\\nIf the radiance of a thousand suns were to burst at once into the sky, that would be like the splendor of the mighty one?...[95][96]\\r\\nYears later he would explain that another verse had also entered his head at that time:\\r\\nWe knew the world would not be the same. A few people laughed, a few people cried. Most people were silent. I remembered the line from the Hindu scripture, the Bhagavad Gita; Vishnu is trying to persuade the Prince that he should do his duty and, to impress him, takes on his multi-armed form and says, 'Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds.' I suppose we all thought that, one way or another.[97][c]\\r\\nJohn R. Lugo was flying a U.S. Navy transport at 10,000 feet (3,000?m), 30 miles (48?km) east of Albuquerque, en route to the west coast. \\"My first impression was, like, the sun was coming up in the south. What a ball of fire! It was so bright it lit up the cockpit of the plane.\\" Lugo radioed Albuquerque. He got no explanation for the blast but was told, \\"Don't fly south.\\"[101]\\r\\nGround zero after the test\\r\\nAn aerial photograph of the Trinity crater shortly after the test.[d]\\r\\nThe Jumbo container after the test\\r\\nThe T (Theoretical) Division at Los Alamos had predicted a yield of between 5 and 10 kilotons of TNT (21 and 42?TJ). Immediately after the blast, the two lead-lined Sherman tanks made their way to the crater. Radiochemical analysis of soil samples that they collected indicated that the total yield (or energy release) had been around 18.6 kilotons of TNT (78?TJ).[102]\\r\\nFifty beryllium-copper diaphragm microphones were also used to record the pressure of the blast wave. These were supplemented by mechanical pressure gauges.[103] These indicated a blast energy of 9.9 kilotons of TNT (41?TJ) I 0.1 kilotons of TNT (0.42?TJ), with only one of the mechanical pressure gauges working correctly that indicated 10 kilotons of TNT (42?TJ). [104]\\r\\nFermi prepared his own experiment to measure the energy that was released as blast. He later recalled that:\\r\\nAbout 40 seconds after the explosion the air blast reached me. I tried to estimate its strength by dropping from about six feet small pieces of paper before, during, and after the passage of the blast wave. Since, at the time, there was no wind I could observe very distinctly and actually measure the displacement of the pieces of paper that were in the process of falling while the blast was passing. The shift was about 2 1/2 meters, which, at the time, I estimated to correspond to the blast that would be produced by ten thousand tons of T.N.T.[105]\\r\\nThere were also several gamma ray and neutron detectors; few survived the blast, with all the gauges within 200 feet (61?m) of ground zero being destroyed,[106] but sufficient data were recovered to measure the gamma ray component of the ionizing radiation released.[107]\\r\\nThe official estimate for the total yield of the Trinity gadget, which includes the energy of the blast component together with the contributions from the explosion's light output and both forms of ionizing radiation, is 21 kilotons of TNT (88?TJ),[109] of which about 15 kilotons of TNT (63?TJ) was contributed by fission of the plutonium core, and about 6 kilotons of TNT (25?TJ) was from fission of the natural uranium tamper.[110] A re-analysis of data published in 2016 put the yield at 22.1 kilotons of TNT (92?TJ), with a margin of error estimated at 2.7 kilotons of TNT (11?TJ).[111]\\r\\nAs a result of the data gathered on the size of the blast, the detonation height for the bombing of Hiroshima was set at 1,885 feet (575?m) to take advantage of the mach stem blast reinforcing effect.[112] The final Nagasaki burst height was 1,650 feet (500?m) so the Mach stem started sooner.[113] The knowledge that implosion worked led Oppenheimer to recommend to Groves that the uranium-235 used in a Little Boy gun-type weapon could be used more economically in a composite core with plutonium. It was too late to do this with the first Little Boy, but the composite cores would soon enter production.[114]\\r\\nCivilians noticed the bright lights and huge explosion. Groves therefore had the Second Air Force issue a press release with a cover story that he had prepared weeks before:\\r\\nAlamogordo, N.M., July 16\\r\\nThe commanding officer of the Alamogordo Army Air Base made the following statement today: \\"Several inquiries have been received concerning a heavy explosion which occurred on the Alamogordo Air base reservation this morning. A remotely located ammunition magazine containing a considerable amount of high explosives and pyrotechnics exploded. There was no loss of life or injury to anyone, and the property damage outside of the explosives magazine was negligible. Weather conditions affecting the content of gas shells exploded by the blast may make it desirable for the Army to evacuate temporarily a few civilians from their homes.\\"[115][116]\\r\\nThe press release was written by Laurence. He had prepared four releases, covering outcomes ranging from an account of a successful test (the one which was used) to catastrophic scenarios involving serious damage to surrounding communities, evacuation of nearby residents, and a placeholder for the names of those killed.[117][118][119] As Laurence was a witness to the test he knew that the last release, if used, might be his own obituary.[117] A newspaper article published the same day stated that \\"the blast was seen and felt throughout an area extending from El Paso to Silver City, Gallup, Socorro, and Albuquerque.\\"[120] An Associated Press article quoted a blind woman 150 miles (240?km) away who asked \\"What's that brilliant light?\\" These articles appeared in New Mexico, but East Coast newspapers ignored them.[117]\\r\\nInformation about the Trinity test was made public shortly after the bombing of Hiroshima. The Smyth Report, released on August 12, 1945, gave some information on the blast, and the edition released by Princeton University Press a few weeks later incorporated the War Department's press release on the test as Appendix 6, and contained the famous pictures of a \\"bulbous\\" Trinity fireball.[121] Groves, Oppenheimer and other dignitaries visited the test site in September 1945, wearing white canvas overshoes to prevent fallout from sticking to the soles of their shoes.[122]\\r\\nThe results of the test were conveyed to the Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson at the Potsdam Conference in Germany in a coded message from his assistant George L. Harrison:\\r\\nOperated on this morning. Diagnosis not yet complete but results seem satisfactory and already exceed expectations. Local press release necessary as interest extends great distance. Dr. Groves pleased. He returns tomorrow. I will keep you posted.[123]\\r\\nThe message arrived at the \\"Little White House\\" in the Potsdam suburb of Babelsberg and was at once taken to Truman and Secretary of State James F. Byrnes.[124] Harrison sent a follow-up message which arrived on the morning of July 18:[124]\\r\\nDoctor has just returned most enthusiastic and confident that the little boy is as husky as his big brother. The light in his eyes discernible from here to High Hold and I could have heard his screams from here to my farm.[123]\\r\\nBecause Stimson's summer home at High Hold was on Long Island and Harrison's farm near Upperville, Virginia, this indicated that the explosion could be seen 200 miles (320?km) away and heard 50 miles (80?km) away.[125]\\r\\nFilm badges used to measure exposure to radioactivity indicated that no observers at N-10,000 had been exposed to more than 0.1 roentgens, but the shelter was evacuated before the radioactive cloud could reach it. The explosion was more efficient than expected and the thermal updraft drew most of the cloud high enough that little fallout fell on the test site. The crater was far more radioactive than expected due to the formation of trinitite, and the crews of the two lead-lined Sherman tanks were subjected to considerable exposure. Anderson's dosimeter and film badge recorded 7 to 10 roentgens, and one of the tank drivers, who made three trips, recorded 13 to 15 roentgens.[126]\\r\\nThe heaviest fallout contamination outside the restricted test area was 30 miles (48?km) from the detonation point, on Chupadera Mesa. The fallout there was reported to have settled in a white mist onto some of the livestock in the area, resulting in local beta burns and a temporary loss of dorsal or back hair. Patches of hair grew back discolored white. The Army bought 75 cattle in all from ranchers; the 17 most significantly marked were kept at Los Alamos, while the rest were shipped to Oak Ridge for long-term observation.[127][128][129][130]\\r\\nUnlike the 100 or so atmospheric nuclear explosions later conducted at the Nevada Test Site, fallout doses to the local inhabitants have not been reconstructed for the Trinity event, due primarily to scarcity of data.[131] In 2014, a National Cancer Institute study commenced that will attempt to close this gap in the literature and complete a Trinity radiation dose reconstruction for the population of the state of New Mexico.[132][133]\\r\\nIn August 1945, shortly after the bombing of Hiroshima, the Kodak Company observed spotting and fogging on their film, which was at that time usually packaged in cardboard containers. Dr. J. H. Webb, a Kodak employee, studied the matter and concluded that the contamination must have come from a nuclear explosion somewhere in the United States. He discounted the possibility that the Hiroshima bomb was responsible, due to the timing of the events. A hot spot of fallout contaminated the river water that the paper mill in Indiana used to manufacture the cardboard pulp from corn husks.[134] Aware of the gravity of his discovery, Dr. Webb kept this secret until 1949.[135]\\r\\nThis incident along with the next continental US tests in 1951 set a precedent. In subsequent atmospheric nuclear tests at the Nevada test site, United States Atomic Energy Commission officials gave the photographic industry maps and forecasts of potential contamination, as well as expected fallout distributions, which enabled them to purchase uncontaminated materials and take other protective measures.[134]\\r\\nIn September 1953, about 650 people attended the first Trinity Site open house. Visitors to a Trinity Site open house are allowed to see the ground zero and McDonald Ranch House areas.[136] More than seventy years after the test, residual radiation at the site is about ten times higher than normal background radiation in the area. The amount of radioactive exposure received during a one-hour visit to the site is about half of the total radiation exposure which a U.S. adult receives on an average day from natural and medical sources.[137]\\r\\nOn December 21, 1965, the 51,500-acre (20,800?ha) Trinity Site was declared a National Historic Landmark district,[138][2] and on October 15, 1966, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places.[1] The landmark includes the base camp, where the scientists and support group lived; ground zero, where the bomb was placed for the explosion; and the McDonald ranch house, where the plutonium core to the bomb was assembled. One of the old instrumentation bunkers is visible beside the road just west of ground zero.[139] An inner oblong fence was added in 1967, and the corridor barbed wire fence that connects the outer fence to the inner one was completed in 1972. Jumbo was moved to the parking lot in 1979; it is missing its ends from an attempt to destroy it in 1946 using eight 500-pound (230?kg) bombs.[140] The Trinity monument, a rough-sided, lava-rock obelisk about 12 feet (3.7?m) high, marks the explosion's hypocenter.[136] It was erected in 1965 by Army personnel from the White Sands Missile Range using local rocks taken from the western boundary of the range.[141] A simple metal plaque reads: \\"Trinity Site Where the World's First Nuclear Device Was Exploded on July 16, 1945.\\" A second memorial plaque on the obelisk was prepared by the Army and the National Park Service, and was unveiled on the 30th anniversary of the test in 1975.[142]\\r\\nA special tour of the site was conducted on July 16, 1995, to mark the 50th anniversary of the Trinity test. About 5,000 visitors arrived to commemorate the occasion, the largest crowd for any open house.[143] Since then, the open houses have usually averaged two to three thousand visitors. The site is still a popular destination for those interested in atomic tourism, though it is only open to the public twice a year during the Trinity Site Open House on the first Saturdays of April and October.[144][145] In 2014, the White Sands Missile Range announced that due to budgetary constraints, the site would only be open once a year, on the first Saturday in April. In 2015, this decision was reversed, and two events were scheduled, in April and October. The base commander, Brigadier General Timothy R. Coffin, explained that:\\r\\nTrinity Site is a national historic testing landmark where the theories and engineering of some of the nation's brightest minds were tested with the detonation of the first nuclear bomb, technologies which then helped end World War II. It is important for us to share Trinity with the public even though the site is located inside a very active military test range. We have travelers from as far away as Australia who travel to visit this historic landmark. Facilitating access twice per year allows more people the chance to visit this historic site.[146]\\r\\nTrinity Site Historical Marker, 2008\\r\\nRemnants of Jumbo, 2010\\r\\nTourists at Ground Zero, 2007\\r\\nPlaque on the obelisk","input":"When was the first nuclear bomb set off?"},{"output":"green leafy vegetables","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nVitamin K is a group of structurally similar, fat-soluble vitamins that the human body requires for complete synthesis of certain proteins that are prerequisites for blood coagulation (K from Koagulation, Danish for \\"coagulation\\") and which the body also needs for controlling binding of calcium in bones and other tissues.[1] The vitamin K-related modification of the proteins allows them to bind calcium ions, which they cannot do otherwise. Without vitamin K, blood coagulation is seriously impaired, and uncontrolled bleeding occurs. Preliminary clinical research indicates that deficiency of vitamin K may weaken bones, potentially leading to osteoporosis, and may promote calcification of arteries and other soft tissues.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nChemically, the vitamin K family comprises 2-methyl-1,4-naphthoquinone (3-) derivatives. Vitamin K includes two natural vitamers: vitamin K1 and vitamin K2.[2] Vitamin K2, in turn, consists of a number of related chemical subtypes, with differing lengths of carbon side chains made of isoprenoid groups of atoms.\\r\\n\\r\\nVitamin K1, also known as phylloquinone, is made by plants, and is found in highest amounts in green leafy vegetables because it is directly involved in photosynthesis. It may be thought of as the plant form of vitamin K. It is active as a vitamin in animals and performs the classic functions of vitamin K, including its activity in the production of blood-clotting proteins. Animals may also convert it to vitamin K2.\\r\\n\\r\\nBacteria in the gut flora can also convert K1 into vitamin K2 (menaquinone). In addition, bacteria typically lengthen the isoprenoid side chain of vitamin K2 to produce a range of vitamin K2 forms, most notably the MK-7 to MK-11 homologues of vitamin K2. All forms of K2 other than MK-4 can only be produced by bacteria, which use these forms in anaerobic respiration. The MK-7 and other bacterially derived forms of vitamin K2 exhibit vitamin K activity in animals, but MK-7's extra utility over MK-4, if any, is unclear and is a matter of investigation.\\r\\n\\r\\nBecause a synthetic form of vitamin K, vitamin K3 (menadione), may be toxic by interfering with the function of glutathione, it is no longer used to treat vitamin K deficiency.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nA review of 2014 concluded that there is positive evidence that monotherapy using MK-4, one of the forms of Vitamin K2, reduces fracture incidence in post-menopausal women with osteoporosis, and suggested further research on the combined use of MK-4 with bisphosphonates. In contrast, an earlier review article of 2013 concluded that there is no good evidence that vitamin K supplementation helps prevent osteoporosis or fractures in postmenopausal women.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nA Cochrane systematic review of 2006 suggested that supplementation with Vitamin K1 and with MK4 reduces bone loss; in particular, a strong effect of MK-4 on incident fractures among Japanese patients was emphasized.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nA review article of 2016 suggested to consider, as one of several measures for bone health, increasing the intake of foods rich in vitamins K1 and K2.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nAdequate intake of vitamin K is associated with the inhibition of arterial calcification and stiffening,[6] but there have been few interventional studies and no good evidence that vitamin K supplementation is of any benefit in the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nOne 10-year population study, the Rotterdam Study, did show a clear and significant inverse relationship between the highest intake levels of menaquinone (mainly MK-4 from eggs and meat, and MK-8 and MK-9 from cheese) and cardiovascular disease and all-cause mortality in older men and women.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nVitamin K has been promoted in supplement form with claims it can slow tumor growth; however, no good medical evidence supports such claims.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nVitamin K is one of the treatments for bleeding events caused by overdose of the anticoagulant drug warfarin (Coumadin?).[10] Vitamin K is also part of the suggested treatment regime for poisoning by rodenticide (coumarin poisoning).[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough allergic reaction from supplementation is possible, no known toxicity is associated with high doses of the phylloquinone (vitamin K1) or menaquinone (vitamin K2) forms of vitamin K, so no tolerable upper intake level (UL) has been set.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nBlood clotting (coagulation) studies in humans using 45?mg per day of vitamin K2 (as MK-4)[13] and even up to 135?mg per day (45?mg three times daily) of K2 (as MK-4),[14] showed no increase in blood clot risk. Even doses in rats as high as 250?mg/kg, body weight did not alter the tendency for blood-clot formation to occur.[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nUnlike the safe natural forms of vitamin K1 and vitamin K2 and their various isomers, a synthetic form of vitamin K, vitamin K3 (menadione), is demonstrably toxic at high levels. The U.S. FDA has banned this form from over-the-counter sale in the United States because large doses have been shown to cause allergic reactions, hemolytic anemia, and cytotoxicity in liver cells.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nPhylloquinone (K1)[16][17] or menaquinone (K2) are capable of reversing the anticoagulant activity of the anticoagulant warfarin (tradename Coumadin). Warfarin works by blocking recycling of vitamin K, so that the body and tissues have lower levels of active vitamin K, and thus a deficiency of vitamin K.\\r\\n\\r\\nSupplemental vitamin K (for which oral dosing is often more active than injectable dosing in human adults) reverses the vitamin K deficiency caused by warfarin, and therefore reduces the intended anticoagulant action of warfarin and related drugs.[18] Sometimes small amounts of vitamin K are given orally to patients taking warfarin so that the action of the drug is more predictable.[18]  The proper anticoagulant action of the drug is a function of vitamin K intake and drug dose, and due to differing absorption must be individualized for each patient.[citation needed] The action of warfarin and vitamin K both require two to five days after dosing to have maximum effect, and neither warfarin or vitamin K shows much effect in the first 24 hours after they are given.[19]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe newer anticoagulants dabigatran and rivaroxaban have different mechanisms of action that do not interact with vitamin K, and may be taken with supplemental vitamin K.[20][21]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe three synthetic forms of vitamin K are vitamins K3 (menadione), K4, and K5, which are used in many areas, including the pet food industry (vitamin K3) and to inhibit fungal growth (vitamin K5).[22]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe MK-4 form of vitamin K2 is produced by conversion of vitamin K1 in the testes, pancreas, and arterial walls.[23] While major questions still surround the biochemical pathway for this transformation, the conversion is not dependent on gut bacteria, as it occurs in germ-free rats[24][25] and in parenterally administered K1 in rats.[26][27] In fact, tissues that accumulate high amounts of MK-4 have a remarkable capacity to convert up to 90% of the available K1 into MK-4.[24][28] There is evidence that the conversion proceeds by removal of the phytyl tail of K1 to produce menadione as an intermediate, which is then condensed with an activated geranylgeranyl moiety (see also prenylation) to produce vitamin K2 in the MK-4 (menatetrenone) form.[29]\\r\\n\\r\\nVitamin K2 (menaquinone) includes several subtypes. The two most studied ones are menaquinone-4 (menatetrenone, MK-4) and menaquinone-7 (MK-7).\\r\\n\\r\\nVitamin K1, the precursor of most vitamin K in nature, is a stereoisomer of phylloquinone, an important chemical in green plants, where it functions as an electron acceptor in photosystem I during photosynthesis. For this reason, vitamin K1 is found in large quantities in the photosynthetic tissues of plants (green leaves, and dark green leafy vegetables such as romaine lettuce, kale, and spinach), but it occurs in far smaller quantities in other plant tissues (roots, fruits, etc.). Iceberg lettuce contains relatively little. The function of phylloquinone in plants appears to have no resemblance to its later metabolic and biochemical function (as \\"vitamin K\\") in animals, where it performs a completely different biochemical reaction.\\r\\n\\r\\nVitamin K (in animals) is involved in the carboxylation of certain glutamate residues in proteins to form gamma-carboxyglutamate (Gla) residues. The modified residues are often (but not always) situated within specific protein domains called Gla domains. Gla residues are usually involved in binding calcium, and are essential for the biological activity of all known Gla proteins.[30]\\r\\n\\r\\nAt this time[update], 17 human proteins with Gla domains have been discovered, and they play key roles in the regulation of three physiological processes:\\r\\n\\r\\nLike other lipid-soluble vitamins (A, D, and E), vitamin K is stored in the fatty tissue of the human body.\\r\\n\\r\\nPrevious theory held that dietary deficiency is extremely rare unless the small intestine was heavily damaged, resulting in malabsorption of the molecule. Another at-risk group for deficiency were those subject to decreased production of K2 by normal intestinal microbiota, as seen in broad-spectrum antibiotic use.[38] Taking broad-spectrum antibiotics can reduce vitamin K production in the gut by nearly 74% in people compared with those not taking these antibiotics.[39] Diets low in vitamin K also decrease the body's vitamin K concentration.[40] Those with chronic kidney disease are at risk for vitamin K deficiency, as well as vitamin D deficiency, and particularly those with the apoE4 genotype.[41] Additionally, the elderly have a reduction in vitamin K2.[42]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe U.S. Institute of Medicine (IOM) updated Estimated Average Requirements (EARs) and Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs) for vitamin K in 1998. The IOM does not distinguish between K1 and K2 ÿ both are counted as vitamin K. At that time,t sufficient information was not available to establish EARs and RDAs for vitamin K. In instances such as these, the board sets Adequate Intakes (AIs), with the understanding that at some later date, AIs will be replaced by more exact information. The current AIs for adult women and men ages 19 and up are 90 and 120 g/day, respectively. AI for pregnancy is 90 g/day. AI for lactation is 90 g/day. For infants up to 12 months, the AI is 2.0-2.5 g/day; for children ages 1ÿ18 years the AI increases with age from 30 to 75 g/day. As for safety, the IOM sets tolerable upper intake levels (known as ULs) for vitamins and minerals when evidence is sufficient. Vitamin K has no UL, as human data for adverse effects from high doses are inadequate. Collectively, the EARs, RDAs, AIs and ULs are referred to as Dietary Reference Intakes.[43]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) refers to the collective set of information as Dietary Reference Values, with Population Reference Intake (PRI) instead of RDA, and Average Requirement instead of EAR. AI and UL are defined the same as in United States. For women and men over age 18 the AI is set at 70 g/day. AI for pregnancy is 70 g/day, ad for lactation 70 g/day. For children ages 1ÿ17 years, the AIs increase with age from 12 to 65 g/day. These AIs are lower than the U.S. RDAs.[44] The EFSA also reviewed the safety question and reached the same conclusion as in United States - that there was not sufficient evidence to set a UL for vitamin K.[45]\\r\\n\\r\\nFor U.S. food and dietary supplement labeling purposes, the amount in a serving is expressed as a percentage of Daily Value (%DV). For vitamin K labeling purposes, 100% of the Daily Value was 80 g, but as of May 27, 2016, it was revised upwards to 120 g, to bring it into agreement with the AI.[46] A table of the old and new adult Daily Values is provided at Reference Daily Intake. The original deadline to be in compliance was July 28, 2018, but on September 29, 2017, the FDA released a proposed rule that extended the deadline to January 1, 2020 for large companies and January 1, 2021 for small companies.[47]\\r\\n\\r\\nVitamin K1 is found chiefly in leafy green vegetables such as spinach, swiss chard, lettuce and Brassica vegetables (such as cabbage, kale, cauliflower, broccoli, and brussels sprouts) and often the absorption is greater when accompanied by fats such as butter or oils. Some fruits, such as avocados, kiwifruit and grapes, also contain vitamin K. Some vegetable oils, notably soybean oil, contain vitamin K, but at levels that would require relatively large calorie consumption to meet the recommended amounts.[50]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe tight binding of vitamin K1 to thylakoid membranes in chloroplasts makes it less bioavailable. For example, cooked spinach has a 5% bioavailability of phylloquinone, however, fat added to it increases bioavailability to 13% due to the increased solubility of vitamin K in fat.[51]\\r\\n\\r\\nAverage diets are usually not lacking in vitamin K, and primary deficiency is rare in healthy adults. Newborn infants are at an increased risk of deficiency. Other populations with an increased prevalence of vitamin K deficiency include those who suffer from liver damage or disease (e.g. alcoholics), cystic fibrosis, or inflammatory bowel diseases, or have recently had abdominal surgeries. Secondary vitamin K deficiency can occur in people with bulimia, those on stringent diets, and those taking anticoagulants. Other drugs associated with vitamin K deficiency include salicylates, barbiturates, and cefamandole, although the mechanisms are still unknown. Vitamin K1 deficiency can result in coagulopathy, a bleeding disorder.[52] Symptoms of K1 deficiency include anemia, bruising, nosebleeds and bleeding of the gums in both sexes, and heavy menstrual bleeding in women.\\r\\n\\r\\nOsteoporosis[53][54] and coronary heart disease[55][56] are strongly associated with lower levels of K2 (menaquinone). Vitamin K2 (as menaquinones MK-4 through MK-10) intake level is inversely related to severe aortic calcification and all-cause mortality.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe function of vitamin K2 in the animal cell is to add a carboxylic acid functional group to a glutamate (Glu) amino acid residue in a protein, to form a gamma-carboxyglutamate (Gla) residue. This is a somewhat uncommon posttranslational modification of the protein, which is then known as a \\"Gla protein\\". The presence of two ?COOH (carboxylic acid) groups on the same carbon in the gamma-carboxyglutamate residue allows it to chelate calcium ions. The binding of calcium ions in this way very often triggers the function or binding of Gla-protein enzymes, such as the so-called vitamin K-dependent clotting factors discussed below.\\r\\n\\r\\nWithin the cell, vitamin K undergoes electron reduction to a reduced form called vitamin K hydroquinone, catalyzed by the enzyme vitamin K epoxide reductase (VKOR).[57] Another enzyme then oxidizes vitamin K hydroquinone to allow carboxylation of Glu to Gla; this enzyme is called gamma-glutamyl carboxylase[58][59] or the vitamin K-dependent carboxylase. The carboxylation reaction only proceeds if the carboxylase enzyme is able to oxidize vitamin K hydroquinone to vitamin K epoxide at the same time. The carboxylation and epoxidation reactions are said to be coupled. Vitamin K epoxide is then reconverted to vitamin K by VKOR. The reduction and subsequent reoxidation of vitamin K coupled with carboxylation of Glu is called the vitamin K cycle.[60] Humans are rarely deficient in vitamin K1 because, in part, vitamin K1  is continuously recycled in cells.[61]\\r\\n\\r\\nWarfarin and other 4-hydroxycoumarins block the action of VKOR.[62] This results in decreased concentrations of vitamin K and vitamin K hydroquinone in tissues, such that the carboxylation reaction catalyzed by the glutamyl carboxylase is inefficient. This results in the production of clotting factors with inadequate Gla. Without Gla on the amino termini of these factors, they no longer bind stably to the blood vessel endothelium and cannot activate clotting to allow formation of a clot during tissue injury. As it is impossible to predict what dose of warfarin will give the desired degree of clotting suppression, warfarin treatment must be carefully monitored to avoid overdose.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe following human Gla-containing proteins (\\"Gla proteins\\") have been characterized to the level of primary structure: blood coagulation factors II (prothrombin), VII, IX, and X, anticoagulant proteins C and S, and the factor X-targeting protein Z. The bone Gla protein osteocalcin, the calcification-inhibiting matrix Gla protein (MGP), the cell growth regulating growth arrest specific gene 6 protein (Gas6), and the four transmembrane Gla proteins (TMGPs), the function of which is at present unknown. Gas6 can function as a growth factor to activate the Axl receptor tyrosine kinase and stimulate cell proliferation or prevent apoptosis in some cells. In all cases in which their function was known, the presence of the Gla residues in these proteins turned out to be essential for functional activity.\\r\\n\\r\\nGla proteins are known to occur in a wide variety of vertebrates: mammals, birds, reptiles, and fish. The venom of a number of Australian snakes acts by activating the human blood-clotting system. In some cases, activation is accomplished by snake Gla-containing enzymes that bind to the endothelium of human blood vessels and catalyze the conversion of procoagulant clotting factors into activated ones, leading to unwanted and potentially deadly clotting.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother interesting class of invertebrate Gla-containing proteins is synthesized by the fish-hunting snail Conus geographus.[63] These snails produce a venom containing hundreds of neuroactive peptides, or conotoxins, which is sufficiently toxic to kill an adult human. Several of the conotoxins contain two to five Gla residues.[64]\\r\\n\\r\\nVitamin K status can be assessed by:\\r\\n\\r\\nMany bacteria, such as Escherichia coli found in the large intestine, can synthesize vitamin K2 (menaquinone-7 or MK-7, up to MK-11),[72] but not vitamin K1 (phylloquinone). In these bacteria, menaquinone transfers two electrons between two different small molecules, during oxygen-independent metabolic energy production processes (anaerobic respiration).[73] For example, a small molecule with an excess of electrons (also called an electron donor) such as lactate, formate, or NADH, with the help of an enzyme, passes two electrons to menaquinone. The menaquinone, with the help of another enzyme, then transfers these two electrons to a suitable oxidant, such fumarate or nitrate (also called an electron acceptor). Adding two electrons to fumarate or nitrate converts the molecule to succinate or nitrite plus water, respectively.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome of these reactions generate a cellular energy source, ATP, in a manner similar to eukaryotic cell aerobic respiration, except the final electron acceptor is not molecular oxygen, but fumarate or nitrate. In aerobic respiration, the final oxidant is molecular oxygen (O2), which accepts four electrons from an electron donor such as NADH to be converted to water. E. coli, as facultative anaerobes, can carry out both aerobic respiration and menaquinone-mediated anaerobic respiration.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe blood clotting factors of newborn babies are roughly 30ÿ60% that of adult values; this may be due to the reduced synthesis of precursor proteins and the sterility of their guts. Human milk contains 1ÿ4?g/L of vitamin K1, while formula-derived milk can contain up to 100?g/L in supplemented formulas. Vitamin K2 concentrations in human milk appear to be much lower than those of vitamin K1. Occurrence of vitamin K deficiency bleeding in the first week of the infant's life is estimated at 0.25ÿ1.7%, with a prevalence of 2ÿ10 cases per 100,000 births.[74] Premature babies have even lower levels of the vitamin, so they are at a higher risk from this deficiency.\\r\\n\\r\\nBleeding in infants due to vitamin K deficiency can be severe, leading to hospitalization, blood transfusions, brain damage, and death. Supplementation can prevent most cases of vitamin K deficiency bleeding in the newborn. Intramuscular administration (known as the Vitamin K shot[75]) is more effective in preventing late vitamin K deficiency bleeding than oral administration.[76][77]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs a result of the occurrences of vitamin K deficiency bleeding, the Committee on Nutrition of the American Academy of Pediatrics has recommended 0.5ÿ1?mg of vitamin K1 be administered to all newborns shortly after birth.[77]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the UK, vitamin K supplementation is recommended for all newborns within the first 24 hours.[78] This is usually given as a single intramuscular injection of 1?mg shortly after birth but as a second-line option can be given by three oral doses over the first month.[79]\\r\\n\\r\\nControversy arose in the early 1990s regarding this practice, when two studies suggested a relationship between parenteral administration of vitamin K and childhood cancer.[80] However, poor methods and small sample sizes led to the discrediting of these studies, and a review of the evidence published in 2000 by Ross and Davies found no link between the two.[81] Doctors reported emerging concerns in 2013,[82] after treating children for serious bleeding problems. They cited lack of newborn vitamin K administration as the reason that the problems occurred, and recommended that breastfed babies could have an increased risk unless they receive a preventative dose.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1929, Danish scientist Henrik Dam investigated the role of cholesterol by feeding chickens a cholesterol-depleted diet.[83] He initially replicated experiments reported by scientists at the Ontario Agricultural College (OAC).[84] McFarlane, Graham and Richardson, working on the chick feed program at OAC, had used chloroform to remove all fat from chick chow. They noticed that chicks fed only fat-depleted chow developed hemorrhages and started bleeding from tag sites.[85] Dam found that these defects could not be restored by adding purified cholesterol to the diet. It appeared that ÿ together with the cholesterol ÿ a second compound had been extracted from the food, and this compound was called the coagulation vitamin. The new vitamin received the letter K because the initial discoveries were reported in a German journal, in which it was designated as Koagulationsvitamin. Edward Adelbert Doisy of Saint Louis University did much of the research that led to the discovery of the structure and chemical nature of vitamin K.[86] Dam and Doisy shared the 1943 Nobel Prize for medicine for their work on vitamin K (K1 and K2) published in 1939. Several laboratories synthesized the compound(s) in 1939.[87]\\r\\n\\r\\nFor several decades, the vitamin K-deficient chick model was the only method of quantifying vitamin K in various foods: the chicks were made vitamin K-deficient and subsequently fed with known amounts of vitamin K-containing food. The extent to which blood coagulation was restored by the diet was taken as a measure for its vitamin K content. Three groups of physicians independently found this: Biochemical Institute, University of Copenhagen (Dam and Johannes Glavind), University of Iowa Department of Pathology (Emory Warner, Kenneth Brinkhous, and Harry Pratt Smith), and the Mayo Clinic (Hugh Butt, Albert Snell, and Arnold Osterberg).[88]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first published report of successful treatment with vitamin K of life-threatening hemorrhage in a jaundiced patient with prothrombin deficiency was made in 1938 by Smith, Warner, and Brinkhous.[89]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe precise function of vitamin K was not discovered until 1974, when three laboratories (Stenflo et al.,[90] Nelsestuen et al.,[91] and Magnusson et al.[92]) isolated the vitamin K-dependent coagulation factor prothrombin (factor II) from cows that received a high dose of a vitamin K antagonist, warfarin. It was shown that, while warfarin-treated cows had a form of prothrombin that contained 10 glutamate (Glu) amino acid residues near the amino terminus of this protein, the normal (untreated) cows contained 10 unusual residues that were chemically identified as -carboxyglutamate (Gla). The extra carboxyl group in Gla made clear that vitamin K plays a role in a carboxylation reaction during which Glu is converted into Gla.","input":"What are the main sources of vitamin k?"},{"output":"flock","context":"This is a list of English terms of venery (venery being an archaic word for hunting), comprising terms from a tradition that arose in the Late Middle Ages, at least partly from the Book of Saint Albans of 1486, a historic list of \\"company terms\\".

It is by a wide margin the most abundant neurotransmitter in the vertebrate nervous system.[1] It is used by every major excitatory function in the vertebrate brain, accounting in total for well over 90% of the synaptic connections in the human brain. It also serves as the primary neurotransmitter for some localized brain regions, such as cerebellum granule cells.\\r\\n\\r\\nBiochemical receptors for glutamate fall into three major classes, known as AMPA receptors, NMDA receptors, and metabotropic glutamate receptors. A fourth class, known as kainate receptors, are similar in many respects to AMPA receptors, but much less abundant. Many synapses use multiple types of glutamate receptors. AMPA receptors are ionotropic receptors specialized for fast excitation:  in many synapses they produce excitatory electrical responses in their targets a fraction of a millisecond after being stimulated.  NMDA receptors are also ionotropic, but they differ from AMPA receptors in being permeable, when activated, to calcium.  Their properties make them particularly important for learning and memory. Metabotropic receptors act through second messenger systems to create slow, sustained effects on their targets.\\r\\n\\r\\nBecause of its role in synaptic plasticity, glutamate is involved in cognitive functions such as  learning and memory in the brain.[2]  The form of plasticity known as long-term potentiation takes place at glutamatergic synapses in the hippocampus, neocortex, and other parts of the brain.  Glutamate works not only as a point-to-point transmitter, but also through spill-over synaptic crosstalk between synapses in which summation of glutamate released from a neighboring synapse creates extrasynaptic signaling/volume transmission.[3]  In addition, glutamate plays important roles in the regulation of growth cones and synaptogenesis during brain development.\\r\\n\\r\\nGlutamate is a major constituent of a wide variety of proteins; consequently it is one of the most abundant amino acids in the human body.[1]  Under ordinary conditions enough is obtained from the diet that there is no need for any to be synthesized.  Nevertheless, glutamate is formally classified as a non-essential amino acid, because it can be synthesized from alpha-Ketoglutaric acid, which is produced as part of the citric acid cycle by a series of reactions whose starting point is citrate.  Glutamate cannot cross the blood-brain barrier unassisted, but it is actively transported into the nervous system by a high affinity transport system, which maintains its concentration in brain fluids at a fairly constant level.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nGlutamate is synthesized in the central nervous system from glutamine as part of the glutamate-glutamine cycle by the enzyme glutaminase. This can occur in the presynaptic neuron or in neighboring glial cells.\\r\\n\\r\\nGlutamate itself serves as metabolic precursor for the neurotransmitter GABA, via the action of the enzyme glutamate decarboxylase.\\r\\n\\r\\nGlutamate exerts its effects by binding to and activating cell surface receptors. In mammals, four families of glutamate receptors have been identified, known as AMPA receptors, kainate receptors, NMDA receptors, and metabotropic glutamate receptors.  The first three families are ionotropic, meaning that when activated they open membrane channels that allow ions to pass through. The metabotropic family are G protein-coupled receptors, meaning that they exert their effects via a complex second messenger system.\\r\\n\\r\\nGlutamate transporters, EAAT and VGLUT, are found in neuronal and glial membranes. They rapidly remove glutamate from the extracellular space. In brain injury or disease, they often work in reverse, and excess glutamate can accumulate outside cells. This process causes calcium ions to enter cells via NMDA receptor channels, leading to neuronal damage and eventual cell death, and is called excitotoxicity.[5] The mechanisms of cell death include\\r\\n\\r\\nExcitotoxicity due to excessive glutamate release and impaired uptake occurs as part of the ischemic cascade and is associated with stroke,[9] autism,[10] some forms of intellectual disability, and diseases such as  amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, lathyrism, and Alzheimer's disease.[9][11] In contrast, decreased glutamate release is observed under conditions of classical phenylketonuria[12]  leading to developmental disruption of glutamate receptor expression.[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nGlutamic acid has been implicated in epileptic seizures. Microinjection of glutamic acid into neurons produces spontaneous depolarisations around one second apart, and this firing pattern is similar to what is known as paroxysmal depolarizing shift in epileptic attacks. This change in the resting membrane potential at seizure foci could cause spontaneous opening of voltage-activated calcium channels, leading to glutamic acid release and further depolarization.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nGlutamate functions as a neurotransmitter in every type of animal that has a nervous system, including ctenophores (comb jellies), which branched off from other phyla at an early stage in evolution and lack the other neurotransmitters found ubiquitously among animals, including serotonin and acetylcholine.[14] Rather, ctenophores have functionally distinct types of ionotropic glutamate receptors,[14]  such that activation of these receptors may trigger muscle contraction and other responses.[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nSponges do not have a nervous system, but also make use of glutamate for cell-to-cell signalling.  Sponges possess metabotropic glutamate receptors, and application of glutamate to a sponge can trigger a whole-body response that sponges use to rid themselves of contaminants.[15] The genome of Trichoplax, a primitive organism that also lacks a nervous system, contains numerous metabotropic glutamate receptors, but their function is not yet known.[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn arthropods and nematodes, glutamate stimulates glutamate-gated chloride channels.[citation needed]  The  subunits of the receptor respond with very high affinity to glutamate and glycine.[17] Targeting these receptors has been the therapeutic goal of anthelmintic therapy using avermectins.  Avermectins target the alpha subunit of glutamate-gated chloride channels with high affinity.[18] These receptors have also been described in arthropods, such as Drosophila melanogaster[19] and Lepeophtheirus salmonis.[20] Irreversible activation of these receptors with avermectins results in hyperpolarization at synapses and neuromuscular junctions resulting in flaccid paralysis and death of nematodes and arthropods.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe presence of glutamate in every part of the body as a building-block for protein made its special role in the nervous system difficult to recognize: its function as a neurotransmitter was not generally accepted until the 1970s, decades after the identification of acetylcholine, norepinephrine, and serotonin as neurotransmitters.[21] The first suggestion that glutamate might function as a transmitter came from T. Hayoshi in 1952, who was motivated by the finding that injections of glutamate into the cerebral ventricles of dogs could cause them to have seizures.[21][22]\\r\\nOther support for this idea soon appeared, but the majority of physiologists were skeptical, for a variety of theoretical and empirical reasons.  One of the most common reasons for skepticism was the universality of glutamate's excitatory effects in the central nervous system, which seemed inconsistent with the specificity expected of a neurotransmitter.[21]  Other reasons for skepticism included a lack of known antagonists and the absence of a known mechanism for inactivation.  A series of discoveries during the 1970s resolved most of these doubts, and by 1980 the compelling nature of the evidence was almost universally recognized.[21]","input":"What part of the brain does glutamate affect?"},{"output":"almost a million","context":"","input":"How many australian soldiers fought in world war 2?"},{"output":"John Fogerty","context":"\\"Proud Mary\\" is a rock song written by John Fogerty and first recorded by his band Creedence Clearwater Revival. The song was released by Fantasy Records as a single from the band's second studio album, Bayou Country, which was released by the same record company in January 1969. The single is generally considered to have been released in early January 1969 [1][2] although at least one source[3] states that it came out just before Christmas 1968. The song became a major hit in the United States, peaking at #2 on the Billboard Hot 100 in March 1969, the first of five non-consecutive singles to peak at #2 for the group.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a 1969 interview, Fogerty said that he wrote it in the two days after he was discharged from the National Guard.[6] In the liner notes for the 2008 expanded reissue of Bayou Country, Joel Selvin explained that the songs for the album started when John Fogerty was in the National Guard, that the riffs for \\"Proud Mary\\", \\"Born on the Bayou\\", and \\"Keep on Chooglin'\\" were conceived by Fogerty at a concert in the Avalon Ballroom, and \\"Proud Mary\\" was arranged from parts of different songs, one of which was about a washerwoman named Mary.[3] The line \\"Left a good job in the city\\" was written following Fogerty's discharge from the National Guard, and the line \\"rollin' on the river\\" was from a movie by Will Rogers.[7]\\r\\nIn the Macintosh program \\"Garage Band\\", Fogerty explained that he liked Beethoven's Fifth Symphony, and wanted to open a song with a similar intro, implying the way \\"Proud Mary\\" opens with the repeated C chord to A chord. The basic track for \\"Proud Mary\\", as with the other songs on the album, was recorded by John Fogerty (lead guitar), Tom Fogerty (rhythm guitar), Stu Cook (bass), and Doug Clifford (drums) at RCA Studios in Hollywood, California, with John overdubbing instruments and all the vocals later.[3]\\r\\nIn 1969 Solomon Burke had a small hit with his cover of the song, which was his second release for Bell and was co-produced by singer Tamiko Jones,[18] who was being rehabilitated after a bout of polio,[19] and was at the time Burke's fiance and manager. Burke recalls: We went to Muscle Shoals and recorded Proud Mary, which they didnt like at all. They thought it was stupid to record a song Proud Mary, which was already on the charts. I was explaining to them that it was a very big record, but its a very white record, a pop record. We will redo the record, open up the doors for it to get on the r&b charts and make the black stations to play the record... It was a Solomon Burke record made in Muscle Shoals. We proved that we can make a hit record without Jerry Wexler eating sandwiches with us. This record was a hit without anybodys help. Proud Mary was only promoted by Tamiko Jones and myself. According to Mark Denning, \\"While that may have seemed like a bald-faced bid for pop radio play, in Burke's hands the song became a bracing tale of life in the Deep South as African-Americans searched for liberation aboard the ship that carried them as slaves and put them to undignified labor serving wealthy whites.\\"[20]\\r\\nJohn Fogerty, the song's composer, was impressed by Burke's version of his song: \\"Two thousand miles away this man had crawled right up inside my head to learn what Proud Mary was all about. Sure, it's great when someone sings your song, but when he understands it, you listen like it was the first time.\\" \\"Reworked as a celebration of black consciousness, his potent mix of gospel and country ÿ the kind that defined his earlier sides for Atlantic ÿ and driven by a Southern funk-like strut, .... it returned Burke to the US R&B Top 20\\",[21] with the single reaching #15 on the R&B charts and #45 on the pop charts. According to Burke in a 2002 interview: \\"I was in Vegas for sixteen weeks at the Sands Hotel. I missed this record being a hit, because we werent there to promote the record, we had no backing. The greatest thing I ever did was tell Ike Turner, Hey man, you should get on this record I think you and Tina could tear this thing up.[22] On 24 May 1969 Burke sang his version of \\"Proud Mary\\" on American Bandstand.[23][24][25]\\r\\n\\"Funkier Than a Mosquita's Tweeter\\" (U.S.)\\r\\nIke & Tina Turner first covered \\"Proud Mary\\" in 1970. This version was released as a single from their Workin' Together album and the song differed greatly from the structure of the original, but is also well known and has become one of Tina Turner's most recognizable signature songs. The Turners' version was substantially rearranged by Soko Richardson[26][27] and Ike Turner. The song started off with a slow, sultry soulful tone in which Tina introduced the song and warned the audience that she and the band were gonna start it off \\"nice and easy\\" as \\"we never do nothing nice and easy\\" but said they would finish it \\"nice and rough\\". After the lyrics are first sung softly by the Turners, the song is then turned into a funk rock vamp with Tina and the Ikettes delivering gospel-influenced vocals. It reached #4 on the pop charts on March 27, 1971, two years to the week after Creedence Clearwater Revival's version was at its peak, and won the Grammy Award for Best R&B Vocal Performance by a Group in 1972.\\r\\nIn the Tina Turner biopic, What's Love Got to Do with It, the song is performed in a timeline of events in Ike and Tina's career in which the couple are transformed from an opening act to The Rolling Stones to a major headlining act by the mid-1970s. However, the film took significant liberties with that timeline; for instance, the film has the group performing the song in 1968 when they reportedly opened for The Stones in the UK, the Turners first opened for them in the UK in 1966 and opened for them again in 1969; by that time, the song wasn't in their set list. Following the original version's release and its success, Ike and Tina included the song in their live act and first performed a version of the song on The Ed Sullivan Show. It was also performed in 1971 (the year of the Turners' version's release) and 1974. The Turners performed the song on Soul Train on April 22, 1972.[28]\\r\\nIn 1988, a live solo version was included on the album Tina Live in Europe. Tina Turner later re-recorded the song in the studio for the biopic's 1993 soundtrack album of the same name. This version was released as a promotional single issued to radio stations and DJs. Tina's solo version was later included on her 2004 greatest hits album All the Best. After a contestant's performance of the song on The X Factor in 2010, this version entered the UK Singles Chart at #62 and fell to #121 the next week, it also entered the Scottish Singles Chart at #40.\\r\\nAnother live version was released in 2009 on the Tina Live album.

Its mission is to provide the New York metropolitan area with military installation support for the Army National Guard and the United States Army Reserve. The original fort was completed in 1831, with major additions made in the 1870s and 1900s. However, all defenses except about half of the original fort have been demolished or buried.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 4 July 1776, a small American battery (the Narrows Fort)[2] on the site of today's Fort Hamilton (the east side of the Narrows) fired into one of the British men-of-war convoying troops to suppress the American Revolution. HMS Asia suffered damage and casualties, but opposition to the immense fleet could be little more than symbolic. However, this very significant event marked one of the earliest uses of the site for military purposes.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe War of 1812 underscored the importance of coastal defense (since the British burned parts of Washington, DC) and helped to promote a new round of fort building. The new forts, including Fort Hamilton, were eventually termed the third system of US seacoast forts. The cornerstone for Fort Hamilton was set in place by its designer, Simon Bernard, on June 11, 1825.[3] Bernard was previously a French military engineer under Napoleon, who had joined the US Army after Napoleon's defeat in 1815. Six years and a half million dollars later, the fort was ready to receive its garrison, initially Battery F of the 4th US Artillery.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nFort Hamilton (now the Casemate Fort, Whiting Quadrangle) was designed primarily as a landward defense for Fort Lafayette, although it had a sea-facing front as well. Fort Lafayette was offshore on Hendricks Reef, and was demolished in the 1960s to make room for the eastern tower of the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge. Fort Hamilton was in the shape of a trapezoid, with the wide side facing the Narrows and the narrow side facing inland.[4] It had two tiers of cannon all around: a casemated tier inside the fort and a barbette tier on the roof. Loopholes for muskets were provided on the three landward sides. A dry ditch also protected these three sides. A caponier, a rare feature in US forts, projected into the ditch to defend it against attack. Two smaller caponiers enclosed the ends of the ditch, projecting off the seacoast front. The fort's sally port was in the middle of this front.  A square redoubt with its own ditch was located behind the fort to provide an initial landward defense position.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nThough references to the structure as Fort Hamilton occur as early as 1826, it was not officially named for the former Senior Officer of the United States Army and first Secretary of the Treasury, Alexander Hamilton, until the twentieth century. In 1839 the Federal government gave permission to New York State's 27th Regiment to drill at the fort, thus qualifying it as the nation's first National Guard training camp.[5] The following year, it allocated $20,000 to improve the fort's armaments, and Captain Robert E. Lee, then an officer of the Army Corps of Engineers, was assigned the task of improving the defenses of the fort as well as those of other military installations in the area.[5] Lee served as Fort Hamilton's post engineer from 1841 to 1846 and is credited with the initial design of several subsequent New York-area forts, notably the rebuilt Fort Richmond[6] and Fort Tompkins,[7] along with the Fort at Willets Point[8] and the Fort at Sandy Hook.[9] Lieutenant Thomas \\"Stonewall\\" Jackson also served at Fort Hamilton, and Captain Abner Doubleday served as the post commander in 1861, shortly after serving at Fort Sumter during the bombardment that started the Civil War.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the Civil War, Fort Hamilton's garrison expanded. A ship barrier across the Narrows assisted Fort Hamilton and its sister forts on Staten Island, now called Fort Wadsworth, in protecting the harbor against the possibility of Confederate raiders. The forts also provided troops to help put down the New York Draft Riots of 1863. Fort Hamilton also served as a prisoner-of-war camp, and an exterior \\"New Battery\\" of guns was added.[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nRifled cannon made vertical-walled masonry fortifications obsolete during the Civil War. The first response of the US coast defense forces to this was a series of new batteries, with guns in open positions behind low earth walls and brick magazines with heavy earth cover between the guns. Most of these were located near existing forts. In 1871 construction began at Fort Hamilton on an 8-gun water battery and a 15-gun mortar battery, but the latter was never completed or armed.[10] Money for these projects ran out in the late 1870s, and US coast defense languished, with few improvements completed for nearly 20 years.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 1885 Board of Fortifications, chaired by Secretary of War William C. Endicott and also called the Endicott Board, recommended sweeping improvements to US coast defenses, with a new generation of modern breech-loading rifled guns and numerous new gun batteries. Most of the Board's recommendations were adopted as the Endicott program, and that included major changes and improvements for Fort Hamilton. More than half of the old fort was demolished to make room for new concrete gun batteries. Fort Hamilton became part of the Artillery District of New York, renamed in 1913 as the Coast Defenses of Southern New York.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe following table shows the gun batteries completed at Fort Hamilton from 1898 to 1905. In most cases references do not indicate the precise model of gun or carriage at a particular battery, or the batteries' namesakes:[3][11]\\r\\n\\r\\nSeveral batteries (Burke, Johnston, Brown, and Griffin) were directly in front of the remains of the old fort, with Battery Griffin in front of and below the others. The other batteries extended in a line southeast of the old fort, with Battery Piper, the mortar battery, well to the rear of the line. Battery Griffin seems to have been designed as a mixed battery of two each M1898 and M1903 3-inch guns. The 4.72-inch guns of this battery were hastily added after the outbreak of the SpanishÿAmerican War in 1898; they were British guns purchased because most of the Endicott program was still years from completion.[13] The 4.72-inch/45 caliber guns were transferred to Fort Kamehameha, Hawaii in 1913 to concentrate this type of weapon in one area. Battery Livingston was also an unusual combination of two disappearing 6-inch guns and two guns on pedestal mounts. Batteries Gillmore and Spear were originally a 7-gun battery under the former name, but were split up in 1903, probably for improved fire control.[3][11]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe American entry into World War I brought many changes to Fort Hamilton, as at most other coast defense installations. Numerous temporary buildings were constructed to house the influx of new recruits, draftees, and units in training prior to deployment overseas. As the Coast Artillery was one of the Army's few sources of trained personnel, the branch was chosen to operate almost all US-manned heavy and railway artillery in that war, most of which was French- or British-made. Most personnel at the forts were transferred to new heavy artillery regiments. Also, several of Fort Hamilton's guns were dismounted for potential service on the Western Front; however, very few Army Coast Artillery weapons were actually used in that war, due to shipping priorities and extensive training. Battery Spear's three 10-inch guns were dismounted for potential use as railway artillery. The eight 6-inch guns of Batteries Burke and Mendenhall were dismounted for potential use on field carriages. Two of these guns, along with four of Battery Piper's 12-inch mortars, were used as the first batteries of Fort Tilden in nearby Far Rockaway, Queens. The removal of half of the mortars was also part of a forcewide program to improve the rate of fire of the remaining mortars. None of the weapons removed from Fort Hamilton in World War I were returned to the fort.[3][11]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe end of World War I also meant more changes for Fort Hamilton. Around 1920 Battery Livingston's pair of 6-inch disappearing guns were transferred to West Point to be used for training cadets. These two guns are preserved today at Fort Pickens near Pensacola, Florida and Battery Chamberlin at the Presidio of San Francisco, the last 6-inch disappearing guns outside of the Philippines. Battery Griffin's pair of 3-inch M1898 guns was removed in 1920, part of a withdrawal from service of some gun types. In 1921 two long-range batteries of 12-inch guns were completed at Fort Hancock, New Jersey, and by 1924 the installation of 16-inch guns at Fort Tilden relegated Fort Hamilton to the second line of New York's coast defenses. In 1937 Battery Neary's pair of 12-inch guns was removed.[3][11]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn World War II Fort Hamilton primarily served as a mobilization center, as it had in World War I. Except for the two remaining 6-inch pedestal guns of Battery Livingston and the pair of 3-inch guns at Battery Griffin, the remaining guns were gradually scrapped; the pair of 16-inch guns at the Highlands Military Reservation in New Jersey along with Fort Tilden superseded the older defenses. An anti-aircraft battery, probably of 90 mm guns, was at the fort during the war.[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nShortly after World War II it was decided that gun coast defenses were obsolete. In 1948, the last coast defense gun was removed from Fort Hamilton.[14] A battery of four 120 mm M1 guns was at the fort 1952-54, part of the Cold War air defense system.[10] In the late 1950s and early 1960s the now-disused gun batteries were demolished or buried for the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge and the Belt Parkway.[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe following Regular Army units were established at Fort Hamilton:\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the 1960s, Fort Hamilton also served as the home for the United States Army Chaplain School as it moved from the recently closed Fort Slocum. Hundreds of Army, Army Reserve and Army National Guard Chaplains and their assistants were trained here for active duty and reserve ministries to soldiers and their dependents. The school was later moved across the Narrows to Fort Wadsworth, and still later to Fort Jackson, South Carolina where it now resides.\\r\\n\\r\\nFort Hamilton is the last active-duty military post in New York City.[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nAt present, U.S. Army Fort Hamilton Garrison is the home of the New York City Recruiting Battalion, the Military Entrance Processing Station, the North Atlantic Division Headquarters of the United States Army Corps of Engineers, the 1179th Transportation Brigade and the 722nd Aeromedical Staging Squadron, the latter organization being a geographically separated unit (GSU) of the 439th Airlift Wing of the Air Force Reserve Command.\\r\\n\\r\\nFort Hamilton also supports many Army Reserve and New York Army National Guard units, These Army National Guard units include the 133d Quartermaster Company, Company C/642d Aviation Support Battalion, 222d Chemical Company, and the 107th Military Police Company.  In October 1997, Fort Hamilton came under the command of the Military District of Washington and in October 2002, under Army Transformation, Fort Hamilton became part of the Installation Management Agency - Northeast Region.\\r\\n\\r\\nConstruction of the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge in the early 1960s did away with several historic structures, including Fort Lafayette, which was located near the Brooklyn shore where the bridge tower now rises from the water. During the same period, efforts toward saving the historical heritage of the Narrows increased. Part of the U.S. Army's contribution to preserving this heritage is in the Harbor Defense Museum at Fort Hamilton.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe original fort later became the Officers' Club and now houses the Community Club.  The  caponier, a miniature fort guarding the main fort's gate, now houses the Harbor Defense Museum. Other notable landmarks include the Robert E. Lee House, where Lee, then a captain, resided while post engineer of the garrison,[15] and Colonels' Row, six historic townhouses that used to house senior officers. All of these structures are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the 2000s, the historic parade field that once lay behind the old New York Area Command (NYAC) Headquarters Building and the Military Personnel Office, former site of numerous ceremonies and festivities, was developed into swiftly built privatized housing. The historic flag pole and cannon are still present at the site, near the old headquarters building and across from the Post Exchange barber shop.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2007, the historic, brick barracks, located on the plot of land within Pershing Loop on the eastern portion of the base, which formerly housed the New York Area Command's Ceremonial Platoon and Military Police Company, was demolished. The ceremonial platoon, consisting of only infantrymen, once performed funeral honors and ceremonial functions (such as deployment as color guards in New York City parades, or firing cannons to start the New York City Marathon), in the greater N.Y. area, including Long Island, New York City, as well as parts of New Jersey, along with the 26th Army Band unit that was similar to the Old Guard in Washington, D.C.\\r\\n\\r\\nA Civil War-era experimental 20-inch Rodman gun, one of only two remaining and the largest gun produced by either side in that period, is in John Paul Jones Park immediately north of the fort. Numerous shells for this weapon are displayed on the fort grounds. An ex-Navy 12\\"/45 caliber Mark V Mod 8 gun is also displayed on post, representative of the type of weapon the fort had in the Endicott era.\\r\\n\\r\\nFort Hamilton is the setting for nearly all of Nelson DeMille's novel, Word of Honor.[16]","input":"What is the closest military base to new york city?"},{"output":"Seattle","context":"Washington is a state located in the Western United States. According to the 2010 United States Census, Washington is the 13th most populous state with 7006672454300000000?6,724,543 inhabitants but the 20th largest by land area spanning 66,455.52 square miles (172,119.0?km2) of land.[1] Washington is divided into 39 counties and contains 281 incorporated municipalities consisting of cities and towns.[2]\\r\\nLegally, a city in Washington can be described primarily by its class. There are five classes of municipalities in Washington: first class city, second class city, town, unclassified city, and code city.\\r\\nFirst class cities are the 10 cities with a population over 10,000 at the time of reorganization and operating under a home rule charter. They are permitted to perform any function specifically granted them by Title 35 RCW (Revised Code of Washington). Second class cities are the 9 cities with a population over 1,500 at the time of reorganization and operating without a home rule charter. Like first class cities, they are permitted to perform any function specifically granted them by Title 35 RCW. Towns are the 69 municipalities with a population of under 1,500 at the time of reorganization. Towns are not authorized to operate under a charter. Like the previously listed cities, they are permitted to perform any function specifically granted them by Title 35 RCW. In 1994, the legislature made 1,500 the minimum population required to incorporate. Unclassified cities are cities that are not operating under any other class. Only one cityWaitsburg, in Walla Walla Countyis unclassified. It operates under the 1881 territorial charter under which it was organized, eight years before Washington was admitted to the Union in 1889. Code cities were created by the state legislature in order to grant the greatest degree of local control to municipalities possible under the state constitution and general law. This classification has been adopted by 192 municipalities in Washington. Code cities (shorthand for optional municipal code cities, as encoded by Title 35A RCW) are authorized to perform any function not specifically denied them in the state constitution or by state law. They may perform any function granted to any other city classification under Title 35 RCW.\\r\\nA city in Washington can be described by its form of government. Cities and towns are specifically authorized three forms of government: Commission, Mayor-Council, Council-Manager. Only the city of Shelton using the three-member commission form of government. Most cities in Washington have the Mayor-Council form of government, which calls for an elected mayor and an elected city council. Cities with Council-Manager system have an elected council and appointed city manager. In addition, if the population of code cites is over 10,000, may incorporate as charter code cities. They may then \\"set out any plan of government deemed 'suitable for the good government of the city'\\" (RCW 35A.08.050), which need not be a commission, mayor-council, or council-manager form. No charter code city has opted for a different type of government as of 2012[update].\\r\\nThe largest municipality by population in Washington is Seattle with 608,660 residents, and the smallest municipality by population is Krupp with 48 residents.[1] The largest municipality by land area is Seattle, which spans 83.84?sq?mi (217.1?km2), while Beaux Arts Village is the smallest at 0.08?sq?mi (0.21?km2).[1]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSkyline of Seattle, Washington's largest city\\r\\nSkyline of Spokane, Washington's second largest city\\r\\nSkyline of Tacoma, a satellite city in the Seattle metropolitan area and Washington's third largest city\\r\\nSkyline of Vancouver, a suburb in the Portland metropolitan area and Washington's fourth largest city\\r\\nAerial view of Bellevue, a boomburb in the Seattle metropolitan area and the fifth largest municipality in Washington\\r\\nAerial view of Kent, a suburb in the Seattle metropolitan area and the sixth largest municipality in Washington\\r\\nDowntown Everett, a satellite city in the Seattle metropolitan area and the seventh largest city in Washington\\r\\nSkyline of Yakima, Washington's eleventh largest city\\r\\n??State capital and county seat \\r\\n??County seat","input":"What are the 5 largest cities in washington state?"},{"output":"Ramsey County","context":"Saint Paul (abbreviated St. Paul) is the capital and second-most populous city of the U.S. state of Minnesota. As of 2016, the city's estimated population was 304,442.[5] Saint Paul is the county seat of Ramsey County, the smallest and most densely populated county in Minnesota.[6] The city lies mostly on the east bank of the Mississippi River in the area surrounding its point of confluence with the Minnesota River, and adjoins Minneapolis, the state's largest city. Known as the \\"Twin Cities\\", the two form the core of MinneapolisÿSaint Paul, the 16th-largest metropolitan area in the United States, with about 3.52 million residents.[7]\\r\\nFounded near historic Native American settlements as a trading and transportation center, the city rose to prominence when it was named the capital of the Minnesota Territory in 1849. The Dakota name for Saint Paul is \\"Imnizaska\\". Though Minneapolis (Bdeota) is better-known nationally, Saint Paul contains the state government and other important institutions.[8] Regionally, the city is known for the Xcel Energy Center, home of the Minnesota Wild,[9] and for the Science Museum of Minnesota.[10][11] As a business hub of the Upper Midwest, it is the headquarters of companies such as Ecolab.[12] Saint Paul, along with its Twin City, Minneapolis, is known for its high literacy rate. It was the only city in the United States with a population of 250,000 or more to see an increase in circulation of Sunday newspapers in 2007.[13]\\r\\nThe settlement originally began at present-day Lambert's Landing, but was known as Pig's Eye after Pierre \\"Pig's Eye\\" Parrant established a popular tavern there. When Lucien Galtier, the first Catholic pastor of the region, established the Log Chapel of Saint Paul (shortly thereafter to become the first location of the Cathedral of Saint Paul), he made it known that the settlement was now to be called by that name, as \\"Saint Paul as applied to a town or city was well appropriated, this monosyllable is short, sounds good, it is understood by all Christian denominations\\".[14]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBurial mounds in present-day Indian Mounds Park suggest that the area was originally inhabited by the Hopewell Native Americans about two thousand years ago.[15][16] From the early 17th century until 1837, the Mdewakanton Dakota, a tribe of the Sioux, lived near the mounds after fleeing their ancestral home of Mille Lacs Lake from advancing Ojibwe.[15][17] They called the area I-mni-za ska dan (\\"little white rock\\") for its exposed white sandstone cliffs.[18][19]\\r\\nFollowing the Louisiana Purchase in 1803, US Army officer Zebulon Pike negotiated approximately 100,000 acres (40,000?ha; 160?sq?mi) of land from the local Dakota tribes in 1805 to establish a fort. The negotiated territory was located on both banks of the Mississippi River, starting from Saint Anthony Falls in present-day Minneapolis, to its confluence with the Saint Croix River.[20] Fort Snelling was built on the territory in 1819 at the confluence of the Mississippi and Minnesota rivers, which formed a natural barrier to both Native American nations. The 1837 Treaty with the Sioux ceded all local tribal land east of the Mississippi to the U.S. Government.[21] Taoyateduta (Chief Little Crow V) moved his band at Kaposia across the river to the south.[22][23] Fur traders, explorers, and missionaries came to the area for the fort's protection. Many of the settlers were French-Canadians who lived nearby. However, as a whiskey trade flourished, military officers banned settlers from the fort-controlled lands. Pierre \\"Pig's Eye\\" Parrant, a retired fur trader-turned-bootlegger who particularly irritated officials,[24] set up his tavern, the Pig's Eye, near present-day Lambert's Landing.[19] By the early 1840s, the community had become important as a trading center and a destination for settlers heading west. Locals called the area Pig's Eye (French: L'?il du Cochon) or Pig's Eye Landing after Parrant's popular tavern.[24]\\r\\nIn 1841, Father Lucien Galtier was sent to minister to the Catholic French Canadians and established a chapel, named for his favorite saint, Paul the Apostle, on the bluffs above Lambert's Landing.[25][26] Galtier intended for the settlement to adopt the name Saint Paul in honor of the new chapel.[24] In 1847, a New York educator named Harriet Bishop moved to the area and opened the city's first school.[27] The Minnesota Territory was formalized in 1849 and Saint Paul named as its capital. In 1857, the territorial legislature voted to move the capital to Saint Peter. However, Joe Rolette, a territorial legislator, stole the physical text of the approved bill and went into hiding, thus preventing the move.[28] On May 11, 1858, Minnesota was admitted to the union as the thirty-second state, with Saint Paul as the capital.\\r\\nThat year, more than 1,000 steamboats were in service at Saint Paul,[27] making the city a gateway for settlers to the Minnesota frontier or Dakota Territory. Natural geography was a primary reason that the city became a landing. The area was the last accessible point to unload boats coming upriver due to the Mississippi River Valley's stone bluffs. During this period, Saint Paul was called \\"The Last City of the East.\\"[29] Industrialist James J. Hill constructed and expanded his network of railways into the Great Northern Railway and Northern Pacific Railway, which were headquartered in Saint Paul. Today they are collectively part of the BNSF Railway.[29]\\r\\nOn August 20, 1904, severe thunderstorms and tornadoes damaged hundreds of downtown buildings, causing USD $1.78 million ($48.48 million present-day) in damages to the city and ripping spans from the High Bridge.[30] In the 1960s, during urban renewal, Saint Paul razed western neighborhoods close to downtown. The city also contended with the creation of the interstate freeway system in a fully built landscape.[31] From 1959 to 1961, the western Rondo Neighborhood was demolished by the construction of Interstate 94, which brought attention to racial segregation and unequal housing in northern cities.[32] The annual Rondo Days celebration commemorates the African American community.[33]\\r\\nDowntown had short skyscraper-building booms beginning in the 1970s. The tallest buildings, such as Galtier Plaza (Jackson and Sibley Towers), The Pointe of Saint Paul condominiums, and the city's tallest building, Wells Fargo Place (formerly Minnesota World Trade Center), were constructed in the late 1980s.[34] In the 1990s and 2000s, the tradition of bringing new immigrant groups to the city continued. As of 2004, nearly 10% of the city's population were recent Hmong immigrants from Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia, Thailand, and Myanmar.[35] Saint Paul is the location of the Hmong Archives.[36]\\r\\nSaint Paul's history and growth as a landing port are tied to water. The city's defining physical characteristic, the confluence of the Mississippi and Minnesota Rivers, was carved into the region during the last ice age, as were the steep river bluffs and dramatic palisades on which the city is built. Receding glaciers and Lake Agassiz forced torrents of water from a glacial river that undercut the river valleys.[37] The city is situated in east-central Minnesota.\\r\\nThe Mississippi River forms a municipal boundary on part of the city's west, southwest, and southeast sides. Minneapolis, the state's largest city, lies to the west. Falcon Heights, Lauderdale, Roseville, and Maplewood are north, with Maplewood lying to the east. The cities of West Saint Paul and South Saint Paul are to the south, as are Lilydale, Mendota, and Mendota Heights, although across the river from the city. The city's largest lakes are Pig's Eye Lake, which is part of the Mississippi, Lake Phalen, and Lake Como. According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 56.18 square miles (145.51?km2), of which 51.98 square miles (134.63?km2) is land and 4.20 square miles (10.88?km2) is water.[1]\\r\\nSaint Paul's Department of Planning and Economic Development divides Saint Paul into seventeen Planning Districts, created in 1979 to allow neighborhoods to participate in governance and use Community Development Block Grants. With a funding agreement directly from the city, the councils share a pool of funds.[38] The councils have significant land-use control, a voice in guiding development, and they organize residents.[39] The boundaries are adjusted depending on population changes; as such, they sometimes overlap established neighborhoods.[40] Though these neighborhoods changed over time, preservationists have saved many of their historically significant structures.\\r\\nThe city's seventeen Planning Districts are:\\r\\nSaint Paul has a continental climate typical of the Upper Midwestern United States. Winters are frigid and snowy, while summers are warm to hot and humid. On the K?ppen climate classification, Saint Paul falls in the hot summer humid continental climate zone (Dfa). The city experiences a full range of precipitation and related weather events, including snow, sleet, ice, rain, thunderstorms, tornadoes, and fog.[41]\\r\\nDue to its northerly location in the United States and lack of large bodies of water to moderate the air, Saint Paul is sometimes subjected to cold Arctic air masses, especially during late December, January, and February. The average annual temperature of 47.05?F (8.36?C) gives the Minneapolis?Saint Paul metropolitan area the coldest annual mean temperature of any major metropolitan area in the continental U.S.[42]\\r\\nThe earliest known inhabitants from about 400 A.D. were members of the Hopewell tradition who buried their dead in mounds (now Indian Mounds Park) on the bluffs above the river. The next known inhabitants were the Mdewakanton Dakota in the 17th century who fled their ancestral home of Mille Lacs Lake in central Minnesota in response to westward expansion of the Ojibwe nation.[17] The Ojibwe would later occupy the north (east) bank of the Mississippi River.\\r\\nBy 1800, French-Canadian explorers came through the region and attracted fur traders to the area. Fort Snelling and nearby Pig's Eye Tavern also brought the first Yankees from New England and English, Irish, and Scottish immigrants who had enlisted in the army and settled nearby after discharge. These early settlers and entrepreneurs built houses on the heights north of the river. The first wave of immigration came with the Irish who settled at Connemara Patch along the Mississippi, named for their home in Connemara Ireland. The Irish would become prolific in politics, city governance, and public safety, much to the chagrin of the Germans and French who had grown into the majority. In 1850, the first of many groups of Swedish immigrants passed through Saint Paul on their way to farming communities in northern and western regions of the territory. A large group settled in Swede Hollow, which would later become home to Poles, Italians, and Mexicans. The last Swedish presence had moved up Saint Paul's East Side along Payne Avenue in the 1950s.[51]\\r\\nIn terms of people who specified European ancestry in the 2005-2007 American Community Survey, the city was 26.4% German, 13.8% Irish, 8.4% Norwegian, 7.0% Swedish, and 6.2% English. There is also a visible community of people of Sub-Saharan African ancestry, representing 4.2% of Saint Paul's population. By the 1980s, the Thomas Dale area, once an Austro-Hungarian enclave known as Frogtown (German: Froschburg), became home to Vietnamese people who left their war-torn country. Soon after a settlement program for the Hmong diaspora came, and by 2000, the Saint Paul Hmong were the largest urban contingent in the United States.[52][53][54] Mexican immigrants have settled in Saint Paul's West Side since the 1930s, and have grown enough that Mexico opened a foreign consulate in 2005.[55][56]\\r\\nThe majority of residents claiming religious affiliation are Christian, split between the Roman Catholic Church and various Protestant denominations. The Roman Catholic presence comes from Irish, German, Scottish, and French Canadian settlers who, in time, would be bolstered by Hispanic immigrants. There are Jewish synagogues such as Mount Zion Temple and relatively small populations of Hindus, Muslims, and Buddhists.[57] The city has been dubbed \\"paganistan\\" due to its large Wiccan population.[58]\\r\\nAs of the 2005-2007 American Community Survey conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau, White Americans made up 66.5% of Saint Paul's population; of which 62.1% were non-Hispanic whites, down from 93.6% in 1970.[49] Blacks or African Americans made up 13.9% of Saint Paul's population; of which 13.5% were non-Hispanic blacks.

Pacific Islander Americans made up less than 0.1% of Saint Paul's population. Individuals from some other race made up 3.4% of Saint Paul's population; of which 0.2% were non-Hispanic. Individuals from two or more races made up 3.1% of Saint Paul's population; of which 2.6% were non-Hispanic. In addition, Hispanics and Latinos made up 8.7% of Saint Paul's population.\\r\\nAs of the 2000 U.S. Census,[59] there were 287,151 people, 112,109 households, and 60,999 families residing in the city. The racial makeup of the city was 67.0% White, 11.7% African American, 1.1% Native American, 12.4% Asian (mostly Hmong), 0.1% Pacific Islander, 3.8% from other races, and 3.9% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 7.9% of the population.\\r\\nAs of the census[2] of 2010, there were 285,068 people, 111,001 households, and 59,689 families residing in the city. The population density was 5,484.2 inhabitants per square mile (2,117.5/km2). There were 120,795 housing units at an average density of 2,323.9 per square mile (897.3/km2). The racial makeup of the city was 60.1% white, 15.7% African American, 1.1% Native American, 15.0% Asian, 0.1% Pacific Islander, 3.9% from other races, and 4.2% from two or more races.

The gender makeup of the city was 48.9% male and 51.1% female.\\r\\nThe MinneapolisÿSaint PaulÿBloomington area employs 1,570,700 people in the private sector as of July 2008, 82.43 percent of which work in private service providing-related jobs.[60]\\r\\nMajor corporations headquartered in Saint Paul include Ecolab, a chemical and cleaning product company[61] which was named in 2008 by the Minneapolis / St. Paul Business Journal as the eighth best place to work in the Twin Cites for companies with 1,000 full-time Minnesota employees,[62] and Securian Financial Group Inc.[63]\\r\\nThe 3M Company is often cited as one of Saint Paul's companies, though it is located in adjacent Maplewood. 3M employs 16,000 people throughout Minnesota.[64] St. Jude Medical, a manufacturer of medical devices, is directly across the northern border of Saint Paul in Little Canada,[65] though the company's address is listed in Saint Paul.[66]\\r\\nThe city was home to the Ford Motor Company's Twin Cities Assembly Plant, which opened in 1924 and closed at the end of 2011. The plant was in Highland Park on the Mississippi River, adjacent to Lock and Dam No. 1, Mississippi River, which generates hydroelectric power.[67] The site is now being cleared of all buildings and tested for contamination to prepare for redevelopment.[68]\\r\\nThe city of Saint Paul has financed city development by use of tax increment financing (TIF). In 2018, the city had 55 TIF districts. Some projects that have benefited from TIF funding include the St. Paul Saints stadium, as well as building affordable housing along the Twin Cities Metro Green Line.[69]\\r\\nIn winter months, Saint Paul hosts the Saint Paul Winter Carnival, a tradition that began in 1886 when a New York reporter called Saint Paul \\"another Siberia.\\" Attended by 350,000 visitors annually, the event showcases ice sculpting, an annual treasure hunt, winter food, activities, and an ice palace.[70] The Como Zoo and Conservatory and adjoining Japanese Garden are popular year-round. The historic Landmark Center in downtown Saint Paul hosts cultural and arts organizations. The city's notable recreation locations include Indian Mounds Park, Battle Creek Regional Park, Harriet Island Regional Park, Highland Park, the Wabasha Street Caves, Lake Como, Lake Phalen, and Rice Park, as well as several areas abutting the Mississippi River. The Irish Fair of Minnesota is also held annually at the Harriet Island Pavilion area. And the country's largest Hmong American sports festival, the Freedom Festival, is held the first weekend of July at McMurray Field near Como Park.\\r\\nThe city is associated with the Minnesota State Fair in nearby Falcon Heights just west of Saint Paul's Como Park neighborhood and southeast of the University of Minnesota Saint Paul Campus. Though Fort Snelling is on the Minneapolis side of the Mississippi River bluff, the area including Fort Snelling State Park and Pike Island is managed by the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources headquartered in the city.[71]\\r\\nSaint Paul is the birthplace of cartoonist Charles M. Schulz (Peanuts), who lived in Merriam Park from infancy until 1960.[72] Schulz's Snoopy cartoon inspired giant, decorated Peanuts sculptures around the city, a Chamber of Commerce promotion in the late 1990s.[73] Other notable residents include writer F. Scott Fitzgerald, playwright August Wilson, who premiered many of the ten plays in his Pittsburgh Cycle at the local Penumbra Theater, painter LeRoy Neiman, and photographer John Vachon.[74]\\r\\nThe Ordway Center for the Performing Arts hosts theater productions and the Minnesota Opera is a founding tenant.[75] RiverCentre, attached to Xcel Energy Center, serves as the city's convention center. The city has contributed to the music of Minnesota and the Twin Cities music scene through various venues. Great jazz musicians have passed through the influential Artists' Quarter, first established in the 1970s in Whittier, Minneapolis, and moved to downtown Saint Paul in 1994.[76] Artists' Quarter also hosts the Soapboxing Poetry Slam, home of the 2009 National Poetry Slam Champions. At The Black Dog, in Lowertown, many French or European jazz musicians (Evan Parker, Tony Hymas, Beno?t Delbecq, Fran?ois Corneloup...) have met Twin Cities musicians and started new groups touring in Europe. Groups and performers such as Fantastic Merlins, Dean Magraw/Davu Seru, Merciless Ghosts, and Willie Murphy are regulars. The Turf Club in Midway has been a music scene landmark since the 1940s.[77] Saint Paul is also the home base of the internationally acclaimed Rose Ensemble.[78] As an Irish stronghold, the city boasts popular Irish pubs with live music, such as Shamrocks, The Dubliner, and O'Gara's. The internationally acclaimed Saint Paul Chamber Orchestra is the nation's only full-time professional chamber orchestra.[79] The Minnesota Centennial Showboat on the Mississippi River began in 1958 with Minnesota's first centennial celebration.[80]\\r\\nSaint Paul hosts a number of museums, including the University of Minnesota's Goldstein Museum of Design,[81] the Minnesota Children's Museum,[82] the Schubert Club Museum of Musical Instruments,[83][84] the Minnesota Museum of American Art,[85][86] the Traces Center for History and Culture,[87] the Minnesota History Center, the Alexander Ramsey House, the James J. Hill House, the Minnesota Transportation Museum, the Science Museum of Minnesota, and The Twin City Model Railroad Museum.\\r\\nThe Saint Paul division of Parks and Recreation runs over 1,500 organized sports teams.[88] In addition, the Parks and Recreation department is responsible for 160 parks and 41 recreation centers.[89]\\r\\nSaint Paul hosts a number of professional, semi-professional, and amateur sports teams. The Minnesota Wild[9] play their home games in downtown Saint Paul's Xcel Energy Center, which opened in 2000. The Wild brought the NHL back to Minnesota for the first time since 1993, when the Minnesota North Stars left the state for Dallas, Texas.[9] (The World Hockey Association's Minnesota Fighting Saints played in Saint Paul from 1972 to 1977.) Citing the history of hockey in the Twin Cities and teams at all levels, Sports Illustrated called Saint Paul the new Hockeytown U.S.A. in 2007.[90]\\r\\nThe Xcel Energy Center, a multipurpose entertainment and sports venue, can host concerts and accommodate nearly all sporting events. It occupies the site of the demolished Saint Paul Civic Center. The Xcel Energy Center hosts the Minnesota high school boys hockey tournament, the Minnesota high school girls' volleyball tournament, and concerts throughout the year. In 2004, it was named the best overall sports venue in the US by ESPN.[91]\\r\\nThe St. Paul Saints is the city's independent league baseball team. There have been several different teams called the Saints over the years. Founded in 1884, they were shut down in 1961 after the Minnesota Twins moved to Bloomington. The St. Paul Saints were brought back in 1993 as an independent baseball team in the Northern League, moving to the American Association in 2006. Their home games are played at the open-air CHS Field in downtown's Lowertown Historic District.[92] Four noted Major League All-Star baseball players are natives of Saint Paul: Hall of Fame outfielder Dave Winfield, Hall of Fame infielder Paul Molitor, pitcher Jack Morris, and first baseman Joe Mauer. The all-black St. Paul Colored Gophers played four seasons in Saint Paul from 1907 to 1911.[93]\\r\\nThe St. Paul Twin Stars of the National Premier Soccer League play their home games at Macalester Stadium.[94] The first curling club in Saint Paul was founded in 1888. The current club, the St. Paul Curling Club, was founded in 1912 and is the largest curling club in the United States.[95] The Minnesota RollerGirls are a flat-track roller derby league based in the Roy Wilkins Auditorium. Minnesota's oldest athletic organization, the Minnesota Boat Club, resides in the Mississippi River on Raspberry Island.[96] Saint Paul is also home to Circus Juventas, the largest circus arts school in North America.[97]\\r\\nOn March 25, 2015, Major League Soccer announced that it had awarded its 23rd MLS franchise to Minnesota United FC, a team from the lower-level North American Soccer League. Bill McGuire and his ownership group, which includes Jim Pohlad of the Minnesota Twins, Glen Taylor of the Minnesota Timberwolves, former Minnesota Wild investor Glen Nelson, and his daughter Wendy Carlson Nelson of the Carlson hospitality company, had intended to build a privately financed soccer-specific stadium in Downtown Minneapolis near the Minneapolis Farmer's Market, but their plan was met with heavy opposition from Minneapolis Mayor Betsy Hodges, who said her city was suffering from \\"stadium fatigue\\" after building three stadiums, for the Minnesota Twins, Minnesota Vikings and the Minnesota Golden Gophers, within a six-year span.[98] On July 1, 2015, after failing to reach an agreement with the city of Minneapolis, McGuire and his partners turned their focus to Saint Paul.[99]\\r\\nOn October 23, 2015, Bill McGuire of Minnesota United FC and Saint Paul Mayor Chris Coleman announced that a privately financed soccer-specific stadium would be built on the vacant Metro Transit bus barn site in Saint Paul's Midway neighborhood near the intersection of Snelling Avenue and University Avenue. It is midway between downtown Saint Paul and downtown Minneapolis. The stadium will open in 2019 and seat 19,400. The team will play in the MLS in 2017.[100]\\r\\nThe Timberwolves, Twins, Vikings, and Lynx all play in Minneapolis.[101]\\r\\nSaint Paul has a variation of the strong mayor-council form of government.[104] The mayor is the chief executive and chief administrative officer for the city and the seven-member city council is the legislative body.[105][106] The mayor is elected by the entire city, while members of the city council are elected from seven different geographic wards of approximately equal population.[107][108] Both the mayor and council members serve four-year terms.[109] The current mayor is Melvin Carter (DFL). Carter is Saint Paul's first African-American mayor. Aside from Norm Coleman, who became a Republican during his second term, Saint Paul has not elected a Republican mayor since 1952.[110]\\r\\nThe city is also the county seat of Ramsey County, named for Alexander Ramsey, the state's first governor. The county once spanned much of the present-day metropolitan area and was originally to be named Saint Paul County after the city. Today it is geographically the smallest county and the most densely populated.[6] Ramsey is the only home rule county in Minnesota; the seven-member Board of Commissioners appoints a county manager whose office is in the combination city hall/county courthouse along with the Minnesota Second Judicial Courts.[111][112] The nearby Law Enforcement Center houses the Ramsey County Sheriff's office.\\r\\nSaint Paul is the capital of the state of Minnesota. The city hosts the capitol building, designed by Saint Paul resident Cass Gilbert, and the House and Senate office buildings. The Minnesota Governor's Residence, which is used for some state functions, is on Summit Avenue. The Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party (affiliated with the Democratic Party) is headquartered in Saint Paul. Numerous state departments and services are also headquartered in Saint Paul, such as the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources.\\r\\nThe city is split into four Minnesota Senate districts (64, 65, 66 and 67) and eight Minnesota House of Representatives districts (64A, 64B, 65A, 65B, 66A, 66B, 67A and 67B), all of which are held by Democrats.[113][114]\\r\\nSaint Paul is the heart of Minnesota's 4th congressional district, represented by Democrat Betty McCollum. The district has been in DFL hands without interruption since 1949. Minnesota is represented in the US Senate by Democrat Amy Klobuchar, a former Hennepin County Attorney, and Democrat Tina Smith, former Lieutenant Governor of Minnesota.\\r\\n*District also includes Falcon Heights, Lauderdale and Roseville .\\r\\nSaint Paul is second in the United States in the number of higher education institutions per capita.[115] Higher education institutions that call Saint Paul home include three public and eight private colleges and universities and five post-secondary institutions. Well-known colleges and universities include the Saint Catherine University, Concordia University, Hamline University, Macalester College, and the University of St. Thomas. Metropolitan State University and Saint Paul College, which focus on non-traditional students, are based in Saint Paul, as well as a law school, Mitchell Hamline School of Law.[116]\\r\\nThe Saint Paul Public Schools district is the state's largest school district and serves approximately 39,000 students. The district is extremely diverse with students from families speaking 90 different languages, although only five languages are used for most school communication: English, Spanish, Hmong, Karen, and Somali. The district runs 82 different schools, including 52 elementary schools, twelve middle schools, seven high schools, ten alternative schools, and one special education school, employing over 6,500 teachers and staff. The school district also oversees community education programs for pre-K and adult learners, including Early Childhood Family Education, GED Diploma, language programs, and various learning opportunities for community members of all ages. In 2006, Saint Paul Public Schools celebrated its 150th anniversary.[117] Some students attend public schools in other school districts chosen by their families under Minnesota's open enrollment statute.[118]\\r\\nA variety of K-12 private, parochial, and public charter schools are also represented in the city. In 1992, Saint Paul became the first city in the US to sponsor and open a charter school, now found in most states across the nation.[119] Saint Paul is currently home to 21 charter schools as well as 38 private schools.[120] The Saint Paul Public Library system includes a Central Library and twelve branch locations.[121]\\r\\nResidents of Saint Paul can receive 10 broadcast television stations, five of which broadcast from within Saint Paul. One daily newspaper, the St. Paul Pioneer Press, two weekly neighborhood newspapers, the East Side Review and City Pages (owned by The Star Tribune Company), and several monthly or semimonthly neighborhood papers serve the city. Several media outlets based in neighboring Minneapolis also serve the Saint Paul community, including the Star Tribune. Saint Paul is home to Minnesota Public Radio, a three-format system that broadcasts on nearly 40 stations[122] around the Midwest. MPR locally delivers news and information, classical, and The Current (which plays a wide variety of music). The station has 110,000 regional members and more than 800,000 listeners each week throughout the Upper Midwest, the largest audience of any regional public radio network.[123] Also operating as part of American Public Media, MPR's programming reaches five million listeners, most notably through Live from Here, hosted by Chris Thile (previously known as A Prairie Home Companion, hosted by Garrison Keillor, who also lives in the city).[123] The Fitzgerald Theater, renamed in 1994 for Saint Paul native and novelist F. Scott Fitzgerald, is home to the show.[124]\\r\\nInterstate Highways\\r\\n Interstate 35E\\r\\n Interstate 94\\r\\nUS Highways\\r\\n US 10\\r\\n US 52\\r\\n US 61\\r\\nMinnesota Highways\\r\\n Highway 5\\r\\n Highway 51\\r\\n Highway 280\\r\\nResidents use Interstate 35E running north-south and Interstate 94 running east-west. Trunk highways include U.S. Highway 52, Minnesota State Highway 280, and Minnesota State Highway 5. Saint Paul has several unique roads such as Ayd Mill Road, Phalen Boulevard and Shepard Road/Warner Road, which diagonally follow particular geographic features in the city. Biking is also gaining popularity, due to the creation of more paved bike lanes that connect to other bike routes throughout the metropolitan area[125] and the creation of Nice Ride Minnesota, a seasonally operated nonprofit bicycle sharing and rental system that has over 1,550 bicycles and 170 stations in both Minneapolis and Saint Paul.[126] Downtown Saint Paul has a five-mile (8?km) enclosed skyway system over twenty-five city blocks.[127] The 563-mile (906?km) Avenue of the Saints connects Saint Paul with Saint Louis, Missouri.\\r\\nThe layout of city streets and roads has often drawn complaints. While he was Governor of Minnesota, Jesse Ventura appeared on the Late Show with David Letterman,[128] and remarked that the streets were designed by \\"drunken Irishmen\\".[129] He later apologized, though people had been complaining about the fractured grid system for more than a century by that point.[129] Some of the city's road design is the result of the curve of the Mississippi River, hilly topography, conflicts between developers of different neighborhoods in the early city, and grand plans only half-realized. Outside of downtown, the roads are less confusing, but most roads are named, rather than numbered, increasing the difficulty for non-natives to navigate.[130]\\r\\nMetro Transit provides bus service and light rail in the MinneapolisÿSaint Paul area. The METRO Green Line is an 11-mile (18?km) light rail line that connects downtown Saint Paul to downtown Minneapolis with 14 stations in Saint Paul. The Green Line runs west along University Avenue, through the University of Minnesota campus, until it links up and then shares stations with the METRO Blue Line in downtown Minneapolis. Construction began in November 2010 and the line began service on June 14, 2014.[131] Roughly 45,000 people rode on the first day; an average 28,000 riders are expected per day.[132]\\r\\nMetro Transit opened the METRO A Line, MinneapolisÿSaint Paul's first arterial bus rapid transit line, along Snelling Avenue and Ford Parkway. The A Line connects the METRO Blue Line at 46th Street station to Rosedale Center with a connection at the Green Line Snelling Avenue station. The A Line is the first in a series of planned arterial bus rapid transit lines and is set to open in early 2016.[133]\\r\\nAmtrak's Empire Builder between Chicago and Seattle stops once daily in each direction at the newly renovated Saint Paul Union Station.[134] Ridership on the train is increasing, about 6% from 2005 to over 505,000 in fiscal year 2007.[135] Increased ridership has prompted southern Minnesota leaders to plan for an expansion of Amtrak's service in the area.[135] Saint Paul is the site of the Pig's Eye Yard, a major freight classification yard for Canadian Pacific Railway.[136] As of 2003, the yard handled over 1,000 freight cars per day.[136] Both Union Pacific and Burlington Northern Santa Fe run trains through the yard, though they are not classified at Pig's Eye.[136] Burlington Northern Santa Fe operates the large Northtown Yard in Minneapolis, which handles about 600 cars per day.[137] There are several other small yards located around the city.\\r\\nSaint Paul is served by the MinneapolisÿSaint Paul International Airport (MSP), which sits on 3,400 acres (14?km2)[138] southwest of the city on the west side of the Mississippi River between Minnesota State Highway 5, Interstate 494, Minnesota State Highway 77, and Minnesota State Highway 62. The airport serves three international, twelve domestic, seven charter, and four regional carriers[139] and is a hub and home base for Delta Air Lines, Mesaba Airlines and Sun Country Airlines.[140] Saint Paul is also served by the St. Paul Downtown Airport located just south of downtown, across the Mississippi River. The airport, also known as Holman Field, is a reliever airport run by the Metropolitan Airports Commission. The airport houses Minnesota's Air National Guard and is tailored to local corporate aviation.[141] There are three runways that serve about 100 resident aircraft and a flight training school. The Holman Field Administration Building and Riverside Hangar are on the National Register of Historic Places.[141]\\r\\nSaint Paul has eight sister cities, as designated by Sister Cities International: [142][143][144]\\r\\nNation:\\r\\nStates:\\r\\nTerritories:","input":"What county is st paul mn located in?"},{"output":"Tiberius","context":"Tiberius (/ta??b??ri?s/; Latin: Tiberius Caesar Divi Augusti filius Augustus;[1][2] 16 November 42 BC ÿ 16 March 37 AD) was Roman emperor from 14 AD to 37 AD, succeeding the first emperor, Augustus. \\r\\n\\r\\nBorn to Tiberius Claudius Nero and Livia Drusilla in a Claudian family, he was given the personal name Tiberius Claudius Nero. His mother divorced Nero and married Octavianlater to ascend to Emperor as Augustuswho officially became his stepfather. Tiberius would later marry Augustus' daughter (from his marriage to Scribonia), Julia the Elder, and even later be adopted by Augustus. Through the adoption, he officially became a  Julian, assuming the name Tiberius Julius Caesar. The emperors after Tiberius would continue this blended dynasty of both families for the following thirty years; historians have named it the Julio-Claudian dynasty. In relations to the other emperors of this dynasty, Tiberius was the stepson of Augustus, grand-uncle of Caligula, paternal uncle of Claudius, and great-grand uncle of Nero. His 22-and-a-half-year reign would be the longest after Augustus's until Antoninus Pius, who surpassed his reign by a few months.\\r\\n\\r\\nTiberius was one of the greatest Roman generals; his conquest of Pannonia, Dalmatia, Raetia, and temporarily, parts of Germania, laid the foundations for the northern frontier. Even so, he came to be remembered as a dark, reclusive and sombre ruler who never really desired to be emperor; Pliny the Elder called him \\"the gloomiest of men.\\"[3] After the death of his son Drusus Julius Caesar in 23 AD, Tiberius became more reclusive and aloof. In 26 AD he removed himself from Rome and left administration largely in the hands of his unscrupulous Praetorian prefects Lucius Aelius Sejanus and Quintus Naevius Sutorius Macro. When Tiberius died, he was succeeded by his grand-nephew and adopted grandson, Caligula.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nTiberius was born in Rome on 16 November 42?BC to Tiberius Claudius Nero and Livia.[5][6] In 39?BC his mother divorced his biological father and remarried Gaius Julius Caesar Octavianus shortly thereafter, while still pregnant with Tiberius Nero's son. In 38?BC his brother, Nero Claudius Drusus, was born.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nLittle is recorded of Tiberius's early life. In 32?BC Tiberius, at the age of nine, delivered the eulogy for his biological father at the rostra.[8] In 29?BC, he rode in the triumphal chariot along with his adoptive father Octavian in celebration of the defeat of Antony and Cleopatra at Actium.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 23?BC Emperor Augustus became gravely ill and his possible death threatened to plunge the Roman world into chaos again. Historians generally agree that it is during this time that the question of Augustus' heir became most acute, and while Augustus had seemed to indicate that Agrippa and Marcellus would carry on his position in the event of his death, the ambiguity of succession became Augustus' chief problem.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn response, a series of potential heirs seem to have been selected, among them Tiberius and his brother Drusus. In 24?BC, at the age of seventeen, Tiberius entered politics under Augustus' direction, receiving the position of quaestor,[10] and was granted the right to stand for election as praetor and consul five years in advance of the age required by law.[11] Similar provisions were made for Drusus.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nShortly thereafter Tiberius began appearing in court as an advocate,[13] and it is presumably here that his interest in Greek rhetoric began. In 20?BC, Tiberius was sent East under Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa.[14] The Parthian Empire had captured the standards of the legions under the command of Marcus Licinius Crassus (53?BC) (at the Battle of Carrhae), Decidius Saxa (40?BC), and Mark Antony (36?BC).[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter a year of negotiation, Tiberius led a sizable force into Armenia, presumably with the goal of establishing it as a Roman client state and ending the threat it posed on the Roman-Parthian border. Augustus was able to reach a compromise whereby the standards were returned, and Armenia remained a neutral territory between the two powers.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nTiberius married Vipsania Agrippina, the daughter of Augustuss close friend and greatest general, Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa.[15] He was appointed to the position of praetor, and was sent with his legions to assist his brother Drusus in campaigns in the west. While Drusus focused his forces in Gallia Narbonensis and along the German frontier, Tiberius combated the tribes in the Alps and within Transalpine Gaul, conquering Raetia. In 15?BC he discovered the sources of the Danube, and soon afterwards the bend of the middle course.[16] Returning to Rome in 13?BC, Tiberius was appointed as consul, and around this same time his son, Drusus Julius Caesar, was born.[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nAgrippa's death in 12?BC elevated Tiberius and Drusus with respect to the succession. At Augustus request in 11 BC, Tiberius divorced Vipsania and married Julia the Elder, Augustus' daughter and Agrippa's widow.[18][15] Tiberius was very reluctant to do this, as Julia had made advances to him when she was married and Tiberius was happily married. His new marriage with Julia was happy at first, but turned sour.[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nReportedly, Tiberius once ran into Vipsania again, and proceeded to follow her home crying and begging forgiveness;[15] soon afterwards, Tiberius met with Augustus, and steps were taken to ensure that Tiberius and Vipsania would never meet again.[19] Tiberius continued to be elevated by Augustus, and after Agrippa's death and his brother Drusus' death in 9?BC, seemed the clear candidate for succession. As such, in 12?BC he received military commissions in Pannonia and Germania; both areas highly volatile and of key importance to Augustan policy.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 6 BC, Tiberius launched a pincer movement against the Marcomanni. Setting out northwest from Carnuntum on the Danube with four legions, Tiberius passed through Quadi territory in order to invade Marcomanni territory from the east. Meanwhile, general Gaius Sentius Saturninus would depart east from Moguntiacum on the Rhine with two or three legions, pass through newly annexed Hermunduri territory, and attack the Marcomanni from the west. The campaign was a resounding success, but Tiberius could not subjugate the Marcomanni because he was soon summoned to the Rhine frontier to protect Rome's new conquests in Germania.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe returned to Rome and was consul for a second time in 7?BC, and in 6?BC was granted tribunician power (tribunicia potestas) and control in the East,[20] all of which mirrored positions that Agrippa had previously held. However, despite these successes and despite his advancement, Tiberius was not happy.[21]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 6?BC, on the verge of accepting command in the East and becoming the second most powerful man in Rome, Tiberius suddenly announced his withdrawal from politics and retired to Rhodes.[22] The precise motives for Tiberius's withdrawal are unclear.[23] Historians have speculated a connection with the fact that Augustus had adopted Julia's sons by Agrippa, Gaius and Lucius, and seemed to be moving them along the same political path that both Tiberius and Drusus had trodden.[24]\\r\\n\\r\\nTiberius's move thus seemed to be an interim solution: he would hold power only until his stepsons would come of age, and then be swept aside. The promiscuous, and very public, behavior of his unhappily married wife, Julia,[25] may have also played a part.[20] Indeed, Tacitus calls it Tiberius' intima causa, his innermost reason for departing for Rhodes, and seems to ascribe the entire move to a hatred of Julia and a longing for Vipsania.[26] Tiberius had found himself married to a woman he loathed, who publicly humiliated him with nighttime escapades in the Roman Forum, and forbidden to see the woman he had loved.[27]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhatever Tiberius's motives, the withdrawal was almost disastrous for Augustus's succession plans. Gaius and Lucius were still in their early teens, and Augustus, now 57 years old, had no immediate successor. There was no longer a guarantee of a peaceful transfer of power after Augustus's death, nor a guarantee that his family, and therefore his family's allies, would continue to hold power should the position of princeps survive.[27]\\r\\n\\r\\nSomewhat apocryphal stories tell of Augustus pleading with Tiberius to stay, even going so far as to stage a serious illness.[27] Tiberius's response was to anchor off the shore of Ostia until word came that Augustus had survived, then sailing straightway for Rhodes.[28] Tiberius reportedly regretted his departure and requested to return to Rome several times, but each time Augustus refused his requests.[29]\\r\\n\\r\\nWith Tiberius's departure, succession rested solely on Augustus' two young grandsons, Lucius and Gaius Caesar. The situation became more precarious in AD?2 with the death of Lucius. Augustus, with perhaps some pressure from Livia, allowed Tiberius to return to Rome as a private citizen and nothing more.[30] In AD?4, Gaius was killed in Armenia, and Augustus had no other choice but to turn to Tiberius.[31][32]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe death of Gaius in AD?4 initiated a flurry of activity in the household of Augustus. Tiberius was adopted as full son and heir and in turn, he was required to adopt his nephew, Germanicus, the son of his brother Drusus and Augustus' niece Antonia Minor.[31][33] Along with his adoption, Tiberius received tribunician power as well as a share of Augustus's maius imperium, something that even Marcus Agrippa may never have had.[34]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn AD?7, Agrippa Postumus, a younger brother of Gaius and Lucius, was disowned by Augustus and banished to the island of Pianosa, to live in solitary confinement.[32][35] Thus, when in AD?13, the powers held by Tiberius were made equal, rather than second, to Augustus's own powers, he was for all intents and purposes a \\"co-princeps\\" with Augustus, and, in the event of the latter's passing, would simply continue to rule without an interregnum or possible upheaval.[36]\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, according to Suetonius, after a two-year stint in Germania, which lasted from 10?12 AD,[37] \\"Tiberius returned and celebrated the triumph which he had postponed, accompanied also by his generals, for whom he had obtained the triumphal regalia. And before turning to enter the Capitol, he dismounted from his chariot and fell at the knees of his father, who was presiding over the ceremonies.[38] \\"Since the consuls caused a law to be passed soon after this that he should govern the provinces jointly with Augustus and hold the census with him, he set out for Illyricum on the conclusion of the lustral ceremonies.\\"[39]\\r\\n\\r\\nThus, according to Suetonius, these ceremonies and the declaration of his \\"co-princeps\\" took place in the year 12 AD, after Tiberius' return from Germania.[37] \\"But he was at once recalled, and finding Augustus in his last illness but still alive, he spent an entire day with him in private.\\"[39] Augustus died in AD?14, a month before his 76th birthday.[40] He was buried with all due ceremony and, as had been arranged beforehand, deified, his will read, and Tiberius, now a middle aged man at 55, was confirmed as his sole surviving heir.[41]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Senate convened on 18 September, to validate Tiberius's position as Princeps and, as it had done with Augustus before, extend the powers of the position to him.[42] These proceedings are fully accounted by Tacitus.[43] Tiberius already had the administrative and political powers of the Princeps, all he lacked were the titlesAugustus, Pater Patriae, and the Civic Crown (a crown made from laurel and oak, in honor of Augustus having saved the lives of Roman citizens).\\r\\n\\r\\nTiberius, however, attempted to play the same role as Augustus: that of the reluctant public servant who wants nothing more than to serve the state.[44][45] This ended up throwing the entire affair into confusion, and rather than humble, he came across as derisive; rather than seeming to want to serve the state, he seemed obstructive.[46] He cited his age as a reason why he could not act as Princeps, stated he did not wish the position, and then proceeded to ask for only a section of the state.[47] Tiberius finally relented and accepted the powers voted to him, though according to Tacitus and Suetonius he refused to bear the titles Pater Patriae, Imperator, and Augustus, and declined the most solid emblem of the Princeps, the Civic Crown and laurels.[48]\\r\\n\\r\\nThis meeting seems to have set the tone for Tiberius's entire rule. He seems to have wished for the Senate and the state to simply act without him and his direct orders were rather vague, inspiring debate more on what he actually meant than on passing his legislation.[49] In his first few years, Tiberius seemed to have wanted the Senate to act on its own,[50] rather than as a servant to his will as it had been under Augustus. According to Tacitus, Tiberius derided the Senate as \\"men fit to be slaves.\\"[51]\\r\\n\\r\\nProblems arose quickly for the new Princeps. The Roman legions posted in Pannonia and in Germania had not been paid the bonuses promised them by Augustus, and after a short period of time mutinied when it was clear that a response from Tiberius was not forthcoming.[52] Germanicus and Tiberius's son, Drusus Julius Caesar, were dispatched with a small force to quell the uprising and bring the legions back in line.[53]\\r\\n\\r\\nRather than simply quell the mutiny, however, Germanicus rallied the mutineers and led them on a short campaign across the Rhine into Germanic territory, stating that whatever treasure they could grab would count as their bonus.[53] Germanicus's forces crossed the Rhine and quickly occupied all of the territory between the Rhine and the Elbe. Additionally, Tacitus records the capture of the Teutoburg forest and the reclaiming of Roman standards lost years before by Publius Quinctilius Varus,[54] when three Roman legions and its auxiliary cohorts had been ambushed by Germanic tribes.[55]\\r\\n\\r\\nGermanicus had managed to deal a significant blow to Rome's enemies, quell an uprising of troops, and returned lost standards to Rome, actions that increased the fame and legend of the already very popular Germanicus with the Roman people.[56]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter being recalled from Germania,[57] Germanicus celebrated a triumph in Rome in AD?17,[54] the first full triumph that the city had seen since Augustus's own in 29?BC. As a result, in AD?18 Germanicus was granted control over the eastern part of the empire, just as both Agrippa and Tiberius had received before, and was clearly the successor to Tiberius.[58] Germanicus survived a little over a year before dying, accusing Gnaeus Calpurnius Piso, the governor of Syria, of poisoning him.[59]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Pisones had been longtime supporters of the Claudians, and had allied themselves with the young Octavian after his marriage to Livia, the mother of Tiberius. Germanicus's death and accusations indicted the new Princeps. Piso was placed on trial and, according to Tacitus, threatened to implicate Tiberius.[60] Whether the governor actually could connect the Princeps to the death of Germanicus is unknown; rather than continuing to stand trial when it became evident that the Senate was against him, Piso committed suicide.[61][62]\\r\\n\\r\\nTiberius seems to have tired of politics at this point. In AD?22, he shared his tribunician authority with his son Drusus,[63] and began making yearly excursions to Campania that reportedly became longer and longer every year. In AD?23, Drusus mysteriously died,[64][65] and Tiberius seems to have made no effort to elevate a replacement. Finally, in AD?26, Tiberius retired from Rome to an Imperial villa-complex he had inherited from Augustus, on the island of Capri. It was just off the coast of Campania, which was a traditional holiday retreat for Rome's upper classes, particularly those who valued cultured leisure (otium) and a Hellenised lifestyle.[66][67]\\r\\n\\r\\nLucius Aelius Sejanus had served the imperial family for almost twenty years when he became Praetorian Prefect in AD?15. As Tiberius became more embittered with the position of Princeps, he began to depend more and more upon the limited secretariat left to him by Augustus, and specifically upon Sejanus and the Praetorians. In AD?17 or 18, Tiberius had trimmed the ranks of the Praetorian Guard responsible for the defense of the city, and had moved it from encampments outside of the city walls into the city itself,[68] giving Sejanus access to somewhere between 6000 and 9000 troops.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe death of Drusus elevated Sejanus, at least in Tiberius's eyes, who thereafter refers to him as his 'Socius Laborum' (Partner of my labours). Tiberius had statues of Sejanus erected throughout the city,[69][70] and Sejanus became more and more visible as Tiberius began to withdraw from Rome altogether. Finally, with Tiberius's withdrawal in AD?26, Sejanus was left in charge of the entire state mechanism and the city of Rome.[67]\\r\\n\\r\\nSejanus's position was not quite that of successor; he had requested marriage in AD?25 to Tiberius's niece, Livilla,[71] though under pressure quickly withdrew the request.[72] While Sejanus's Praetorians controlled the imperial post, and therefore the information that Tiberius received from Rome and the information Rome received from Tiberius,[73] the presence of Livia seems to have checked his overt power for a time. Her death in AD?29 changed all that.[74]\\r\\n\\r\\nSejanus began a series of purge trials of Senators and wealthy equestrians in the city of Rome, removing those capable of opposing his power as well as extending the imperial (and his own) treasury. Germanicus's widow Agrippina the Elder and two of her sons, Nero Julius Caesar and Drusus Caesar were arrested and exiled in AD?30 and later all died in suspicious circumstances. In Sejanus's purge of Agrippina the Elder and her family, Caligula, Agrippina the Younger, Julia Drusilla, and Julia Livilla were the only survivors.[75]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 31, Sejanus held the consulship with Tiberius in absentia,[76] and began his play for power in earnest. Precisely what happened is difficult to determine, but Sejanus seems to have covertly attempted to court those families who were tied to the Julians, and attempted to ingratiate himself with the Julian family line with an eye towards placing himself, as an adopted Julian, in the position of Princeps, or as a possible regent.[76] Livilla was later implicated in this plot, and was revealed to have been Sejanus's lover for a number of years.[77]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe plot seems to have involved the two of them overthrowing Tiberius, with the support of the Julians, and either assuming the Principate themselves, or serving as regent to the young Tiberius Gemellus or possibly even Caligula.[78] Those who stood in his way were tried for treason and swiftly dealt with.[78]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn AD?31 Sejanus was summoned to a meeting of the Senate, where a letter from Tiberius was read condemning Sejanus and ordering his immediate execution. Sejanus was tried, and he and several of his colleagues were executed within the week.[79] As commander of the Praetorian Guard, he was replaced by Naevius Sutorius Macro.[79]\\r\\n\\r\\nTacitus claims that more treason trials followed and that whereas Tiberius had been hesitant to act at the outset of his reign, now, towards the end of his life, he seemed to do so without compunction. Hardest hit were those families with political ties to the Julians. Even the imperial magistracy was hit, as any and all who had associated with Sejanus or could in some way be tied to his schemes were summarily tried and executed, their properties seized by the state.  As Tacitus vividly describes,\\r\\n\\r\\nExecutions were now a stimulus to his fury, and he ordered the death of all who were lying in prison under accusation of complicity with Sejanus. There lay, singly or in heaps, the unnumbered dead, of every age and sex, the illustrious with the obscure. Kinsfolk and friends were not allowed to be near them, to weep over them, or even to gaze on them too long. Spies were set round them, who noted the sorrow of each mourner and followed the rotting corpses, till they were dragged to the Tiber, where, floating or driven on the bank, no one dared to burn or to touch them.[80]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, Tacitus' portrayal of a tyrannical, vengeful emperor has been challenged by some historians: Edward Togo Salmon notes in A history of the Roman world from 30 BC to AD 138: \\r\\nIn the whole twenty two years of Tiberius' reign, not more than fifty-two persons were accused of treason, of whom almost half escaped conviction, while the four innocent people to be condemned fell victims to the excessive zeal of the Senate, not to the Emperor's tyranny.[81]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile Tiberius was in Capri, rumours abounded as to what exactly he was doing there. Suetonius records the rumours of lurid tales of sexual perversity, including graphic depictions of child molestation, and cruelty,[82] and most of all his paranoia.[83] While heavily sensationalized,[84] Suetonius' stories at least paint a picture of how Tiberius was perceived by the Roman senatorial class, and what his impact on the Principate was during his 23 years of rule.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe affair of Sejanus and the final years of treason trials permanently damaged Tiberius' image and reputation. After Sejanus's fall, Tiberius' withdrawal from Rome was complete; the empire continued to run under the inertia of the bureaucracy established by Augustus, rather than through the leadership of the Princeps. Suetonius records that he became paranoid,[83] and spent a great deal of time brooding over the death of his son. Meanwhile, during this period a short invasion by Parthia, incursions by tribes from Dacia and from across the Rhine by several Germanic tribes occurred.[85]\\r\\n\\r\\nLittle was done to either secure or indicate how his succession was to take place; the Julians and their supporters had fallen to the wrath of Sejanus, and his own sons and immediate family were dead. Two of the candidates were either Caligula, the sole surviving son of Germanicus, or Tiberius' own grandson, Tiberius Gemellus.[86] However, only a half-hearted attempt at the end of Tiberius' life was made to make Caligula a quaestor, and thus give him some credibility as a possible successor, while Gemellus himself was still only a teenager and thus completely unsuitable for some years to come.[87]\\r\\n\\r\\nTiberius died in Misenum on 16 March AD?37, in his seventy eighth year.[88][89][90]  Tacitus relates that the emperor appeared to have stopped breathing, and that Caligula, who was at Tiberius' villa, was being congratulated on his succession to the empire, when news arrived that the emperor had revived and was recovering his faculties.  Those who had moments before recognized Caligula as Augustus fled in fear of the emperor's wrath, while Macro took advantage of the chaos to have Tiberius smothered with his own bedclothes.[91]  Suetonius reports several rumours, including that the emperor had been poisoned by Caligula, starved, and smothered with a pillow; that recovering, and finding himself deserted by his attendants, he attempted to rise from his couch, but fell dead.[92]  According to Cassius Dio, Caligula, fearing that the emperor would recover, refused Tiberius' requests for food, insisting that he needed warmth, not food; then assisted by Macro, he smothered the emperor in his bedclothes.[93]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter his death, the Senate refused to vote Tiberius the divine honors that had been paid to Augustus, and mobs filled the streets yelling \\"To the Tiber with Tiberius!\\"; the bodies of criminals were typically thrown into the river, instead of being buried or burnt.[94] However, the emperor was cremated, and his ashes were quietly laid in the Mausoleum of Augustus, later to be scattered in AD 410 during the Sack of Rome.[95]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn his will, Tiberius had left his powers jointly to Caligula and Tiberius Gemellus.[96][97] Caligula's first act on becoming Princeps was to void Tiberius' will and have Gemellus executed.[97]\\r\\n\\r\\nTiberius' heir Caligula not only spent Tiberius' fortune of 2,700,000,000 sesterces but would also begin the chain of events which would bring about the downfall of the Julio-Claudian dynasty in AD 68.[98]\\r\\n\\r\\nWere he to have died prior to AD?23, he might have been hailed as an exemplary ruler.[99] Despite the overwhelmingly negative characterization left by Roman historians, Tiberius left the imperial treasury with nearly 3 billion sesterces upon his death.[97][100] Rather than embark on costly campaigns of conquest, he chose to strengthen the existing empire by building additional bases, using diplomacy as well as military threats, and generally refraining from getting drawn into petty squabbles between competing frontier tyrants.[68]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe result was a stronger, more consolidated empire. Of the authors whose texts have survived, only four describe the reign of Tiberius in considerable detail: Tacitus, Suetonius, Cassius Dio and Marcus Velleius Paterculus. Fragmentary evidence also remains from Pliny the Elder, Strabo and Seneca the Elder. Tiberius himself wrote an autobiography which Suetonius describes as \\"brief and sketchy\\", but this book has been lost.[101]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe most detailed account of this period is handed down to us by Tacitus, whose Annals dedicate the first six books entirely to the reign of Tiberius. Tacitus was a Roman senator, born during the reign of Nero in 56 AD, and consul suffect in AD 97. His text is largely based on the Acta Senatus (the minutes of the session of the Senate) and the Acta Diurna (a collection of the acts of the government and news of the court and capital), as well as speeches by Tiberius himself, and the histories of contemporaries such as Marcus Cluvius Rufus, Fabius Rusticus and Pliny the Elder (all of which are lost).[99]\\r\\n\\r\\nTacitus' narrative emphasizes both political and psychological motivation. His characterisation of Tiberius throughout the first six books is mostly negative, and gradually worsens as his rule declines, identifying a clear breaking point with the death of his son Drusus in 23 AD.[99]\\r\\n\\r\\nTacitus describes Julio-Claudian rule as generally unjust and \\"criminal\\";[102] he attributes the apparent virtues of Tiberius during his early reign to hypocrisy.[88] \\r\\nAnother major recurring theme concerns the balance of power between the Senate and the Emperors, corruption, and the growing tyranny among the governing classes of Rome. A substantial amount of his account on Tiberius is therefore devoted to the treason trials and persecutions following the revival of the maiestas law under Augustus.[103] Ultimately, Tacitus' opinion on Tiberius is best illustrated by his conclusion of the sixth book:\\r\\n\\r\\nHis character too had its distinct periods. It was a bright time in his life and reputation, while under Augustus he was a private citizen or held high offices; a time of reserve and crafty assumption of virtue, as long as Germanicus and Drusus were alive. Again, while his mother lived, he was a compound of good and evil; he was infamous for his cruelty, though he veiled his debaucheries, while he loved or feared Sejanus. Finally, he plunged into every wickedness and disgrace, when fear and shame being cast off, he simply indulged his own inclinations.[88]\\r\\n\\r\\nSuetonius was an equestrian who held administrative posts during the reigns of Trajan and Hadrian. The Twelve Caesars details a biographical history of the principate from the birth of Julius Caesar to the death of Domitian in AD?96. Like Tacitus, he drew upon the imperial archives, as well as histories by Aufidius Bassus, Marcus Cluvius Rufus, Fabius Rusticus and Augustus' own letters.[82]\\r\\n\\r\\nHis account is more sensationalist and anecdotal than that of his contemporary. The most famous sections of his biography delve into the numerous alleged debaucheries Tiberius remitted himself to while at Capri.[82] Nevertheless, Suetonius also reserves praise for Tiberius' actions during his early reign, emphasizing his modesty.[104]\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of the few surviving sources contemporary with the rule of Tiberius comes from Velleius Paterculus, who served under Tiberius for eight years (from AD?4) in Germany and Pannonia as praefect of cavalry and legatus. Paterculus' Compendium of Roman History spans a period from the fall of Troy to the death of Livia in AD?29. His text on Tiberius lavishes praise on both the emperor[10][105] and Sejanus.[106] How much of this is due to genuine admiration or prudence remains an open question, but it has been conjectured that he was put to death in AD?31 as a friend of Sejanus.[107]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Gospels mention that during Tiberius' reign, Jesus of Nazareth preached and was executed under the authority of Pontius Pilate, the Roman governor of Judaea province. In the Bible, Tiberius is mentioned by name in Luke 3:1,[108] which states that John the Baptist entered on his public ministry in the fifteenth year of his reign. The city of Tiberias (named after Tiberius) referenced in John 6:23, [109] is located on the Sea of Galilee, which was also known as the Sea of Tiberias and is referenced in John 6:1, [110]. Many other references to Caesar (or the emperor in some other translations), without further specification, would seem to refer to Tiberius. Similarly, the \\"Tribute Penny\\" referred to in Matthew[111] and Mark[112] is popularly thought to be a silver denarius coin of Tiberius.[113][114][115]\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring Tiberius' reign Jews had become more prominent in Rome and Jewish and Gentile followers of Jesus began proselytizing Roman citizens, increasing long-simmering resentments.[116] Tiberius in 19 AD ordered Jews who were of military age to join the Roman Army.[116] Tiberius banished the rest of the Jews from Rome and threatened to enslave them for life if they did not leave the city.[116]\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is considerable debate among historians as to when Christianity was differentiated from Judaism.[116] Most scholars believe that Roman distinction between Jews and Christians took place around 70 AD.[116]  Tiberius most likely viewed Christians as a Jewish sect rather than a separate, distinct faith.[116]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe palace of Tiberius at Rome was located on the Palatine Hill, the ruins of which can still be seen today. No major public works were undertaken in the city during his reign, except a temple dedicated to Augustus and the restoration of the theater of Pompey,[117][118] both of which were not finished until the reign of Caligula.[119] In addition, remnants of Tiberius' villa at Sperlonga, which includes a grotto where the important Sperlonga sculptures were found in fragments, and the Villa Jovis on top of Capri have been preserved. The estate at Capri is said by Tacitus to have included a total of twelve villas across the island,[67] of which Villa Jovis was the largest.\\r\\n\\r\\nTiberius refused to be worshipped as a living god, and allowed only one temple to be built in his honor, at Smyrna.[120] The town Tiberias, in modern Israel on the western shore of the Sea of Galilee, was named in Tiberius's honour by Herod Antipas.[121]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe theft of the Gold Tiberius, an unintentionally unique commemorative coin commissioned by Tiberius which is stated to have achieved legendary status in the centuries hence, from a mysterious triad of occultists drives the plot of the framing story in Arthur Machen's 1895 novel The Three Impostors.\\r\\n\\r\\nTiberius has been represented in fiction, in literature, film and television, and in video games, often as a peripheral character in the central storyline. One such modern representation is in the novel I, Claudius by Robert Graves,[122] and the consequent BBC television series adaptation, where he is portrayed by George Baker.[123] George R. R. Martin, the author of The Song of Ice and Fire series, has stated that central character Stannis Baratheon is partially inspired by Tiberius Caesar, and particularly the portrayal by Baker.[124]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the 1968 ITV historical drama The Caesars, Tiberius (by Andr Morell) is the central character for much of the series and is portrayed in a much more balanced way than in I, Claudius.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe also appears as a minor character in the 2006 film The Inquiry, in which he is played by Max von Sydow. In addition, Tiberius has prominent roles in Ben-Hur (played by George Relph in his last starring role),[125] and in A.D. (played by James Mason).\\r\\n\\r\\nPlayed by Ernest Thesiger, he featured in The Robe (1953). He was featured in the 1979 film Caligula, portrayed by Peter O'Toole. He was an important character in Taylor Caldwell's 1958 novel, Dear and Glorious Physician, a biography of St Luke the Evangelist, author of the third canonical Gospel.\\r\\n\\r\\nTiberius was married twice, with only his first union producing a child who would survive to adulthood:","input":"Who was the roman emperor when christ was born?"},{"output":"Tower of Terror","context":"Tower of Terror is a 1997 American supernatural horror television film written and directed by D.

It was adopted in its present form during a meeting of the Constituent Assembly held on 22 July 1947, and it became the official flag of the Dominion of India on 15 August 1947. The flag was subsequently retained as that of the Republic of India. In India, the term \\"tricolour\\" (Hindi: ??????, translit.?Tira?g) almost always refers to the Indian national flag. The flag is based on the Swaraj flag, a flag of the Indian National Congress designed by Pingali Venkayya.[N 1]\\r\\nBy law, the flag is to be made of khadi, a special type of hand-spun cloth or silk, made popular by Mahatma Gandhi. The manufacturing process and specifications for the flag are laid out by the Bureau of Indian Standards. The right to manufacture the flag is held by the Khadi Development and Village Industries Commission, who allocates it to regional groups. As of 2009, the Karnataka Khadi Gramodyoga Samyukta Sangha has been the sole manufacturer of the flag.\\r\\nUsage of the flag is governed by the Flag Code of India and other laws relating to the national emblems. The original code prohibited use of the flag by private citizens except on national days such as the Independence day and the Republic Day. In 2002, on hearing an appeal from a private citizen, Naveen Jindal, the Supreme Court of India directed the Government of India to amend the code to allow flag usage by private citizens. Subsequently, the Union Cabinet of India amended the code to allow limited usage. The code was amended once more in 2005 to allow some additional use including adaptations on certain forms of clothing. The flag code also governs the protocol of flying the flag and its use in conjunction with other national and non-national flags.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to the Flag code of India, the Indian flag has a ratio of two by three (where the length of the flag is 1.5 times that of the width). All three stripes of the flag (saffron, white and green) are to be equal in width and length. The size of the Ashoka Chakra is not specified in the Flag code, but it has twenty-four spokes that are evenly spaced.[5] In section 4.3.1 of \\"IS1: Manufacturing standards for the Indian Flag\\", there is a chart that details the size of the Ashoka Chakra on the nine specific sizes of the national flag.[3] In both the Flag code and IS1, they call for the Ashoka Chakra to be printed or painted on both sides of the flag in navy blue.[3][5] Below is the list of specified shades for all colours used on the national flag, with the exception of Navy Blue, from \\"IS1: Manufacturing standards for the Indian Flag\\" as defined in the 1931 CIE Colour Specifications with illuminant C.[3] The navy blue colour can be found in the standard IS:1803-1973.[3]\\r\\nNote that the values given in the table correspond to CIE 1931 color space.

The flag was designed by Pingali Venkayya. In the centre was a traditional spinning wheel, symbolising Gandhi's goal of making Indians self-reliant by fabricating their own clothing. The design was then modified to include a white stripe in the centre for other religious communities, and provide a background for the spinning wheel. Subsequently, to avoid sectarian associations with the colour scheme, saffron, white and green were chosen for the three bands, representing courage and sacrifice, peace and truth, and faith and chivalry respectively.[7]\\r\\nA few days before India became independent on 15 August 1947, the specially constituted Constituent Assembly decided that the flag of India must be acceptable to all parties and communities.[8] A modified version of the Swaraj flag was chosen; the tricolour remained the same saffron, white and green. However, the charkha was replaced by the Ashoka Chakra representing the eternal wheel of law. The philosopher Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan, who later became India's first Vice President and second President, clarified the adopted flag and described its significance as follows:\\r\\nA number of flags with varying designs were used in the period preceding the Indian Independence Movement by the rulers of different princely states; the idea of a single Indian flag was first raised by the British rulers of India after the rebellion of 1857, which resulted in the establishment of direct imperial rule. The first flag, whose design was based on western heraldic standards, were similar to the flags of other British colonies, including Canada and Australia; its blue field included the Union Flag in the upper-left quadrant and a Star of India capped by the royal crown in the middle of the right half. To address the question of how the star conveyed \\"Indianness\\", Queen Victoria created the Knight Commander of the Order of the Star of India to honour services to the empire by her Indian subjects. Subsequently, all the Indian princely states received flags with symbols based on the heraldic criteria of Europe including the right to fly defaced British red ensigns.[10][11][12]\\r\\nIn the early twentieth century, around the coronation of Edward VII, a discussion started on the need for a heraldic symbol that was representative of the Indian empire. William Coldstream, a British member of the Indian Civil Service, campaigned the government to change the heraldic symbol from a star, which he considered to be a common choice, to something more appropriate. His proposal was not well received by the government; Lord Curzon rejected it for practical reasons including the multiplication of flags.[13] Around this time, nationalist opinion within the dominion was leading to a representation through religious tradition. The symbols that were in vogue included the Ganesha, advocated by Bal Gangadhar Tilak, and Kali, advocated by Aurobindo Ghosh and Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay. Another symbol was the cow, or Gau Mata (cow mother). However, all these symbols were Hindu-centric and did not suggest unity with India's Muslim population.[14]\\r\\nThe partition of Bengal (1905) resulted in the introduction of a new flag representing the Indian independence movement that sought to unite the multitude of castes and races within the country. The Vande Mataram flag, part of the Swadeshi movement against the British, comprised Indian religious symbols represented in western heraldic fashion. The tricolour flag included eight white lotuses on the upper green band representing the eight provinces, a sun and a crescent on the bottom red band, and the Vande Mataram slogan in Hindi on the central yellow band. The flag was launched in Calcutta bereft of any ceremony and the launch was only briefly covered by newspapers. The flag was not covered in contemporary governmental or political reports either, but was used at the annual session of the Indian National Congress. A slightly modified version was subsequently used by Madam Bhikaji Cama at the second International Socialist Congress in Stuttgart in 1907. Despite the multiple uses of the flag, it failed to generate enthusiasm amongst Indian nationalists.[15]\\r\\nAround the same time, another proposal for the flag was initiated by Sister Nivedita, a Hindu reformist and disciple of Swami Vivekananda. The flag consisted of a thunderbolt in the centre and a hundred and eight oil lamps for the border, with the Vande Mataram caption split around the thunderbolt. It was also presented at the Indian National Congress meeting in 1906.[16] Soon, many other proposals were initiated, but none of them gained attention from the nationalist movement.\\r\\nIn 1909, Lord Ampthill, former Governor of the Madras Presidency, wrote to The Times of London in the run up to Empire Day pointing out that there existed \\"no flag representative of India as a whole or any Indian province ... Surely this is strange, seeing that but for India there would be no Empire.\\"[17]\\r\\nIn 1916, Pingali Venkayya submitted thirty new designs, in the form of a booklet funded by members of the High Court of Madras. These many proposals and recommendations did little more than keep the flag movement alive. The same year, Annie Besant and Bal Gangadhar Tilak adopted a new flag as part of the Home Rule Movement. The flag included the Union Jack in the upper left corner, a star and crescent in the upper right, and seven stars displayed diagonally from the lower right, on a background of five red and four green alternating bands. The flag resulted in the first governmental initiative against any nationalistic flag, as a magistrate in Coimbatore banned its use. The ban was followed by a public debate on the function and importance of a national flag.[18]\\r\\nIn the early 1920s, national flag discussions gained prominence across most British dominions following the peace treaty between Britain and Ireland. In November 1920, the Indian delegation to the League of Nations wanted to use an Indian flag, and this prompted the British Indian government to place renewed emphasis on the flag as a national symbol.\\r\\nIn April 1921, Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi wrote in his journal Young India about the need for an Indian flag, proposing a flag with the charkha or spinning wheel at the centre.[20] The idea of the spinning wheel was put forth by Lala Hansraj, and Gandhi commissioned Pingali Venkayya to design a flag with the spinning wheel on a red and green banner, the red colour signifying Hindus and the green standing for Muslims. Gandhi wanted the flag to be presented at the Congress session of 1921, but it was not delivered on time, and another flag was proposed at the session. Gandhi later wrote that the delay was fortuitous since it allowed him to realise that other religions were not represented; he then added white to the banner colours, to represent all the other religions. Finally, owing to the religious-political sensibilities, in 1929, Gandhi moved towards a more secular interpretation of the flag colours, stating that red stood for the sacrifices of the people, white for purity, and green for hope.[21]\\r\\nOn 13 April 1923, during a procession by local Congress volunteers in Nagpur commemorating the Jallianwala Bagh massacre, the Swaraj flag with the spinning wheel, designed by Pingali Venkayya, was hoisted. This event resulted in a confrontation between the Congressmen and the police, after which five people were imprisoned. Over a hundred other protesters continued the flag procession after a meeting. Subsequently, on the first of May, Jamnalal Bajaj, the secretary of the Nagpur Congress Committee, started the Flag Satyagraha, gaining national attention and marking a significant point in the flag movement. The satyagraha, promoted nationally by the Congress, started creating cracks within the organisation in which the Gandhians were highly enthused while the other group, the Swarajists, called it inconsequential.\\r\\nFinally, at the All India Congress Committee meeting in July, 1923, at the insistence of Jawaharlal Nehru and Sarojini Naidu, Congress closed ranks and the flag movement was endorsed. The flag movement was managed by Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel with the idea of public processions and flag displays by common people. By the end of the movement, over 1500 people had been arrested across all of British India. The Bombay Chronicle reported that the movement drew from diverse groups of society including farmers, students, merchants, labourers and \\"national servants\\". While Muslim participation was moderate, the movement enthused women, who had hitherto rarely participated in the independence movement.[22]\\r\\nWhile the flag agitation got its impetus from Gandhi's writings and discourses, the movement received political acceptance following the Nagpur incident. News reports, editorials and letters to editors published in various journals and newspapers of the time attest to the subsequent development of a bond between the flag and the nation. Soon, the concept of preserving the honour of the national flag became an integral component of the independence struggle. While Muslims were still wary of the Swaraj flag, it gained acceptance among Muslim leaders of the Congress and the Khilafat Movement as the national flag.\\r\\nDetractors of the flag movement, including Motilal Nehru, soon hailed the Swaraj flag as a symbol of national unity. Thus, the flag became a significant structural component of the institution of India. In contrast to the subdued responses of the past, the British Indian government took greater cognisance of the new flag, and began to define a policy of response. The British parliament discussed public use of the flag, and based on directives from England, the British Indian government threatened to withdraw funds from municipalities and local governments that did not prevent the display of the Swaraj flag.[24] The Swaraj flag became the official flag of Congress at the 1931 meeting. However, by then, the flag had already become the symbol of the independence movement.[25]\\r\\nA few days before India gained its independence in August 1947, the Constituent Assembly was formed. To select a flag for independent India, on 23 June 1947, the assembly set up an ad hoc committee headed by Rajendra Prasad and including Maulana Abul Kalam Azad, Sarojini Naidu, C. Rajagopalachari, K. M. Munshi and B. R. Ambedkar as its members.\\r\\nOn 14 July 1947, the committee recommended that the flag of the Indian National Congress be adopted as the National Flag of India with suitable modifications, so as to make it acceptable to all parties and communities. It was also resolved that the flag should not have any communal undertones.[5] The spinning wheel of the Congress flag was replaced by the Chakra (wheel) from the Lion Capital of Ashoka. According to Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan, the chakra was chosen as it was representative of dharma and law. However, Jawaharlal Nehru explained that the change was more practical in nature, as unlike the flag with the spinning wheel, this design would appear symmetrical. Gandhi was not very pleased by the change, but eventually came around to accepting it.\\r\\nThe flag was proposed by Nehru at the Constituent Assembly on 22 July 1947 as a horizontal tricolour of deep saffron, white and dark green in equal proportions, with the Ashoka wheel in blue in the centre of the white band. Nehru also presented two flags, one in Khadi-silk and the other in Khadi-cotton, to the assembly. The resolution was approved unanimously.[28] It served as the national flag of the Dominion of India between 15 August 1947 and 26 January 1950, and has served as the flag of the Republic of India since then.[8]\\r\\nThe design and manufacturing process for the national flag is regulated by three documents issued by the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS). All of the flags are made out of khadi cloth of silk or cotton. The standards were created in 1968 and were updated in 2008.[29] Nine standard sizes of the flag are specified by law.[1]\\r\\nIn 1951, after India became a republic, the Indian Standards Institute (now the BIS) brought out the first official specifications for the flag. These were revised in 1964 to conform to the metric system which was adopted in India. The specifications were further amended on 17 August 1968.[5] The specifications cover all the essential requirements of the manufacture of the Indian flag including sizes, dye colour, chromatic values, brightness, thread count and hemp cordage. The guidelines are covered under civil and criminal laws and defects in the manufacturing process can result in punishments that include fines or jail terms.[30][31]\\r\\nKhadi or hand-spun cloth is the only material allowed to be used for the flag, and flying a flag made of any other material is punishable by law with imprisonment up to three years, besides a fine. Raw materials for khadi are restricted to cotton, silk and wool. There are two kinds of khadi used: The first is the khadi-bunting which makes up the body of the flag, and the second is the khadi-duck, which is a beige-coloured cloth that holds the flag to the pole. The khadi-duck is an unconventional type of weave that meshes three threads into a weave, compared to the two threads used in conventional weaving. This type of weaving is extremely rare, and there are fewer than twenty weavers in India professing this skill. The guidelines also state that there should be exactly 150 threads per square centimetre, four threads per stitch, and one square foot should weigh exactly 205 grams (7.2?oz).[5][30][31][32]\\r\\nThere are four places in the country licensed to make the cloth for the national flag, they are in Karnataka, Marathwada, Barabanki in UP, and Banetha in Rajasthan.[33] The woven khadi is obtained from two handloom units in the Dharwad and Bagalkot districts of northern Karnataka. Currently, Karnataka Khadi Gramodyoga Samyukta Sangha based in Hubli is the only licensed flag production and supply unit in India.[31] Permission for setting up flag manufacturing units in India is allotted by the Khadi Development and Village Industries Commission, though the BIS has the power to cancel the licences of units that flout guidelines.[5] The hand-woven khadi for the National Flag was initially manufactured at Garag, a small village in the Dharwad district. A Centre was established at Garag in 1954 by a few freedom fighters under the banner of Dharwad Taluk Kshetriya Seva Sangh and obtained the Centre's licence to make flags.[5]\\r\\nOnce woven, the material is sent to the BIS laboratories for testing. After quality testing, the material, if approved, is returned to the factory. It is then separated into three lots which are dyed saffron, white and green. The Ashoka Chakra is screen printed, stencilled or suitably embroidered onto each side of the white cloth. Care also has to be taken that the chakra is completely visible and synchronised on both sides. Three pieces of the required dimension, one of each colour, are then stitched together according to specifications and the final product is ironed and packed. The BIS then checks the colours and only then can the flag be sold.[30][31]\\r\\nDisplay and usage of the flag is governed by the Flag Code of India, 2002 (successor to the Flag Code?ÿ India, the original flag code); the Emblems and Names (Prevention of Improper Use) Act, 1950; and the Prevention of Insults to National Honour Act, 1971.[5] Insults to the national flag, including gross affronts or indignities to it, as well as using it in a manner so as to violate the provisions of the Flag Code, are punishable by law with imprisonment up to three years, or a fine, or both.[34]\\r\\nOfficial regulation states that the flag must never touch the ground or water, or be used as a drapery in any form.[5] The flag may not be intentionally placed upside down, dipped in anything, or hold any objects other than flower petals before unfurling. No sort of lettering may be inscribed on the flag. When out in the open, the flag should always be flown between sunrise and sunset, irrespective of the weather conditions. Prior to 2009, the flag could be flown on a public building at night under special circumstances; currently, Indian citizens can fly the flag even at night, subject to the restriction that the flag should be hoisted on a tall flagpole and be well-illuminated.[5][35]\\r\\nThe flag should never be depicted, displayed or flown upside down. Tradition also states that when draped vertically, the flag should not merely be rotated 90degrees, but also reversed. One \\"reads\\" a flag like the pages of a book, from top to bottom and from left to right, and after rotation the results should be the same. It is considered insulting to display the flag in a frayed or dirty state, and the same rule applies to the flagpoles and halyards used to hoist the flag, which should always be in a proper state of maintenance.[1]\\r\\nThe original flag code of India did not allow private citizens to fly the national flag except on national days such as Independence Day or Republic Day. In 2001, Naveen Jindal, an industrialist used to the more egalitarian use of the flag in the United States where he studied, flew the Indian flag on his office building. The flag was confiscated and he was warned of prosecution. Jindal filed a public interest litigation petition in the High Court of Delhi; he sought to strike down the restriction on the use of the flag by private citizens, arguing that hoisting the national flag with due decorum and honour was his right as a citizen, and a way of expressing his love for the country.[36][37]\\r\\nAt the end of the appeals process, the case was heard by the Supreme Court of India; the court ruled in Jindal's favour, asking the Government of India to consider the matter. The Union Cabinet of India then amended the Indian Flag Code with effect from 26 January 2002, allowing private citizens to hoist the flag on any day of the year, subject to their safeguarding the dignity, honour and respect of the flag.[5] It is also held that the code was not a statute and restrictions under the code ought to be followed; also, the right to fly the flag is a qualified right, unlike the absolute rights guaranteed to citizens, and should be interpreted in the context of Article 19 of the Constitution of India.[5]\\r\\nThe original flag code also forbade use of the flag on uniforms, costumes and other clothing. In July 2005, the Government of India amended the code to allow some forms of usage. The amended code forbids usage in clothing below the waist and on undergarments, and forbids embroidering onto pillowcases, handkerchiefs or other dress material.[38]\\r\\nDisposal of damaged flags is also covered by the flag code. Damaged or soiled flags may not be cast aside or disrespectfully destroyed; they have to be destroyed as a whole in private, preferably by burning or by any other method consistent with the dignity of the flag.[1]\\r\\nThe rules regarding the correct methods to display the flag state that when two flags are fully spread out horizontally on a wall behind a podium, their hoists should be towards each other with the saffron stripes uppermost. If the flag is displayed on a short flagpole, this should be mounted at an angle to the wall with the flag draped tastefully from it. If two national flags are displayed on crossed staffs, the hoists must be towards each other and the flags must be fully spread out. The flag should never be used as a cloth to cover tables, lecterns, podiums or buildings, or be draped from railings.[1]\\r\\nWhenever the flag is displayed indoors in halls at public meetings or gatherings of any kind, it should always be on the right (observers' left), as this is the position of authority. So when the flag is displayed next to a speaker in the hall or other meeting place, it must be placed on the speaker's right hand. When it is displayed elsewhere in the hall, it should be to the right of the audience. The flag should be displayed completely spread out with the saffron stripe on top. If hung vertically on the wall behind the podium, the saffron stripe should be to the left of the onlookers facing the flag with the hoist cord at the top.[1]\\r\\nThe flag, when carried in a procession or parade or with another flag or flags, should be on the marching right or alone in the centre at the front. The flag may form a distinctive feature of the unveiling of a statue, monument, or plaque, but should never be used as the covering for the object. As a mark of respect to the flag, it should never be dipped to a person or thing, as opposed to regimental colours, organisational or institutional flags, which may be dipped as a mark of honour. During the ceremony of hoisting or lowering the flag, or when the flag is passing in a parade or in a review, all persons present should face the flag and stand at attention. Those present in uniform should render the appropriate salute. When the flag is in a moving column, persons present will stand at attention or salute as the flag passes them. A dignitary may take the salute without a head dress. The flag salutation should be followed by the playing of the national anthem.[1]\\r\\nThe privilege of flying the national flag on vehicles is restricted to the President, the Vice-President or the Prime Minister, Governors and Lieutenant Governors of states, Chief Ministers, Union Ministers, members of the Parliament of India and state legislatures of the Indian states (Vidhan Sabha and Vidhan Parishad), judges of the Supreme Court of India and High Courts, and flag officers of the Army, Navy and Air Force. The flag has to be flown from a staff affixed firmly either on the middle front or to the front right side of the car. When a foreign dignitary travels in a car provided by government, the flag should be flown on the right side of the car while the flag of the foreign country should be flown on the left side.[5]\\r\\nThe flag should be flown on the aircraft carrying the President, the Vice-President or the Prime Minister on a visit to a foreign country. Alongside the National Flag, the flag of the country visited should also be flown; however, when the aircraft lands in countries en route, the national flags of the respective countries would be flown instead. When carrying the president within India, aircraft display the flag on the side the president embarks or disembarks; the flag is similarly flown on trains, but only when the train is stationary or approaching a railway station.[1]\\r\\nWhen the Indian flag is flown on Indian territory along with other national flags, the general rule is that the Indian flag should be the starting point of all flags. When flags are placed in a straight line, the rightmost flag (leftmost to the observer facing the flag) is the Indian flag, followed by other national flags in alphabetical order. When placed in a circle, the Indian flag is the first point and is followed by other flags alphabetically. In such placement, all other flags should be of approximately the same size with no other flag being larger than the Indian flag. Each national flag should also be flown from its own pole and no flag should be placed higher than another. In addition to being the first flag, the Indian flag may also be placed within the row or circle alphabetically. When placed on crossed poles, the Indian flag should be in front of the other flag, and to the right (observer's left) of the other flag. The only exception to the preceding rule is when it is flown along with the flag of the United Nations, which may be placed to the right of the Indian flag.[1]\\r\\nWhen the Indian flag is displayed with non-national flags, including corporate flags and advertising banners, the rules state that if the flags are on separate staffs, the flag of India should be in the middle, or the furthest left from the viewpoint of the onlookers, or at least one flag's breadth higher than the other flags in the group. Its flagpole must be in front of the other poles in the group, but if they are on the same staff, it must be the uppermost flag. If the flag is carried in procession with other flags, it must be at the head of the marching procession, or if carried with a row of flags in line abreast, it must be carried to the marching right of the procession.[1]\\r\\nThe flag should be flown at half-mast as a sign of mourning. The decision to do so lies with the President of India, who also decides the period of such mourning. When the flag is to be flown at half mast, it must first be raised to the top of the mast and then slowly lowered. Only the Indian flag is flown half mast; all other flags remain at normal height.\\r\\nThe flag is flown half-mast nationwide on the death of the president, Vice-president or prime minister. It is flown half-mast in New Delhi and the state of origin for the Speaker of the Lok Sabha, Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, and Union Ministers. On deaths of Governors, Lt. Governors and Chief Ministers, the flag is flown at half-mast in the respective states and union territories.\\r\\nThe Indian flag cannot be flown at half-mast on Republic Day (26 January), Independence day (15 August), Gandhi Jayanti (2 October), National Week (6ÿ13 April) or state formation anniversaries, except over buildings housing the body of the deceased dignitary. However, even in such cases, the flag must be raised to full-mast when the body is moved from the building.\\r\\nObservances of State mourning on the death of foreign dignitaries are governed by special instructions issued from the Ministry of Home Affairs in individual cases. However, in the event of death of either the Head of the State or Head of the Government of a foreign country, the Indian Mission accredited to that country may fly the national flag at half-mast.\\r\\nOn occasions of state, military, central para-military forces funerals, the flag shall be draped over the bier or coffin with the saffron towards the head of the bier or coffin. The flag should not be lowered into the grave or burnt in the pyre.[1]","input":"When was the indian flag hoisted for the first time?"},{"output":"International Border (IB)","context":"The BangladeshÿIndia border, known locally as the International Border (IB), is an international border running between Bangladesh and India that demarcates the eight divisions of Bangladesh and the Indian states.\\r\\nBangladesh and India share a 4,156?km (2,582?mi)-long international border, the fifth-longest land border in the world, including 262?km (163?mi) in Assam, 856?km (532?mi) in Tripura, 180?km (110?mi) in Mizoram, 443?km (275?mi) in Meghalaya, and 2,217?km (1,378?mi) in Bengal.[1] The Bangladeshi divisions of Mymensingh, Khulna, Rajshahi, Rangpur, Sylhet and Chittagong are situated along the border. A number of pillars mark the border between the two states. Small demarcated portions of the border are fenced on both sides. The Land Boundary Agreement to simplify the border was ratified by both India and Bangladesh on 7 May 2015.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Radcliffe Line was published on 17 August 1947 as a boundary demarcation line between India and Pakistan upon the partition of India. It was named after its architect, Sir Cyril Radcliffe, who, as chairman of the Border Commissions, was charged with equitably dividing 175,000 square miles (450,000?km2) of territory with 88 million people.[3]\\r\\nThe border is used as a route for smuggling livestock, food items, medicines and drugs from India to Bangladesh. Moreover, illegal immigrants from Bangladesh cross the border to India. Because of a large number of illegal immigrants crossing from Bangladesh into India, a controversial shoot-on-sight policy has been enforced by the Indian border patrols.[4][5][6] This policy was initiated with reports of violence between the illegal migrants and Indian soldiers.[7] The border has also witnessed occasional skirmishes between the Indian Border Security Force and the Border Guards Bangladesh, most notably in 2001.\\r\\nIn July 2009, Channel 4 News reported that hundreds of Bangladeshis were killed by the BSF along the Indo-Bangladeshi Barrier. The BSF claims that the barrier's main purpose is to check illegal immigration and to prevent cross-border terrorism.[8] In 2010, Human Rights Watch (HRW) issued an 81-page report which brought up uncountable abuses of the BSF. The report was compiled from the interviews taken from the victims of BSF torments, witnesses, members of the BSF and its Bangladeshi counterpart. The report stated that over 1000 Bangladeshi citizens were killed during the first decade of the 21st century. According to HRW, BSF did not only shoot illegal migrants or smugglers but even innocents who were seen near, sometimes even people working in fields (farmland) near the border.[9]\\r\\nBSF has often been accused by Bangladesh government of incursions into Bangladesh territory, and indiscriminate shooting of civilians along the India-Bangladesh borders. This was in retaliation to massive illegal immigration from Bangladesh to India, for which the Indo-Bangladeshi Barrier is underway.[10] In a news conference in August 2008, Indian BSF officials admitted that they killed 59 illegals (34 Bangladeshis, 21 Indians, rest unidentified) who were trying to cross the border during the prior six months.[11] Bangladeshi media accused the BSF of abducting 5 Bangladeshi children, aged between 8 and 15, from the Haripur Upazila in Thakurgaon District of Bangladesh, in 2010. The children were setting fishing nets near the border.[12] In 2010, Human Rights Watch has accused the Border Security Force for the indiscriminate killings. BSF forces killed and hanged the dead body over the fence Ms. Felani (a 15-year-old Bangladeshi girl) on 7 January 2011.[13]\\r\\nMany conferences have been held between India and Bangladesh to discuss such issues as smuggling and trespassing, cattle lifting, trafficking of drugs and arms. Colonel Muhammad Shahid Sarwar of BGB gave Border Security Force a list of miscreants which took place in India, and the BSF side also handed over a similar list to the BGB.\\r\\nThe enclaves or chitmahals (Bengali: ??????) between India and Bangladesh border in the Indian state of West Bengal were a long-standing issue between the countries. The enclaves were reputedly part of a high-stakes card game or chess games centuries ago between two regional kings, the Raja of Cooch Behar and the Maharaja of Rangpur, and the result of the confused outcome of a treaty between the Kingdom of Koch Bihar and the Mughal Empire. After the partition of India in 1947, Cooch Behar district merged with India and Rangpur went to then-East Pakistan, which became Bangladesh in 1971.\\r\\nThe prime ministers of India and Bangladesh signed a Land Boundary Agreement in 1974 to exchange all enclaves and simplify the international border. In 1974 Bangladesh approved the proposed Land Boundary Agreement, but India did not ratify it. In 2011 the two countries again agreed to exchange enclaves and adverse possessions. A revised version of the agreement was finally adopted by the two countries when the Parliament of India passed the 119th Amendment to the Indian Constitution on 7 May 2015.[14][15]\\r\\nInside the main part of Bangladesh, there were 111 Indian enclaves (17,160.63 acres), while inside the main part of India, there were 51 Bangladeshi enclaves (7,110.02 acres). In respect of adverse possessions, India received 2,777.038 acres of land and transferred 2,267.682 acres to Bangladesh. Under the agreement, the enclave residents could continue to reside at their present location or move to the country of their choice.[16][17] The adverse possession of Boraibari went to Bangladesh.[18] The undemarcated borders between the nations were also finally solved with respect to Daikhata-Dumabari, Muhurichar (an island in the Muhuri River),[19] and Pyrdiwah.[20][21][22]\\r\\nIndia and Bangladesh had engaged in eight rounds of bilateral negotiations starting 1974, but it remained inconclusive until 2009. In October 2009, Bangladesh served India with notice of arbitration proceedings under the UNCLOS.\\r\\nThe Arbitration Tribunal delivered the ruling on 7 July 2014 and settled the dispute.[23]\\r\\nMap of major border customs checkposts\\r\\nDesignated Integrated Check Posts (ICP, with both customs and immigration facilities) and Land Customs Stations (LCS) are:[24]\\r\\nTransport between India and Bangladesh bears much historical and political significance for both countries, which possessed no ground transport links for 43 years, starting with the partition of Bengal and India in 1947. After the establishment of Bangladesh following the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971, bilateral relations improved considerably, but the two governments moved slowly on implementing a 1980 agreement on improving transport links.[26]\\r\\nThe KolkataÿDhaka Bus started in 1999.[27] In 2001, another bus service was launched to connect Dhaka with Agartala, the capital of the Indian state of Tripura, the second largest city of Northeast India that borders Bangladesh in the east. In 2015 June direct bus service from Kolkata to Agartala via, Petrapole, Dhaka, Akhoura began. The service is operated by West Bengal surface transport corporation.\\r\\nBefore partition India and Bangladesh had multiple rail links. In the 21st century the countries are only connected by rail links on the Western Bangladeshi border, although there are plans to rebuild some of the other rail links. 2 scheduled passenger trains run between Kolkata and Bangladesh as the Maitree Express and the Bandhan Express.\\r\\nThe project has run into several delays and there is no clear completion date for the project yet.[28][29][30] The barrier when complete will be patrolled by the Border Security Force. The fence will also be electrified at some stretches. The BSF claims that the barrier's main purpose is to prevent smuggling of narcotics.[8]\\r\\nIndia is constructing the Indo-Bangladeshi barrier, a 3,406-kilometre (2,116?mi) fence of barbed wire and concrete just under 3 metres high, to prevent smuggling of narcotics. Out of this, 500 kilometres of fencing was completed at the cost of ?28.81 billion (US$450?million) by November 2007. The deadline for project completion was set to 2008ÿ09[28] By October 2009, about 2649 kilometres of fencing along with about 3326 kilometres of border roads were completed. The deadline for project completion was revised to March 2010.[29] By March 2011, 2735 kilometres of fencing was completed and the deadline was revised to March 2012.[30]\\r\\nAssam shares 263?km of border with Bangladesh out of which 143.9?km is land and 119.1?km is riverine. As of November 2011, 221.56?km of fencing was completed.[31] India has completed the installation of flood lights for 277 kilometers in the West Bengal sector.[28] Sometimes between 2001-2006 Bangladesh Border security troops (BDR) clashed with the Indian Border Security Force when the fence was built beyond the no man's land.[32]\\r\\nCoordinates: 261543N 884506E? / ?26.26194N 88.75167E? / 26.26194; 88.75167","input":"What is the border line between india and bangladesh called?"},{"output":"Twelve regional Federal Reserve Banks","context":"","input":"Who is the federal reserve system overseen by?"},{"output":"state university","context":"","input":"Is texas a m university a public or private school?"},{"output":"U.S. Bank Stadium","context":"The Super Bowl is the annual championship game of the National Football League (NFL). The game is the culmination of a regular season that begins in the late summer of the previous calendar year. Normally, Roman numerals are used to identify each game, rather than the year in which it is held. For example, Super Bowl I was played on January 15, 1967, following the 1966 regular season. The sole exception to this naming convention tradition occurred with Super Bowl 50, which was played on February 7, 2016, following the 2015 regular season, and the following year, the nomenclature returned to Roman numerals for Super Bowl LI, following the 2016 regular season. The most recent Super Bowl was Super Bowl LII, on February 4, 2018, following the 2017 regular season.\\r\\nThe game was created as part of a merger agreement between the NFL and its then-rival league, the American Football League (AFL). It was agreed that the two leagues' champion teams would play in the AFLÿNFL World Championship Game until the merger was to officially begin in 1970. After the merger, each league was redesignated as a \\"conference\\", and the game has since been played between the conference champions to determine the NFL's league champion. Currently, the National Football Conference (NFC) leads the league with 27 wins to 25 wins for the American Football Conference (AFC). The Pittsburgh Steelers have the most Super Bowl championship titles, with six. The New England Patriots have the most Super Bowl appearances, with ten. Charles Haley and Tom Brady both have five Super Bowl rings, which is the record for the most rings won by a single player.\\r\\nThe day on which the Super Bowl is played, now considered by some as an unofficial American national holiday,[1][2] is called \\"Super Bowl Sunday\\". It is the second-largest day for U.S. food consumption, after Thanksgiving Day.[3] In addition, the Super Bowl has frequently been the most-watched American television broadcast of the year; the seven most-watched broadcasts in U.S. television history are Super Bowls.[4] In 2015, Super Bowl XLIX became the most-watched American television program in history with an average audience of 114.4 million viewers, the fifth time in six years the game had set a record, starting with the 2010 Super Bowl, which itself had taken over the number-one spot held for 27 years by the final episode of M*A*S*H.[5][6][7] The Super Bowl is also among the most-watched sporting events in the world, almost all audiences being North American, and is second to soccer's UEFA Champions League final as the most watched annual sporting event worldwide.[8]\\r\\nThe NFL restricts the use of its \\"Super Bowl\\" trademark; it is frequently called the Big Game or other generic terms by non-sponsoring corporations. Because of the high viewership, commercial airtime during the Super Bowl broadcast is the most expensive of the year, leading to companies regularly developing their most expensive advertisements for this broadcast. As a result, watching and discussing the broadcast's commercials has become a significant aspect of the event.[9] In addition, popular singers and musicians including Mariah Carey, Michael Jackson, Madonna, Prince, Beyonc, Paul McCartney, The Rolling Stones, The Who, Whitney Houston, and Lady Gaga have performed during the event's pre-game and halftime ceremonies.\\r\\nFor four decades after its 1920 inception, the NFL successfully fended off several rival leagues. However, in 1960, it encountered its most serious competitor when the American Football League (AFL) was formed. The AFL vied heavily with the NFL for both players and fans, but by the middle of the decade, the strain of competition led to serious merger talks between the two leagues. Prior to the 1966 season, the NFL and AFL reached a merger agreement that was to take effect for the 1970 season. As part of the merger, the champions of the two leagues agreed to meet in a world championship game for professional American football until the merger was effected.\\r\\nA bowl game is a post-season college football game. The original \\"bowl game\\" was the Rose Bowl Game in Pasadena, California, which was first played in 1902 as the \\"Tournament East-West football game\\" as part of the Pasadena Tournament of Roses and moved to the new Rose Bowl Stadium in 1923. The stadium got its name from the fact that the game played there was part of the Tournament of Roses and that it was shaped like a bowl, much like the Yale Bowl in New Haven, Connecticut; the Tournament of Roses football game itself eventually came to be known as the Rose Bowl Game. Exploiting the Rose Bowl Game's popularity, post-season college football contests were created for Miami (the Orange Bowl), New Orleans (the Sugar Bowl), and El Paso, Texas (the Sun Bowl) in 1935, and for Dallas (the Cotton Bowl) in 1937. By the time the first Super Bowl was played, the term \\"bowl\\" for any major American football game was well established.\\r\\nLamar Hunt, owner of the AFL's Kansas City Chiefs, first used the term \\"Super Bowl\\"[10] to refer to the NFL-AFL championship game in the merger meetings. Hunt later said the name was likely in his head because his children had been playing with a Super Ball toy;[11] a vintage example of the ball is on display at the Pro Football Hall of Fame in Canton, Ohio. In a July 25, 1966, letter to NFL commissioner Pete Rozelle, Hunt wrote, \\"I have kiddingly called it the 'Super Bowl,' which obviously can be improved upon.\\"\\r\\nThe leagues' owners chose the name \\"AFLÿNFL Championship Game\\",[12] but in July 1966 the Kansas City Star quoted Hunt in discussing \\"the Super Bowl  that's my term for the championship game between the two leagues\\",[13] and the media immediately began using the term.[14] Although the league stated in 1967 that \\"not many people like it\\", asking for suggestions and considering alternatives such as \\"Merger Bowl\\" and \\"The Game\\", the Associated Press reported that \\"Super Bowl\\" \\"grew and grew and grew-until it reached the point that there was Super Week, Super Sunday, Super Teams, Super Players, ad infinitum\\".[12] \\"Super Bowl\\" became official beginning with the third annual game.[15] Roman numerals were first affixed for the fifth edition, in January 1971.[16]\\r\\nAfter the NFL's Green Bay Packers won the first two Super Bowls, some team owners feared for the future of the merger. At the time, many doubted the competitiveness of AFL teams compared with their NFL counterparts, though that perception changed when the AFL's New York Jets defeated the NFL's Baltimore Colts in Super Bowl III in Miami. One year later, the AFL's Kansas City Chiefs defeated the NFL's Minnesota Vikings 23ÿ7 in Super Bowl IV in New Orleans, which was the final AFL-NFL World Championship Game played before the merger. Beginning with the 1970 season, the NFL realigned into two conferences; the former AFL teams plus three NFL teams (the Colts, Pittsburgh Steelers, and Cleveland Browns) would constitute the American Football Conference (AFC), while the remaining NFL clubs would form the National Football Conference (NFC). The champions of the two conferences would play each other in the Super Bowl.\\r\\nThe winning team receives the Vince Lombardi Trophy, named after the coach of the Green Bay Packers, who won the first two Super Bowl games and three of the five preceding NFL championships in 1961, 1962, and 1965. Following Lombardi's death in September 1970, the trophy was named the Vince Lombardi Trophy. The first trophy awarded under the new name was presented to the Baltimore Colts following their win in Super Bowl V in Miami.\\r\\nThe Super Bowl is currently played on the first Sunday in February. This is due to the current NFL schedule which consists of the opening weekend of the season being held immediately after Labor Day (the first Monday in September), the 17-week regular season (where teams each play 16 games and have one bye), the first three rounds of the playoffs, and the Super Bowl two weeks after the two Conference Championship Games. This schedule has been in effect since Super Bowl XXXVIII in February 2004. The date of the Super Bowl can thus be determined from the date of the preceding Labor Day. For example, Labor Day in 2015 occurred on September 7; therefore the next Super Bowl was scheduled exactly five months later on February 7, 2016.\\r\\nOriginally, the game took place in early to mid-January. For Super Bowl I there was only one round of playoffs: the pre-merger NFL and AFL Championship Games. The addition of two playoff rounds (first in 1967 and then in 1978), an increase in regular season games from 14 to 16 (1978), and the establishment of one bye-week per team (1990) have caused the Super Bowl to be played later. Partially offsetting these season-lengthening effects, simultaneous with the addition of two regular season games in 1978, the season was started earlier. Prior to 1978, the season started as late as September 21. Now, since Labor Day is always the first Monday of September, September 13 is the latest possible date for the first full Sunday set of games (Since 2002, the regular season has started with the Kickoff Game on the first Thursday after Labor Day). The earliest possible season start date is September 7.\\r\\nThe Pittsburgh Steelers have won six Super Bowls, the most of any team; the Dallas Cowboys, New England Patriots and San Francisco 49ers have five victories each, while the Green Bay Packers and New York Giants have four Super Bowl championships. Fourteen other NFL franchises have won at least one Super Bowl. Eight teams have appeared in Super Bowl games without a win. The Minnesota Vikings were the first team to have appeared a record four times without a win. The Buffalo Bills played in a record four Super Bowls in a row and lost every one. Four teams (the Cleveland Browns, Detroit Lions, Jacksonville Jaguars, and Houston Texans) have never appeared in a Super Bowl. The Browns and Lions both won NFL Championships prior to the creation of the Super Bowl, while the Jaguars (1995) and Texans (2002) are both recent NFL expansion teams. (Detroit, Houston, and Jacksonville, however, have hosted a Super Bowl, leaving the Browns the only team to date who has neither played in nor whose city has hosted the game.) The Minnesota Vikings won the last NFL Championship before the merger but lost to the AFL champion Kansas City Chiefs in Super Bowl IV.\\r\\nThe Green Bay Packers won the first two Super Bowls (Known as the AFL-NFL World Championship Game for these first two contests), defeating the Kansas City Chiefs and Oakland Raiders following the 1966 and 1967 seasons, respectively. The Packers were led by quarterback, Bart Starr, who was named the Most Valuable Player (MVP) for both games. These two championships, coupled with the Packers' NFL championships in 1961, 1962, and 1965, amount to the most successful stretch in NFL History; five championships in seven years, and the only threepeat in NFL history (1965, 1966, and 1967).\\r\\nIn Super Bowl III, the AFL's New York Jets defeated the eighteen-point favorite Baltimore Colts of the NFL, 16ÿ7. The Jets were led by quarterback Joe Namath, who had famously guaranteed a Jets win prior to the game, and former Colts head coach Weeb Ewbank, and their victory proved that the AFL was the NFL's competitive equal. This was reinforced the following year when the AFL's Kansas City Chiefs defeated the NFL's Minnesota Vikings 23ÿ7 in Super Bowl IV.\\r\\nAfter the AFLÿNFL merger was completed in 1970, three franchises?ÿ the Dallas Cowboys, Miami Dolphins, and Pittsburgh Steelers?ÿ would go on to dominate the 1970s, winning a combined eight Super Bowls in the decade.\\r\\nThe Baltimore Colts, now a member of the AFC, would start the decade by defeating the Cowboys in Super Bowl V, a game which is notable as being the only Super Bowl to date in which a player from the losing team won the Super Bowl MVP (Cowboys' linebacker Chuck Howley). Beginning with this Super Bowl, all Super Bowls have served as the NFL's league championship game.\\r\\nThe Cowboys, coming back from a loss the previous season, won Super Bowl VI over the Dolphins. However, this would be the Dolphins' final loss in over a year, as the next year, the Dolphins would go 14ÿ0 in the regular season and eventually win all of their playoff games, capped off with a 14ÿ7 victory in Super Bowl VII, becoming the first and only team to finish an entire perfect regular and postseason. The Dolphins would repeat as league champions by winning Super Bowl VIII a year later.\\r\\nIn the late 1970s, the Steelers became the first NFL dynasty of the post-merger era by winning four Super Bowls (IX, X, XIII, and XIV) in six years. They were led by head coach Chuck Noll, the play of offensive stars Terry Bradshaw, Franco Harris, Lynn Swann, John Stallworth, and Mike Webster, and their dominant \\"Steel Curtain\\" defense, led by \\"Mean\\" Joe Greene, L. C. Greenwood, Ernie Holmes, Mel Blount, Jack Ham, and Jack Lambert. The coaches and administrators also were part of the dynasty's greatness as evidenced by the team's \\"final pieces\\" being part of the famous 1974 draft. The selections in that class have been considered the best by any pro franchise ever, as Pittsburgh selected four future Hall of Famers, the most for any team in any sport in a single draft. The Steelers were the first team to win three and then four Super Bowls and appeared in six AFC Championship Games during the decade, making the playoffs in eight straight seasons. Nine players and three coaches and administrators on the team have been inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame. Pittsburgh still remains the only team to win back-to-back Super Bowls twice and four Super Bowls in a six-year period.\\r\\nThe Steelers' dynasty was interrupted only by the Oakland Raiders' Super Bowl XI win and the Cowboys winning their second Super Bowl of the decade.\\r\\nIn the 1980s and 1990s, the tables turned for the AFC, as the NFC dominated the Super Bowls of the new decade and most of those of the 1990s. The NFC won 16 of the 20 Super Bowls during these two decades, including 13 straight from Super Bowl XIX to Super Bowl XXXI.\\r\\nThe most successful team of the 1980s was the San Francisco 49ers, which featured the West Coast offense of Hall of Fame head coach Bill Walsh. This offense was led by three-time Super Bowl MVP and Hall of Fame quarterback Joe Montana, Super Bowl MVP and Hall of Fame wide receiver Jerry Rice, running back Roger Craig, and defensive safety/cornerback Ronnie Lott. Under their leadership, the 49ers won four Super Bowls in the decade (XVI, XIX, XXIII, and XXIV) and made nine playoff appearances between 1981 and 1990, including eight division championships, becoming the second dynasty of the post-merger NFL.\\r\\nThe 1980s also produced the 1985 Chicago Bears, who posted an 18ÿ1 record under head coach Mike Ditka; quarterback Jim McMahon; and Hall of Fame running back Walter Payton. Their team won Super Bowl XX in dominant fashion. The Washington Redskins and New York Giants were also top teams of this period; the Redskins won Super Bowls XVII, XXII, and XXVI. The Giants claimed Super Bowls XXI and XXV. As in the 1970s, the Oakland Raiders were the only team to interrupt the Super Bowl dominance of other teams; they won Super Bowls XV and XVIII (the latter as the Los Angeles Raiders).\\r\\nFollowing several seasons with poor records in the 1980s, the Dallas Cowboys rose back to prominence in the 1990s. During this decade, the Cowboys made post-season appearances every year except for the seasons of 1990 and 1997. From 1992 to 1996, the Cowboys won their division championship each year. In this same period, the Buffalo Bills had made their mark reaching the Super Bowl for a record four consecutive years, only to lose all four. After Super Bowl championships by division rivals New York (1990) and Washington (1991), the Cowboys won three of the next four Super Bowls (XXVII, XXVIII, and XXX) led by quarterback Troy Aikman, running back Emmitt Smith, and wide receiver Michael Irvin. All three of these players went to the Hall of Fame. The Cowboys' streak was interrupted by the 49ers, who won their league-leading fifth title overall with Super Bowl XXIX in dominating fashion under Super Bowl MVP and Hall of Fame quarterback Steve Young, Hall of Fame wide receiver Jerry Rice, and Hall of Fame cornerback Deion Sanders; however, the Cowboys' victory in Super Bowl XXX the next year also gave them five titles overall and they did so with Sanders after he won the Super Bowl the previous year with the 49ers. The NFC's winning streak was continued by the Green Bay Packers who, under Hall of Fame quarterback Brett Favre, won Super Bowl XXXI, their first championship since Super Bowl II in the late 1960s.\\r\\nSuper Bowl XXXII saw quarterback John Elway and running back Terrell Davis lead the Denver Broncos to an upset victory over the defending champion Packers, snapping the NFC's 13-year winning streak. The following year, the Broncos defeated the Atlanta Falcons in Super Bowl XXXIII, Elway's fifth Super Bowl appearance, his second NFL championship, and his final NFL game. The back-to-back victories heralded a change in momentum in which AFC teams would win nine out of 12 Super Bowls. In the years between 1995 and 2016, five teams?ÿ the Steelers, New England Patriots, Broncos, Baltimore Ravens, and Indianapolis Colts ÿ accounted for 20 of the 22 AFC Super Bowl appearances (including the last 14), with those same teams often meeting each other earlier in the playoffs. In contrast, the NFC saw a different representative in the Super Bowl every season from 2001 through 2010.\\r\\nThe year following the Broncos' second victory, however, a surprising St. Louis Rams team led by the undrafted quarterback, Kurt Warner, who would close out the 1990s in a wild battle against the Tennessee Titans in Super Bowl XXXIV. The tense game came down to the final play in which Tennessee had the opportunity to tie the game and send it to overtime. The Titans nearly pulled it off, but the tackle of receiver Kevin Dyson by linebacker Mike Jones kept the ball out of the end zone by a matter of inches. In 2007, ESPN would rank \\"The Tackle\\" as the 2nd greatest moment in Super Bowl history.[17]\\r\\nSuper Bowl XXXV was played by the AFC's Baltimore Ravens and the NFC's New York Giants. The Ravens defeated the Giants by the score of 34ÿ7. The game was played on January 28, 2001, at Raymond James Stadium in Tampa, Florida.\\r\\nThe New England Patriots became the dominant team throughout the early 2000s, winning the championship three out of four years early in the decade. They would become only the second team in the history of the NFL to do so (after the 1990s Dallas Cowboys). In Super Bowl XXXVI, first-year starting quarterback Tom Brady led his team to a 20ÿ17 upset victory over the St. Louis Rams. Brady would go on to win the MVP award for this game. The Patriots also won Super Bowls XXXVIII[18] and XXXIX defeating the Carolina Panthers and the Philadelphia Eagles respectively. This four-year stretch of Patriot dominance was interrupted by the Tampa Bay Buccaneers' 48ÿ21 Super Bowl XXXVII victory over the Oakland Raiders.\\r\\nThe Pittsburgh Steelers and Indianapolis Colts continued the era of AFC dominance by winning Super Bowls XL and XLI in 2005ÿ06 and 2006ÿ07, respectively defeating the Seattle Seahawks and Chicago Bears.\\r\\nIn the 2007 season, the Patriots became the fourth team in NFL history to have a perfect unbeaten and untied regular season record, the second in the Super Bowl era after the 1972 Miami Dolphins, and the first to finish 16ÿ0. They easily marched through the AFC playoffs and were heavy favorites in Super Bowl XLII. However, they lost that game to Eli Manning and the New York Giants 17ÿ14, leaving the Patriots' 2007 record at 18ÿ1.\\r\\nThe following season, the Steelers logged their record sixth Super Bowl title (XLIII) in a 27ÿ23, final-minute victory against the Arizona Cardinals.\\r\\nThe 2009 season saw the New Orleans Saints defeat the Indianapolis Colts in Super Bowl XLIV by a score of 31ÿ17 to take home their first Championship. With this victory, the Saints joined the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and New York Jets as the only teams to have won in their sole Super Bowl appearance.\\r\\nThe 2010s have seen parity between the two conferences, but not within them. Since the start of 2010, five of the nine Super Bowl winners hailed from the NFC, the other four from the AFC.\\r\\nFollowing up the Saints' win in Super Bowl XLIV, the 2010 season brought the Green Bay Packers their fourth Super Bowl (XLV) victory and record thirteenth NFL championship overall with the defeat of the Pittsburgh Steelers in February 2011. The Giants won another title after the 2011 season, again defeating the Patriots in Super Bowl XLVI.\\r\\nThe Baltimore Ravens snapped the NFC's three-game winning streak by winning Super Bowl XLVII in a 34ÿ31 victory over the San Francisco 49ers. Super Bowl XLVIII, played at New Jersey's MetLife Stadium in February 2014, was the first Super Bowl held outdoors in a cold weather environment. The Seattle Seahawks won their first NFL title with a 43ÿ8 defeat of the Denver Broncos, in a highly touted matchup that pitted Seattle's top-ranked defense against a Peyton Manning-led Denver offense that had broken the NFL's single-season scoring record.\\r\\nIn Super Bowl XLIX, the Patriots beat the defending Super Bowl champions, the Seahawks, 28ÿ24 as Malcolm Butler intercepted a Seattle pass in the end zone with the Seahawks poised to take the lead. In Super Bowl 50, the Broncos, led by the league's top-ranked defense, defeated the Carolina Panthers, who had the league's top-ranked offense, in what became the final game of quarterback Peyton Manning's career.\\r\\nIn Super Bowl LI, the Atlanta Falcons had a 28ÿ3 lead late in the third quarter, but lost to the Patriots, 34ÿ28, in the first Super Bowl to ever end in overtime.\\r\\nIn Super Bowl LII, the Philadelphia Eagles defeated the New England Patriots, 41ÿ33. It was the Eagles' third Super Bowl appearance, and their first win in franchise history. It was the Patriots' tenth Super Bowl appearance, and their fourth appearance in ten years; had the Patriots won, they would have tied the Pittsburgh Steelers with the most Super Bowl wins (six).\\r\\nThe Super Bowls of the late 2000s and 2010s are notable for the performances (and the pedigrees) of several of the participating quarterbacks, and stagnation (especially on the AFC side) in repeated appearances by the same teams and players. In particular, Tom Brady, Ben Roethlisberger, or Peyton Manning appeared as the AFC team's quarterback in all but two of the Super Bowls between 2001 and 2018.\\r\\nThe Super Bowl is one of the most watched annual sporting events in the world, with viewership overwhelmingly domestic.[19] The only other annual event that gathers more viewers is the UEFA Champions League final.[19] For many years, the Super Bowl has possessed a large US and global television viewership, and it is often the most watched United States originating television program of the year.[20] The game tends to have high Nielsen television ratings, which is usually around a 40 rating and 60 shares. This means that on average, more than 100 million people from the United States alone are tuned into the Super Bowl at any given moment.\\r\\nIn press releases preceding each year's event, the NFL typically claims that that year's Super Bowl will have a potential worldwide audience of around one billion people in over 200 countries.[21] This figure refers to the number of people able to watch the game, not the number of people actually watching. However, the statements have been frequently misinterpreted in various media as referring to the latter figure, leading to a common misperception about the game's actual global audience.[22][23] The New York-based media research firm Initiative measured the global audience for the 2005 Super Bowl at 93 million people, with 98 percent of that figure being viewers in North America, which meant roughly 2 million people outside North America watched the Super Bowl that year.[22]\\r\\nThe 2015 Super Bowl XLIX holds the record for average number of U.S. viewers, with a final number of 114.4 million,[24] making the game the most-viewed television broadcast of any kind in American history. The halftime show was the most watched ever with 118.5 million viewers tuning in, and an all-time high of 168 million viewers in the United States had watched several portions of the Super Bowl 2015 broadcast.[25] The game set a record for total viewers for the fifth time in six years.[6]\\r\\nThe highest-rated game according to Nielsen was Super Bowl XVI in 1982, which was watched in 49.1 percent of households (73 shares), or 40,020,000 households at the time. Ratings for that game, a San Francisco victory over Cincinnati, may have been aided by a large blizzard that had affected much of the northeastern United States on game day, leaving residents to stay at home more than usual. Super Bowl XVI still ranks fourth on Nielsen's list of top-rated programs of all time, and three other Super Bowls, XII, XVII, and XX, made the top ten.[26]\\r\\nFamous commercial campaigns include the Budweiser \\"Bud Bowl\\" campaign, the 1984 introduction of Apple's Macintosh computer, and the 1999 and 2000 dot-com ads. As the television ratings of the Super Bowl have steadily increased over the years, prices have also increased every year, with advertisers paying as much as $3.5 million for a thirty-second spot during Super Bowl XLVI in 2012.[27] A segment of the audience tunes into the Super Bowl solely to view commercials.[9] In 2010, Nielsen reported that 51 percent of Super Bowl viewers tune in for the commercials.[28] The Super Bowl halftime show has spawned another set of alternative entertainment such as the Lingerie Bowl, the Beer Bottle Bowl, and others.\\r\\nSince 1991, the Super Bowl has begun between 6:19 and 6:40 PM EST so that most of the game is played during the primetime hours on the East Coast.[29]\\r\\nNote: Years listed are the year the game was actually played (will be played[?]) rather than what NFL season it is considered to have been.\\r\\n^?*:?The extended current TV contracts with the networks expire after the 2022 season (or Super Bowl LVII in early 2023) and the Super Bowl is currently rotated annually between CBS, Fox, and NBC in that order.\\r\\n^?**:?ABC is not currently in the rotation for Super Bowl broadcasts.\\r\\n^?***:?The first Super Bowl was simultaneously broadcast by CBS and NBC, with each network using the same video feed, but providing its own commentary.\\r\\nSuper Bowls IÿVI were blacked out in the television markets of the host cities, due to league restrictions then in place.[30]\\r\\nThe Super Bowl provides an extremely strong lead-in to programming following it on the same channel, the effects of which can last for several hours. For instance, in discussing the ratings of a local TV station, Buffalo television critic Alan Pergament noted on the coattails from Super Bowl XLVII, which aired on CBS: \\"A paid program that ran on Channel 4 (WIVB-TV) at 2:30 in the morning had a 1.3 rating. That's higher than some CW prime time shows get on WNLO-TV, Channel 4's sister station.\\"[31]\\r\\nBecause of this strong coattail effect, the network that airs the Super Bowl typically takes advantage of the large audience to air an episode of a hit series, or to premiere the pilot of a promising new one in the lead-out slot, which immediately follows the Super Bowl and post-game coverage.\\r\\nInitially, it was sort of a novelty and so it didn't quite feel right. But it was just like, this is the year. ... Bands of our generation, you can sort of be seen on a stage like this or, like, not seen. There's not a lot of middle places. It is a tremendous venue.\\r\\nEarly Super Bowls featured a halftime show consisting of marching bands from local colleges or high schools; but as the popularity of the game increased, a trend where popular singers and musicians performed during its pre-game ceremonies and the halftime show, or simply sang the national anthem of the United States, emerged.[33] Unlike regular season or playoff games, thirty minutes are allocated for the Super Bowl halftime. After a special live episode of the Fox sketch comedy series In Living Color caused a drop in viewership for the Super Bowl XXVI halftime show, the NFL sought to increase the Super Bowl's audience by hiring A-list talent to perform. They approached Michael Jackson, whose performance the following year drew higher figures than the game itself.[34][35] Another notable performance came during Super Bowl XXXVI in 2002, when U2 performed; during their third song, \\"Where the Streets Have No Name\\", the band played under a large projection screen which scrolled through names of the victims of the September 11 attacks.\\r\\nFor many years, Whitney Houston's performance of the national anthem at Super Bowl XXV in 1991, during the Gulf War, had long been regarded as one of the best renditions of the anthem in history.[36][37][38] Then, in an historic, groundbreaking, and emotional performance prior to Super Bowl XLVIII, soprano Renee Fleming became the first opera singer to perform the anthem, propelling FOX to the highest ratings of any program in its history, and remains so today.\\r\\nThe halftime show of Super Bowl XXXVIII attracted controversy, following an incident in which Justin Timberlake removed a piece of Janet Jackson's top, briefly exposing one of her breasts before the broadcast quickly cut away from the shot. The incident led to fines being issued by the FCC (and a larger crackdown over \\"indecent\\" content broadcast on television), and MTV (then a sister to the game's broadcaster that year, CBS, under Viacom) being banned by the NFL from producing the Super Bowl halftime show in the future. In an effort to prevent a repeat of the incident, the NFL held a moratorium on Super Bowl halftime shows featuring pop performers, and instead invited a single, headlining veteran act, such as Paul McCartney, The Who, Prince, and Bruce Springsteen. This practice ended at Super Bowl XLV, which returned to using current pop acts such as The Black Eyed Peas and Katy Perry.[39][40]\\r\\nExcluding Super Bowl XXXIX, the famous \\"I'm going to Disney World!\\" advertising campaign took place in every Super Bowl since Super Bowl XXI when quarterback Phil Simms from the New York Giants became the first player to say the tagline.\\r\\nAs of Super Bowl LII, 27 of 52 Super Bowls have been played in three cities: New Orleans (ten times), the Greater Miami area (ten times), and the Greater Los Angeles area (seven times). No market or region without an active NFL franchise has ever hosted a Super Bowl, and the presence of an NFL team in a market or region is now a de jure requirement for bidding on the game.[41][42] The winning market is not, however, required to host the Super Bowl in the same stadium that its NFL team uses, and nine Super Bowls have been held in a stadium other than the one the NFL team in that city was using at the time. For example, Los Angeles's last five Super Bowls were all played at the Rose Bowl, which has never been used by any NFL franchise outside of the Super Bowl.[citation needed]\\r\\nNo team has ever played the Super Bowl in its home stadium. The closest any team has come was the 2017 Minnesota Vikings, who were within one win of playing Super Bowl LII in U.S. Bank Stadium, but lost the NFC Championship game to the Philadelphia Eagles. Two teams have played the Super Bowl in their home market: the San Francisco 49ers, who played Super Bowl XIX in Stanford Stadium instead of Candlestick Park; and the Los Angeles Rams, who played Super Bowl XIV in the Rose Bowl instead of the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. In both cases, the stadium in which the Super Bowl was held was perceived to be a better stadium for a large, high-profile event than the stadiums the Rams and 49ers were playing in at the time; this situation has not arisen since 1993, in part because the league has traditionally awarded the Super Bowl in modern times to the newest stadiums. Besides those two, the only other Super Bowl venue that was not the home stadium to an NFL team at the time was Rice Stadium in Houston: the Houston Oilers had played there previously, but moved to the Astrodome several years prior to Super Bowl VIII. The Orange Bowl was the only AFL stadium to host a Super Bowl and the only stadium to host consecutive Super Bowls, hosting Super Bowls II and III.\\r\\nTraditionally, the NFL does not award Super Bowls to stadiums that are located in climates with an expected average daily temperature less than 50?F (10?C) on game day unless the field can be completely covered by a fixed or retractable roof.[43] Six Super Bowls have been played in northern cities: two in the Detroit areaSuper Bowl XVI at Pontiac Silverdome in Pontiac, Michigan and Super Bowl XL at Ford Field in Detroit, two in MinneapolisSuper Bowl XXVI at the Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome and Super Bowl LII at the U.S. Bank Stadium, one in Indianapolis at Lucas Oil Stadium for Super Bowl XLVI, and one in the New York areaSuper Bowl XLVIII at MetLife Stadium. Only MetLife Stadium did not have a roof (be it fixed or retractable) but it was still picked as the host stadium for Super Bowl XLVIII in an apparent waiver of the warm-climate rule.\\r\\nThere have been a few instances where the league has rescinded the Super Bowl from cities. Super Bowl XXVII in 1993 was originally awarded to Sun Devil Stadium in Tempe, Arizona, but after Arizona voters elected not to recognize Martin Luther King, Jr. Day as a paid state-employee's holiday in 1990, the NFL moved the game to the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, California.[44] When voters in Arizona opted to create such a legal holiday in 1992, Super Bowl XXX in 1996 was awarded to Tempe. Super Bowl XXXIII was awarded first to Candlestick Park in San Francisco, but when plans to renovate the stadium fell through, the game was moved to Pro Player Stadium in greater Miami. Super Bowl XXXVII was awarded to a new stadium not yet built in San Francisco, when that stadium failed to be built, the game was moved to San Diego. Super Bowl XLIV, slated for February 7, 2010, was withdrawn from New York City's proposed West Side Stadium, because the city, state, and proposed tenants New York Jets could not agree on funding. Super Bowl XLIV was then eventually awarded to Sun Life Stadium in Miami Gardens, Florida. Super Bowl XLIX in 2015 was originally given to Arrowhead Stadium in Kansas City, Missouri, but after two sales taxes failed to pass at the ballot box, and opposition by local business leaders and politicians increased, Kansas City eventually withdrew its request to host the game.[45] Super Bowl XLIX was then eventually awarded to University of Phoenix Stadium in Glendale, Arizona.\\r\\nIn 2011, Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott said, \\"[The Super Bowl is] commonly known as the single largest human trafficking incident in the United States.\\" According to Forbes, 10,000 prostitutes were brought to Miami in 2010 for the Super Bowl.[46] Snopes research in 2015 determined that the actual number of prostitutes involved in a typical Super Bowl weekend is less than 100, not statistically higher than any other time of the year, and that the notion of mass increases in human trafficking around the Super Bowl was a politician's myth.[47]\\r\\nThe location of the Super Bowl is chosen by the NFL well in advance, usually three to five years before the game. Cities place bids to host a Super Bowl and are evaluated in terms of stadium renovation and their ability to host.[43][48] In 2014, a document listing the specific requirements of Super Bowl hosts was leaked, giving a clear list of what was required for a Super Bowl host.[49] Much of the cost of the Super Bowl is to be assumed by the host community, although some costs are enumerated within the requirements to be assumed by the NFL. Some of the host requirements include:\\r\\nThe NFL owners meet to make a selection on the site, usually three to five years prior to the event. In 2007, NFL commissioner Roger Goodell suggested that a Super Bowl might be played in London, perhaps at Wembley Stadium.[51] The game has never been played in a region that lacks an NFL franchise; seven Super Bowls have been played in Los Angeles, but none were held there in the 21-year period when the league had no team in the area.[citation needed] New Orleans, the site of the 2013 Super Bowl, invested more than $1 billion in infrastructure improvements in the years leading up to the game.[52]\\r\\nThe designated \\"home team\\" alternates between the NFC team in odd-numbered games and the AFC team in even-numbered games.[53][54] This alternation was initiated with the first Super Bowl, when the Green Bay Packers were the designated home team. Regardless of being the home or away team of record, each team has their team logo and wordmark painted in one of the end zones. Designated away teams have won 30 of 51 Super Bowls to date (approximately 59 percent).\\r\\nSince Super Bowl XIII in January 1979, the home team is given the choice of wearing their colored or white jerseys. Originally, the designated home team had to wear their colored jerseys, which resulted in Dallas donning their less exposed dark blue jerseys for Super Bowl V. While most of the home teams in the Super Bowl have chosen to wear their colored jerseys, there have been six (6) exceptions: the Dallas Cowboys during Super Bowl XIII and XXVII, the Washington Redskins during Super Bowl XVII, the Pittsburgh Steelers during Super Bowl XL, the Denver Broncos during Super Bowl 50, and the New England Patriots in Super Bowl LII. The Cowboys, since 1964, have worn white jerseys at home. The Redskins wore white at home under coach Joe Gibbs starting in 1981 through 1992, continued by Richie Petitbon and Norv Turner through 2000, then again when Gibbs returned from 2004 through 2007. Meanwhile, the Steelers, who have always worn their black jerseys at home since the AFLÿNFL merger in 1970, opted for the white jerseys after winning three consecutive playoff games on the road, wearing white. The Steelers' decision was compared with the New England Patriots in Super Bowl XX; the Patriots had worn white jerseys at home during the 1985 season, but after winning road playoff games against the New York Jets and Miami Dolphins wearing red jerseys, New England opted to switch to crimson for the Super Bowl as the designated home team. For the Broncos in Super Bowl 50, Denver general manager John Elway simply stated, \\"We've had Super Bowl success in our white uniforms\\"; they previously had been 0ÿ4 in Super Bowls when wearing their orange jerseys.[55][56] The Broncos' decision is also perceived to be made out of superstition, losing all Super Bowl games with the orange jerseys in terrible fashion. It is unclear why the Patriots chose to wear their white jerseys for Super Bowl LII. During the pairing of Bill Belichick and Tom Brady, New England has mostly worn their blue jerseys for home games, but have worn white for a home game in the 2008, 2010, and 2011 seasons.[57] The New England Patriots were 3-0 in their white uniforms in Super Bowls prior to Super Bowl LII with Belichick and Brady,[58][59] and they may have been going on recent trends of teams who wear white for the Super Bowl game.[60][61][62] White-shirted teams have won 33 of 52 Super Bowls to date (63 percent). The only teams to win in their dark-colored uniform in more recent years are the Green Bay Packers against the Pittsburgh Steelers in Super Bowl XLV and the Philadelphia Eagles against the New England Patriots in Super Bowl LII, with teams in white winning 12 of the last 14 Super Bowls.[63]\\r\\nThe 49ers, as part of the league's 75th Anniversary celebration, used their 1957 throwback uniform in Super Bowl XXIX, which for that year was their regular home jersey. No team has yet worn a third jersey or Color Rush uniform for the Super Bowl.\\r\\nFifteen different regions have hosted Super Bowls.\\r\\nNote: Years listed are the year the game was actually played (or will be played[?]; future games are denoted through italics) rather than what NFL season it is considered to have been.\\r\\nA total of twenty-six different stadiums, five of which no longer exist and one of which does not yet exist, have hosted or are scheduled to host Super Bowls.

NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell has openly discussed the possibility on different occasions.[68][69][70][71] Time zone complications are a significant obstacle to a Super Bowl in London; a typical 6:30?p.m. Eastern Time start would result in the game beginning at 11:30?p.m. local time in London, an unusually late hour to be holding spectator sports (the NFL has never in its history started a game later than 9:15?p.m. local time).[71] As bids have been submitted for all Super Bowls through Super Bowl LVI, the soonest that any stadium outside the NFL's footprint could serve as host would be Super Bowl LVII in 2023.\\r\\nThe NFL is very active on stopping what it says is unauthorized commercial use of its trademarked terms \\"NFL\\", \\"Super Bowl\\", and \\"Super Sunday\\".[72] As a result, many events and promotions tied to the game, but not sanctioned by the NFL, are asked to refer to it with euphemisms such as \\"The Big Game\\", or other generic descriptions.[73][74] A radio spot for Planters nuts parodied this, by saying \\"it would be super...to have a bowl...of Planters nuts while watching the big game!\\" and comedian Stephen Colbert began referring to the game in 2014 as the \\"Superb Owl\\". In 2015, the NFL filed opposition with the USPTO Trademark Trial and Appeal Board to a trademark application submitted by an Arizona-based nonprofit for \\"Superb Owl\\".[75] The NFL claims that the use of the phrase \\"Super Bowl\\" implies an NFL affiliation, and on this basis the league asserts broad rights to restrict how the game may be shown publicly; for example, the league says Super Bowl showings are prohibited in churches or at other events that \\"promote a message\\", while venues that do not regularly show sporting events cannot show the Super Bowl on any television screen larger than 55?inches.[76] Some critics say the NFL is exaggerating its ownership rights by stating that \\"any use is prohibited\\", as this contradicts the broad doctrine of fair use in the United States.[76] Legislation was proposed by Utah Senator Orrin Hatch in 2008 \\"to provide an exemption from exclusive rights in copyright for certain nonprofit organizations to display live football games\\", and \\"for other purposes\\".[77]\\r\\nIn 2004, The NFL started issuing Cease and Desist letters to casinos in Las Vegas that were hosting Super Bowl parties. \\"Super Bowl\\" is a registered trademark, owned by the NFL, and any other business using that name for profit-making ventures is in violation of federal law, according to the letters. In reaction to the letters, many Vegas resorts, rather than discontinue the popular and lucrative parties, started referring to them as \\"Big Game Parties.\\"[78][79][80]\\r\\nIn 2006, the NFL made an attempt to trademark \\"The Big Game\\" as well; however, it withdrew the application in 2007 due to growing commercial and public-relations opposition to the move, mostly from Stanford University and the University of California, Berkeley and their fans, as the Stanford Cardinal football and California Golden Bears football teams compete in the Big Game, which has been played since 1892 (28 years before the formation of the NFL and 75 years before Super Bowl I).[81] Additionally, the Mega Millions lottery game was known as The Big Game from 1996 to 2002.[82]\\r\\nLike the other major professional leagues in the United States, the winner of the Super Bowl is usually declared \\"world champions\\", a title that has been mocked by non-American journalists.[83][84] Others feel the title is fitting, since it is the only professional league of its kind.[85]\\r\\nThe practice by the U.S. major leagues of using the \\"World Champion\\" moniker originates from the World Series of professional baseball,[citation needed] and it was later used during the first three Super Bowls when they were referred to as AFL-NFL World Championship Games. The phrase is still engraved on the Super Bowl rings.\\r\\n Media related to Super Bowl at Wikimedia Commons","input":"Where was this year's super bowl held?"},{"output":"more than a half dozen coaches","context":"In baseball, a number of coaches assist in the smooth functioning of a team. They are assistants to the manager, who determines the lineup and decides how to substitute players during the game. Beyond the manager, more than a half dozen coaches may assist the manager in running the team.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBaseball is unique in that the manager and coaches typically all wear numbered uniforms similar to those of the players. Notable exceptions to this were Baseball Hall of Fame manager Connie Mack, who always wore a black suit during his 50 years at the helm of the Philadelphia Athletics, and Burt Shotton, manager of the Brooklyn Dodgers in the late 1940s, who wore a Dodger 200 cap and a team jacket over street clothes in the dugout. After the widespread adoption of numbered uniforms in the early 1930s, Joe McCarthy, another Hall of Fame manager, wore a full uniform but no number on his back for the remainder of his career (with the New York Yankees, then the Boston Red Sox). Coincidentally, all three men retired during or after the same season  1950.\\r\\nFull-time coaches in professional baseball date to 1909, when John McGraw of the New York Giants engaged Arlie Latham and Wilbert Robinson as coaches.[1] By the 1920s, most Major League teams had two full-time coaches, although the manager often doubled as third-base coach and specialists such as pitching coaches were rare. After World War II, most MLB teams listed between three and five coaches on their roster, as managers increasingly ran their teams from the dugout full-time, and appointed pitching and bullpen coaches to assist them and the baseline coaches. Batting and bench coaches came into vogue during the 1960s and later.[1] Because of the proliferation of uniformed coaches in the modern game, by the late 2000s Major League Baseball had restricted the number of uniformed staff to six coaches and one manager during the course of a game.[2] Beginning with the 2013 season, clubs are permitted to employ a seventh uniformed coach, designated the assistant hitting coach, at their own discretion.[3]\\r\\nThe first bench coach in baseball was George Huff, who took that helm for the Illinois Fighting Illini baseball in 1905; at the time, it meant a coach present throughout the season.[4]\\r\\nMore recently, the bench coach is a team's second-in-command. The bench coach serves as an in-game advisor to the manager, offering situational advice, and bouncing ideas back and forth in order to assist the manager in making game decisions.[5] If the manager is ejected, suspended, or unable to attend a game for any reason, the bench coach assumes the position of acting manager. If the manager is fired or resigns during the season, it is usually the bench coach who gets promoted to interim manager. The bench coach's responsibilities also include helping to set up the day's practice and stretching routines before a game, as well as coordinating spring training routines and practices.[6]\\r\\nA pitching coach mentors and trains teams' pitchers. He advises the manager on the condition of pitchers and their arms, and serves as an in-game coach for the pitcher currently on the mound. When a manager makes a visit to the mound, he typically is doing so to make a pitching change or to discuss situational defense. However, to talk about mechanics or how to pitch to a particular batter, the pitching coach is the one who will typically visit the mound. The pitching coach is generally a former pitcher. One exception is Dave Duncan, the former pitching coach of the St. Louis Cardinals, who was a catcher. Prior to the early 1950s, pitching coaches were usually former catchers.[7]\\r\\nThe bullpen coach is similar to a pitching coach, but works primarily with relief pitchers in the bullpen. He does not make mound visits, however, as he stays in the bullpen the entire game, working with relievers who are warming up to enter the game. Generally, the bullpen coach is either a former pitcher or catcher.\\r\\nA hitting coach, as the name suggests, works with a team's players to improve their hitting techniques and form. He monitors players' swings during the game and over the course of the season, advising them when necessary between at-bats on adjustments to make. He also oversees their performance during practices, cage sessions, and pre-game batting practice. With the advent of technology, hitting coaches are increasingly utilizing video to analyze their hitters along with scouting the opposing pitchers. Video has allowed hitting coaches to clearly illustrate problem areas in the swing, making the adjustment period quicker for the player being analyzed. This process is typically called video analysis.\\r\\nTwo on-field coaches are present when the team is at bat. Stationed in designated coaches' boxes near first and third base, they are appropriately named base coachesindividually, first base coach and third base coach. They assist in the direction of baserunners, help prevent pickoffs, and relay signals sent from the manager in the dugout to runners and batters. While the first base coach is primarily responsible for the batter as to whether he stops at first base or not or for a runner already on first, the third base coach carries more responsibility. His duties include holding or sending runners rounding second and third bases, as well as having to make critical, split-second decisions about whether to try to score a runner on a hit, and accounting for the arm strength of the opposing team's fielder and the speed and position of his baserunner.\\r\\nThe bench coach, third base coach, and first base coach often are assigned additional responsibility for assisting players in specific areas, particularly defense. Common designations include outfield instructor, infield instructor, catching instructor, and baserunning instructor.[8] When a coaching staff is assembled, the selection of the first base coach is frequently made with the purpose of filling a gap in these coaching responsibilities, as the actual in-game duties of a first base coach are relatively light.\\r\\nTeams may also employ individuals to work with players in other areas or activities. These positions sometimes include the word \\"coach\\" in their titles. Individuals holding these positions usually do not dress in uniform during games, as the number of uniformed coaches is restricted by Major League Baseball rules. The most prominent of these positions are the athletic trainer and the strength and conditioning coach. All Major League Baseball teams employ an athletic trainer; most employ a strength and conditioning coach. Other positions include bullpen catcher and batting practice pitcher. Some teams also employ additional coaches without specific responsibilities.\\r\\nIn general, Major League Baseball teams will have one person specifically assigned to each coaching position described above. However, minor league and amateur teams typically have coaches fulfill multiple responsibilities. A typical minor league/amateur team coaching structure will have a manager, a pitching coach, and a hitting coach, each of whom also assumes the responsibilities of the first and third base coaches, bullpen coach, etc. In U.S. college baseball, the title \\"manager\\" is not used; the person who fills the role of a professional manager is instead called the \\"head coach\\".","input":"How many coaches are on a mlb baseball team?"},{"output":"over 100 words","context":"The grey parrot or African grey parrot (Psittacus erithacus) is an Old World parrot in the family Psittacidae. This article describes the Congo grey parrot. The Timneh parrot (Psittacus timneh) was earlier treated as conspecific but has since been split as a full species.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe grey parrot is a medium-sized, predominantly grey, black-billed parrot. Their average weight is 400 grams (0.88?lb), with an average length of 33 centimetres (13?in)[2] and an average wingspan of 46ÿ52?cm.[3] The Congo species is a lighter grey, with darker grey over the head and both wings, while the head and body feathers have a slight white edge to them. The tail feathers are red. The Timneh is a darker grey and has a dark maroon coloured tail as well as having a portion of their beak being light pink in colour. Due to artificial selection by parrot breeders, some Congo grey parrots are partially or completely red.[4] Both sexes appear similar.[2] The colouration of juveniles is similar to that of adults, but the eye is typically dark grey to black, in comparison to the yellow irises around dark eyes of the adult birds.[5] The undertail coverts are also tinged with grey.[2] The adults weigh between 418 and 526 grams.[6]\\r\\nGrey parrots may live for 40ÿ60 years in captivity, although their mean lifespan in the wild appears to be shorter at about 23 years.[3]\\r\\nThe grey parrot is native to equatorial Africa, including Angola, Cameroon, Congo, C?te d'Ivoire, Ghana, Kenya, and Uganda. The species is found inside a range from Kenya to the eastern part of the Ivory Coast.[7] Between 120,100 and 259,000 Timneh African gray parrots remain worldwide.[8] Current estimates for the global population of Congo grey parrots are uncertain and range from 0.63 to 13 million birds. Populations are decreasing worldwide.[8] The species seems to favor dense forests, but can also be found at forest edges and in more open vegetation types (gallery and savanna forests).[1]\\r\\nA population study published in 2015 found that the species had been virtually eliminated from Ghana with numbers declining 90 to 99% since 1992.[9] They were found in only 10 of 42 forested areas, and in three roosts that once held between 700 and 1200 birds each, now had only 18 in total. Local people mainly blamed the pet trade, and the felling of timber for the decline.[10] Populations are thought to be stable in Cameroon, and in the Congo an estimated 15,000 are taken every year for the pet trade, from the eastern part of the country. The annual quota is 5,000.[10]\\r\\nGrey parrots are monogamous breeders which nest in tree cavities. Each couple of parrots needs its own tree to nest. The hen lays three to five eggs, which she incubates for 30 days while being fed by her mate. The adults defend their nesting sites.[7] Both parents help take care of the chicks until they can go off on their own.[11] Grey parrot chicks require feeding and care from their parents in the nest.[7] The parents take care of them until four or five weeks after they are fledged.[11] Young leave the nest at the age of 12 weeks. Little is known about the courtship behavior of this species in the wild.[3] They weigh between 12 and 14 g at hatching and between 372 and 526 g when they leave their parents.[6]\\r\\nThey are mostly frugivorous; most of their diet consists of fruit, nuts, and seeds. The species prefers oil palm fruit and also eat flowers and tree bark, as well as insects and snails.[4] In the wild, the grey is partly a ground feeder.[12] In captivity, it can eat sunflower seeds, bird pellets, a variety of fruits such as pears, orange, pomegranate, apple, and banana, and vegetables such as carrots, cooked sweet potato, celery, fresh kale, peas, and green beans.[6][12] They also need a source of calcium.[7]\\r\\nThe natural predators for this species include palm-nut vultures, as well as a number of raptors; monkeys target eggs and the young for food. Grey parrots in captivity have been observed to be susceptible to fungal infections, bacterial infections, nutritional insufficiency, malignant tumors, psittacine beak and feather disease, tapeworms, and blood-worms.[7][12]\\r\\nHumans are by far the largest threat to wild grey populations. Between 1994 and 2003, over 359,000 grey parrots were traded on the international market. Around 21% of the population of the wild birds are being harvested every year. Mortality rates are extremely high after they are captured until they reach market, ranging from 60 to 66%.[8] Mortality among imported birds is high.[13] This bird is also hunted for its meat and for its parts are used in traditional medicines.[14] As a result of the extensive harvest of wild birds, in addition to habitat loss, this species is believed to be undergoing a rapid decline in the wild and has therefore been rated as endangered by the IUCN.[1]\\r\\nIn October 2016, the Convention on the International Trade of Endangered Fauna and Flora (CITES) extended the highest level of protection to grey parrots by listing the species under appendix 1, which bans global and domestic trade in the species.[15]\\r\\nThe species is common in captivity and is regularly kept by humans as a companion parrot, prized for its ability to mimic human speech, which makes it one of the most popular avian pets.[1] An escaped pet in Japan was returned to his owner after repeating the owner's name and address.[16]\\r\\nThey are notorious for mimicking noises around their environment and using them tirelessly. While they are highly intelligent birds, they need enrichment and attention in captivity or they can become distressed; feather plucking is a common symptom.[12] However, they may be prone to behavioural problems due to their sensitive nature.[13]\\r\\nGrey parrots are also highly intelligent, having been shown to perform at the cognitive level of a 4ÿ to 6-year-old child in some tasks. New experiments have shown that grey parrots can learn number sequences and can associate human voices with those humans' faces.[17] Most notably, Dr Irene Pepperberg's work with Alex the parrot showed his ability to learn over 100 words, differentiating between objects, colours, materials, and shapes.[18]\\r\\nGrey mutations occur naturally in the wild, like the Blue Ino (albino), Incomplete Ino, and Blue varietals. The Blue Ino is all white. The Incomplete Ino has light pigmentation. The Blue has a white tail.\\r\\nBreeders from South Africa, Australia, New Zealand, and Scandinavia have intensively bred greys since the 1800s. These bred varieties include the Red Pied, F2 Pied, Grizzles, Ino, Incomplete, Parino, Lutino, Cinnamon, and Red Factor. South African bird breeder Von van Antwerpen and New Zealand partner Jaco Bosman selected F2 Pieds and created the first Red Factor Greys. The Red Factor Greys are rare, can be predominantly red-pigmented, and range in price depending on the extent of the red plumage displayed.[19]","input":"How many words can a grey parrot learn?"},{"output":"Four molecules of ATP","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nCellular respiration is a set of metabolic reactions and processes that take place in the cells of organisms to convert biochemical energy from nutrients into adenosine triphosphate (ATP), and then release waste products.[1] The reactions involved in respiration are catabolic reactions, which break large molecules into smaller ones, releasing energy in the process, as weak so-called \\"high-energy\\" bonds are replaced by stronger bonds in the products. Respiration is one of the key ways a cell releases chemical energy to fuel cellular activity. Cellular respiration is considered an exothermic redox reaction which releases heat. The overall reaction occurs in a series of biochemical steps, most of which are redox reactions themselves. Although cellular respiration is technically a combustion reaction, it clearly does not resemble one when it occurs in a living cell because of the slow release of energy from the series of reactions.\\r\\n\\r\\nNutrients that are commonly used by animal and plant cells in respiration include sugar, amino acids and fatty acids, and the most common oxidizing agent (electron acceptor) is molecular oxygen (O2). The chemical energy stored in ATP (its third phosphate group is weakly bonded to the rest of the molecule and is cheaply broken allowing stronger bonds to form, thereby transferring energy for use by the cell) can then be used to drive processes requiring energy, including biosynthesis, locomotion or transportation of molecules across cell membranes.\\r\\n\\r\\nAerobic respiration requires oxygen (O2) in order to create ATP. Although carbohydrates, fats, and proteins  are consumed as reactants, it is the preferred method of pyruvate breakdown in glycolysis and requires that pyruvate enter the mitochondria in order to be fully oxidized by the Krebs cycle. The products of this process are carbon dioxide and water, but the energy transferred is used to break bonds in ADP as the third phosphate group is added to form  ATP (adenosine triphosphate), by substrate-level phosphorylation, NADH and FADH2\\r\\n\\r\\nThe negative G indicates that the reaction can occur spontaneously.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe potential of NADH and FADH2 is converted to more ATP through an electron transport chain with oxygen as the \\"terminal electron acceptor\\". Most of the ATP produced by aerobic cellular respiration is made by oxidative phosphorylation. This works by the energy released in the consumption of pyruvate being used to create a chemiosmotic potential by pumping protons across a membrane. This potential is then used to drive ATP synthase and produce ATP from ADP and a phosphate group. Biology textbooks often state that 38 ATP molecules can be made per oxidised glucose molecule during cellular respiration (2 from glycolysis, 2 from the Krebs cycle, and about 34 from the electron transport system).[2] However, this maximum yield is never quite reached because of losses due to leaky membranes as well as the cost of moving pyruvate and ADP into the mitochondrial matrix, and current estimates range around 29 to 30 ATP per glucose.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nAerobic metabolism is up to 15 times more efficient than anaerobic metabolism (which yields 2?molecules ATP per 1?molecule glucose).  However some anaerobic organisms, such as methanogens are able to continue with anaerobic respiration, yielding more ATP by using other inorganic molecules (not oxygen) as final electron acceptors in the electron transport chain.  They share the initial pathway of glycolysis but aerobic metabolism continues with the Krebs cycle and oxidative phosphorylation. The post-glycolytic reactions take place in the mitochondria in eukaryotic cells, and in the cytoplasm in prokaryotic cells.\\r\\n\\r\\n1.

This pathway can function with or without the presence of oxygen. In humans, aerobic conditions produce pyruvate and anaerobic conditions produce lactate. In aerobic conditions, the process converts one molecule of glucose into two molecules of pyruvate (pyruvic acid), generating energy in the form of two net molecules of ATP. Four molecules of ATP per glucose are actually produced, however, two are consumed as part of the preparatory phase. The initial phosphorylation of glucose is required to increase the reactivity (decrease its stability) in order for the molecule to be cleaved into two pyruvate molecules by the enzyme aldolase. During the pay-off phase of glycolysis, four phosphate groups are transferred to ADP by substrate-level phosphorylation to make four ATP, and two NADH are produced when the pyruvate are oxidized. The overall reaction can be expressed this way:\\r\\n\\r\\nStarting with glucose,  1 ATP is used to donate a phosphate to glucose to produce glucose 6-phosphate. Glycogen can be converted into glucose 6-phosphate as well with the help of glycogen phosphorylase. During energy metabolism, glucose 6-phosphate becomes fructose 6-phosphate. An additional ATP is used to phosphorylate fructose 6-phosphate into fructose 1,6-disphosphate by the help of phosphofructokinase. Fructose 1,6-diphosphate then splits into two phosphorylated molecules with three carbon chains which later degrades into pyruvate.\\r\\n\\r\\nGlycolysis can be literally translated as \\"sugar splitting\\".[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nPyruvate is oxidized to acetyl-CoA and CO2 by the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC).  The PDC contains multiple copies of three enzymes and is located in the mitochondria of eukaryotic cells and in the cytosol of prokaryotes. In the conversion of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA, one molecule of NADH and one molecule of CO2 is formed.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is also called the Krebs cycle or the tricarboxylic acid cycle. When oxygen is present, acetyl-CoA is produced from the pyruvate molecules created from glycolysis. Once acetyl-CoA is formed, aerobic or anaerobic respiration can occur.[4] When oxygen is present, the mitochondria will undergo aerobic respiration which leads to the Krebs cycle.  However, if oxygen is not present, fermentation of the pyruvate molecule will occur.  In the presence of oxygen, when acetyl-CoA is produced, the molecule then enters the citric acid cycle (Krebs cycle) inside the mitochondrial matrix, and is oxidized to CO2 while at the same time reducing NAD to NADH. NADH can be used by the electron transport chain to create further ATP as part of oxidative phosphorylation. To fully oxidize the equivalent of one glucose molecule, two acetyl-CoA must be metabolized by the Krebs cycle. Two waste products, H2O and CO2, are created during this cycle.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe citric acid cycle is an 8-step process involving 18 different enzymes and co-enzymes.[4] During the cycle, acetyl-CoA (2 carbons) + oxaloacetate (4 carbons) yields citrate (6 carbons), which is rearranged to a more reactive form called isocitrate (6 carbons). Isocitrate is modified to become ϫ-ketoglutarate (5 carbons), succinyl-CoA, succinate, fumarate, malate, and, finally, oxaloacetate.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe net gain of high-energy compounds from one cycle is 3 NADH, 1 FADH2, and 1 GTP; the GTP may subsequently be used to produce ATP. Thus, the total yield from 1 glucose molecule (2 pyruvate molecules) is 6 NADH, 2 FADH2, and 2 ATP.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn eukaryotes, oxidative phosphorylation occurs in the mitochondrial cristae. It comprises the electron transport chain that establishes a proton gradient (chemiosmotic potential) across the boundary of inner membrane by oxidizing the NADH produced from the Krebs cycle. ATP is synthesized by the ATP synthase enzyme when the chemiosmotic gradient is used to drive the phosphorylation of ADP. The electrons are finally transferred to exogenous oxygen and, with the addition of two protons, water is formed.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe table below describes the reactions involved when one glucose molecule is fully oxidized into carbon dioxide. It is assumed that all the reduced coenzymes are oxidized by the electron transport chain and used for oxidative phosphorylation.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough there is a theoretical yield of 38 ATP molecules per glucose during cellular respiration, such conditions are generally not realized because of losses such as the cost of moving pyruvate (from glycolysis), phosphate, and ADP (substrates for ATP synthesis) into the mitochondria. All are actively transported using carriers that utilize the stored energy in the proton electrochemical gradient.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe outcome of these transport processes using the proton electrochemical gradient is that more than 3 H+ are needed to make 1 ATP. Obviously this reduces the theoretical efficiency of the whole process and the likely maximum is closer to 28ÿ30 ATP molecules.[2] In practice the efficiency may be even lower because the inner membrane of the mitochondria is slightly leaky to protons.[5] Other factors may also dissipate the proton gradient creating an apparently leaky mitochondria. An uncoupling protein known as thermogenin is expressed in some cell types and is a channel that can transport protons. When this protein is active in the inner membrane it short circuits the coupling between the electron transport chain and ATP synthesis. The potential energy from the proton gradient is not used to make ATP but generates heat. This is particularly important in brown fat thermogenesis of newborn and hibernating mammals.\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to some of newer sources the ATP yield during aerobic respiration is not 36ÿ38, but only about 30ÿ32 ATP molecules / 1 molecule of glucose [6], because:\\r\\n\\r\\nSo finally we have, per molecule of glucose\\r\\n\\r\\nAltogether this gives 4 + 3 (or 5) + 20 + 3 = 30 (or 32) ATP per molecule of glucose\\r\\n\\r\\nThe total ATP yield in ethanol or lactic acid fermentation is only 2 molecules coming from glycolysis, because pyruvate is not transferred to the mitochondrion and finally oxidized to the carbon dioxide (CO2), but reduced to ethanol or lactic acid in the cytoplasm.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nWithout oxygen, pyruvate (pyruvic acid) is not metabolized by cellular respiration but undergoes a process of fermentation. The pyruvate is not transported into the mitochondrion, but remains in the cytoplasm, where it is converted to waste products that may be removed from the cell. This serves the purpose of oxidizing the electron carriers so that they can perform glycolysis again and removing the excess pyruvate. Fermentation oxidizes NADH to NAD+ so it can be re-used in glycolysis.  In the absence of oxygen, fermentation prevents the buildup of NADH in the cytoplasm and provides NAD+ for glycolysis.  This waste product varies depending on the organism. In skeletal muscles, the waste product is lactic acid. This type of fermentation is called lactic acid fermentation. In strenuous exercise, when energy demands exceed energy supply, the respiratory chain cannot process all of the hydrogen atoms joined by NADH. During anaerobic glycolysis, NAD+ regenerates when pairs of hydrogen combine with pyruvate to form lactate. Lactate formation is catalyzed by lactate dehydrogenase in a reversible reaction. Lactate can also be used as an indirect precursor for liver glycogen. During recovery, when oxygen becomes available, NAD+ attaches to hydrogen from lactate to form ATP. In yeast, the waste products are ethanol and carbon dioxide. This type of fermentation is known as alcoholic or ethanol fermentation. The ATP generated in this process is made by substrate-level phosphorylation, which does not require oxygen.\\r\\n\\r\\nFermentation is less efficient at using the energy from glucose: only 2 ATP are produced per glucose, compared to the 38 ATP per glucose nominally produced by aerobic respiration. This is because the waste products of fermentation still contain chemical potential energy that can be released by oxidation. Ethanol, for example, can be burned in an internal combustion engine like gasoline. Glycolytic ATP, however, is created more quickly. For prokaryotes to continue a rapid growth rate when they are shifted from an aerobic environment to an anaerobic environment, they must increase the rate of the glycolytic reactions. For multicellular organisms, during short bursts of strenuous activity, muscle cells use fermentation to supplement the ATP production from the slower aerobic respiration, so fermentation may be used by a cell even before the oxygen levels are depleted, as is the case in sports that do not require athletes to pace themselves, such as sprinting.\\r\\n\\r\\nCellular respiration is the process by which biological fuels are oxidised in the presence of an inorganic electron acceptor (such as oxygen) to produce large amounts of energy, to drive the bulk production of ATP.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnaerobic respiration is used by some microorganisms in which neither oxygen (aerobic respiration) nor pyruvate derivatives (fermentation) is the final electron acceptor.  Rather, an inorganic acceptor such as sulfate or nitrate is used.\\r\\nSuch organisms are typically found in unusual places such as underwater caves or near hydrothermal vents at the bottom of the ocean.","input":"How many atp molecules are obtained from glycolysis?"},{"output":"Taichung","context":"In the structural hierarchy of the administrative divisions in Taiwan, there are three types of administrative divisions with City (, sh) in their names.\\r\\nThe 23 cities in Taiwan:\\r\\nKaohsiung, Taiwan's second largest city and its leading port.\\r\\nNew Taipei, Taiwan's largest city formerly Taipei County.\\r\\nTaichung, Taiwan's third largest city.\\r\\nTainan\\r\\nTaipei, Taiwan's capital and fourth largest city.\\r\\nTaoyuan\\r\\nChiayi\\r\\nHsinchu\\r\\nKeelung\\r\\nList of all cities and townships in Taiwan.\\r\\nTongyong Pinyin was the standard of Chinese romanization of Taiwan between 2002 and 2008.

In 1887, the Illinois General Assembly, partly in response to concerns arising out of an extreme weather event in 1885 that threatened the city's water supply,[3] decided to reverse the flow of the Chicago River through civil engineering by taking water from Lake Michigan and discharging it into the Mississippi River watershed. In 1889, the Illinois General Assembly created the Chicago Sanitary District (now The Metropolitan Water Reclamation District) to replace the Illinois and Michigan Canal, which had become inadequate to carry the city's increasing sewage and commercial navigation needs, with the Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal, a much larger waterway.[4] The District completed this man-made hydrologic connection between the Great Lakes and Mississippi watershed in 1900 [5] by reversing the flow of the Main Stem and South Branch of the river using a series of canal locks, and increasing the river's flow from Lake Michigan, causing it to empty into the new Canal. In 1999, this system was named a 'Civil Engineering Monument of the Millennium' by the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE).[6]\\r\\nThe river is memorialized, in part, by two horizontal blue stripes on the Municipal Flag of Chicago.[7] The river also serves as inspiration for one of Chicago's ubiquitous symbols: a three-branched, Y-shaped symbol (called the municipal device) is found on many buildings and other structures throughout Chicago; it represents the three branches of the Chicago River.[8][9][10]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen it followed its natural course, the North and South Branches of the Chicago River converged at Wolf Point to form the Main Stem, which jogged southward from the present course of the river to avoid a baymouth bar entering Lake Michigan at about the level of present-day Madison Street.[11] Today, the Main Stem of the Chicago River flows west from Lake Michigan to Wolf Point, where it converges with the North Branch to form the South Branch, which flows southwest and empties into the Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal.\\r\\nEarly settlers named the North Branch of the Chicago River the Guarie River, or Gary's River, after a trader who may have settled the west bank of the river a short distance north of Wolf Point, at what is now Fulton Street.[12][13] The source of the North Branch is in the northern suburbs of Chicago where its three principal tributaries converge. The Skokie Riveror East Forkrises from a flat area, historically a wetland, near Park City, Illinois to the west of the city of Waukegan.[14] It then flows southward, paralleling the edge of Lake Michigan, through wetlands, the Greenbelt Forest Preserve and a number of golf courses towards Highland Park, Illinois.[15] South of Highland Park the river passes the Chicago Botanic Gardens and through an area of former marshlands known as the Skokie Lagoons. The Middle Fork arises near Rondout, Illinois and flows southwards through Lake Forest and Highland Park. These two tributaries merge at Watersmeet Woods west of Wilmette. From there the North Branch flows south towards Morton Grove.[16] The West Fork rises near Mettawa and flows south through Bannockburn, Deerfield, and Northbrook, meeting the North Branch at Morton Grove.[17] In recognition of the work of Ralph Frese in promoting canoeing on and conservation of Chicago-area rivers, the forest preserve district of Cook County, Illinois has designated a section of the East Fork and North Branch from Willow Road in Northfield to Dempster Street in Morton Grove the Ralph Frese River Trail.[18][19]\\r\\nThe North Branch continues southwards through Niles, entering the city of Chicago near the intersection of Milwaukee Avenue and Devon Avenue,[20] from where it serves as the boundary of the Forest Glen community area with Norwood Park and Jefferson Park. This stretch of the river meanders in a south-easterly direction, passing through golf courses and forest preserves until it reaches Foster Avenue, where it passes through residential neighborhoods on the north side of the Albany Park community area.[21] In River Park the river meets the North Shore Channel, a drainage canal built between 1907 and 1910 to increase the flow of the North Branch and help flush pollution into the Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal.[3] From the confluence with the North Shore Channel south to Belmont Avenue the North Branch flows through mostly residential neighborhoods in a man-made channel that was dug to straighten and deepen the river, helping it to carry the additional flow from the North Shore Channel.[22]\\r\\nSouth of Belmont the North Branch is lined with a mixture of residential developments, retail parks, and industry until it reaches the industrial area known as the Clybourn Corridor.[23] Here it passes beneath the Cortland Street Drawbridge, which was the first 'Chicago-style' fixed-trunnion bascule bridge built in the United States,[24] and is designated as an ASCE Civil Engineering Landmark and a Chicago Landmark.\\r\\nAt North Avenue, south of the North Avenue Bridge, the North Branch divides, the original course of the river makes a curve along the west side of Goose Island, whilst the North Branch Canal cuts off the bend, forming the island. The North Branch Canalor Ogden's Canalwas completed in 1857, and was originally 50 feet (15?m) wide and 10 feet (3.0?m) deep allowing craft navigating the river to avoid the bend.[25] The 1902 Cherry Avenue Bridge, just south of North Avenue, was constructed to carry the Chicago, Milwaukee and St. Paul Railway onto Goose Island. It is a rare example of an asymmetric bob-tail swing bridge[26] and was designated a Chicago Landmark in 2007.[27] From Goose Island the North Branch continues to flow south east to Wolf Point where it joins the Main Stem.\\r\\nThe source of the Main Stem of the Chicago River is Lake Michigan. Water enters the river through sluice gates at the Chicago River Controlling Works with a small additional flow provided by the passage of boats between the river and Lake Michigan through the Chicago Harbor Lock.[28] The surface level of the river is maintained at 0.5 to 2 feet (0.15 to 0.61?m) below the Chicago City Datum (579.48 feet [176.63?m] above mean sea level) except for when there is excessive storm run-off into the river or when the level of the lake is more than 2 feet below the Chicago City Datum.[29] Acoustic velocity meters at the Columbus Drive Bridge and the T. J. O'Brien lock on the Calumet River monitor the diversion of water from Lake Michigan to the Mississippi River basin, which is limited to an average of 3,200 cubic feet (91?m3) per second per year over the 40-year period from 1980 to 2020.[30]\\r\\nThe Main Stem flows 1.5 miles (2.4?km) west from the controlling works at Lake Michigan;[31] passing beneath the Outer Drive, Columbus Drive, Michigan Avenue, Wabash Avenue, State Street, Dearborn Street, Clark Street, La Salle Street, Wells Street, and Franklin Street bridges en route to its confluence with the North Branch at Wolf Point. At McClurg Court it passes the Nicholas J Melas Centennial Fountain, which was built in 1989 to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the Metropolitan Water Reclamation District of Greater Chicago; between May and October the fountain sends an arc of water over the river for ten minutes every hour.[32] On the north bank of the river, near the Chicago Landmark Michigan Avenue Bridge, is Pioneer Court, which marks the site of the homestead of Jean Baptiste Point du Sable who is recognized as the founder of Chicago.[33] On the south bank of the river is the site of Fort Dearborn, an army fort, first established in 1803. Notable buildings surrounding this area include the NBC Tower, the Tribune Tower, and the Wrigley Building. The river turns slightly to the south west between Michigan Avenue and State Street, passing the Trump International Hotel and Tower, 35 East Wacker, and 330 North Wabash. Turning west again the river passes Marina City, the Reid, Murdoch & Co. Building, and Merchandise Mart, and 333 Wacker Drive.\\r\\nSince the early 2000s, the south shore of the Main Stem has been developed as the Chicago Riverwalk. It provides a linear, lushly landscaped park intended to offer a peaceful escape from the busy Loop and a tourist attraction. Different sections are named Market, Civic, Arcade, and Confluence. The sections between State Street and Lake Street are currently under construction and scheduled to be completed by the end of 2016. The plans reflect ideas first proposed by the Burnham Plan as early as 1909.\\r\\nThe source of the South Branch of the Chicago River is the confluence of the North Branch and Main stem at Wolf Point. From here the river flows south passing the Lake Street, Randolph Street, Washington Street, Madison Street, Monroe Street, Adams Street, Jackson Boulevard, Van Buren Street, Congress Parkway, and Harrison Street bridges before leaving the downtown Loop community area. Notable buildings that line this stretch of the river include the Boeing Company World Headquarters, the Civic Opera House, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, Union Station and Willis Tower.\\r\\nThe river continues southwards past railroad yards and the St. Charles Air Line Bridge. Between Polk and 18th Streets the river originally made a meander to the east; between 1927 and 1929 the river was straightened and moved 1?4 mile (0.40?km) west at this point to make room for a railroad terminal.[34] The river turns to the southwest at Ping Tom Memorial Park where it passes under the Chicago Landmark Canal Street railroad bridge. The river turns westward where it is crossed by the Dan Ryan Expressway; these immovable bridges have a clearance of 60 feet (18?m) requiring large ships that pass underneath to have folding masts.[35]\\r\\nAt Ashland Avenue the river widens to form the U.S. Turning Basin, the west bank of which was the starting point of the Illinois and Michigan Canal.[36] Prior to 1983, this was where the US Coast Guard Rules of the Road, Great Lakes ended & Rules of the Road, Western Rivers began. Since 1983, there is just a single Inland Navigational Rules passed by Congressional Act in 1980 (Public Law 96-591). At the basin the river is joined by a tributary, the South Fork of the river, which is commonly given the nickname Bubbly Creek. A bridge used to span the South Fork at this point that was too low for boats to pass meaning that their cargo needed to be unloaded at the bridge, and the neighborhood at its east end became known as Bridgeport.[37] The river continues to the south west, entering the Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal at Damen Avenue. The original West Fork of the South Branch, which before 1935[38] led towards Mud Lake and the Chicago Portage, has been filled in; a triangular intrusion into the north bank at Damen Avenue marks the place where it diverged from the course of the canal.[37] From there, the water flows down the canal through the southwest side of Chicago and southwestern suburbs and, in time, into the Des Plaines River between Crest Hill on the west and Lockport on the east, just north of the border between Crest Hill and Joliet, Illinois, eventually reaching the Gulf of Mexico.\\r\\nThe United States Geological Survey monitors water flow at a number of sites in the Chicago River system. Discharge from the North Branch is measured at Grand Avenue; between 2004 and 2010 this averaged 582 cubic feet (16.5?m3) per second.[39] During the winter months as much as 75% of the flow in the North Branch is due to the discharge of treated sewage from the North Side Water Reclamation Plant into the North Shore Channel.[40] Flow on the Main Stem is measured at Columbus Drive; between 2000 and 2006 this averaged 136 cubic feet (3.9?m3) per second.[41]\\r\\nThe name Chicago derives from 17th century French rendering of a Native American term for a type of wild leek, which grew abundantly near the river. The river, and its region, were named after this edible plant.[42]\\r\\nLouis Jolliet and Jacques Marquette, though probably not the first Europeans to visit the area, are the first recorded to have visited the Chicago River in 1673, when they wrote of their discovery of the geographically vital Chicago Portage.[43] Marquette returned in 1674, camped a few days near the mouth of the river, then moved on to the Chicago RiverÿDes Plaines River portage, where he stayed through the winter of 1674ÿ75. The Fox Wars effectively closed the Chicago area to Europeans in the first part of the 18th century. The first non-native to re-settle in the area may have been a trader named Guillory, who might have had a trading post near Wolf Point on the Chicago River in around 1778.[44] In 1823 a government expedition used the name Gary River (phonetic spelling of Guillory) to refer to the north branch of the Chicago River.\\r\\nJean Baptiste Point du Sable is widely regarded as the first permanent resident of Chicago; he built a farm on the northern bank at the mouth of the river in the 1780s.[45] The earliest known record of Pointe du Sable living in Chicago is the diary of Hugh Heward, who made a journey through Illinois in the spring of 1790. Antoine Ouilmette claimed to have arrived in Chicago shortly after this in July 1790.[46]\\r\\nIn 1795, in a then minor part of the Treaty of Greenville, an Indian confederation granted treaty rights to the United States, to a parcel of land at the mouth of the \\"Chicago River\\".[n 1][48] This was followed by the 1816 Treaty of St. Louis and Treaty of Chicago, which ceded additional land in the Chicago area.[49] In 1803, Fort Dearborn was constructed on the bank opposite what had been Point du Sable's settlement, on the site of the present-day Michigan Avenue Bridge.[50] Lieutenant James Strode Swearingen, who led the troops from Detroit to Chicago to establish the fort, described the river as being about 30 yards (27?m) wide and upwards of 18 feet (5.5?m) deep at the place where the fort was intended to be built; the riverbanks were 8 feet (2.4?m) high on the south side and 6 feet (1.8?m) on the north.[51]\\r\\nBetween 1816 and 1828 soldiers from Fort Dearborn cut channels through the sandbar at the mouth of the river to allow yawls to bring supplies to the fort.[52] These channels rapidly clogged with sand requiring a new one to be cut. On March 2, 1833 $25,000[n 2] was appropriated by Congress for harbor works, and work began in June of that year under the supervision of Major George Bender, the commandant at Fort Dearborn.[52][54] In January 1834 James Allen took over the supervision of this work[55] and, aided by a February storm that breached the sandbar, on July 12, 1834 the harbor works had progressed enough to allow a 100-short-ton (91?t) schooner, the Illinois to sail up the river to Wolf Point and dock at the wharf of Newberry & Dole.[52] The initial entrance through the sandbar was 200 feet (61?m) wide and 3 to 7 feet (0.91 to 2.13?m) deep, flanked by piers 200 feet (61?m) long on the south wall and 700 feet (210?m) long to the north. Allen's work continued, and by October 1837 the still unfinished piers had been extended to 1,850 and 1,200 feet (560 and 370?m) respectively.[56]\\r\\nIn 1848, the Illinois and Michigan canal linked the river to the Illinois River and the Mississippi Valley across the Chicago Portage. This canal was the farthest west, and the last, of a series of United States' government land grant canals. It provided the only water route from New York City to New Orleans through the county's interior and Chicago.[57]\\r\\nDuring the last ice age, the area that became Chicago was covered by Lake Chicago, which drained south into the Mississippi Valley. As the ice and water retreated, a short 12-to-14-foot (3.7 to 4.3?m) ridge was exposed about a mile inland, which generally separated the Great Lakes' watershed from the Mississippi Valley, except in times of heavy precipitation or when winter ice flows prevented drainage.[58] By the time Europeans arrived, the Chicago River flowed sluggishly into Lake Michigan from Chicago's flat plain. As Chicago grew, this allowed sewage and other pollution into the clean-water source for the city, contributing to several public health problems, like typhoid fever.[59] Starting in 1848, much of the Chicago River's flow was also diverted across the Chicago Portage into the Illinois and Michigan Canal.[60] In 1871, the old canal was deepened in an attempt to completely reverse the river's flow but the reversal of the river only lasted one season.[61]\\r\\nFinally, in 1900, the Sanitary District of Chicago, then headed by William Boldenweck, completely reversed the flow of the Main Stem and South Branch of the river using a series of canal locks, increasing the river's flow from Lake Michigan and causing it to empty into the newly completed Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal. In 1999, this system was named a \\"Civil Engineering Monument of the Millennium\\" by the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE).[6] Before this time, the Chicago River was known by many local residents of Chicago as \\"the stinking river\\" because of the massive amounts of sewage and pollution that poured into the river from Chicago's booming industrial economy.\\r\\nThrough the 1980s, the river was quite dirty and often filled with garbage; however, during the 1990s, it underwent extensive cleaning as part of an effort at beautification by Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley.\\r\\nIn 2005, researchers at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign created a three-dimensional, hydrodynamic simulation of the Chicago River, which suggested that density currents are the cause of an observed bi-directional wintertime flow in the river. At the surface, the river flows east to west, away from Lake Michigan, as expected. But deep below, near the riverbed, water seasonally travels west to east, toward the lake.[62]\\r\\nAll outflows from the Great Lakes Basin are regulated by the joint U.S.-Canadian Great Lakes Commission, and the outflow through the Chicago River is set under a U.S. Supreme Court decision (1967, modified 1980 and 1997). The city of Chicago is allowed to remove 3200 cubic feet per second (91 m3/s) of water from the Great Lakes system; about half of this, 1 billion US gallons a day (44 m3/s), is sent down the Chicago River, while the rest is used for drinking water.[63] In late 2005, the Chicago-based Alliance for the Great Lakes proposed re-separating the Great Lakes and Mississippi River basins to address such ecological concerns as the spread of invasive species.[64]\\r\\nIn 1915, the Eastland, an excursion boat docked at the Clark Street bridge, rolled over, killing 844 passengers.[65] Many of the passengers were trapped by moving objects such as pianos and tables. The site is now the location of a memorial dedicated in 1989. The marker was stolen in 2000 and replaced in 2003. There are plans to build an outdoor exhibit at the site as well.\\r\\nOn April 13, 1992, a flood occurred when a pile driven into the riverbed caused stress fractures in the wall of a long-abandoned tunnel of the Chicago Tunnel Company near the Kinzie Street railroad bridge. Most of the 60-mile (97?km) network of underground freight railway, which encompasses much of downtown, was eventually flooded, along with the lower levels of buildings it once serviced and attached underground shops and pedestrian ways.\\r\\nThe first bridge across the Chicago River was constructed over the North Branch near the present day Kinzie Street in 1832. A second bridge, over the South Branch near Randolph Street, was added in 1833.[66] The first moveable bridge was constructed across the main stem at Dearborn Street in 1834.[67] Today, the Chicago River has 38 movable bridges spanning it, down from a peak of 52 bridges.[68] These bridges are of several different types, including trunnion bascule, Scherzer rolling lift, swing bridges, and vertical lift bridges.\\r\\nThe Chicago River has been highly affected by industrial and residential development with attendant changes to the quality of the water and riverbanks. Several species of freshwater fish are known to inhabit the river, including largemouth and smallmouth bass, rock bass, crappie, bluegill, catfish, and carp. The river also has a large population of crayfish. The South Fork of the Main (South) Branch, which was the primary sewer for the Union Stock Yards and the meat packing industry, was once so polluted that it became known as Bubbly Creek.[69] Illinois has issued advisories regarding eating fish from the river due to PCB and mercury contamination, including a \\"do not eat\\" advisory for carp more than 12?inches long.[70] There are concerns that silver carp and bighead carp, now invasive species in the Mississippi and Illinois Rivers, may reach the Great Lakes through the Chicago River.[71] Despite the pollution concerns, the Chicago River remains a very popular target for freshwater recreational fishing. In 2006, the Chicago Park District started the annual \\"Mayor Daley's Chicago River Fishing Festival\\", which has increased in popularity with each year.\\r\\nNear the mouth of the Chicago River 1838\\r\\nNear the mouth of the Chicago River 1893\\r\\nNear the mouth of the Chicago River circa late 1800s\\r\\nMouth of the river in the early 20th century\\r\\nAs part of a more than fifty-year-old Chicago tradition, the Chicago River is dyed green in observance of St.?Patrick's Day.[72] The actual event does not necessarily occur on St. Patrick's Day and is scheduled for the Saturday before March 17, unless the 17th falls on a Saturday (when the event takes place on St. Patrick's Day).\\r\\nThe tradition of dyeing the river green arose by accident when plumbers used fluorescein dye to trace sources of illegal pollution discharges.[73] The dyeing of the river is still sponsored by the local plumbers union.[74]\\r\\nThe United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) outlawed the use of fluorescein for this purpose, since it was shown to be harmful to the river.[73] The parade committee has since switched to a mix involving forty pounds of powdered vegetable dye.[75] Though the committee closely guards the exact formula, they insist that it has been tested and verified safe for the environment.[76] Furthermore, since the environmental organization Friends of the Chicago River believes the dye is probably not harmful, they do not oppose the practice.[77]\\r\\nIn 2009 First Lady Michelle Obama, a Chicago native, requested that the White House fountains be dyed green to celebrate St.?Patrick's Day.[78]\\r\\nFor the Chicago Cubs rally and parade for their 2016 World Series Championship celebrations, the river was dyed Cubs blue.[79]\\r\\nThe US Army Corps of Engineers have monitored the development of harbors and channels for navigation on the Great Lakes since the early 1800s. They began monitoring hydrological conditions and lake levels in 1918. A December 26, 2012 report revealed that Chicago District navigation infrastructure did receive significant impacts from Hurricane Sandy with some areas experiencing severe shoaling. Chicago Shoreline Project mitigated the damage of the storm event.[5]\\r\\nThe same report noted that the low Great Lakes levels were drought-induced, caused by a very hot, dry summer and a lack of a solid snowpack in the winter of 2012. At the time of the report, December 2012, Lake Michigan-Huron was 28 inches below its long-term average which is near the record lows of 1964.[5] Historic lake levels for Lake Michigan reported from 1918 to 1998 show that the low levels observed in 1964 were the lowest since 1918.[4] In 2012 Lake Michigan-Hurons seasonal rise was about 4 inches where it usually is about 12 inches. Normally the Chicago River water level is two feet lower than the lake and therefore does not flow into the lake. If the lake level falls too low threatening to reverse the river flow, the Metropolitan Water Reclamation District of Greater Chicago would be forced to close locks between the lake and river for longer periods of time limiting navigation. A reversal flow of the Chicago River into Lake Michigan would have a negative impact on navigation and on the quality of Lake Michigan water which is the source of drinking water.[5] Chicago's raw sewage in the river is normally carried upstream toward the Mississippi River which flows south towards the Gulf of Mexico. On January 9, 2013 Chicago meteorologists announced 320 days without at least one inch of snowfall.

While not all leaders had formal military training, the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York and the United States Naval Academy at Annapolis created dedicated cadres of professional officers whose understanding of military science had profound effect on the conduct of the American Civil War and whose lasting legacy helped forge the traditions of the modern U.S. officer corps of all service branches.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPresident Abraham Lincoln was Commander-in-Chief of the Union armed forces throughout the conflict; after his April 14, 1865 assassination, Vice President Andrew Johnson became the nation's chief executive.[1] Lincoln's first Secretary of War was Simon Cameron; Edwin M. Stanton was confirmed to replace Cameron in January 1862. Thomas A. Scott was Assistant Secretary of War. Gideon Welles was Secretary of the Navy, aided by Assistant Secretary of the Navy Gustavus Fox.[2]\\r\\nWhen the war began, the American standing army or \\"Regular army\\" consisted of only 1080 commissioned officers and 15,000 enlisted men.[3] Although 142 regular officers became Union generals during the war, most remained \\"frozen\\" in their regular units. That stated, most of the major Union wartime commanders had significant previous regular army experience.[4] Over the course of the war, the Commanding General of the United States Army was, in order of service, Winfield Scott, George B. McClellan, Henry Halleck, and finally, Ulysses S. Grant.\\r\\n\\r\\nUnder the United States Constitution, each state recruited, trained, equipped, and maintained local militia; regimental officers were appointed and promoted by state governors. After states answered Lincoln's April 15, 1861, ninety-day call for 75,000 volunteer soldiers, most Union states' regiments and batteries became known as \\"Volunteers\\" to distinguish between state and regular army units. Union brigade-level officers (generals) could receive two different types of Federal commissions: U.S. Army or U.S. Volunteers (ex: Major General, U.S.A. as opposed to Major General, U.S.V.). While most Civil War generals held volunteer or brevet rank, many generals held both types of commission; regular rank was considered superior.[5]\\r\\nReflecting the multi-national makeup of the soldiers engaged, some Union military leaders derived from nations other than the United States.\\r\\nThe rapid rise of the United States Navy during the Civil War contributed enormously to the North's ability to effectively blockade ports and Confederate shipping from quite early in the conflict. Handicapped by an aging 90 ship fleet, and despite significant manpower losses to the Confederate Navy after secession, a massive ship construction campaign embracing technological innovations from civil engineer James Buchanan Eads and naval engineers like Benjamin F. Isherwood and John Ericsson, along with four years' daily experience with modern naval conflict put the U. S. Navy onto a path which has led to today's world naval dominance.[6]\\r\\nJefferson Davis was named provisional president on February 9, 1861, and assumed similar commander-in-chief responsibilities as would Lincoln; on November 6, 1861 Davis was elected President of the Confederate States of America under the Confederate Constitution. Alexander H. Stephens was appointed as Vice President of the Confederate States of America on February 18, 1861, and later assumed identical vice presidential responsibilities as Hannibal Hamlin did. Several men served the Confederacy as Secretary of War, including Leroy Pope Walker, Judah P. Benjamin, George W. Randolph, James Seddon, and John C. Breckinridge. Stephen Mallory was Confederate Secretary of the Navy throughout the conflict.[7]\\r\\nIn the wake of secession, many regular officers felt they could not betray loyalty to their home state, as a result some 313 of those officers resigned their commission and in many cases took up arms for the Confederate Army. Himself a graduate of West Point and a former regular officer, Confederate President Jefferson Davis highly prized these valuable recruits to the cause and saw that former regular officers were given positions of authority and responsibility.[8]\\r\\nThe land of Davy Crockett and Andrew Jackson, the state military tradition was especially strong in southern states, some of which were until recently frontier areas. Several significant Confederate military leaders emerged from state unit commands.\\r\\nWhile no foreign power sent troops or commanders directly to assist the Confederate States, some leaders derived from countries other than the United States.\\r\\nThe Confederate Navy possessed no extensive shipbuilding facilities; instead, it relied on refitting captured ships or purchased warships from Great Britain. The South had abundant navigable inland waterways, but after the Union built a vast fleet of gunboats, they soon dominated the Mississippi, Tennessee, Cumberland, Red and other rivers, rendering those waterways almost useless to the Confederacy. Confederates did seize several Union Navy vessels in harbor after secession and converted a few into ironclads, like the CSS Virginia. Blockade runners were built and operated by British naval interests, although by late in the war the C.S. Navy operated some. A few new vessels were built or purchased in Britain, notably the CSS Shenandoah and the CSS Alabama. These warships acted as raiders, wreaking havoc with commercial shipping. Aggrieved by these losses, in 1871 the U.S. government was awarded damages from Great Britain in the Alabama Claims.[6]","input":"Who was the famous leader of the confederate military?"},{"output":"William Shakespeare","context":"William Shakespeare (/??e?ksp??r/; 26 April 1564 (baptised)?ÿ 23 April 1616)[a] was an English poet, playwright and actor, widely regarded as the greatest writer in the English language and the world's pre-eminent dramatist.[2][3][4] He is often called England's national poet and the \\"Bard of Avon\\".[5][b] His extant works, including collaborations, consist of approximately 39 plays,[c] 154 sonnets, two long narrative poems and a few other verses, some of uncertain authorship. His plays have been translated into every major living language and are performed more often than those of any other playwright.[7]\\r\\nShakespeare was born and brought up in Stratford-upon-Avon, Warwickshire. At the age of 18, he married Anne Hathaway, with whom he had three children: Susanna and twins Hamnet and Judith. Some time between 1585 and 1592, he began a successful career in London as an actor, writer, and part-owner of a playing company called the Lord Chamberlain's Men, later known as the King's Men. At age 49 around 1613, he appears to have retired to Stratford, where he died three years later. Few records of Shakespeare's private life survive, which has stimulated considerable speculation about such matters as his physical appearance, sexuality, religious beliefs and whether the works attributed to him were written by others.[8][9][10] These speculations are often criticized for failing to point out the fact that few records survive of most commoners of his period.\\r\\nShakespeare produced most of his known work between 1589 and 1613.[11][12][d] His early plays were primarily comedies and histories, which are regarded as some of the best work ever produced in these genres. He then wrote mainly tragedies until about 1608, including Hamlet, Othello, King Lear and Macbeth, considered some of the finest works in the English language.[2][3][4] In his last phase, he wrote tragicomedies, also known as romances and collaborated with other playwrights.\\r\\nMany of his plays were published in editions of varying quality and accuracy during his lifetime. However, in 1623 John Heminges and Henry Condell, two friends and fellow actors of Shakespeare, published a more definitive text known as the First Folio, a posthumous collected edition of his dramatic works that included all but two of the plays now recognised as Shakespeare's.[13] It was prefaced with a poem by Ben Jonson, in which Shakespeare is hailed, presciently, as \\"not of an age, but for all time\\".[13]\\r\\nIn the 20th and 21st centuries, his works have been repeatedly adapted and rediscovered by new movements in scholarship and performance. His plays remain highly popular and are constantly studied, performed, and reinterpreted in diverse cultural and political contexts throughout the world.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWilliam Shakespeare was the son of John Shakespeare, an alderman and a successful glover originally from Snitterfield, and Mary Arden, the daughter of an affluent landowning farmer.[14] He was born in Stratford-upon-Avon and baptised there on 26 April 1564. His actual date of birth remains unknown, but is traditionally observed on 23 April, Saint George's Day.[15] This date, which can be traced back to an 18th-century scholar's mistake, has proved appealing to biographers because Shakespeare died on 23 April 1616.[16][17] He was the third child of eight and the eldest surviving son.[18]\\r\\nAlthough no attendance records for the period survive, most biographers agree that Shakespeare was probably educated at the King's New School in Stratford,[19][20][21] a free school chartered in 1553,[22] about a quarter-mile (400?m) from his home. Grammar schools varied in quality during the Elizabethan era, but grammar school curricula were largely similar: the basic Latin text was standardised by royal decree,[23][24] and the school would have provided an intensive education in grammar based upon Latin classical authors.[25]\\r\\nAt the age of 18, Shakespeare married 26-year-old Anne Hathaway. The consistory court of the Diocese of Worcester issued a marriage licence on 27 November 1582. The next day, two of Hathaway's neighbours posted bonds guaranteeing that no lawful claims impeded the marriage.[26] The ceremony may have been arranged in some haste since the Worcester chancellor allowed the marriage banns to be read once instead of the usual three times,[27][28] and six months after the marriage Anne gave birth to a daughter, Susanna, baptised 26 May 1583.[29] Twins, son Hamnet and daughter Judith, followed almost two years later and were baptised 2 February 1585.[30] Hamnet died of unknown causes at the age of 11 and was buried 11 August 1596.[31]\\r\\nAfter the birth of the twins, Shakespeare left few historical traces until he is mentioned as part of the London theatre scene in 1592. The exception is the appearance of his name in the \\"complaints bill\\" of a law case before the Queen's Bench court at Westminster dated Michaelmas Term 1588 and 9 October 1589.[32] Scholars refer to the years between 1585 and 1592 as Shakespeare's \\"lost years\\".[33] Biographers attempting to account for this period have reported many apocryphal stories. Nicholas Rowe, Shakespeare's first biographer, recounted a Stratford legend that Shakespeare fled the town for London to escape prosecution for deer poaching in the estate of local squire Thomas Lucy. Shakespeare is also supposed to have taken his revenge on Lucy by writing a scurrilous ballad about him.[34][35] Another 18th-century story has Shakespeare starting his theatrical career minding the horses of theatre patrons in London.[36] John Aubrey reported that Shakespeare had been a country schoolmaster.[37] Some 20th-century scholars have suggested that Shakespeare may have been employed as a schoolmaster by Alexander Hoghton of Lancashire, a Catholic landowner who named a certain \\"William Shakeshafte\\" in his will.[38][39] Little evidence substantiates such stories other than hearsay collected after his death, and Shakeshafte was a common name in the Lancashire area.[40][41]\\r\\nIt is not known definitively when Shakespeare began writing, but contemporary allusions and records of performances show that several of his plays were on the London stage by 1592.[42] By then, he was sufficiently known in London to be attacked in print by the playwright Robert Greene in his Groats-Worth of Wit:\\r\\n...?there is an upstart Crow, beautified with our feathers, that with his Tiger's heart wrapped in a Player's hide, supposes he is as well able to bombast out a blank verse as the best of you: and being an absolute Johannes factotum, is in his own conceit the only Shake-scene in a country.[43]\\r\\nScholars differ on the exact meaning of Greene's words,[43][44] but most agree that Greene was accusing Shakespeare of reaching above his rank in trying to match such university-educated writers as Christopher Marlowe, Thomas Nashe, and Greene himself (the so-called \\"university wits\\").[45] The italicised phrase parodying the line \\"Oh, tiger's heart wrapped in a woman's hide\\" from Shakespeare's Henry VI, Part 3, along with the pun \\"Shake-scene\\", clearly identify Shakespeare as Greene's target. As used here, Johannes Factotum (\\"Jack of all trades\\") refers to a second-rate tinkerer with the work of others, rather than the more common \\"universal genius\\".[43][46]\\r\\nGreene's attack is the earliest surviving mention of Shakespeare's work in the theatre. Biographers suggest that his career may have begun any time from the mid-1580s to just before Greene's remarks.[47][48][49] After 1594, Shakespeare's plays were performed only by the Lord Chamberlain's Men, a company owned by a group of players, including Shakespeare, that soon became the leading playing company in London.[50] After the death of Queen Elizabeth in 1603, the company was awarded a royal patent by the new King James I, and changed its name to the King's Men.[51]\\r\\n\\"All the world's a stage,\\r\\nand all the men and women merely players:\\r\\nthey have their exits and their entrances;\\r\\nand one man in his time plays many parts?...\\"\\r\\nIn 1599, a partnership of members of the company built their own theatre on the south bank of the River Thames, which they named the Globe. In 1608, the partnership also took over the Blackfriars indoor theatre. Extant records of Shakespeare's property purchases and investments indicate that his association with the company made him a wealthy man,[53] and in 1597, he bought the second-largest house in Stratford, New Place, and in 1605, invested in a share of the parish tithes in Stratford.[54]\\r\\nSome of Shakespeare's plays were published in quarto editions, beginning in 1594, and by 1598, his name had become a selling point and began to appear on the title pages.[55][56][57] Shakespeare continued to act in his own and other plays after his success as a playwright. The 1616 edition of Ben Jonson's Works names him on the cast lists for Every Man in His Humour (1598) and Sejanus His Fall (1603).[58] The absence of his name from the 1605 cast list for Jonson's Volpone is taken by some scholars as a sign that his acting career was nearing its end.[47] The First Folio of 1623, however, lists Shakespeare as one of \\"the Principal Actors in all these Plays\\", some of which were first staged after Volpone, although we cannot know for certain which roles he played.[59] In 1610, John Davies of Hereford wrote that \\"good Will\\" played \\"kingly\\" roles.[60] In 1709, Rowe passed down a tradition that Shakespeare played the ghost of Hamlet's father.[35] Later traditions maintain that he also played Adam in As You Like It, and the Chorus in Henry V,[61][62] though scholars doubt the sources of that information.[63]\\r\\nThroughout his career, Shakespeare divided his time between London and Stratford. In 1596, the year before he bought New Place as his family home in Stratford, Shakespeare was living in the parish of St. Helen's, Bishopsgate, north of the River Thames.[64][65] He moved across the river to Southwark by 1599, the same year his company constructed the Globe Theatre there.[64][66] By 1604, he had moved north of the river again, to an area north of St Paul's Cathedral with many fine houses. There, he rented rooms from a French Huguenot named Christopher Mountjoy, a maker of ladies' wigs and other headgear.[67][68]\\r\\nRowe was the first biographer to record the tradition, repeated by Johnson, that Shakespeare retired to Stratford \\"some years before his death\\".[69][70] He was still working as an actor in London in 1608; in an answer to the sharers' petition in 1635, Cuthbert Burbage stated that after purchasing the lease of the Blackfriars Theatre in 1608 from Henry Evans, the King's Men \\"placed men players\\" there, \\"which were Heminges, Condell, Shakespeare, etc.\\".[71] However, it is perhaps relevant that the bubonic plague raged in London throughout 1609.[72][73] The London public playhouses were repeatedly closed during extended outbreaks of the plague (a total of over 60 months closure between May 1603 and February 1610),[74] which meant there was often no acting work. Retirement from all work was uncommon at that time.[75] Shakespeare continued to visit London during the years 1611ÿ1614.[69] In 1612, he was called as a witness in Bellott v. Mountjoy, a court case concerning the marriage settlement of Mountjoy's daughter, Mary.[76][77] In March 1613, he bought a gatehouse in the former Blackfriars priory;[78] and from November 1614, he was in London for several weeks with his son-in-law, John Hall.[79] After 1610, Shakespeare wrote fewer plays, and none are attributed to him after 1613.[80] His last three plays were collaborations, probably with John Fletcher,[81] who succeeded him as the house playwright of the King's Men.[82]\\r\\nShakespeare died on 23 April 1616, at the age of 52.[f] He died within a month of signing his will, a document which he begins by describing himself as being in \\"perfect health\\". No extant contemporary source explains how or why he died. Half a century later, John Ward, the vicar of Stratford, wrote in his notebook: \\"Shakespeare, Drayton, and Ben Jonson had a merry meeting and, it seems, drank too hard, for Shakespeare died of a fever there contracted\\",[83][84] not an impossible scenario since Shakespeare knew Jonson and Drayton. Of the tributes from fellow authors, one refers to his relatively sudden death: \\"We wondered, Shakespeare, that thou went'st so soon / From the world's stage to the grave's tiring room.\\"[85][g]\\r\\nHe was survived by his wife and two daughters. Susanna had married a physician, John Hall, in 1607,[86] and Judith had married Thomas Quiney, a vintner, two months before Shakespeare's death.[87] Shakespeare signed his last will and testament on 25 March 1616; the following day, his new son-in-law, Thomas Quiney was found guilty of fathering an illegitimate son by Margaret Wheeler, who had died during childbirth. Thomas was ordered by the church court to do public penance, which would have caused much shame and embarrassment for the Shakespeare family.[87]\\r\\nShakespeare bequeathed the bulk of his large estate to his elder daughter Susanna[88] under stipulations that she pass it down intact to \\"the first son of her body\\".[89] The Quineys had three children, all of whom died without marrying.[90][91] The Halls had one child, Elizabeth, who married twice but died without children in 1670, ending Shakespeare's direct line.[92][93] Shakespeare's will scarcely mentions his wife, Anne, who was probably entitled to one-third of his estate automatically.[h] He did make a point, however, of leaving her \\"my second best bed\\", a bequest that has led to much speculation.[95][96][97] Some scholars see the bequest as an insult to Anne, whereas others believe that the second-best bed would have been the matrimonial bed and therefore rich in significance.[98]\\r\\nShakespeare was buried in the chancel of the Holy Trinity Church two days after his death.[99][100] The epitaph carved into the stone slab covering his grave includes a curse against moving his bones, which was carefully avoided during restoration of the church in 2008:[101]\\r\\nGood frend for Iesvs sake forbeare,\\r\\nTo digg the dvst encloased heare.\\r\\nBleste be  man  spares thes stones,\\r\\nAnd cvrst be he  moves my bones.[102][i]\\r\\n(Modern spelling: Good friend, for Jesus' sake forbear, / To dig the dust enclosed here. / Blessed be the man that spares these stones, / And cursed be he that moves my bones.)\\r\\nSome time before 1623, a funerary monument was erected in his memory on the north wall, with a half-effigy of him in the act of writing. Its plaque compares him to Nestor, Socrates, and Virgil.[103] In 1623, in conjunction with the publication of the First Folio, the Droeshout engraving was published.[104]\\r\\nShakespeare has been commemorated in many statues and memorials around the world, including funeral monuments in Southwark Cathedral and Poets' Corner in Westminster Abbey.[105][106]\\r\\nMost playwrights of the period typically collaborated with others at some point, and critics agree that Shakespeare did the same, mostly early and late in his career.[107] Some attributions, such as Titus Andronicus and the early history plays, remain controversial while The Two Noble Kinsmen and the lost Cardenio have well-attested contemporary documentation. Textual evidence also supports the view that several of the plays were revised by other writers after their original composition.\\r\\nThe first recorded works of Shakespeare are Richard III and the three parts of Henry VI, written in the early 1590s during a vogue for historical drama. Shakespeare's plays are difficult to date precisely, however,[108][109] and studies of the texts suggest that Titus Andronicus, The Comedy of Errors, The Taming of the Shrew, and The Two Gentlemen of Verona may also belong to Shakespeare's earliest period.[110][108] His first histories, which draw heavily on the 1587 edition of Raphael Holinshed's Chronicles of England, Scotland, and Ireland,[111] dramatise the destructive results of weak or corrupt rule and have been interpreted as a justification for the origins of the Tudor dynasty.[112] The early plays were influenced by the works of other Elizabethan dramatists, especially Thomas Kyd and Christopher Marlowe, by the traditions of medieval drama, and by the plays of Seneca.[113][114][115] The Comedy of Errors was also based on classical models, but no source for The Taming of the Shrew has been found, though it is related to a separate play of the same name and may have derived from a folk story.[116][117] Like The Two Gentlemen of Verona, in which two friends appear to approve of rape,[118][119][120] the Shrew's story of the taming of a woman's independent spirit by a man sometimes troubles modern critics, directors, and audiences.[121]\\r\\nShakespeare's early classical and Italianate comedies, containing tight double plots and precise comic sequences, give way in the mid-1590s to the romantic atmosphere of his most acclaimed comedies.[122] A Midsummer Night's Dream is a witty mixture of romance, fairy magic, and comic lowlife scenes.[123] Shakespeare's next comedy, the equally romantic Merchant of Venice, contains a portrayal of the vengeful Jewish moneylender Shylock, which reflects Elizabethan views but may appear derogatory to modern audiences.[124][125] The wit and wordplay of Much Ado About Nothing,[126] the charming rural setting of As You Like It, and the lively merrymaking of Twelfth Night complete Shakespeare's sequence of great comedies.[127] After the lyrical Richard II, written almost entirely in verse, Shakespeare introduced prose comedy into the histories of the late 1590s, Henry IV, parts 1 and 2, and Henry V. His characters become more complex and tender as he switches deftly between comic and serious scenes, prose and poetry, and achieves the narrative variety of his mature work.[128][129][130] This period begins and ends with two tragedies: Romeo and Juliet, the famous romantic tragedy of sexually charged adolescence, love, and death;[131][132] and Julius Caesarbased on Sir Thomas North's 1579 translation of Plutarch's Parallel Liveswhich introduced a new kind of drama.[133][134] According to Shakespearean scholar James Shapiro, in Julius Caesar, \\"the various strands of politics, character, inwardness, contemporary events, even Shakespeare's own reflections on the act of writing, began to infuse each other\\".[135]\\r\\nIn the early 17th century, Shakespeare wrote the so-called \\"problem plays\\" Measure for Measure, Troilus and Cressida, and All's Well That Ends Well and a number of his best known tragedies.[136][137] Many critics believe that Shakespeare's greatest tragedies represent the peak of his art. The titular hero of one of Shakespeare's greatest tragedies, Hamlet, has probably been discussed more than any other Shakespearean character, especially for his famous soliloquy which begins \\"To be or not to be; that is the question\\".[138] Unlike the introverted Hamlet, whose fatal flaw is hesitation, the heroes of the tragedies that followed, Othello and King Lear, are undone by hasty errors of judgement.[139] The plots of Shakespeare's tragedies often hinge on such fatal errors or flaws, which overturn order and destroy the hero and those he loves.[140] In Othello, the villain Iago stokes Othello's sexual jealousy to the point where he murders the innocent wife who loves him.[141][142] In King Lear, the old king commits the tragic error of giving up his powers, initiating the events which lead to the torture and blinding of the Earl of Gloucester and the murder of Lear's youngest daughter Cordelia. According to the critic Frank Kermode, \\"the play offers neither its good characters nor its audience any relief from its cruelty\\".[143][144][145] In Macbeth, the shortest and most compressed of Shakespeare's tragedies,[146] uncontrollable ambition incites Macbeth and his wife, Lady Macbeth, to murder the rightful king and usurp the throne until their own guilt destroys them in turn.[147] In this play, Shakespeare adds a supernatural element to the tragic structure. His last major tragedies, Antony and Cleopatra and Coriolanus, contain some of Shakespeare's finest poetry and were considered his most successful tragedies by the poet and critic T. S. Eliot.[148][149][150]\\r\\nIn his final period, Shakespeare turned to romance or tragicomedy and completed three more major plays: Cymbeline, The Winter's Tale, and The Tempest, as well as the collaboration, Pericles, Prince of Tyre. Less bleak than the tragedies, these four plays are graver in tone than the comedies of the 1590s, but they end with reconciliation and the forgiveness of potentially tragic errors.[151] Some commentators have seen this change in mood as evidence of a more serene view of life on Shakespeare's part, but it may merely reflect the theatrical fashion of the day.[152][153][154] Shakespeare collaborated on two further surviving plays, Henry VIII and The Two Noble Kinsmen, probably with John Fletcher.[155]\\r\\nIt is not clear for which companies Shakespeare wrote his early plays. The title page of the 1594 edition of Titus Andronicus reveals that the play had been acted by three different troupes.[156] After the plagues of 1592ÿ3, Shakespeare's plays were performed by his own company at The Theatre and the Curtain in Shoreditch, north of the Thames.[157] Londoners flocked there to see the first part of Henry IV, Leonard Digges recording, \\"Let but Falstaff come, Hal, Poins, the rest?... and you scarce shall have a room\\".[158] When the company found themselves in dispute with their landlord, they pulled The Theatre down and used the timbers to construct the Globe Theatre, the first playhouse built by actors for actors, on the south bank of the Thames at Southwark.[159][160] The Globe opened in autumn 1599, with Julius Caesar one of the first plays staged. Most of Shakespeare's greatest post-1599 plays were written for the Globe, including Hamlet, Othello, and King Lear.[159][161][162]\\r\\nAfter the Lord Chamberlain's Men were renamed the King's Men in 1603, they entered a special relationship with the new King James. Although the performance records are patchy, the King's Men performed seven of Shakespeare's plays at court between 1 November 1604, and 31 October 1605, including two performances of The Merchant of Venice.[62] After 1608, they performed at the indoor Blackfriars Theatre during the winter and the Globe during the summer.[163] The indoor setting, combined with the Jacobean fashion for lavishly staged masques, allowed Shakespeare to introduce more elaborate stage devices. In Cymbeline, for example, Jupiter descends \\"in thunder and lightning, sitting upon an eagle: he throws a thunderbolt. The ghosts fall on their knees.\\"[164][165]\\r\\nThe actors in Shakespeare's company included the famous Richard Burbage, William Kempe, Henry Condell and John Heminges. Burbage played the leading role in the first performances of many of Shakespeare's plays, including Richard III, Hamlet, Othello, and King Lear.[166] The popular comic actor Will Kempe played the servant Peter in Romeo and Juliet and Dogberry in Much Ado About Nothing, among other characters.[167][168] He was replaced around 1600 by Robert Armin, who played roles such as Touchstone in As You Like It and the fool in King Lear.[169] In 1613, Sir Henry Wotton recorded that Henry VIII \\"was set forth with many extraordinary circumstances of pomp and ceremony\\".[170] On 29 June, however, a cannon set fire to the thatch of the Globe and burned the theatre to the ground, an event which pinpoints the date of a Shakespeare play with rare precision.[170]\\r\\nIn 1623, John Heminges and Henry Condell, two of Shakespeare's friends from the King's Men, published the First Folio, a collected edition of Shakespeare's plays. It contained 36 texts, including 18 printed for the first time.[171] Many of the plays had already appeared in quarto versionsflimsy books made from sheets of paper folded twice to make four leaves.[172] No evidence suggests that Shakespeare approved these editions, which the First Folio describes as \\"stol'n and surreptitious copies\\".[173] Nor did Shakespeare plan or expect his works to survive in any form at all; those works likely would have faded into oblivion but for his friends' spontaneous idea, after his death, to create and publish the First Folio.[174]\\r\\nAlfred Pollard termed some of the pre-1623 versions as \\"bad quartos\\" because of their adapted, paraphrased or garbled texts, which may in places have been reconstructed from memory.[172][173][175] Where several versions of a play survive, each differs from the other. The differences may stem from copying or printing errors, from notes by actors or audience members, or from Shakespeare's own papers.[176][177] In some cases, for example, Hamlet, Troilus and Cressida, and Othello, Shakespeare could have revised the texts between the quarto and folio editions. In the case of King Lear, however, while most modern editions do conflate them, the 1623 folio version is so different from the 1608 quarto that the Oxford Shakespeare prints them both, arguing that they cannot be conflated without confusion.[178]\\r\\nIn 1593 and 1594, when the theatres were closed because of plague, Shakespeare published two narrative poems on sexual themes, Venus and Adonis and The Rape of Lucrece. He dedicated them to Henry Wriothesley, Earl of Southampton. In Venus and Adonis, an innocent Adonis rejects the sexual advances of Venus; while in The Rape of Lucrece, the virtuous wife Lucrece is raped by the lustful Tarquin.[179] Influenced by Ovid's Metamorphoses,[180] the poems show the guilt and moral confusion that result from uncontrolled lust.[181] Both proved popular and were often reprinted during Shakespeare's lifetime. A third narrative poem, A Lover's Complaint, in which a young woman laments her seduction by a persuasive suitor, was printed in the first edition of the Sonnets in 1609. Most scholars now accept that Shakespeare wrote A Lover's Complaint. Critics consider that its fine qualities are marred by leaden effects.[182][183][184] The Phoenix and the Turtle, printed in Robert Chester's 1601 Love's Martyr, mourns the deaths of the legendary phoenix and his lover, the faithful turtle dove. In 1599, two early drafts of sonnets 138 and 144 appeared in The Passionate Pilgrim, published under Shakespeare's name but without his permission.[182][184][185]\\r\\nPublished in 1609, the Sonnets were the last of Shakespeare's non-dramatic works to be printed. Scholars are not certain when each of the 154 sonnets was composed, but evidence suggests that Shakespeare wrote sonnets throughout his career for a private readership.[186][187] Even before the two unauthorised sonnets appeared in The Passionate Pilgrim in 1599, Francis Meres had referred in 1598 to Shakespeare's \\"sugred Sonnets among his private friends\\".[188] Few analysts believe that the published collection follows Shakespeare's intended sequence.[189] He seems to have planned two contrasting series: one about uncontrollable lust for a married woman of dark complexion (the \\"dark lady\\"), and one about conflicted love for a fair young man (the \\"fair youth\\"). It remains unclear if these figures represent real individuals, or if the authorial \\"I\\" who addresses them represents Shakespeare himself, though Wordsworth believed that with the sonnets \\"Shakespeare unlocked his heart\\".[188][187]\\r\\n\\"Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?\\r\\nThou art more lovely and more temperate?...\\"\\r\\nThe 1609 edition was dedicated to a \\"Mr. W.H.\\", credited as \\"the only begetter\\" of the poems. It is not known whether this was written by Shakespeare himself or by the publisher, Thomas Thorpe, whose initials appear at the foot of the dedication page; nor is it known who Mr. W.H. was, despite numerous theories, or whether Shakespeare even authorised the publication.[191] Critics praise the Sonnets as a profound meditation on the nature of love, sexual passion, procreation, death, and time.[192]\\r\\nShakespeare's first plays were written in the conventional style of the day. He wrote them in a stylised language that does not always spring naturally from the needs of the characters or the drama.[193] The poetry depends on extended, sometimes elaborate metaphors and conceits, and the language is often rhetoricalwritten for actors to declaim rather than speak. The grand speeches in Titus Andronicus, in the view of some critics, often hold up the action, for example; and the verse in The Two Gentlemen of Verona has been described as stilted.[194][195]\\r\\n\\"And pity, like a naked new-born babe,\\r\\nStriding the blast, or heaven's cherubim, hors'd\\r\\nUpon the sightless couriers of the air.\\"[196]\\r\\nHowever, Shakespeare soon began to adapt the traditional styles to his own purposes. The opening soliloquy of Richard III has its roots in the self-declaration of Vice in medieval drama. At the same time, Richard's vivid self-awareness looks forward to the soliloquies of Shakespeare's mature plays.[197][198] No single play marks a change from the traditional to the freer style. Shakespeare combined the two throughout his career, with Romeo and Juliet perhaps the best example of the mixing of the styles.[199] By the time of Romeo and Juliet, Richard II, and A Midsummer Night's Dream in the mid-1590s, Shakespeare had begun to write a more natural poetry. He increasingly tuned his metaphors and images to the needs of the drama itself.\\r\\nShakespeare's standard poetic form was blank verse, composed in iambic pentameter. In practice, this meant that his verse was usually unrhymed and consisted of ten syllables to a line, spoken with a stress on every second syllable. The blank verse of his early plays is quite different from that of his later ones. It is often beautiful, but its sentences tend to start, pause, and finish at the end of lines, with the risk of monotony.[200] Once Shakespeare mastered traditional blank verse, he began to interrupt and vary its flow. This technique releases the new power and flexibility of the poetry in plays such as Julius Caesar and Hamlet. Shakespeare uses it, for example, to convey the turmoil in Hamlet's mind:[201]\\r\\nSir, in my heart there was a kind of fighting\\r\\nThat would not let me sleep. Methought I lay\\r\\nWorse than the mutines in the bilboes. Rashly\\r\\nAnd prais'd be rashness for itlet us know\\r\\nOur indiscretion sometimes serves us well?...\\r\\nAfter Hamlet, Shakespeare varied his poetic style further, particularly in the more emotional passages of the late tragedies. The literary critic A. C. Bradley described this style as \\"more concentrated, rapid, varied, and, in construction, less regular, not seldom twisted or elliptical\\".[202] In the last phase of his career, Shakespeare adopted many techniques to achieve these effects. These included run-on lines, irregular pauses and stops, and extreme variations in sentence structure and length.[203] In Macbeth, for example, the language darts from one unrelated metaphor or simile to another: \\"was the hope drunk/ Wherein you dressed yourself?\\" (1.7.35ÿ38); \\"...?pity, like a naked new-born babe/ Striding the blast, or heaven's cherubim, hors'd/ Upon the sightless couriers of the air?...\\" (1.7.21ÿ25). The listener is challenged to complete the sense.[203] The late romances, with their shifts in time and surprising turns of plot, inspired a last poetic style in which long and short sentences are set against one another, clauses are piled up, subject and object are reversed, and words are omitted, creating an effect of spontaneity.[204]\\r\\nShakespeare combined poetic genius with a practical sense of the theatre.[205] Like all playwrights of the time, he dramatised stories from sources such as Plutarch and Holinshed.[206] He reshaped each plot to create several centres of interest and to show as many sides of a narrative to the audience as possible. This strength of design ensures that a Shakespeare play can survive translation, cutting and wide interpretation without loss to its core drama.[207] As Shakespeare's mastery grew, he gave his characters clearer and more varied motivations and distinctive patterns of speech. He preserved aspects of his earlier style in the later plays, however. In Shakespeare's late romances, he deliberately returned to a more artificial style, which emphasised the illusion of theatre.[208][209]\\r\\nShakespeare's work has made a lasting impression on later theatre and literature. In particular, he expanded the dramatic potential of characterisation, plot, language, and genre.[210] Until Romeo and Juliet, for example, romance had not been viewed as a worthy topic for tragedy.[211] Soliloquies had been used mainly to convey information about characters or events, but Shakespeare used them to explore characters' minds.[212] His work heavily influenced later poetry. The Romantic poets attempted to revive Shakespearean verse drama, though with little success. Critic George Steiner described all English verse dramas from Coleridge to Tennyson as \\"feeble variations on Shakespearean themes.\\"[213]\\r\\nShakespeare influenced novelists such as Thomas Hardy, William Faulkner, and Charles Dickens. The American novelist Herman Melville's soliloquies owe much to Shakespeare; his Captain Ahab in Moby-Dick is a classic tragic hero, inspired by King Lear.[214] Scholars have identified 20,000 pieces of music linked to Shakespeare's works. These include two operas by Giuseppe Verdi, Otello and Falstaff, whose critical standing compares with that of the source plays.[215] Shakespeare has also inspired many painters, including the Romantics and the Pre-Raphaelites. The Swiss Romantic artist Henry Fuseli, a friend of William Blake, even translated Macbeth into German.[216] The psychoanalyst Sigmund Freud drew on Shakespearean psychology, in particular, that of Hamlet, for his theories of human nature.[217]\\r\\nIn Shakespeare's day, English grammar, spelling, and pronunciation were less standardised than they are now,[218] and his use of language helped shape modern English.[219] Samuel Johnson quoted him more often than any other author in his A Dictionary of the English Language, the first serious work of its type.[220] Expressions such as \\"with bated breath\\" (Merchant of Venice) and \\"a foregone conclusion\\" (Othello) have found their way into everyday English speech.[221][222]\\r\\nShakespeare was not revered in his lifetime, but he received a large amount of praise.[224][225] In 1598, the cleric and author Francis Meres singled him out from a group of English writers as \\"the most excellent\\" in both comedy and tragedy.[226][227] The authors of the Parnassus plays at St John's College, Cambridge numbered him with Chaucer, Gower, and Spenser.[228] In the First Folio, Ben Jonson called Shakespeare the \\"Soul of the age, the applause, delight, the wonder of our stage\\", though he had remarked elsewhere that \\"Shakespeare wanted art\\".[223]\\r\\nBetween the Restoration of the monarchy in 1660 and the end of the 17th century, classical ideas were in vogue. As a result, critics of the time mostly rated Shakespeare below John Fletcher and Ben Jonson.[229] Thomas Rymer, for example, condemned Shakespeare for mixing the comic with the tragic. Nevertheless, poet and critic John Dryden rated Shakespeare highly, saying of Jonson, \\"I admire him, but I love Shakespeare\\".[230] For several decades, Rymer's view held sway; but during the 18th century, critics began to respond to Shakespeare on his own terms and acclaim what they termed his natural genius. A series of scholarly editions of his work, notably those of Samuel Johnson in 1765 and Edmond Malone in 1790, added to his growing reputation.[231][232] By 1800, he was firmly enshrined as the national poet.[233] In the 18th and 19th centuries, his reputation also spread abroad. Among those who championed him were the writers Voltaire, Goethe, Stendhal, and Victor Hugo.[234][j]\\r\\nDuring the Romantic era, Shakespeare was praised by the poet and literary philosopher Samuel Taylor Coleridge; and the critic August Wilhelm Schlegel translated his plays in the spirit of German Romanticism.[236] In the 19th century, critical admiration for Shakespeare's genius often bordered on adulation.[237] \\"That King Shakespeare,\\" the essayist Thomas Carlyle wrote in 1840, \\"does not he shine, in crowned sovereignty, over us all, as the noblest, gentlest, yet strongest of rallying signs; indestructible\\".[238] The Victorians produced his plays as lavish spectacles on a grand scale.[239] The playwright and critic George Bernard Shaw mocked the cult of Shakespeare worship as \\"bardolatry\\", claiming that the new naturalism of Ibsen's plays had made Shakespeare obsolete.[240]\\r\\nThe modernist revolution in the arts during the early 20th century, far from discarding Shakespeare, eagerly enlisted his work in the service of the avant-garde. The Expressionists in Germany and the Futurists in Moscow mounted productions of his plays. Marxist playwright and director Bertolt Brecht devised an epic theatre under the influence of Shakespeare. The poet and critic T.S. Eliot argued against Shaw that Shakespeare's \\"primitiveness\\" in fact made him truly modern.[241] Eliot, along with G. Wilson Knight and the school of New Criticism, led a movement towards a closer reading of Shakespeare's imagery. In the 1950s, a wave of new critical approaches replaced modernism and paved the way for \\"post-modern\\" studies of Shakespeare.[242] By the 1980s, Shakespeare studies were open to movements such as structuralism, feminism, New Historicism, African-American studies, and queer studies.[243][244] In a comprehensive reading of Shakespeare's works and comparing Shakespeare literary accomplishments to accomplishments among leading figures in philosophy and theology as well, Harold Bloom has commented that \\"Shakespeare was larger than Plato and than St. Augustine. He encloses us because we see with his fundamental perceptions.\\"[245]\\r\\nShakespeare's works include the 36 plays printed in the First Folio of 1623, listed according to their folio classification as comedies, histories, and tragedies.[246] Two plays not included in the First Folio, The Two Noble Kinsmen and Pericles, Prince of Tyre, are now accepted as part of the canon, with today's scholars agreeing that Shakespeare made major contributions to the writing of both.[247][248] No Shakespearean poems were included in the First Folio.\\r\\nIn the late 19th century, Edward Dowden classified four of the late comedies as romances, and though many scholars prefer to call them tragicomedies, Dowden's term is often used.[249][250] In 1896, Frederick S. Boas coined the term \\"problem plays\\" to describe four plays: All's Well That Ends Well, Measure for Measure, Troilus and Cressida, and Hamlet.[251] \\"Dramas as singular in theme and temper cannot be strictly called comedies or tragedies\\", he wrote. \\"We may, therefore, borrow a convenient phrase from the theatre of today and class them together as Shakespeare's problem plays.\\"[252] The term, much debated and sometimes applied to other plays, remains in use, though Hamlet is definitively classed as a tragedy.[253][254][255]\\r\\nAround 230 years after Shakespeare's death, doubts began to be expressed about the authorship of the works attributed to him.[256] Proposed alternative candidates include Francis Bacon, Christopher Marlowe, and Edward de Vere, 17th Earl of Oxford.[257] Several \\"group theories\\" have also been proposed.[258] Only a small minority of academics believe there is reason to question the traditional attribution,[259] but interest in the subject, particularly the Oxfordian theory of Shakespeare authorship, continues into the 21st century.[260][261][262]\\r\\nSome scholars claim that members of Shakespeare's family were Catholics, at a time when practicing Catholicism in England was against the law.[263] Shakespeare's mother, Mary Arden, certainly came from a pious Catholic family. The strongest evidence might be a Catholic statement of faith signed by his father, John Shakespeare, found in 1757 in the rafters of his former house in Henley Street. However, the document is now lost and scholars differ as to its authenticity.[264][265] In 1591, the authorities reported that John Shakespeare had missed church \\"for fear of process for debt\\", a common Catholic excuse.[266][267][268] In 1606, the name of William's daughter Susanna appears on a list of those who failed to attend Easter communion in Stratford.[266][267][268] As several scholars have noted, whatever his private views, Shakespeare \\"conformed to the official state religion\\",[citation needed] as Park Honan put it.[k] Also, Shakespeare's will uses a Protestant formula, and he was a confirmed member of the Church of England, where he was married, his children were baptized, and where he is buried. Other authors argue that there is a lack of evidence about Shakespeare's religious beliefs. Scholars find evidence both for and against Shakespeare's Catholicism, Protestantism, or lack of belief in his plays, but the truth may be impossible to prove.[270][271]\\r\\nFew details of Shakespeare's sexuality are known. At 18, he married 26-year-old Anne Hathaway, who was pregnant. Susanna, the first of their three children, was born six months later on 26 May 1583. Over the centuries, some readers have posited that Shakespeare's sonnets are autobiographical,[272] and point to them as evidence of his love for a young man. Others read the same passages as the expression of intense friendship rather than romantic love.[273][274][275] The 26 so-called \\"Dark Lady\\" sonnets, addressed to a married woman, are taken as evidence of heterosexual liaisons.[276]\\r\\nNo written contemporary description of Shakespeare's physical appearance survives, and no evidence suggests that he ever commissioned a portrait, so the Droeshout engraving, which Ben Jonson approved of as a good likeness,[277] and his Stratford monument provide perhaps the best evidence of his appearance. From the 18th century, the desire for authentic Shakespeare portraits fuelled claims that various surviving pictures depicted Shakespeare. That demand also led to the production of several fake portraits, as well as misattributions, repaintings, and relabelling of portraits of other people.[278]","input":"Who is the most performed playwright of all time?"},{"output":"435 Representatives","context":"","input":"How many seats in the house and senate?"},{"output":"Rajendra Singh","context":"The Director General of the Indian Coast Guard (DG ICG) is the head of the Indian Coast Guard.

It has distinctive yellow and black markings on the abdomen and a mostly white cephalothorax. Its scientific Latin name translates to \\"gilded silver-face\\" (the genus name Argiope meaning \\"silver-face\\", while the specific epithet aurantia means \\"gilded\\"). Males range from 5ÿ9?mm (0.20ÿ0.35?in); females range from 19ÿ28?mm (0.75ÿ1.10?in). These spiders may bite if disturbed or harassed, but the venom is seemingly harmless to humans.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nYellow garden spiders often build webs in areas adjacent to open sunny fields where they stay concealed and protected from the wind. The spider can also be found along the eaves of houses and outbuildings or in any tall vegetation where they can securely stretch a web.\\r\\nFemale Argiope aurantia spiders tend to be somewhat local, often staying in one place throughout much of their lifetime.\\r\\nThe web of the yellow garden spider is distinctive: a circular shape up to 2 feet (60?cm) in diameter, with a dense zigzag of silk, known as a stabilimentum, in the center. The purpose of the stabilimentum is disputed. It is possible that it acts as camouflage for the spider lurking in the web's center, but it may also attract insect prey, or even warn birds of the presence of the otherwise difficult-to-see web. Only those spiders that are active during the day construct stabilimenta in their webs.\\r\\nTo construct the web, several radial lines are stretched among four or five anchor points that can be more than three feet apart. The radial lines meet at a central point. The spider makes a frame with several more radial lines and then fills the center with a spiral of silk, leaving a 5?16-to-3?8-inch (7.9 to 9.5?mm) gap between the spiral rings, starting with the innermost ring and moving outward in a clockwise motion. To ensure that the web is taut, the spider bends the radial lines slightly together while applying the silk spiral. The female builds a substantially larger web than the male's small zigzag web, often found nearby. The spider occupies the center of the web, usually facing straight down, waiting for prey to become ensnared in it. If disturbed by a possible predator, she may drop from the web and hide on the ground nearby. The web normally remains in one location for the entire summer, but spiders can change locations usually early in the season, perhaps to find better protection or better hunting.\\r\\nThe yellow garden spider can oscillate her web vigorously while she remains firmly attached in the center.[7] This action might prevent predators like wasps and birds from drawing a good bead, and also to fully entangle an insect before it cuts itself loose. However, in a case observed in Georgia, Davis witnessed a Vespa crabro fly into the spiders web and get tangled up. Upon looking closer it was found that V.?crabro was actually cutting free prey that had been caught in the A.?aurantia web. In this case, A.?aurantia did not interfere or fight with the European hornet, probably because it dropped from the web and hid nearby.[8]\\r\\nIn a nightly ritual, the spider consumes the circular interior part of the web and then rebuilds it each morning with fresh new silk. The radial framework and anchoring lines are not usually replaced when the spider rebuilds the web. The spider may be recycling the chemicals used in web building. Additionally, the fine threads that she consumes appear to have tiny particles of what may be minuscule insects and organic matter that may contain nutrition.[9]\\r\\nThe yellow garden spider does not live in very dense location clusters like other orb spiders such as the golden orb web spider. The yellow garden spider keeps a clean orderly web in comparison to the cluttered series of webs built and abandoned by groups of golden orb spiders.\\r\\nArgiope spiders are not aggressive. They might bite if grabbed, but other than for defense they do not attack large animals. Their venom often contains a library of polyamine toxins with potential as therapeutic medicinal agents. Notable among these is the argiotoxin ArgTX-636.[10]\\r\\nA bite by Argiope aurantia is comparable to a bee sting with redness and swelling. For a healthy adult, a bite is not considered an issue. Though they are not aggressive spiders, the very young, elderly, and those with compromised immune systems should exercise caution, just as they would around a beehive.[11]\\r\\nYellow garden spiders breed twice a year. The males roam in search of a female, building a small web near or actually in the female's web, then court the females by plucking strands on her web. Often, when the male approaches the female, he has a safety drop line ready, in case she attacks him. The male uses the palpal bulbs on his pedipalps to transfer sperm to the female. After inserting the second palpal bulb, the male dies, and is sometimes then eaten by the female.[12]\\r\\nShe lays her eggs at night on a sheet of silky material, then covers them with another layer of silk, then a protective brownish silk. She then uses her legs to form the sheet into a ball with an upturned neck. Egg sacs range from 5/8\\"?to?1\\" in diameter. She often suspends the egg sac right on her web, near the center where she spends most of her time. Each spider produces from one to four sacs with perhaps over a thousand eggs inside each. She guards the eggs against predation as long as she is able. However, as the weather cools, she becomes more frail, and dies around the time of the first hard frost.[6]\\r\\nIn the spring, the young spiders exit the sac. They are so tiny that they look like dust gathered inside the silk mesh. Some of the spiderlings remain nearby, but others exude a strand of silk that gets caught by the breeze, carrying the spiderling to a more distant area.[6]\\r\\nFemales of the species are the most commonly seen in gardens. Their webs are usually characterized by a zigzag shaped stabilimentum (an extra thick line of silk) in the middle extending vertically. The spiders spend most of their time in their webs, waiting for prey to become ensnared. When prey becomes caught in the web, the spider may undulate the web back and forth to further trap the insect. When the prey is secure, the spider kills it by injecting its venom and then wraps the prey in a cocoon of silk for later consumption (typically 1ÿ4 hours later). Prey includes small vertebrates, such as geckos and green anoles, as well as insects.[6][13]\\r\\nFemale\\r\\nUnderside\\r\\nMale\\r\\nYellow garden spider zig?zag?web\\r\\nEgg?sac\\r\\nArgiope?aurantia spiderlings\\r\\nWriting spider eating a swallowtail?butterfly in Holly?Springs, North?Carolina\\r\\nFemale consuming a?moth\\r\\nCapturing and wrapping several honey?bees","input":"What is a black spider with yellow stripes?"},{"output":"is a label","context":"The Monroney sticker or window sticker is a label required in the United States to be displayed in all new automobiles and includes the listing of certain official information about the car.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) conducted a series of studies to determine the best way to redesign this label to provide consumers with simple energy and environmental comparisons across all vehicles types, including battery electric vehicles (BEV), plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEV), and conventional internal combustion engine vehicles powered by gasoline and diesel, in order to help consumers choose more efficient and environmentally friendly vehicles.[5][6]\\r\\nAs part of the research and redesign process, EPA conducted focus groups where presented participants with several options to express the consumption of electricity for plug-in electric vehicles. The research showed that participants did not understand the concept of a kilowatt hour as a measure of electric energy use in spite of the fact that this is the metric used in their monthly electric bills. Instead, participants favored a miles per gallon of gasoline equivalent, MPGe, as the metric to compare with the familiar miles per gallon used for gasoline vehicles. The research also concluded that the kW-hrs per 100 miles metric was more confusing to focus group participants compared to a miles per kW-hr. Based on these results, EPA decided to use the following fuel economy and fuel consumption metrics on the redesigned labels: MPG (city and highway, and combined); MPGe (city and highway, and combined); Gallons per 100 miles; kW-hrs per 100 miles.[6]\\r\\nThe proposed design and final content for two options of the new sticker label that will be introduced in 2013 model year cars and trucks were consulted for 60 days with the public in 2010, and both included miles per gallon equivalent and kW-hrs per 100 miles as the fuel economy metrics for plug-in cars, but in one option MPGe and annual electricity cost are the two most prominent metrics. One of the design options had a letter grading system from A to D and the rating would have compared a given vehicles fuel economy and air pollution to those of the entire fleet of new cars. The letter grade system was opposed by carmakers and rejected after the public consultation.[3][7][8] In November 2010, EPA introduced MPGe as comparison metric on its new sticker for fuel economy for the Nissan Leaf and the Chevrolet Volt.[9][10][10]\\r\\nIn May 2011, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) and EPA issued a joint final rule establishing new requirements for a fuel economy and environment label that will be mandatory for all new passenger cars and trucks starting with model year 2013, though carmakers can adopt it voluntarily for model year 2012. The ruling include new labels for alternative fuel and alternative propulsion vehicles available in the US market, such as plug-in hybrids, electric vehicles, flexible-fuel vehicles, hydrogen fuel cell vehicle, and natural gas vehicles.[1][2] The common fuel economy metric adopted to allow the comparison of alternative fuel and advanced technology vehicles with conventional internal combustion engine vehicles is miles per gallon of gasoline equivalent (MPGe).

The Thirteen Colonies had very similar political, constitutional, and legal systems, and were dominated by Protestant English-speakers. They were part of Britain's possessions in the New World, which also included colonies in Canada and the Caribbean, as well as East and West Florida.\\r\\nIn the 18th century, the British government operated its colonies under a policy of mercantilism, in which the central government administered its possessions for the economic benefit of the mother country. However, the Thirteen Colonies had a high degree of self-governance and active local elections, and resisted London's demands for more control. In the 1750s, the colonies began collaborating with one another instead of dealing directly with Britain. These inter-colonial activities cultivated a sense of shared American identity and led to calls for protection of the colonists' \\"Rights as Englishmen\\", especially the principle of \\"no taxation without representation\\". Grievances with the British government led to the American Revolution, in which the colonies collaborated in forming a Continental Congress which declared independence in 1776 and fought the American Revolutionary War (1775ÿ83) with the aid of France, the Dutch Republic, and Spain.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first permanently settled English colony on the North American continent was the Colony and Dominion of Virginia, established 1607. The number 13 was complete with the establishment of the Province of Georgia in 1732, although the term \\"Thirteen Colonies\\" became current only in the context of the American Revolution.[3]\\r\\nThe first successful English colony was Jamestown, established May 14, 1607 near Chesapeake Bay. The business venture was financed and coordinated by the London Virginia Company, a joint stock company looking for gold. Its first years were extremely difficult, with very high death rates from disease and starvation, wars with local Indians, and little gold. The colony survived and flourished by turning to tobacco as a cash crop.[4][5]\\r\\nIn 1632, King Charles I granted the charter for Province of Maryland to Cecil Calvert, 2nd Baron Baltimore. Calvert's father had been a prominent Catholic official who encouraged Catholic immigration to the English colonies. The charter offered no guidelines on religion, although it was assumed that Catholics would not be molested in the new colony.[6]\\r\\nThe Province of Carolina was the first attempted English settlement south of Virginia. It was a private venture, financed by a group of English Lords Proprietors who obtained a Royal Charter to the Carolinas in 1663, hoping that a new colony in the south would become profitable like Jamestown. Carolina was not settled until 1670, and even then the first attempt failed because there was no incentive for emigration to that area. Eventually, however, the Lords combined their remaining capital and financed a settlement mission to the area led by Sir John Colleton. The expedition located fertile and defensible ground at what became Charleston, originally Charles Town for Charles II of England.[7]\\r\\nThe Pilgrims were a small group of Puritan separatists who felt that they needed to physically distance themselves from the corrupt Church of England. After initially moving to the Netherlands, they decided to re-establish themselves in America. The initial Pilgrim settlers sailed to North America in 1620 on the Mayflower. Upon their arrival, they drew up the Mayflower Compact, by which they bound themselves together as a united community, thus establishing the small Plymouth Colony. William Bradford was their main leader. After its founding, other settlers traveled from England to join the colony.[8]\\r\\nThe non-separatist Puritans constituted a much larger group than the Pilgrims, and they established the Massachusetts Bay Colony in 1629 with 400 settlers. They sought to reform the Church of England by creating a new, pure church in the New World. By 1640, 20,000 had arrived; many died soon after arrival, but the others found a healthy climate and an ample food supply. The Plymouth and Massachusetts Bay colonies together spawned other Puritan colonies in New England, including the New Haven, Saybrook, and Connecticut colonies. During the 17th century, the New Haven and Saybrook colonies were absorbed by Connecticut.[9]\\r\\nProvidence Plantation was founded in 1636 by Roger Williams on land provided by Narragansett sachem Canonicus. Williams was a Puritan who preached religious tolerance, separation of Church and State, and a complete break with the Church of England. He was banished from the Massachusetts Bay Colony over theological disagreements, and he and other settlers founded Providence Plantation based on an egalitarian constitution providing for majority rule \\"in civil things\\" and \\"liberty of conscience\\" in religious matters.[4][10] In 1637, a second group including Anne Hutchinson established a second settlement on Aquidneck Island, also known as Rhode Island.\\r\\nOther colonists settled to the north, mingling with adventurers and profit-oriented settlers to establish more religiously diverse colonies in New Hampshire and Maine. These small settlements were absorbed by Massachusetts when it made significant land claims in the 1640s and 1650s, but New Hampshire was eventually given a separate charter in 1679. Maine remained a part of Massachusetts until achieving statehood in 1820.\\r\\nIn 1686, King James II of England consolidated the New England colonies into Dominion of New England. In 1688, the colonies of New York, West Jersey, and East Jersey were added to the dominion. The dominion was disestablished in 1689, after the Glorious Revolution, and the former colonies were re-established.\\r\\nAfter the Second Anglo-Dutch War, the Dutch colony of New Netherland was taken over by the British and renamed New York. However, large numbers of Dutch remained in the colony, dominating the rural areas between New York City and Albany. Meanwhile, Yankees from New England started moving in, as did immigrants from Germany. New York City attracted a large polyglot population, including a large black slave population.[11] In 1674, the proprietary colonies of East Jersey and West Jersey were created from lands formerly part of New York.[12]\\r\\nPennsylvania was founded in 1681 as a proprietary colony of Quaker William Penn. The main population elements included Quaker population based in Philadelphia, a Scotch Irish population on the Western frontier, and numerous German colonies in between.[13] Philadelphia became the largest city in the colonies with its central location, excellent port, and a population of about 30,000.[14]\\r\\nIn 1702, East and West Jersey were combined to form the Province of New Jersey.\\r\\nDue to their remoteness from each other, the northern and southern sections of the Carolina colony operated more or less independently until 1691, when Philip Ludwell was appointed governor of the entire province. From that time until 1708, the northern and southern settlements remained under one government. However, during this period, the two halves of the province began increasingly to be known as North Carolina and South Carolina. In 1712, Carolina was divided into two colonies: the Province of South Carolina and the Province of North Carolina.\\r\\nIn the 1730s, James Oglethorpe, a Member of Parliament, proposed that the area south of the Carolinas be colonized with the \\"worthy poor\\" of England, to provide an alternative to the overcrowded debtors' prisons. Oglethorpe and other English philanthropists secured a royal charter as the Trustees of the colony of Georgia on June 9, 1732.[15]\\r\\nThe French and Indian War (1754ÿ1763) was the American extension of the general European conflict known as the Seven Years' War. Previous colonial wars in North America had started in Europe and then spread to the colonies, but the French and Indian War is notable for having started in North America and spread to Europe. One of the primary causes of the war was increasing competition between Britain and France, especially in the Great Lakes and Ohio valley.[16]\\r\\nThe French and Indian War took on a new significance for the British North American colonists when William Pitt the Elder decided that major military resources needed to be devoted to North America in order to win the war against France. For the first time, the continent became one of the main theaters of what could be termed a \\"world war\\". During the war, the position of the British colonies as part of the British Empire was made truly apparent, as British military and civilian officials took on an increased presence in the lives of Americans.\\r\\nThe war also increased a sense of American unity in other ways. It caused men to travel across the continent who might otherwise have never left their own colony, fighting alongside men from decidedly different backgrounds who were nonetheless still \\"American\\". Throughout the course of the war, British officers trained American ones for battle, most notably George Washington, which benefitted the American cause during the Revolution. Also, colonial legislatures and officials had to cooperate intensively, for the first time, in pursuit of the continent-wide military effort.[16] The relations between the British military establishment and the colonists were not always positive, setting the stage for later distrust and dislike of British troops.\\r\\nIn the Treaty of Paris (1763), France formally ceded to Britain the eastern part of its vast North American empire, having secretly given to Spain the territory of Louisiana west of the Mississippi River the previous year. Before the war, Britain held the thirteen American colonies, most of present-day Nova Scotia, and most of the Hudson Bay watershed. Following the war, Britain gained all French territory east of the Mississippi River, including Quebec, the Great Lakes, and the Ohio River valley. Britain also gained Spanish Florida, from which it formed the colonies of East and West Florida. In removing a major foreign threat to the thirteen colonies, the war also largely removed the colonists' need of colonial protection.\\r\\nThe British and colonists triumphed jointly over a common foe. The colonists' loyalty to the mother country was stronger than ever before. However, disunity was beginning to form. British Prime Minister William Pitt the Elder had decided to wage the war in the colonies with the use of troops from the colonies and tax funds from Britain itself. This was a successful wartime strategy but, after the war was over, each side believed that it had borne a greater burden than the other. The British elite, the most heavily taxed of any in Europe, pointed out angrily that the colonists paid little to the royal coffers. The colonists replied that their sons had fought and died in a war that served European interests more than their own. This dispute was a link in the chain of events that soon brought about the American Revolution.[16]\\r\\nThe British sought to maintain peaceful relations with those Indian tribes that had allied with the French, to keep them separated from the American frontiersmen. To this end, the Royal Proclamation of 1763 restricted settlement west of the Appalachian Mountains, as this was designated an Indian Reserve.[17] Some groups of settlers disregarded the proclamation, continuing to move west and establish farms.[18] The proclamation was soon modified and was no longer a hindrance to settlement, but the fact angered the colonists that it had been promulgated without their prior consultation.[19]\\r\\nAmericans insisted on the principle of \\"no taxation without representation\\" beginning with the intense protests over the Stamp Act of 1765, representation being understood in the context of Parliament directly levying the duty or excise tax, and thus by-passing the colonial legislatures, which had levied taxes on the colonies in the monarch's stead prior to 1763.[20] They argued that the colonies had no representation in the British Parliament, so it was a violation of their rights as Englishmen for taxes to be imposed upon them. The other British colonies that had assemblies largely agreed with those in the Thirteen Colonies, but they were thoroughly controlled by the British Empire and the Royal Navy, so protests were hopeless.[21]\\r\\nParliament rejected the colonial protests and asserted its authority by passing new taxes. Trouble escalated over the tea tax, as Americans in each colony boycotted the tea, and those in Boston dumped the tea in the harbor during the Boston Tea Party in 1773. Tensions escalated in 1774 as Parliament passed the laws known as the Intolerable Acts, which greatly restricted self-government in the colony of Massachusetts, among other things.\\r\\nIn response, the colonies formed extralegal bodies of elected representatives, generally known as Provincial Congresses. Colonists emphasized their determination by boycotting imports of British merchandise.[22] Later in 1774, twelve colonies sent representatives to the First Continental Congress in Philadelphia. During the Second Continental Congress, the thirteenth colony (Georgia) sent delegates, as well. By spring 1775, all royal officials had been expelled from all thirteen colonies. The Continental Congress became a national government. It raised an army to fight the British and named George Washington its commander, made treaties, declared independence, and recommended that the colonies write constitutions and become states.[23] In 1776, the Thirteen Colonies declared their independence from Britain. With the help of France and Spain, the Thirteen Colonies defeated the British in the American Revolutionary War. In the 1783 Treaty of Paris, Britain recognized the independence of Thirteen Colonies, which became known as the United States.\\r\\nThe colonial population rose to a quarter of a million during the 17th century, and to nearly 2.5 million on the eve of the American revolution. Perkins (1988) notes the importance of good health for the growth of the colonies: \\"Fewer deaths among the young meant that a higher proportion of the population reached reproductive age, and that fact alone helps to explain why the colonies grew so rapidly.\\"[25] There were, of course, many other reasons for the population growth besides good health, such as the Great Migration.\\r\\nBy 1776, about 85% of the white population population's ancestry originated in the British Isles (English, Irish, Scottish, Welsh), 9% of German origin, 4% [Dutch American|Dutch]] and 2% Huguenot French and other minorities. Over 90% were farmers, with several small cities that were also seaports linking the colonial economy to the larger British Empire. These populations continued to grow at a rapid rate during the late 18th and early 19th centuries, primarily because of high birth rates and relatively low death rates. Immigration was a minor factor from 1774 to 1830.[26]\\r\\nSlavery was legal and practiced in many of the Thirteen Colonies. In most places, it involved house servants or farm workers. It was of economic importance in the export-oriented tobacco plantations of Virginia and Maryland and on the rice and indigo plantations of South Carolina.[27] About 287,000 slaves were imported into the Thirteen Colonies over a period of 160 years, or 2% of the estimated 12 million taken from Africa to the Americas via the Atlantic slave trade. The great majority went to sugar colonies in the Caribbean and to Brazil, where life expectancy was short and the numbers had to be continually replenished. By the mid-18th century, life expectancy was much higher in the American colonies.[28]\\r\\nThe numbers grew rapidly through a very high birth rate and low mortality rate, reaching nearly four million by the 1860 census. From 1770 until 1860, the rate of natural growth of North American slaves was much greater than for the population of any nation in Europe, and was nearly twice as rapid as that in England.\\r\\nProtestantism was the predominant religion in the Thirteen Colonies. There were also Catholics, Jews and deists. A large fraction had no religious connection. The Anglican Church or Church of England was officially established in most of the South; It was disestablished at the time of the American Revolution. As the Puritan movement became the Congregational denomination, it was the established religion in Massachusetts and Connecticut until well into the 19th century. [30] In practice this meant that tax revenues were allocated to church expenses. The Anglican parishes in the South were under the control of local vestries, and had public functions, such as repair of the roads and relief of the poor.[31]\\r\\nThe colonies were religiously diverse, with Protestant denominations brought by British, German, Dutch, and other immigrants. The Reformed tradition was the foundation for Presbyterian, Congregationalist, and Continental Reformed denominations. The Dutch Reformed Church was strong among Dutch Americans in New York and New Jersey, while Lutheranism was prevalent among German immigrants. Germans also brought diverse forms of Anabaptism, especially the Mennonite variety. Baptist preacher Roger Williams founded Providence Plantations which became Rhode Island. Jews Were clustered in a few port cities. The Baltimore family founded Maryland and brought in fellow Catholics from England.[32] Presbyterians were chiefly immigrants from Scotland and Ulster, and favored the back country and frontier districts.[33]\\r\\nQuakers were well established in Pennsylvania, where they controlled the governorship and for many years the legislature.[34] Quakers were also numerous in Rhode Island. Baptists and Methodists were growing rapidly during the First Great Awakening of the 1740s.[35] In Virginia the Baptists they posed a challenge to the landed elites.[36] Many of the denominations sponsored missions to the local Indians. In contrast a Catholic candidate, the number of conversions was relatively small.[37]\\r\\nHigher education was available for young men in the North, and most students were aspiring Protestant ministers. The oldest colleges were Harvard College, College of New Jersey (Princeton), Yale College, and College of Rhode Island (Brown). Others were King's College (Columbia), the College of Philadelphia (University of Pennsylvania), and Dartmouth College in New Hampshire. South of Philadelphia, there was only the College of William and Mary which trained the secular elite in Virginia, especially aspiring lawyers.\\r\\nMost New England towns sponsored public schools for boys, but public schooling was rare elsewhere. Girls were educated at home or by small local private schools, and they had no access to college. Aspiring physicians and lawyers typically learned as apprentices to an established practitioner, although some young men went to medical schools in Scotland.[38]\\r\\nThe three forms of colonial government in 1776 were provincial (royal colony), proprietary, and charter. These governments were all subordinate to the King of England, with no explicit relationship with the British Parliament. Beginning late in the 17th century, the administration of all British colonies was overseen by the Board of Trade in London.\\r\\nThe provincial colony was governed by commissions created at pleasure of the king. A governor and (in some provinces) his council were appointed by the crown. The governor was invested with general executive powers and authorized to call a locally elected assembly. The governor's council would sit as an upper house when the assembly was in session, in addition to its role in advising the governor. Assemblies were made up of representatives elected by the freeholders and planters (landowners) of the province. The governor had the power of absolute veto and could prorogue (i.e., delay) and dissolve the assembly. The assembly's role was to make all local laws and ordinances, ensuring that they were not inconsistent with the laws of England. In practice, this did not always occur, since many of the provincial assemblies sought to expand their powers and limit those of the governor and crown. Laws could be examined by the British Privy Council or Board of Trade, which also held veto power of legislation. New Hampshire, New York, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, and eventually Massachusetts were crown colonies.\\r\\nProprietary colonies were governed much as royal colonies except that lord proprietors, rather than the king, appointed the governor. They were set up after the Restoration of 1660 and typically enjoyed greater civil and religious liberty. Pennsylvania (which included Delaware), New Jersey, and Maryland were proprietary colonies.[39]\\r\\nCharter governments were political corporations created by letters patent, giving the grantees control of the land and the powers of legislative government. The charters provided a fundamental constitution and divided powers among legislative, executive, and judicial functions, with those powers being vested in officials. Massachusetts, Providence Plantation, Rhode Island, Warwick, and Connecticut were charter colonies. The Massachusetts charter was revoked in 1684 and was replaced by a provincial charter that was issued in 1691.[40]\\r\\nAfter 1680, the royal government in London took an increasing interest in the affairs of the colonies, which were growing rapidly in population and wealth. In 1680, only Virginia was a royal colony; by 1720, half were under the control of royal governors. These governors were appointees closely tied to the government in London.\\r\\nHistorians before the 1880s emphasized American nationalism. However, scholarship after that time was heavily influenced by the \\"Imperial school\\" led by Herbert L. Osgood, George Louis Beer, Charles McLean Andrews, and Lawrence H. Gipson. This viewpoint dominated colonial historiography into the 1940s, and they emphasized and often praised the attention that London gave to all the colonies. In this view, there was never a threat (before the 1770s) that any colony would revolt or seek independence.[41]\\r\\nBritish settlers did not come to the American colonies with the intention of creating a democratic system; yet they quickly created a broad electorate without a land-owning aristocracy, along with a pattern of free elections which put a strong emphasis on voter participation. The colonies offered a much freer degree of suffrage than England or indeed any other country. Any property owner could vote for members of the lower house of the legislature, and they could even vote for the governor in Connecticut and Rhode Island.[42] Voters were required to hold an \\"interest\\" in society; as the South Carolina legislature said in 1716, \\"it is necessary and reasonable, that none but such persons will have an interest in the Province should be capable to elect members of the Commons House of Assembly\\".[43] The main legal criterion for having an \\"interest\\" was ownership of real estate property, which was uncommon in Britain, where 19 out of 20 men were controlled politically by their landlords. (Women, children, indentured servants, and slaves were subsumed under the interest of the family head.) London insisted on this requirement for the colonies, telling governors to exclude from the ballot men who were not freeholdersthat is, those who did not own land. Nevertheless, land was so widely owned that 50% to 80% of the men were eligible to vote.[44]\\r\\nThe colonial political culture emphasized deference, so that local notables were the men who ran and were chosen. But sometimes they competed with each other and had to appeal to the common man for votes. There were no political parties, and would-be legislators formed ad-hoc coalitions of their families, friends, and neighbors. Outside of Puritan New England, election day brought in all the men from the countryside to the county seat to make merry, politick, shake hands with the grandees, meet old friends, and hear the speechesall the while toasting, eating, treating, tippling, and gambling. They voted by shouting their choice to the clerk, as supporters cheered or booed. Candidate George Washington spent S39 for treats for his supporters. The candidates knew that they had to \\"swill the planters with bumbo\\" (rum). Elections were carnivals where all men were equal for one day and traditional restraints were relaxed.[45]\\r\\nThe actual rate of voting ranged from 20% to 40% of all adult white males. The rates were higher in Pennsylvania and New York, where long-standing factions based on ethnic and religious groups mobilized supporters at a higher rate. New York and Rhode Island developed long-lasting two-faction systems that held together for years at the colony level, but they did not reach into local affairs. The factions were based on the personalities of a few leaders and an array of family connections, and they had little basis in policy or ideology. Elsewhere the political scene was in a constant whirl, based on personality rather than long-lived factions or serious disputes on issues.[42]\\r\\nThe colonies were independent of one other long before 1774; indeed, all the colonies began as separate and unique settlements or plantations. Further, efforts had failed to form a colonial union through the Albany Congress of 1754 led by Benjamin Franklin. The thirteen all had well-established systems of self-government and elections based on the Rights of Englishmen which they were determined to protect from imperial interference.[46]\\r\\nThe British Empire at the time operated under the mercantile system, where all trade was concentrated inside the Empire, and trade with other empires was forbidden. The goal was to enrich Britainits merchants and its government. Whether the policy was good for the colonists was not an issue in London, but Americans became increasingly restive with mercantilist policies.[47]\\r\\nMercantilism meant that the government and the merchants became partners with the goal of increasing political power and private wealth, to the exclusion of other empires. The government protected its merchantsand kept others outby trade barriers, regulations, and subsidies to domestic industries in order to maximize exports from and minimize imports to the realm. The government had to fight smugglingwhich became a favorite American technique in the 18th century to circumvent the restrictions on trading with the French, Spanish or Dutch.[48] The tactic used by mercantilism was to run trade surpluses, so that gold and silver would pour into London. The government took its share through duties and taxes, with the remainder going to merchants in Britain. The government spent much of its revenue on a superb Royal Navy, which not only protected the British colonies but threatened the colonies of the other empires, and sometimes seized them. Thus the British Navy captured New Amsterdam (New York) in 1664. The colonies were captive markets for British industry, and the goal was to enrich the mother country.[49]\\r\\nBritain implemented mercantilism by trying to block American trade with the French, Spanish, or Dutch empires using the Navigation Acts, which Americans avoided as often as they could. The royal officials responded to smuggling with open-ended search warrants (Writs of Assistance). In 1761, Boston lawyer James Otis argued that the writs violated the constitutional rights of the colonists. He lost the case, but John Adams later wrote, \\"Then and there the child Independence was born.\\"[50]\\r\\nHowever, the colonists took pains to argue that they did not oppose British regulation of their external trade; they only opposed legislation which affected them internally.\\r\\nBesides these thirteen colonies, Britain had another dozen in the New World. Those in the British West Indies, Newfoundland, the Province of Quebec, Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island, Bermuda, and East and West Florida remained loyal to the crown throughout the war (although Spain reacquired Florida before the war was over). There was a certain degree of sympathy with the Patriot cause in several of the other colonies, but their geographical isolation and the dominance of British naval power precluded any effective participation.[51] The British crown had only recently acquired those lands, and many of the issues facing the Thirteen Colonies did not apply to them, especially in the case of Quebec and Florida.[52]\\r\\nAt the time of the war Britain had seven other colonies on the Atlantic coast of North America: Newfoundland, Rupert's Land (the area around the Hudson Bay), Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island, East Florida, West Florida, and the Province of Quebec. There were other colonies in the Americas as well, largely in the British West Indies. These colonies remained loyal to the crown.[53]\\r\\nNewfoundland stayed loyal to Britain without question. It was exempt from the Navigation Acts and shared none of the grievances of the continental colonies. It was tightly bound to Britain and controlled by the Royal Navy and had no assembly that could voice grievances.\\r\\nNova Scotia had a large Yankee element that had recently arrived from New England, and shared the sentiments of the Americans about demanding the rights of the British men. The royal government in Halifax reluctantly allowed the Yankees of Nova Scotia a kind of \\"neutrality.\\" In any case, the island-like geography and the presence of the major British naval base at Halifax made the thought of armed resistance impossible.[54]\\r\\nQuebec was inhabited by French Catholic settlers who came under British control in the previous decade. The Quebec Act of 1774 gave them formal cultural autonomy within the empire, and many priests feared the intense Protestantism in New England. The American grievances over taxation had little relevance, and there was no assembly nor elections of any kind that could have mobilized any grievances. Even so, the Americans offered membership in the new nation and sent a military expedition that failed to capture Canada in 1775. Most Canadians remained neutral but some joined the American cause.[55]\\r\\nIn the West Indies the elected assemblies of Jamaica, Grenada, and Barbados formally declared their sympathies for the American cause and called for mediation, but the others were quite loyal. Britain carefully avoided antagonizing the rich owners of sugar plantations (many of whom lived in London); in turn the planters' greater dependence on slavery made them recognize the need for British military protection from possible slave revolts. The possibilities for overt action were sharply limited by the overwhelming power of Royal Navy in the islands. During the war there was some opportunistic trading with American ships.[56]\\r\\nIn Bermuda and the Bahamas local leaders were angry at the food shortages caused by British blockade of American ports. There was increasing sympathy for the American cause, including smuggling, and both colonies were considered \\"passive allies\\" of the United States throughout the war. When an American naval squadron arrived in the Bahamas to seize gunpowder, the colony gave no resistance at all.[57]\\r\\nEast Florida and West Florida were territories transferred from Spain to Britain after the French and Indian War by treaty. The few British colonists there needed protection from attacks by Indians and Spanish privateers. After 1775, East Florida became a major base for the British war effort in the South, especially in the invasions of Georgia and South Carolina.[58] However, Spain seized Pensacola in West Florida in 1781, then recovered both territories in the Treaty of Paris that ended the war in 1783. Spain ultimately transferred the Florida provinces to the United States in 1819.[59]\\r\\nThe first British empire centered on the 13 American colonies, which attracted large numbers of settlers from Britain. The \\"Imperial School\\" in the 1900sÿ1930s period took a favorable view of the benefits of empire, emphasizing its successful economic integration.[60] The Imperial School included such historians as Herbert L. Osgood, George Louis Beer, Charles M. Andrews, and Lawrence Gipson.[61]\\r\\nThe shock of Britain's defeat in 1783 caused a radical revision of their policies on colonialism, thereby producing what historians call the end of the First British Empire; of course, Britain still owned Canada and some islands in the West Indies.[62] Ashley Jackson writes:\\r\\nThe first British Empire was largely destroyed by the loss of the American colonies, followed by a \\"swing to the east\\" and the foundation of a second British Empire based on commercial and territorial expansion in South Asia.[63]\\r\\nMuch of the historiography concerns the reasons why the Americans rebelled in the 1770s and successfully broke away. Since the 1960s, the mainstream of historiography emphasizes the growth of American consciousness and nationalism, and its Republican value system in opposition to the aristocratic viewpoint of British leaders.[64]\\r\\nIn the analysis of the coming of the Revolution, historians in recent decades have mostly used one of three approaches.[65]","input":"By 1776 how many english colonies had been established along the atlantic coast?"},{"output":"Alan Christie Wilson","context":"Alan Christie Wilson (July 4, 1943 ÿ September 3, 1970) was a co-founder, leader, and primary composer for the American blues band Canned Heat. He played harmonica, guitar, and sang with the group live and on recordings. Wilson was lead singer on Canned Heat's two biggest U.S. hit singles. His death at age 27 prefigured that of some of the other rock artists of the 1960s.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWilson was born and grew up in the Boston suburb of Arlington, Massachusetts.[1] Some of Wilson's first efforts at performing music publicly came during his teen years with a jazz ensemble he formed with other musically oriented friends from school.[2] It was around this same time that Wilson developed a fascination with blues music after a friend played a Muddy Waters record for him. [3] After graduating from Arlington High School, he majored in music at Boston University and played the Cambridge, Massachusetts coffeehouse folk-blues circuit. Wilson developed into a dedicated student of early blues, writing a number of articles for Broadside of Boston newspaper and the folk-revival magazine Little Sandy Review, including a piece on bluesman Robert Pete Williams.[4]\\r\\nWilson was considered by many of his musical peers to be an expert on the blues musicians who came before him; many considered him as possessing an exceptional ability for connecting musically with the elder bluesmen.[5][6] His biggest influences included Skip James, Robert Johnson, Son House, Charley Patton, Tommy Johnson, John Lee Hooker, Muddy Waters, and Bukka White. James, in particular, was a highly exalted figure in Wilson's personal music journey. In high school, Wilson studied James' 1931 recordings with great ardor. Subsequently, Wilson began singing similar to James' high pitch. Wilson eventually perfected the high tenor, for which he would become known.[7]\\r\\nAfter Son House's 'rediscovery' in 1964, it was evident that House had forgotten his songs due to his long absence from music. Wilson showed him how to play again the songs House had recorded in 1930 and 1942. Wilson played House's old recordings for him and demonstrated them on guitar to revive House's memory.[8] House recorded \\"Father of the Delta Blues\\" for Columbia Records in 1965. Two of three selections on the set featured Wilson on harmonica and guitar. In a letter to Jazz Journal published in the September 1965 issue, Son House's manager Dick Waterman remarked the following about the project and Wilson: \\"It is a solo album, except for backing on two cuts by a 21-year-old White boy from Cambridge by the name of Al Wilson. Al plays second guitar on Empire State Express and harp on Levee Camp Moan. Al never recorded before, but he has backed John Hurt, Skip James, Sleepy John Estes, Bukka White and many others. He is good, and the record will prove it.\\"[9]\\r\\nDuring his time performing in Cambridge, Wilson met American guitarist John Fahey. From Fahey, he acquired the nickname \\"Blind Owl\\" owing to his extreme nearsightedness, roundish facial features and scholarly nature.[10] In one instance when he was playing at a wedding, he laid his guitar on the wedding cake because he did not see it. As Canned Heat's drummer, Fito de la Parra, wrote in his book: \\"Without the glasses, Alan literally could not recognize the people he played with at two feet, that's how blind the 'Blind Owl' was.\\".[11] With Fahey's encouragement, Wilson moved with Fahey to Los Angeles with the aim of having Wilson assist Fahey with his UCLA master's thesis on Charley Patton. It was in Los Angeles that Wilson met Bob Hite, a fellow blues enthusiast and record collector who would go on to establish Canned Heat with Wilson.[12]\\r\\nWith Canned Heat, Wilson performed at two prominent concerts of the 1960s era, the Monterey Pop Festival in 1967 and Woodstock in 1969. Although Canned Heat's live performance was cut from the original theatrical release of the Woodstock film, they were featured in the 25th anniversary \\"Director's Cut.\\" [13] The studio version of \\"Going Up The Country\\" was featured in the Woodstock film.\\r\\nWilson also wrote and sang the hit record \\"On the Road Again.\\" In an interview with Down Beat magazine he remarked that, \\"...?on \\"On The Road Again\\" [second LP] I appear in six different capacities ÿ three tamboura parts, harmonica, vocal, and guitar, all recorded at different times.\\" [14] On the double album Hooker 'N Heat (1970), John Lee Hooker is heard wondering how Wilson is capable of following Hooker's guitar playing so well. Hooker was known to be a difficult performer to accompany, partly because of his disregard of song form. Yet Wilson seemed to have no trouble at all following him on this album. Hooker concludes that \\"you [Wilson] musta been listenin' to my records all your life\\". Hooker is also known to have stated \\"Wilson is the greatest harmonica player ever.\\"\\r\\nOn September 3, 1970, Wilson was found dead on a hillside behind bandmate Bob Hite's Topanga Canyon home; he was 27 years old. An autopsy identified his manner and cause of death as accidental acute barbiturate intoxication.[15] Wilson reportedly had attempted suicide a few months earlier, attempting to drive his car off a freeway in Los Angeles. He was briefly hospitalized for significant depression, and was released after a few weeks.[16] Although his death is sometimes reported as a suicide, this is not clearly established and he left no note.[17] Wilson's death came just two weeks before the death of Jimi Hendrix and four weeks before the death of Janis Joplin, two artists who also died at the same age. Along with his talent and intellect, Wilson had a reputation for social awkwardness and introversion which may have contributed to his depression.\\r\\nWilson was a passionate conservationist who loved reading books on botany and ecology. He often slept outdoors to be closer to nature. In 1969, he wrote and recorded a song, \\"Poor Moon\\", which expressed concern over potential pollution of the moon. He wrote an essay called 'Grim Harvest', about the coastal redwood forests of California, which was printed as the liner notes to the Future Blues album by Canned Heat. Wilson was interested in preserving the natural world, particularly the redwood trees. When he died, so too did the Music Mountain organization he had initiated dedicated to this purpose.[18] In order to support his dream, Wilson's family has purchased a \\"grove naming\\" in his memory through the Save the Redwoods League of California. The money donated to create this memorial will be used by the League to support redwood reforestation, research, education, and land acquisition of both new and old growth redwoods.[19]\\r\\nStephen Stills' song \\"Blues Man\\" from the album Manassas is dedicated to Wilson, along with Jimi Hendrix and Duane Allman.","input":"Who is the lead singer of canned heat?"},{"output":"approximately 500","context":"The List of Florida hurricanes encompasses approximately 500?tropical or subtropical cyclones that affected the state of Florida. More storms hit Florida than any other U.S. state,[1] and since 1851 only eighteen hurricane seasons passed without a known storm impacting the state. Collectively, cyclones that hit the region have resulted in over 10,000 deaths, most of which occurring prior to the start of Hurricane Hunters flights in 1943. Additionally, the cumulative impact from the storms totaled over $141?billion in damage (2017?USD), primarily from Hurricane Andrew and hurricanes in the 2004 and 2005 seasons.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTropical cyclones have affected Florida in every month of the year with the exceptions of January and March. Nearly one-third of the cyclones affected the state in September, and nearly three-fourths of the storms affected the state between August and October, which coincides with the peak of the hurricane season. Portions of the coastline have the lowest return period, or the frequency at which a certain intensity or category of hurricane can be expected within 86?mi (139?km) of a given location, in the country. Monroe County was struck by 26 hurricanes since 1926, which is the greatest total for any county in the United States.[4]\\r\\nIn a Monthly Weather Review paper published in 1934, the U.S. Weather Bureau recognized Key West and Pensacola as the most hurricane-prone cities in the state; Key West experiences both storms developing from the western Atlantic Ocean and the Caribbean Sea, while Pensacola has received hurricanes crossing the state as well as storms recurving in the northern Gulf of Mexico.[5] The earliest storm to affect the state was the 1952 Groundhog Day Tropical Storm, and the latest storm to impact the state was a hurricane making landfall on December?1, 1925.\\r\\nThe strongest tropical cyclone to make landfall on the state was the Labor Day Hurricane of 1935, which crossed the Florida Keys with a pressure of 892?mbar (hPa; 26.35?inHg); it is also the strongest hurricane on record to strike the United States. Out of the ten most intense landfalling United States hurricanes, four struck Florida at peak strength.[2]\\r\\nThe first recorded tropical cyclone to affect the area that is now the state of Florida occurred in 1523, when two ships and their crews were lost along the western coastline.[6] A total 159 hurricanes are known to have affected the state prior to 1900, which collectively resulted in at least 6,504 fatalities and monetary damage of over $102?million (2017?USD). Additionally, at least 109 boats or ships were either driven ashore, wrecked, or damaged due to the storms. A strong hurricane struck northwest Florida on May 28, 1863 and is the earliest landfall during the year known in the US.[7]\\r\\nInformation is sparse for earlier years due to limitations in tropical cyclone observation, though as coastlines became more populated, more data became available. The National Hurricane Center recognizes the uncertainty in both the death tolls and the dates of the events.[8]\\r\\nIn the period between 1900 and 1949, 108 tropical cyclones affected the state, which collectively resulted in about $4.5?billion (2017?USD) in damage. Additionally, tropical cyclones in Florida were directly responsible for about 3,500 fatalities during the period, most of which from the 1928 Okeechobee Hurricane. The 1947 season was the year with the most tropical cyclones affecting the state, with a total of 6 systems. The 1905, 1908, 1913, 1927, 1931, 1942, and 1943 seasons were the only years during the period in which a storm did not affect the state.\\r\\nThe strongest hurricane to hit the state during the period was the Labor Day Hurricane of 1935, which is the strongest hurricane on record to strike the United States.[9] Several other major hurricanes struck the state during the period, including the 1926 Miami Hurricane, the 1928 Okeechobee Hurricane, and a cyclone each in 1945 and 1949 which made landfall as a Category 4 hurricane.\\r\\nIn the period between 1950 and 1974, 85 tropical or subtropical cyclones impacted the state, which collectively resulted in about $7?billion (2017?USD) in damage, primarily from Hurricanes Donna and Dora. Additionally, the storms were directly responsible for 93 fatalities and indirectly for 23 more deaths. Several tropical cyclones produced over 20?inches (500?mm) of rainfall in the state, including Hurricane Easy, which is the highest total during the period. The 1969 season was the year with the most tropical cyclones affecting the state, with a total of 8 systems. The 1954 and 1967 seasons were the only years during the period in which a storm did not affect the state.\\r\\nThe strongest hurricane to hit the state during the period was Hurricane Donna, which was the 8th strongest hurricane on record to strike the United States.[9] Additionally, Hurricanes Easy, King, Cleo, Isbell, and Betsy hit the state as major hurricanes.\\r\\nIn the period between 1975 and 1999, 83 tropical or subtropical cyclones affected the state, which collectively resulted in $51.1?billion (2017?USD) in damage, primarily from Hurricane Andrew, and 54 direct casualties. The 1985 season was the year with the most tropical cyclones affecting the state, with a total of 8 systems. Every year included at least 1 tropical cyclone affecting the state. The strongest hurricane to hit the state during the period was Hurricane Andrew, which was one of only three Category 5 hurricanes to strike the United States. Andrew, at the time, was the costliest tropical cyclone in United States history and remains the second-costliest. Additionally, Hurricanes Eloise, David, and Opal hit the state as major hurricanes.\\r\\nThe period from 2000 to the present was marked by several devastating North Atlantic hurricanes; as of 2017[update], 79 tropical or subtropical cyclones have affected the U.S. state of Florida. Collectively, cyclones in Florida over that period resulted in over $73 billion in damage[10] (2017?USD). Additionally, tropical cyclones in Florida were responsible for 147 direct fatalities and at least 92 indirect ones during the period. Eight cyclones affected the state in both 2003 and 2005, which were the years with the most tropical cyclones impacting the state. Every year included at least one tropical cyclone affecting the state.\\r\\nThe strongest hurricane to hit the state during the period was Hurricane Charley, which was the strongest hurricane to strike the United States since Hurricane Andrew. Additionally, hurricanes Ivan, Jeanne, Dennis, Wilma, and Irma made landfall on the state as major hurricanes.\\r\\nThe following major hurricanes either made landfall on the state as a major hurricane or brought winds of Category 3 status to the state. For storms that made landfall twice or more, the maximum sustained wind speed, and hence the highest Saffir-Simpson category, at the strongest landfall is listed. Only the landfalls at major hurricane intensity are listed. A * indicates that the storm made landfall outside Florida, but brought winds of major hurricane intensity to part of the state. Storms are listed since 1851, which is the official start of the Atlantic hurricane database.[2][3] Originally, hurricanes were classified by central pressure in the 20th century;[3][11] however, modern practices quantify storm intensities by maximum sustained winds.[12] United States hurricanes are still classified by central pressure from 1921ÿ1979;[3][11] therefore, the maximum sustained winds in the Atlantic hurricane database (HURDAT) are utilized for storms from 1921ÿ1979,[2] since this period has not been reanalyzed by the Atlantic hurricane reanalysis project.[13]\\r\\nThe following is a list of hurricanes with 100 or more deaths in the state.\\r\\nLazaro Gamio of the Washington Post created a series of maps depicting the paths of all hurricanes to impact Florida from 1916 to 2015.[14]","input":"How many hurricanes have made landfall in florida?"},{"output":"Peter Cox","context":"Go West are an English pop duo, formed in 1982 by lead vocalist Peter Cox and rhythm guitarist and backup vocalist Richard Drummie. The duo enjoyed their peak of popularity between the mid 1980s and the early 1990s and are best known for the international top 10 hits \\"We Close Our Eyes\\", \\"Call Me\\", and \\"King of Wishful Thinking\\". They were named Best British Newcomer at the 1986 Brit Awards.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nGo West had a publishing deal and possessed a portastudio, but lacked a band or recording company. Cox and Drummie decided, with support from John Glover, their manager, to find a musical producer, and record just two of their songs. The tracks \\"We Close Our Eyes\\" and \\"Call Me\\" found Go West landing a recording contract with Chrysalis Records. Upon confirmation of the Chrysalis deal, they recruited British guitarist Alan Murphy, whose contributions became a key ingredient in shaping the duo's musical identity.\\r\\nGo West's debut single, \\"We Close Our Eyes\\", was released in 1985 and reached No. 5 on the UK Singles Chart, No. 5 on the US Dance Club Play chart and No. 41 on the Billboard Hot 100. The video for the song, directed by Godley & Creme, became an early favourite on MTV. They were voted the \\"Best Newcomers\\" at the 1986 Brit Awards.[4] The song was part of the soundtrack for the Italian low-budget horror film Dmoni, also known as Demons. The single would prove to be their highest placed UK single, and only appearance in the UK top ten.\\r\\nThe duo's eponymous debut album was released in 1985. It included \\"We Close Our Eyes\\" and \\"Call Me\\" as well as \\"Don't Look Down\\", which served as the prequel to what would be their first top 40 hit in the US. The album itself was not only successful in the UK but also moderately so in the US. Bangs and Crashes, an album of remixes, B-sides and live tracks, was released in 1986, and included the track \\"One Way Street\\" which was part of the Rocky IV soundtrack. \\"Don't Be Afraid of Your Dreams\\" was in the film A Nightmare on Elm Street 4: The Dream Master during the closing credits.\\r\\nIn 1987, Go West released the proper follow-up to their debut, Dancing on the Couch, which made the UK top 20. Although several singles were released from the album, its success paled in comparison to the first album, particularly in the US. However, it yielded the band's first American top 40 hit with the single \\"Don't Look Down ÿ The Sequel\\", a continuation of the track \\"Don't Look Down\\" from the debut album. However, \\"Don't Look Down ÿ The Sequel\\" was not included on UK versions of the CD, which instead included the track \\"Let's Build a Boat\\".\\r\\nIn 1990, Go West scored a top 10 US hit with \\"King of Wishful Thinking\\" from the film Pretty Woman. The track was written by Cox and Drummie in collaboration with Martin Page. In 1991, the song received an ASCAP award for being one of the most played songs in America the previous year.\\r\\nIn 1992, the duo released the Indian Summer album, which included \\"Faithful\\", another hit in the US, peaking at No. 14, and also a UK hit, peaking at No. 13. This track later received airplay recognition awards in the US in both 1992 and 1993.\\r\\nIn 1997, Cox took a break from Go West to release his self-titled debut solo album. He has gone on to release several more solo albums into the 2000s.

The presidential aircraft is a prominent symbol of the American presidency and its power.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe idea of designating specific military aircraft to transport the President arose in 1943, when officials of the United States Army Air Forces, the predecessor to the U.S. Air Force, became concerned over the reliance on commercial airlines to transport the president. A C-87 Liberator Express was reconfigured for use as a presidential transport, but the Secret Service rejected it because of its safety record. A C-54 Skymaster was then converted for presidential use; this aircraft, dubbed the Sacred Cow, carried President Franklin D. Roosevelt to the Yalta Conference in February 1945 and was subsequently used for another two years by President Harry S. Truman.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe \\"Air Force One\\" call sign was created after a 1953 incident during which a Lockheed Constellation named Columbine II, carrying President Dwight D. Eisenhower, entered the same airspace as a commercial airline flight using the same flight number.[3][4][5]\\r\\n\\r\\nA number of aircraft types have been used as Air Force One since the creation of the presidential fleet, starting with two Lockheed Constellations in the late 1950s: Columbine II and Columbine III. It also operated two Boeing 707s, introduced in the 1960s and 1970s; since 1990, the presidential fleet has been two Boeing VC-25As, which are specifically configured, highly customized Boeing 747-200B series aircraft. The Air Force plans to procure the Boeing 747-8 for the next version of Air Force One.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 11 October 1910, Theodore Roosevelt became the first U.S. president to fly in an aircraft, an early Wright Flyer from Kinloch Field near St. Louis, Missouri.  He was no longer in office at the time, having been succeeded by William Howard Taft. The record-making occasion was a brief overflight of the crowd at a county fair but was nonetheless the beginning of presidential air travel.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nPrior to World War II, overseas and cross-country presidential travel was rare.  The lack of wireless telecommunication and available modes of transportation made long-distance travel impractical, as it took much time and isolated the president from events in Washington, D.C. Railroads were a safer and more reliable option if the president needed to travel to distant states. By the late 1930s, with the arrival of aircraft such as the Douglas DC-3, increasing numbers of the U.S. public saw passenger air travel as a reasonable mode of transportation. All-metal aircraft, more reliable engines, and new radio aids to navigation had made commercial airline travel safer and more convenient. Life insurance companies even began to offer airline pilots insurance policies, albeit at extravagant rates, and many commercial travelers and government officials began using the airlines in preference to rail travel, especially for longer trips.\\r\\n\\r\\nFranklin D. Roosevelt was the first president to fly in an aircraft while in office. The first aircraft obtained specifically for presidential travel was a Douglas Dolphin amphibian delivered in 1933 which was designated RD-2 by the US Navy and based at the Naval base at Anacostia D.C. The Dolphin was modified with luxury upholstery for four passengers and a small separate sleeping compartment.[7] The aircraft remained in service as a presidential transport from 1933 until 1939.[8] There are no reports, however, on whether the president actually flew in the aircraft. During World War II, Roosevelt traveled on the Dixie Clipper, a Pan Am-crewed Boeing 314 flying boat to the 1943 Casablanca Conference in Morocco, a flight that covered 5,500 miles (8,890?km) in three legs.[9] The threat from the German submarines throughout the Battle of the Atlantic made air travel the preferred method of VIP transatlantic transportation.[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nConcerned about relying upon commercial airlines to transport the president, USAAF leaders ordered the conversion of a military aircraft to accommodate the special needs of the Commander-in-Chief.[11] The first dedicated aircraft proposed for presidential use was a C-87A VIP transport aircraft. This aircraft, number 41-24159, was modified in 1943 for use as a presidential VIP transport, the Guess Where II, intended to carry President Franklin D. Roosevelt on international trips.[12]  Had it been accepted, it would have been the first aircraft to be used in presidential service, in effect the first Air Force One. However, after a review of the C-87's highly controversial safety record in service, the Secret Service flatly refused to approve the Guess Where II for presidential carriage.[12] As the C-87 was a derivative of the Consolidated B-24 Liberator bomber, it presented strong offensive impressions to enemy fighter aircraft as well as foreign destinations visited, an issue not present with airplanes that were used purely for transport. The Guess Where II was used to transport senior members of the Roosevelt administration on various trips. In March 1944, it transported Eleanor Roosevelt on a goodwill tour of several Latin American countries. The C-87 was scrapped in 1945.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Secret Service subsequently reconfigured a Douglas C-54 Skymaster for presidential transport duty. The VC-54C aircraft, nicknamed the Sacred Cow, included a sleeping area, radio telephone, and retractable elevator to lift Roosevelt in his wheelchair. As modified, the VC-54C was used by President Roosevelt only once before his death, on his trip to the Yalta Conference in February 1945.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nSacred Cow is now on display at the National Museum of the United States Air Force at Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter Roosevelt's death in April 1945, Vice President Harry S. Truman became president. The legislation that created the U.S. Air Force, the National Security Act of 1947, was signed by Truman while on board the VC-54C.[11] He replaced the VC-54C in 1947 with a modified C-118 Liftmaster, calling it the Independence (name of Truman's Missouri hometown). This was the first aircraft acting as Air Force One that had a distinctive exteriora bald eagle head painted on its nose.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe presidential call sign was established for security purposes during the administration of Dwight D. Eisenhower. The change stemmed from a 1953 incident where an Eastern Airlines commercial flight (8610) had the same call sign as the flight the president was on (Air Force 8610). The airliner accidentally entered the same airspace, and after the incident, the unique presidential aircraft call sign \\"Air Force One\\" was introduced. The first official flight using the call sign Air Force One was in 1959, during the Eisenhower administration.\\r\\n\\r\\nEisenhower introduced four propeller-driven aircraft to presidential service. This group included two Lockheed C-121 Constellations, the aircraft Columbine II (VC-121A 48-610)[13][14][15]the only primary presidential airplane ever soldand Columbine III (VC-121E 53-7885).[16]  They were named by First Lady Mamie Eisenhower after the columbine, the official state flower of her adopted home state of Colorado. Two Aero Commanders were added to the fleet and earned the distinction of being the smallest aircraft ever to serve as Air Force One. President Eisenhower also upgraded Air Force One's technology by adding an air-to-ground telephone and an air-to-ground teletype machine.\\r\\n\\r\\nToward the end of Eisenhower's term in 1958, the Air Force added three Boeing 707 jets (as VC-137s designated SAM 970, 971, and 972), into the fleet.[17] Eisenhower became the first president to use the VC-137 during his \\"Flight to Peace\\" Goodwill tour, from 3 December through 22 December 1959. He visited 11 Asian nations, flying 22,000 miles (35,000?km) in 19 days, about twice as fast as he could have covered that distance via one of the Columbines.\\r\\n\\r\\nUnder John F. Kennedy, presidential air travel entered the jet age.[18] He had used the Eisenhower-era jets for trips to Canada, France, Austria, and the United Kingdom.[19]  Then in October 1962, the U.S. Air Force purchased a Boeing C-137 Stratoliner, a modified long-range Boeing 707Special Air Mission (SAM) 26000.[20]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Air Force had designed a special presidential livery in red and metallic gold, with the nation's name in block letters. Kennedy felt the aircraft appeared too regal, and, on advice from his wife, First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy, he contacted the French-born American industrial designer Raymond Loewy for help in designing a new livery and interiors for the VC-137 jet.[2] Loewy met with the president, and his earliest research on the project took him to the National Archives, where he looked at the first printed copy of the United States Declaration of Independence; he saw the country's name set widely spaced and in upper case in Caslon typeface. He chose to expose the polished aluminum fuselage on the bottom side and used two blues ÿ slate-blue associated with the early republic and the presidency and a more contemporary cyan to represent the present and future. The presidential seal was added to both sides of the fuselage near the nose, a large American flag was painted on the tail, and the sides of the aircraft read \\"United States of America\\" in all capital letters. Loewy's work won immediate praise from the president and the press. The VC-137 markings were adapted for the larger VC-25 when it entered service in 1990.[21]\\r\\n\\r\\nSAM 26000 was in service from 1962 to 1998, serving Presidents Kennedy to Clinton. On 22 November 1963, SAM 26000 carried President Kennedy to Dallas, Texas, where it served as the backdrop as the Kennedys greeted well-wishers at Dallas's Love Field. Later that afternoon, Kennedy was assassinated, and Vice President Lyndon Johnson assumed the office of President and took the oath of office aboard SAM 26000. On Johnson's orders, the plane carried Kennedy's body back to Washington.[22]  A decade later, SAM 26000 took Johnson's body home to Texas after his state funeral in Washington.[23][24]\\r\\n\\r\\nJohnson used SAM 26000 to travel extensively domestically and to visit troops in South Vietnam during the Vietnam War. SAM 26000 served President Nixon on several groundbreaking overseas voyages, including his famous visit to the People's Republic of China in February 1972 and trip to the Soviet Union later that year, both firsts for an American president.[25] Nixon dubbed the plane the \\"Spirit of '76\\" in honor of the forthcoming bicentennial of the United States; that logo was painted on both sides of the plane's nose.[26]\\r\\n\\r\\nSAM 26000 is now on display at the National Museum of the United States Air Force at Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio.\\r\\n\\r\\nSAM 26000 was replaced in December 1972 by another VC-137, Special Air Mission 27000, although SAM 26000 was kept as a backup until it was finally retired in 1998.[27] Richard Nixon was the first president to use SAM 27000; the newer aircraft served every president until it was replaced by two VC-25 aircraft (SAM 28000 and 29000) in 1990.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn June 1974, while President Nixon was on his way to a scheduled stop in Syria, Syrian fighter jets intercepted Air Force One to act as escorts. However, the Air Force One crew was not informed in advance and, as a result, took evasive action including a dive.[28]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter announcing his intention to resign the presidency, Nixon boarded SAM 27000 (with call sign \\"Air Force One\\") to travel to California. Colonel Ralph Albertazzie, then pilot of Air Force One, recounted that after Gerald Ford was sworn in as president, the plane had to be redesignated as SAM 27000, indicating no president was on board the aircraft. Over Jefferson City, Missouri, Albertazzie radioed: \\"'Kansas City, this was Air Force One. Will you change our call sign to Sierra Alpha Mike (SAM) 27000?' Back came the reply: 'Roger, Sierra Alpha Mike 27000. Good luck to the President.'\\"[29]\\r\\n\\r\\nSAM 27000's last flight as Air Force One was on 29 August 2001 when it flew President George W. Bush from San Antonio to Waco, Texas. Following the flight, it was formally decommissioned, then flown to San Bernardino International Airport (former Norton AFB) in California.  It was dismantled and taken to the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in Simi Valley, where it was reassembled and is on permanent display.\\r\\n\\r\\nThough Ronald Reagan's two terms as president saw no major changes to Air Force One, the manufacture of the presidential aircraft version of the 747 began during his presidency. The USAF issued a Request For Proposal in 1985 for two wide-body aircraft with a minimum of three engines and an unrefueled range of 6,000 miles (9,700?km). Boeing with the 747 and McDonnell Douglas with the DC-10 submitted proposals, and the Reagan Administration ordered two identical 747s to replace the aging 707s he used.[30] The interior designs, drawn up by First Lady Nancy Reagan, were reminiscent of the American Southwest.[30] The first of two aircraft, designated VC-25A, was delivered in 1990, during the administration of George H. W. Bush. Delays were experienced to allow for additional work to protect the aircraft from electromagnetic pulse (EMP) effects.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe VC-25 is equipped with both secure and unsecure phone and computer communications systems, enabling the president to perform duties while airborne, in the event of an attack on the US.  The presidential air fleet is operated by the 89th Airlift Wing at Andrews Field, Maryland.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Air Force usually does not have fighter aircraft escort the presidential aircraft over the United States but it has occurred, for example during the attack on the World Trade Center.[28]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 11 September 2001, President George W. Bush was interrupted as he attended an event at Emma E. Booker Elementary School in Sarasota, Florida, after the attack on the World Trade Center South Tower in New York City. He took off on a VC-25 from Sarasota-Bradenton International Airport with Colonel Mark Tillman, the senior pilot of Air Force One that day, in charge. Air traffic controllers gave Air Force One an ominous warning that a passenger jet was close to Air Force One and was unresponsive to calls. Tillman recalls: \\"As we got over Gainesville, Florida, we got the word from Jacksonville Center. They said, 'Air Force One you have traffic behind you and basically above you that is descending into you, we are not in contact with them ÿ they have shut their responder [sic] off.' And at that time it kind of led us to believe maybe someone was coming into us in Sarasota, they saw us take off, they just stayed high and are following us at this point. We had no idea what the capabilities of the terrorists were at that point.\\"[31]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn response to this reported threat, Col. Tillman said he flew Air Force One over the Gulf of Mexico to test whether the other aircraft would follow. The other jet continued on its route, and Tillman said that it was later explained to him that an airliner had lost its transponder and that the pilots on-board neglected to switch to another radio frequency.  An aircraft transponder broadcasts an electronic identification signal.[31]  A threat came again when Tillman received a message warning of an imminent attack on Air Force One. \\"We got word from the vice president and the staff that 'Angel was next.' Angel being the classified call sign for Air Force One. Once we got into the Gulf [of Mexico] and they passed to us that 'Angel was next,' at that point I asked for fighter support.

Tillman explained that this was due to his concern that because of the reported threat, Air Force One would be attacked when he returned to Andrews Air Force Base.[31]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the preliminary stops, the president was returned to Washington. The next day, officials at the White House and the Justice Department explained that President Bush did this because there was \\"specific and credible information that the White House and Air Force One were also intended targets.\\"[32] The White House could not confirm evidence of a threat made against Air Force One, and investigation found the original claim to be a result of miscommunication.[33]\\r\\n\\r\\nPresidents have invited other world leaders to travel with them on Air Force One at times, including Nixon inviting Soviet Premier Leonid Brezhnev to travel with him to California from Washington, D.C. in June 1973.[34] In 1983, President Reagan and Queen Elizabeth II toured the U.S. West Coast aboard Air Force One.[35] In March 2012, President Obama took British Prime Minister David Cameron to a basketball game in Ohio aboard Air Force One.[36]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 27 April 2009, a low-flying VC-25 circled New York City for a photo-op and training exercise and caused a scare for many in New York.[37] Fallout from the photo op incident led to the resignation of the director of the White House Military Office.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen President Bush came to the end of his second term in 2009, a VC-25 was used to transport him to Texas. For this purpose the aircraft call sign was Special Air Mission 28000, as the aircraft did not carry the current President of the United States.

The U.S. Government Accountability Office estimated the total cost at $3.2 billion, and the U.S. Air Force's budget for the program is projected to be nearly $4 billion.  In December 2016, Boeing was on contract for preliminary development worth $170 million.[42][43][44]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 1 August 2017, Defense One reported that in an effort to pay less for the replacement program, the U.S. Air Force has contracted to purchase two of the bankrupt Russian airline Transaero's undelivered 747-8 Intercontinentals from Boeing, which is storing them in the Mojave Desert to prevent corrosion. These airplanes, which were flight-tested but never delivered, will be retrofitted with telecommunications and security equipment to bring them to the required security level for the presidential aircraft.[45][46]\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the Johnson Administration, the United States Air Force acquired a Beechcraft King Air B90 which was designated VC-6A.[47] The aircraft was used to transport President Johnson between Bergstrom Air Force Base and his family ranch near Johnson City, Texas,[48] and was used at least once to transport the President to Princeton, New Jersey.[49] It was referred to as Lady Bird's airplane and later in its service life featured a basic color scheme similar to civilian aircraft.[50] When the President was aboard, the aircraft used the call sign Air Force One.[49]\\r\\n\\r\\nUnited Airlines is the only commercial airline to have operated Executive One, the call sign given to a civilian flight on which the U.S. President is aboard. On 26 December 1973, President Richard Nixon and his family flew as commercial passengers on a United DC-10 from Washington Dulles to Los Angeles International Airport. His staff explained that this was done to conserve fuel by not having to fly the usual Boeing 707 Air Force aircraft.[51]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe President regularly flies in helicopters (call sign Marine One) operated by the U.S. Marine Corps.[52]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn November 1999, President Bill Clinton flew from Ankara, Turkey, to Cengiz Topel Naval Air Station outside Izmit, Turkey, aboard a marked C-20C (Gulfstream III) using the call sign \\"Air Force One\\", escorted by three F-16s.[53]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 8 March 2000, President Clinton flew to Pakistan aboard an unmarked Gulfstream III while another aircraft with the call sign \\"Air Force One\\" flew on the same route a few minutes later.

During the flight, the aircraft used the call sign of \\"Navy One\\" for the first time.  This aircraft is now on display at the National Naval Aviation Museum at Naval Air Station Pensacola, Florida.[57]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen required by circumstances, the President makes domestic flights using a Boeing C-32, sometimes to allow access to smaller airports that cannot support the larger VC-25.[58]\\r\\n\\r\\nSeveral presidential aircraft that have formerly served as Air Force One (Sacred Cow, Independence, Columbine III, SAM 26000, and other smaller presidential aircraft) are on display in the presidential hangar of the National Museum of the United States Air Force (located at Wright-Patterson AFB near Dayton, Ohio) and at the Museum of Flight in Seattle, Washington (earlier VC-137B SAM 970). The Boeing VC-137C that served as Air Force One from the Nixon years through the George H. W.

They deduced this by measuring how an alpha particle beam is scattered when it strikes a thin metal foil. The experiments were performed between 1908 and 1913 by Hans Geiger and Ernest Marsden under the direction of Ernest Rutherford at the Physical Laboratories of the University of Manchester.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe popular theory of atomic structure at the time of Rutherford's experiment was the \\"plum pudding model\\". This model was devised by Lord Kelvin and further developed by J. J. Thomson. Thomson was the scientist who discovered the electron, and that it was a component of every atom. Thomson believed the atom was a sphere of positive charge throughout which the electrons were distributed, a bit like plums in a Christmas pudding. The existence of protons and neutrons was unknown at this time. They knew atoms were very tiny (Rutherford assumed they were in the order of 10?8 m in radius[1]). This model was based entirely on classical (Newtonian) physics; the current accepted model uses quantum mechanics.\\r\\nThomson's model was not universally accepted even before Rutherford's experiments. Thomson himself was never able to develop a complete and stable model of his concept. A Japanese scientist named Hantaro Nagaoka rejected Thomson's model on the grounds that opposing charges cannot penetrate each other.[2] He proposed instead that electrons orbit the positive charge like the rings around Saturn.[3]\\r\\nAn alpha particle is a sub-microscopic, positively charged particle of matter. According to Thomson's model, if an alpha particle were to collide with an atom, it would just fly straight through, its path being deflected by at most a fraction of a degree. At the atomic scale, the concept of \\"solid matter\\" is meaningless, so the alpha particle would not bounce off the atom like a marble; it would be affected only by the atom's electric fields, and Thomson's model predicted that the electric fields in an atom are just too weak to affect a passing alpha particle much (alpha particles tend to move very fast). Both the negative and positive charges within the Thomson atom are spread out over the atom's entire volume. According to Coulomb's Law, the less concentrated a sphere of electric charge is, the weaker its electric field at its surface will be.[4][5]\\r\\nAs a worked example, consider an alpha particle passing tangentially to a Thomson gold atom, where it will experience the electric field at its strongest and thus experience the maximum deflection Ĳ. Since the electrons are very light compared to the alpha particle, their influence can be neglected[6] and the atom can be seen as a heavy sphere of positive charge.\\r\\nUsing classical physics, the alpha particle's lateral change in momentum p can be approximated using the impulse of force relationship and the Coulomb force expression:\\r\\nThe above calculation is but an approximation of what happens when an alpha particle comes near a Thomson atom, but it is clear that the deflection at most will be in the order of a small fraction of a degree. If the alpha particle were to pass through a gold foil some 400 atoms thick and experience maximal deflection in the same direction (unlikely), it would still be a small deflection.\\r\\nAt Rutherford's behest, Geiger and Marsden performed a series of experiments where they pointed a beam of alpha particles at a thin foil of metal and measured the scattering pattern by using a fluorescent screen. They spotted alpha particles bouncing off the metal foil in all directions, some right back at the source. This should have been impossible according to Thomson's model; the alpha particles should have all gone straight through. Obviously, those particles had encountered an electrostatic force far greater than Thomson's model suggested they would, which in turn implied that the atom's positive charge was concentrated in a much tinier volume than Thomson imagined.[7]\\r\\nWhen Geiger and Marsden shot alpha particles at their metal foils, they noticed only a tiny fraction of the alpha particles were deflected by more than 90. Most just flew straight through the foil. This suggested that those tiny spheres of intense positive charge were separated by vast gulfs of empty space.[7] Most particles passed through the empty space and experienced negligible deviation, while a handful struck the nuclei of the atoms and bounced right back.\\r\\nRutherford thus rejected Thomson's model of the atom, and instead proposed a model where the atom consisted of mostly empty space, with all its positive charge concentrated in its center in a very tiny volume, surrounded by a cloud of electrons.\\r\\nErnest Rutherford was Langsworthy Professor of Physics at the Victoria University of Manchester[8] (now the University of Manchester). He had already received numerous honors for his studies of radiation. He had discovered the existence of alpha rays, beta rays, and gamma rays, and had proved that these were the consequence of the disintegration of atoms. In 1906, he received a visit from a German physicist named Hans Geiger, and was so impressed that he asked Geiger to stay and help him with his research.[9] Ernest Marsden was a physics undergraduate student studying under Geiger.\\r\\nAlpha particles are tiny, positively charged particles that are spontaneously emitted by certain substances such as uranium and radium. Rutherford himself had discovered them in 1899. In 1908 he was trying to precisely measure their charge-to-mass ratio. To do this, he first needed to know just how many alpha particles his sample of radium was giving off (after which he would measure their total charge and divide one by the other). Alpha particles are too tiny to be seen even with a microscope, but Rutherford knew that alpha particles ionize air molecules, and if the air is within an electric field, the ions will produce an electric current. On this principle, Rutherford and Geiger designed a simple counting device which consisted of two electrodes in a glass tube. Every alpha particle that passed through the tube would create a pulse of electricity that could be counted. It was an early version of the Geiger counter.[9]\\r\\nThe counter that Geiger and Rutherford built proved unreliable because the alpha particles were being too strongly deflected by their collisions with the molecules of air within the detection chamber. The highly variable trajectories of the alpha particles meant that they did not all generate the same number of ions as they passed through the gas, thus producing erratic readings. This puzzled Rutherford because he had thought that alpha particles were just too heavy to be deflected so strongly. Rutherford asked Geiger to investigate just how much matter could scatter alpha rays.[10]\\r\\nThe experiments they designed involved bombarding a metal foil with alpha particles to observe how the foil scattered them in relation to their thickness and material. They used a fluorescent screen to measure the trajectories of the particles. Each impact of an alpha particle on the screen produced a tiny flash of light. Geiger worked in a darkened lab for hours on end, counting these tiny scintillations using a microscope.[5] Rutherford lacked the endurance for this work, which is why he left it to his younger colleagues.[11] For the metal foil, they tested a variety of metals, but they preferred gold because they could make the foil very thin, as gold is very malleable.[12] As a source of alpha particles, Rutherford's substance of choice was radium, a substance several million times more radioactive than uranium.\\r\\nA 1908 paper by Geiger, On the Scattering of ϫ-Particles by Matter,[13] describes the following experiment. He constructed a long glass tube, nearly two meters in length. At one end of the tube was a quantity of \\"radium emanation\\" (R) that served as a source of alpha particles. The opposite end of the tube was covered with a phosphorescent screen (Z). In the middle of the tube was a 0.9?mm-wide slit. The alpha particles from R passed through the slit and created a glowing patch of light on the screen. A microscope (M) was used to count the scintillations on the screen and measure their spread. Geiger pumped all the air out of the tube so that the alpha particles would be unobstructed, and they left a neat and tight image on the screen that corresponded to the shape of the slit. Geiger then allowed some air in the tube, and the glowing patch became more diffuse. Geiger then pumped out the air and placed some gold foil over the slit at AA. This too caused the patch of light on the screen to become more spread out. This experiment demonstrated that both air and solid matter could markedly scatter alpha particles. The apparatus, however, could only observe small angles of deflection. Rutherford wanted to know if the alpha particles were being scattered by even larger anglesperhaps larger than 90.\\r\\nIn a 1909 paper, On a Diffuse Reflection of the ϫ-Particles,[14] Geiger and Marsden described the experiment by which they proved that alpha particles can indeed be scattered by more than 90. In their experiment, they prepared a small conical glass tube (AB) containing \\"radium emanation\\" (radon), \\"radium A\\" (actual radium), and \\"radium C\\" (bismuth-214); its open end sealed with mica. This was their alpha particle emitter. They then set up a lead plate (P), behind which they placed a fluorescent screen (S). The tube was held on the opposite side of plate, such that the alpha particles it emitted could not directly strike the screen. They noticed a few scintillations on the screen, because some alpha particles got around the plate by bouncing off air molecules. They then placed a metal foil (R) to the side of the lead plate. They pointed the tube at the foil to see if the alpha particles would bounce off it and strike the screen on the other side of the plate, and observed an increase in the number of scintillations on the screen. Counting the scintillations, they observed that metals with higher atomic mass, such as gold, reflected more alpha particles than lighter ones such as aluminium.\\r\\nGeiger and Marsden then wanted to estimate the total number of alpha particles that were being reflected. The previous setup was unsuitable for doing this because the tube contained several radioactive substances (radium plus its decay products) and thus the alpha particles emitted had varying ranges, and because it was difficult for them to ascertain at what rate the tube was emitting alpha particles. This time, they placed a small quantity of radium C (bismuth-214) on the lead plate, which bounced off a platinum reflector (R) and onto the screen. They found that only a tiny fraction of the alpha particles that struck the reflector bounced onto the screen (in this case, 1 in 8000).[14]\\r\\nA 1910 paper[15] by Geiger, The Scattering of the ϫ-Particles by Matter, describes an experiment by which he sought to measure how the most probable angle through which an a-particle is deflected varies with the material it passes through, the thickness of said material, and the velocity of the alpha particles. He constructed an airtight glass tube from which the air was pumped out. At one end was a bulb (B) containing \\"radium emanation\\" (radon-222). By means of mercury, the radon in B was pumped up the narrow glass pipe whose end at A was plugged with mica. At the other end of the tube was a fluorescent zinc sulfide screen (S). The microscope which he used to count the scintillations on the screen was affixed to a vertical millimeter scale with a vernier, which allowed Geiger to precisely measure where the flashes of light appeared on the screen and thus calculate the particles' angles of deflection. The alpha particles emitted from A was narrowed to a beam by a small circular hole at D. Geiger placed a metal foil in the path of the rays at D and E to observe how the zone of flashes changed. He could also vary the velocity of the alpha particles by placing extra sheets of mica or aluminium at A.\\r\\nFrom the measurements he took, Geiger came to the following conclusions:\\r\\n\\r\\nConsidering the results of the above experiments, Rutherford published a landmark paper in 1911 titled \\"The Scattering of ϫ and  Particles by Matter and the Structure of the Atom\\" wherein he proposed that the atom contains at its center a volume of electric charge that is very small and intense (in fact, Rutherford treats it as a point charge in his calculations).[1] For the purpose of his mathematical calculations he assumed this central charge was positive, but he admitted he could not prove this and that he had to wait for other experiments to develop his theory.\\r\\nRutherford developed a mathematical equation that modeled how the foil should scatter the alpha particles if all the positive charge and most of the atomic mass was concentrated in a single point at the center of an atom.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\ns\\r\\n=\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nX\\r\\nn\\r\\nt\\r\\n\\r\\ncsc\\r\\n\\r\\n4\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n(\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n?\\r\\n2\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n)\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n16\\r\\n\\r\\nr\\r\\n\\r\\n2\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n(\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n2\\r\\n\\r\\nQ\\r\\n\\r\\nn\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nQ\\r\\n\\r\\nϫ\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nm\\r\\n\\r\\nv\\r\\n\\r\\n2\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n)\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n2\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n{\\\\displaystyle s={\\\\frac {Xnt\\\\csc ^{4}{\\\\!\\\\left({\\\\tfrac {\\\\phi }{2}}\\\\right)}}{16r^{2}}}\\\\cdot {\\\\left({\\\\frac {2Q_{n}Q_{\\\\alpha }}{mv^{2}}}\\\\right)}^{2}}\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom the scattering data, Rutherford estimated the central charge Qn to be about +100 units (see Rutherford model)\\r\\nIn a 1913 paper, The Laws of Deflexion of ϫ Particles through Large Angles,[16] Geiger and Marsden describe a series of experiments by which they sought to experimentally verify the above equation that Rutherford developed. Rutherford's equation predicted that the number of scintillations per minute s that will be observed at a given angle  should be proportional to:\\r\\nTheir 1913 paper describes four experiments by which they proved each of these four relationships.\\r\\nTo test how the scattering varied with the angle of deflection (i.e. if s Q csc4(/2)) Geiger and Marsden built an apparatus that consisted of a hollow metal cylinder mounted on a turntable. Inside the cylinder was a metal foil (F) and a radiation source containing radon (R), mounted on a detached column (T) which allowed the cylinder to rotate independently. The column was also a tube by which air was pumped out of the cylinder. A microscope (M) with its objective lens covered by a fluorescent zinc sulfide screen (S) penetrated the wall of the cylinder and pointed at the metal foil. By turning the table, the microscope could be moved a full circle around the foil, allowing Geiger to observe and count alpha particles deflected by up to 150. Correcting for experimental error, Geiger and Marsden found that the number of alpha particles that are deflected by a given angle  is indeed proportional to csc4(/2).[16]\\r\\nGeiger and Marsden then tested how the scattering varied with the thickness of the foil (i.e. if s Q t). They constructed a disc (S) with six holes drilled in it. The holes were covered with metal foil (F) of varying thickness, or none for control. This disc was then sealed in a brass ring (A) between two glass plates (B and C). The disc could be rotated by means of a rod (P) to bring each window in front of the alpha particle source (R). On the rear glass pane was a zinc sulfide screen (Z). Geiger and Marsden found that the number of scintillations that appeared on the zinc sulfide screen was indeed proportional to the thickness as long as said thickness was small.[16]\\r\\nGeiger and Marsden reused the above apparatus to measure how the scattering pattern varied with the square of the nuclear charge (i.e. if s Q Qn2). Geiger and Marsden didn't know what the positive charge of the nucleus of their metals were (they had only just discovered the nucleus existed at all), but they assumed it was proportional to the atomic weight, so they tested whether the scattering was proportional to the atomic weight squared. Geiger and Marsden covered the holes of the disc with foils of gold, tin, silver, copper, and aluminum. They measured each foil's stopping power by equating it to an equivalent thickness of air. They counted the number of scintillations per minute that each foil produced on the screen. They divided the number of scintillations per minute by the respective foil's air equivalent, then divided again by the square root of the atomic weight (Geiger and Marsden knew that for foils of equal stopping power, the number of atoms per unit area is proportional to the square root of the atomic weight). Thus, for each metal, Geiger and Marsden obtained the number of scintillations that a fixed number of atoms produce. For each metal, they then divided this number by the square of the atomic weight, and found that the ratios were more or less the same. Thus they proved that s Q Qn2.[16]\\r\\nFinally, Geiger and Marsden tested how the scattering varied with the velocity of the alpha particles (i.e. if s Q 1/v4). Using the same apparatus again, they slowed the alpha particles by placing extra sheets of mica in front of the alpha particle source. They found that, within the range of experimental error, that the number of scinitillations was indeed proportional to 1/v4.[16]\\r\\nIn his 1911 paper (see above), Rutherford assumed that the central charge of the atom was positive, but a negative charge would have fitted his scattering model just as well.[17] In a 1913 paper,[18] Rutherford declared that the \\"nucleus\\" (as he now called it) was indeed positively charged, based on the result of experiments exploring the scattering of alpha particles in various gases.\\r\\nIn 1917, Rutherford and his assistant William Kay began exploring the passage of alpha particles through gases such as hydrogen and nitrogen. In an experiment where they shot a beam of alpha particles through hydrogen, the alpha particles knocked the hydrogen nuclei forwards in the direction of the beam, not backwards. In an experiment where they shot alpha particles through nitrogen, he discovered that the alpha particles knocked hydrogen nuclei (i.e. protons) out of the nitrogen nuclei.[17]\\r\\nWhen Geiger reported to Rutherford that he had spotted alpha particles being strongly deflected, Rutherford was astounded. In a lecture Rutherford delivered at Cambridge University, he said:\\r\\nIt was quite the most incredible event that has ever happened to me in my life. It was almost as incredible as if you fired a 15-inch shell at a piece of tissue paper and it came back and hit you. On consideration, I realized that this scattering backward must be the result of a single collision, and when I made calculations I saw that it was impossible to get anything of that order of magnitude unless you took a system in which the greater part of the mass of the atom was concentrated in a minute nucleus. It was then that I had the idea of an atom with a minute massive centre, carrying a charge.\\r\\nAccolades soon flooded in. Hantaro Nagaoka, who had once proposed a Saturnian model of the atom, wrote to Rutherford from Tokyo in 1911: \\"Congratulations on the simpleness of the apparatus you employ and the brilliant results you obtained\\". The conclusions of these experiments revealed how all matter on Earth is structured and thus affected every scientific and engineering discipline, making it one of the most pivotal scientific discoveries of all time. The astronomer Arthur Eddington called Rutherford's discovery the most important scientific achievement since Democritus proposed the atom ages earlier.[11]\\r\\nLike most scientific models, Rutherford's atomic model was neither perfect nor complete. According to classical Newtonian physics, it was in fact impossible. Accelerating charged particles radiate electromagnetic waves, so an electron orbiting an atomic nucleus in theory would spiral into the nucleus as it loses energy. To fix this problem, scientists had to incorporate quantum mechanics into Rutherford's model.","input":"When did the gold foil experiment take place?"},{"output":"Octopussy and The Living Daylights","context":"The James Bond literary franchise is a series of novels and short stories, first published in 1953 by Ian Fleming, a British author, journalist, and former naval intelligence officer. James Bond, often referred to by his code name, 007, is a British Secret Service agent; the character was created by journalist and author Ian Fleming, and first appeared in his 1953 novel Casino Royale; the books are set in a contemporary period, between May 1951 and February 1964. Fleming went on to write a total of twelve novels and two collections of short stories, all written at his Jamaican home Goldeneye and published annually. Two of his books were published after his death in 1964.\\r\\nSince Fleming's death a number of other authors have written continuation works. Some of these have been novelizations of episodes in the series of Bond films, produced by Eon Productions, while others were either continuation novels or short stories. The first author was Kingsley Amis, writing under the pseudonym of \\"Robert Markham\\" who produced one novel; then came novelist and biographer John Pearson who wrote a fictional biography of Bond. Novelist and screenwriter Christopher Wood wrote two novelizations in the late 1970s. Writer John Gardner was asked to continue the series by copyright holders Ian Fleming Publications and, between 1981 and 1996, he wrote fourteen novels and two novelizations. After Gardner retired due to ill health, American author Raymond Benson continued the stories and wrote six Bond novels, three novelizations and three short stories between 1996 and 2002.\\r\\nThere was a hiatus of six years before Sebastian Faulks was commissioned to write a further Bond novel, which was released on 28 May 2008, the 100th anniversary of Ian Fleming's birth. This was followed in 2011 by a novel by American author Jeffery Deaver, a 2013 book by William Boyd and a further instalment in September 2015 by Anthony Horowitz, with a second Horowitz novel announced for publication in May 2018. There have also been two Fleming estate-sanctioned spin-off series of books: Young Bond, based around Bond's adventures whilst a schoolboy at Eton College, and The Moneypenny Diaries, a series of books and short stories focusing on the supporting character Miss Moneypenny.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring World War II Fleming had mentioned to friends that he wanted to write a spy novel,[1] but it was not until 17 February 1952 that he began to write his first novel, Casino Royale. He started writing his book at his Jamaican home Goldeneye, typing out 2,000 words in the morning, directly from his own experiences and imagination;[2] he finished work on the manuscript in just over two months,[3] completing it on 18 March 1952.[4] Publishers Jonathan Cape were initially reluctant to publish the book, but were persuaded by Fleming's brother Peter (1907ÿ1971), who had previously published material through them.[5] On 13 April 1953 Casino Royale was released in the UK in hardcover, priced at 10s, 6d,[6] with a cover that had been devised by Fleming himself.[7] The first edition of 4,728 copies of Casino Royale sold out in less than a month;[7] a second print run the same month also sold out,[6] as did a third run of more than 8,000 books published in May 1954.[8] At the time, Fleming was the Foreign Manager for Kemsley Newspapers, an organisation which owned The Sunday Times. Upon accepting the job, Fleming requested that he be allowed three months' holiday per year, which allowed him the freedom to write.[1]\\r\\nThe novel centred on the exploits of James Bond, an intelligence officer in the 00 section of the Secret Intelligence Service, commonly known as MI6. Bond was also known by his code number, 007, and was a Royal Naval Reserve Commander. Fleming took the name for his character from that of the American ornithologist James Bond, a Caribbean bird expert and author of the definitive field guide Birds of the West Indies.[9] Fleming based his creation on a number of individuals he came across during his time in the Naval Intelligence Division during World War II, admitting that Bond \\"was a compound of all the secret agents and commando types I met during the war\\".[10] After the publication of Casino Royale, Fleming used his annual holiday at his house in Jamaica to write another Bond story;[1] in total, between 1953 and 1966, two years after his death, twelve Bond novels and two short-story collections were published, with the last two booksThe Man with the Golden Gun and Octopussy and The Living Daylightspublished posthumously.[11]\\r\\n\\"Octopussy\\" Bond tracks down a World War II hero who had murdered his friend to steal a cache of Nazi gold.\\r\\n\\"The Living Daylights\\" Bond is assigned sniper duty, but when he sees the sniper is a beautiful woman, he shoots the butt of her rifle instead of killing her.\\r\\n\\"The Property of a Lady\\" Bond visits Sotheby's to identify a KGB agent.\\r\\n\\"007 in New York\\" Bond warns a female MI6 employee that her new boyfriend is a KGB agent.\\r\\nIn the summer of 1958, the CBS television network commissioned Fleming to write episodes of a television show based on the James Bond character. This deal came about after the success of the 1954 television adaptation of Casino Royale as an episode of the CBS television series Climax![26] Fleming agreed to the deal, and began to write outlines for the series; however, CBS later dropped the idea.[27] In January and February 1959 Fleming adapted four of the television plots into short stories and added a fifth story he had written in the summer of 1958.[28] The stories were originally titled The Rough with the Smooth, although this was changed to For Your Eyes Only for publication, which included the subtitle Five Secret Occasions in the Life of James Bond.[26]\\r\\nAfter Fleming's death, a second collection featuring two short stories was released, Octopussy and The Living Daylights.[29] When the paperback edition of the book was published, \\"The Property of a Lady\\" was also included[30] and, by 2002, \\"007 in New York\\" had been added to the book by Penguin Books.[31]\\r\\nIndependent scholar John Griswold constructed a \\"high-level chronology of James Bond's life\\", based on the logic of depicted events and actual time periods referred to in the books.[43][nb 4] This chronology differs from the publication sequence.[44] Griswold also deliberately discounts the chronological significance of actual historic events mentioned in the novels and stories, arguing that Fleming made such references for effect without synchronising them accurately to his fiction.[45] Fellow Bond-scholar Henry Chancellor also worked through the Bond chronology, which broadly agrees with Griswold, although there are differences. Chancellor noted that \\"Fleming was always vague about dates\\", although the novels are supposed to be set in order of publication.[46]\\r\\nFollowing Fleming's death in 1964, Glidrose Productions, publishers of the James Bond novels and since renamed Ian Fleming Publications, approached author James Leasor to write a continuation novel, but he declined.[50] Glidrose then commissioned Kingsley Amis, who, under the pseudonym of \\"Robert Markham\\", wrote Colonel Sun, which was published on 28 March 1968.[30]\\r\\nIn 1973, Glidrose permitted publication of John Pearson's fictional biography of Bond entitled James Bond: The Authorized Biography of 007. This book, written in the first person, posits that Bond was a real person about whom Ian Fleming wrote a series of adventures. This is the only Bond work where the author shares copyright with Glidrose.\\r\\nIn 1977, the Eon Productions film The Spy Who Loved Me was released and, due to the radical differences between the film and the original novel of the same name, Eon productions authorised a novelization, James Bond, The Spy Who Loved Me. The 1979 film Moonraker, which other than the villain's name also substantially diverged from the original source novel, was also produced in novel form, as James Bond and Moonraker; both books were written by screenwriter Christopher Wood.[51]\\r\\nIn the 1980s, the Bond series was initially revived with new novels by John Gardner, although initially he almost turned the series down.[55] Between 1981 and 1996, Gardner went on to write sixteen Bond books in total; two of the books he wrote ÿ Licence to Kill and GoldenEye ÿ were novelizations of Eon Productions films of the same name. Gardner stated that he wanted \\"to bring Mr Bond into the 1980s\\",[56] although he retained the ages of the characters as they were when Fleming had left them.[57] Even though Gardner kept the ages the same, he made Bond grey at the temples as a nod to the passing of the years.[58] In 1996, Gardner retired from writing James Bond books due to ill health.[59] With the influence of the American publishers, Putnam's, the Gardner novels showed an increase in the number of Americanisms used in the book, such as a waiter wearing \\"pants\\", rather than trousers, in The Man from Barbarossa.[60] James Harker, writing in The Guardian, considered that the Gardner books were \\"dogged by silliness\\",[60] giving examples of Scorpius, where much of the action is set in Chippenham, and Win, Lose or Die, where \\"Bond gets chummy with an unconvincing Maggie Thatcher\\".[60]\\r\\nIn 1996, American author Raymond Benson became the writer of the Bond novels. Benson had previously written The James Bond Bedside Companion, first published in 1984,[76] and had also written scenarios and support material for the early 1980s 007 James Bond dice-and-paper role playing game. By the time he moved on to other, non-Bond related projects in 2002, Benson had written six Bond novels, three novelizations and three short stories.[77] Benson followed Gardner's pattern of setting Bond in the contemporary timeframe of the 1990s[78] and, according to academic Jeremy Black, had more echoes of Fleming's style than John Gardner.[79]\\r\\nBenson also changed Bond's gun back to the Walther PPK,[80] put him behind the wheel of a Jaguar XK8[81] and made him swear more,[82] which led Black to note that there was an increased level of crudity lacking in either Fleming or Gardner.[79] However, commenting in The Australian, Peter Janson-Smith, Fleming's former literary agent, noted that Benson \\"has got the Fleming feel?... It's as close to Fleming as I have seen.\\"[83] The Peterborough Evening Telegraph agreed, stating that with Benson's 007, in keeping more with Fleming, \\"PC-ness goes out the window and it's a more ruthless Bond with bad habits.\\"[84] The Sunday Mercury in 1999 said, \\"Benson has made Bond less gimmicky, concentrating on the action rather than the gadgets. The result is a slick enough read for dedicated Bond fans who like blazing guns (Walthers, of course) and beautiful women\\"[85] and Kirkus Reviews called Benson's 007 \\"a chip off the old block and, if not a gilt-edged Bond, at least a double-A.\\"[86]\\r\\nGlidrose twice approached Lee Child, author of the Jack Reacher novels, about writing a Bond novel but he turned them down.[95] Ian Fleming Publications then commissioned Sebastian Faulks to write a continuation novel, which was released on 28 May 2008, the 100th anniversary of Ian Fleming's birth.[96] The booktitled Devil May Carewas published in the UK by Penguin Books and by Doubleday in the US.[97] Faulks ignored the timeframe established by Gardner and Benson and instead reverted to that used by Fleming and Amis, basing his novel in the 1960s;[78] he also managed to use a number of the cultural touchstones of the sixties in the book.[98] Faulks was true to Bond's original character and background too, and provided \\"a Flemingesque hero\\"[78] who drove a battleship grey 1967 T-series Bentley.[81]\\r\\nThe American writer Jeffery Deaver was then commissioned by Ian Fleming Publications to produce Carte Blanche, which was published on 26 May 2011.[99] The book updated Bond working for a post-9/11 agency, independent of MI5 or MI6.[100] On 26 September 2013 the novel Solo, by William Boyd was published in the UK and by HarperCollins in Canada and the US; the book was once again set in the 1960s.[101][102] In October 2014 it was announced that Anthony Horowitz was to write a further Bond instalment. The novel, titled Trigger Mortis, is set in the 1950s, and it contains material written, but previously unreleased, by Fleming.[103] In February 2018, it was announced that a second Horowitz novel, again building upon unpublished Fleming and this time a prequel to Casino Royale, titled Forever and a Day would be published by Jonathan Cape on 31 May 2018.[104]\\r\\nThe Young Bond series of novels was started by Charlie Higson[109] and, between 2005 and 2009, five novels and one short story were published.[110] The first Young Bond novel, SilverFin was also adapted and released as a graphic novel on 2 October 2008 by Puffin Books.[111] Comic book artist Kev Walker illustrated Higson's novel.[112] Young Bond is set in the 1930s, which would fit the chronology with that of Fleming.[113]\\r\\nCharlie Higson[114]\\r\\nHigson stated that he was instructed by the Fleming estate to ignore all other interpretations of Bond, except the original Fleming version.[115] As the background to Bond's childhood, Higson used Bond's obituary in You Only Live Twice as well as his own and Fleming's childhoods.[116] In forming the early Bond character, Higson created the origins of some of Bond's character traits, including his love of cars and fine wine.[115]\\r\\nIn October 2013 Ian Fleming Publications announced that Stephen Cole would continue the series, with the first edition scheduled to be released in Autumn 2014.[117] The title was later confirmed as Shoot to Kill with a release date of 6 November 2014, and it was further confirmed that Cole would be credited as Steve Cole for the release.[118]","input":"What was ian fleming's last bond book?"},{"output":"mandelbrot is slightly softer than biscotti due to its higher oil and/or butter content.","context":"Mandelbrot (Yiddish: ?????????????),[1][2][3] with a number of variant spellings,[A] and called mandel bread in English-speaking countries and kamishbrot in Ukraine, is a Jewish cookie popular amongst Eastern European Jews. The Yiddish word mandelbrot literally means almond bread, a reference to its common ingredient of almonds. It is typically formed by baking a loaf which is then cut into small slabs and twice-baked in order to form a crunchy exterior. The cookies were popular in Eastern Europe among rabbis, merchants and other itinerant Jews as a staple dessert that kept well.[4]\\r\\nIts precise origin is unknown, as is its historic relationship with biscotti, a similar Italian cookie. While mandelbrot and biscotti both have a crunchy exterior, mandelbrot is slightly softer than biscotti due to its higher oil and/or butter content.\\r\\nAdditional ingredients vary between bakers, but common additions include almonds, walnuts, cinnamon, chocolate chips or diced candied fruit. Mandelbrot is called kamishbrot in Ukraine, and the two terms are often used interchangeably in the United States.[5]","input":"What is the difference between mandelbrot and biscotti?"},{"output":"Cumberland River","context":"The Cumberland River is a major waterway of the Southern United States. The 688-mile-long (1,107?km)[2] river drains almost 18,000 square miles (47,000?km2) of southern Kentucky and north-central Tennessee. The river flows generally west from a source in the Appalachian Mountains to its confluence with the Ohio River near Paducah, Kentucky, and the mouth of the Tennessee River. Major tributaries include the Obey, Caney Fork, Stones, and Red rivers.\\r\\nAlthough the Cumberland River basin is predominantly rural, there are also some large cities on the river, including Nashville and Clarksville, both in Tennessee. In addition, the river system has been extensively developed for flood control, with major dams impounding both the main stem and many of its important tributaries.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIts headwaters are three separate forks that begin in Kentucky and converge in Baxter, KY, located in Harlan County. Martin's Fork starts near Hensley Settlement on Brush Mountain in Bell County and snakes its way north through the mountains to Baxter. Clover Fork starts on Black Mountain in Holmes Mill, near the Virginia border, and flows west in parallel with Kentucky Route 38 until it reaches Harlan. Clover Fork once flowed through downtown Harlan and merged with Martins Fork at the intersection of Kentucky Route 38 and US Route 421 until a flood control project began in 1992 diverted it through a tunnel under Little Black Mountain from which it emerges in Baxter and converges with Martins Fork. Poor Fork begins as a small stream on Pine Mountain in Letcher County near Flat Gap, Virginia. It flows southwest in parallel with Pine Mountain until it merges with the other two forks in Baxter.\\r\\nFrom there, the wider, now named Cumberland River continues flowing west through the mountains of Kentucky before turning northward toward Cumberland Falls. The 68-foot (21?m) falls is one of the largest waterfalls in the southeastern United States and is one of the few places in the Western Hemisphere where a moonbow can be seen.[5]\\r\\nBeyond Cumberland Falls, the river turns abruptly west once again and continues to grow as it converges with other creeks and streams. It receives the Laurel and Rockcastle rivers from the northeast and then the Big South Fork of the Cumberland River from the south. From here it flows into the man-made Lake Cumberland, formed by Wolf Creek Dam. The more than 100-mile (160?km) reservoir is one of the largest artificial lakes in the eastern US.\\r\\nNear Celina, the river crosses south into Tennessee, where it is joined by the Obey River and Caney Fork. Northeast of Nashville, the river is dammed twice more, forming Cordell Hull Lake and Old Hickory Lake. After flowing through Nashville and picking up the Stones River, the river is dammed to form Cheatham Lake. The river turns northwest toward Clarksville, where it is joined by the Red River, and then flows back into Kentucky at the Land Between the Lakes National Recreation Area, a section of land nestled between Lake Barkley, which is fed by the Cumberland River, and Kentucky Lake. Finally, the river flows north and merges with the Ohio River at Smithland, northeast of Paducah.\\r\\nThe explorer Thomas Walker of Virginia in 1758 named the river, but whether for the Duke of Cumberland or the English county of Cumberland is not known.[6]\\r\\nThe Cumberland River was called Wasioto by the Shawnee Native Americans, who lived in this area. French traders called it the Riviere des Chaouanons, or \\"River of the Shawnee\\" for this association. The river was also known as the Shawnee River (or Shawanoe River) for years after Walker's trip.[1]\\r\\nImportant first as a passage for hunters and settlers, the Cumberland River also supported later riverboat trade, which traveled to the Ohio and Mississippi rivers. Villages, towns, and cities were located at landing points along its banks. Through the middle of the 19th century, settlers depended on rivers as the primary transportation routes for trading and travel.\\r\\nIn more recent history, a number of severe floods have struck various regions that the river flows through. In April 1977, Harlan, Kentucky, and many surrounding communities were inundated with floodwaters, destroying most of the homes and businesses within the floodplain of the river. This event led to the building of the Martins Fork Dam for flood control and the diversion of the Clover Fork around the city of Harlan. In addition, the river was diverted through a mountain cut in Loyall, Kentucky.\\r\\nIn late April and early May 2010, due to the 2010 Tennessee floods, the river overflowed its banks and flooded Nashville and Clarksville, Tennessee. The downtown area was ordered to evacuate.[7]","input":"What is the river that runs through nashville tn?"},{"output":"Enzyme assays","context":"Enzyme assays are laboratory methods for measuring enzymatic activity. They are vital for the study of enzyme kinetics and enzyme inhibition.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe quantity or concentration of an enzyme can be expressed in molar amounts, as with any other chemical, or in terms of activity in enzyme units.\\r\\n\\r\\nEnzyme activity = moles of substrate converted per unit time = rate G reaction volume. Enzyme activity is a measure of the quantity of active enzyme present and is thus dependent on conditions, which should be specified. The SI unit is the katal, 1 katal = 1?mol s?1, but this is an excessively large unit. A more practical and commonly used value is enzyme unit (U) = 1 mol min?1. 1 U corresponds to 16.67 nanokatals.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nEnzyme activity as given in katal generally refers to that of the assumed natural target substrate of the enzyme. Enzyme activity can also be given as that of certain standardized substrates, such as gelatin, then measured in gelatin digesting units (GDU), or milk proteins, then measured in milk clotting units (MCU). The units GDU and MCU are based on how fast one gram of the enzyme will digest gelatin or milk proteins, respectively. 1 GDU equals approximately 1.5 MCU.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nAn increased amount of substrate will increase the rate of reaction with enzymes, however once past a certain point, the rate of reaction will level out because the amount of active sites available has stayed constant.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe specific activity of an enzyme is another common unit. This is the activity of an enzyme per milligram of total protein (expressed in mol min?1mg?1). Specific activity gives a measurement of enzyme purity in the mixture. It is the micro moles of product formed by an enzyme in a given amount of time (minutes) under given conditions per milligram of total proteins. Specific activity is equal to the rate of reaction multiplied by the volume of reaction divided by the mass of total protein. The SI unit is katal kg?1, but a more practical unit is mol mg?1 min?1. Specific activity is a measure of enzyme processivity, at a specific (usually saturating) substrate concentration, and is usually constant for a pure enzyme. For elimination of errors arising from differences in cultivation batches and/or misfolded enzyme etc. an active site titration needs to be done. This is a measure of the amount of active enzyme, calculated by e.g. titrating the amount of active sites present by employing an irreversible inhibitor. The specific activity should then be expressed as mol min?1 mg?1 active enzyme. If the molecular weight of the enzyme is known, the turnover number, or mol product per second per mol of active enzyme, can be calculated from the specific activity. The turnover number can be visualized as the number of times each enzyme molecule carries out its catalytic cycle per second.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe rate of a reaction is the concentration of substrate disappearing (or product produced) per unit time (mol L?1 s?1).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe % purity is 100% G (specific activity of enzyme sample / specific activity of pure enzyme). The impure sample has lower specific activity because some of the mass is not actually enzyme. If the specific activity of 100% pure enzyme is known, then an impure sample will have a lower specific activity, allowing purity to be calculated.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll enzyme assays measure either the consumption of substrate or production of product over time. A large number of different methods of measuring the concentrations of substrates and products exist and many enzymes can be assayed in several different ways. Biochemists usually study enzyme-catalysed reactions using four types of experiments:[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nEnzyme assays can be split into two groups according to their sampling method: continuous assays, where the assay gives a continuous reading of activity, and discontinuous assays, where samples are taken, the reaction stopped and then the concentration of substrates/products determined.\\r\\n\\r\\nContinuous assays are most convenient, with one assay giving the rate of reaction with no further work necessary. There are many different types of continuous assays.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn spectrophotometric assays, you follow the course of the reaction by measuring a change in how much light the assay solution absorbs. If this light is in the visible region you can actually see a change in the color of the assay, and these are called colorimetric assays. The MTT assay, a redox assay using a tetrazolium dye as substrate is an example of a colorimetric assay.\\r\\n\\r\\nUV light is often used, since the common coenzymes NADH and NADPH absorb UV light in their reduced forms, but do not in their oxidized forms. An oxidoreductase using NADH as a substrate could therefore be assayed by following the decrease in UV absorbance at a wavelength of 340?nm as it consumes the coenzyme.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nDirect versus coupled assays\\r\\n\\r\\nEven when the enzyme reaction does not result in a change in the absorbance of light, it can still be possible to use a spectrophotometric assay for the enzyme by using a coupled assay. Here, the product of one reaction is used as the substrate of another, easily detectable reaction. For example, figure 1 shows the coupled assay for the enzyme hexokinase, which can be assayed by coupling its production of glucose-6-phosphate to NADPH production, using glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase.\\r\\n\\r\\nFluorescence is when a molecule emits light of one wavelength after absorbing light of a different wavelength. Fluorometric assays use a difference in the fluorescence of substrate from product to measure the enzyme reaction. These assays are in general much more sensitive than spectrophotometric assays, but can suffer from interference caused by impurities and the instability of many fluorescent compounds when exposed to light.\\r\\n\\r\\nAn example of these assays is again the use of the nucleotide coenzymes NADH and NADPH. Here, the reduced forms are fluorescent and the oxidised forms non-fluorescent. Oxidation reactions can therefore be followed by a decrease in fluorescence and reduction reactions by an increase.[5] Synthetic substrates that release a fluorescent dye in an enzyme-catalyzed reaction are also available, such as 4-methylumbelliferyl--D-galactoside for assaying -galactosidase.\\r\\n\\r\\nCalorimetry is the measurement of the heat released or absorbed by chemical reactions. These assays are very general, since many reactions involve some change in heat and with use of a microcalorimeter, not much enzyme or substrate is required. These assays can be used to measure reactions that are impossible to assay in any other way.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nChemiluminescence is the emission of light by a chemical reaction. Some enzyme reactions produce light and this can be measured to detect product formation. These types of assay can be extremely sensitive, since the light produced can be captured by photographic film over days or weeks, but can be hard to quantify, because not all the light released by a reaction will be detected.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe detection of horseradish peroxidase by enzymatic chemiluminescence (ECL) is a common method of detecting antibodies in western blotting. Another example is the enzyme luciferase, this is found in fireflies and naturally produces light from its substrate luciferin.\\r\\n\\r\\nStatic light scattering measures the product of weight-averaged molar mass and concentration of macromolecules in solution. Given a fixed total concentration of one or more species over the measurement time, the scattering signal is a direct measure of the weight-averaged molar mass of the solution, which will vary as complexes form or dissociate.\\r\\nHence the measurement quantifies the stoichiometry of the complexes as well as kinetics. Light scattering assays of protein kinetics is a very general technique that does not require an enzyme.\\r\\n\\r\\nMicroscale thermophoresis (MST)[7] measures the size, charge and hydration entropy of molecules/substrates at equilibrium.[8] The thermophoretic movement of a fluorescently labeled substrate changes significantly as it is modified by an enzyme. This enzymatic activity can be measured with high time resolution in real time.[9] The material consumption of the all optical MST method is very low, only 5 l sample volume and 10nM enzyme concentration are needed to measure the enzymatic rate constants for activity and inhibition. MST allows analysts to measure the modification of two different substrates at once (multiplexing) if both substrates are labeled with different fluorophores. Thus substrate competition experiments can be performed.\\r\\n\\r\\nDiscontinuous assays are when samples are taken from an enzyme reaction at intervals and the amount of product production or substrate consumption is measured in these samples.\\r\\n\\r\\nRadiometric assays measure the incorporation of radioactivity into substrates or its release from substrates. The radioactive isotopes most frequently used in these assays are 14C, 32P, 35S and 125I. Since radioactive isotopes can allow the specific labelling of a single atom of a substrate, these assays are both extremely sensitive and specific. They are frequently used in biochemistry and are often the only way of measuring a specific reaction in crude extracts (the complex mixtures of enzymes produced when you lyse cells).\\r\\n\\r\\nRadioactivity is usually measured in these procedures using a scintillation counter.\\r\\n\\r\\nChromatographic assays measure product formation by separating the reaction mixture into its components by chromatography. This is usually done by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), but can also use the simpler technique of thin layer chromatography. Although this approach can need a lot of material, its sensitivity can be increased by labelling the substrates/products with a radioactive or fluorescent tag. Assay sensitivity has also been increased by switching protocols to improved chromatographic instruments (e.g. ultra-high pressure liquid chromatography) that operate at pump pressure a few-fold higher than HPLC instruments (see High-performance liquid chromatography#Pump pressure).[10]","input":"What methods are used to measure the activity of an enzyme?"},{"output":"haddock","context":"Icelandic cuisine, the cuisine of Iceland, has a long history. Important parts of Icelandic cuisine are lamb, dairy, and fish, the latter due to Iceland's being surrounded by ocean. Popular foods in Iceland include skyr, hangikj?t (smoked lamb), kleinur, laufabraue and bollur. Torramatur is a traditional buffet served at midwinter festivals called Torrabl܇t; it includes a selection of traditionally cured meat and fish products served with r~gbraue (dense dark and sweet rye bread) and brennivn (an Icelandic akvavit). The flavors of this traditional country food originates in its preservation methods; pickling in fermented whey or brine, drying, and smoking.\\r\\nModern Icelandic chefs usually emphasise the quality of available ingredients rather than age-old cooking traditions and methods. Numerous restaurants in Iceland specialise in seafood. At the annual Food and Fun chef's competition (held since 2004), competitors create innovative dishes with fresh ingredients produced in Iceland. Points of pride are the quality of the lamb meat, seafood, and (more recently) skyr. Other local ingredients include seabirds and waterfowl (including their eggs), salmon and trout, crowberry, blueberry, rhubarb, Iceland moss, wild mushrooms, wild thyme, lovage, angelica, and dried seaweed, as well as a wide array of dairy products.\\r\\nBecause of the history of settlement in a harsh climate, animal products dominate Icelandic cuisine. Popular taste has been developing, however, to become closer to the European norm. As an example, consumption of vegetables has greatly increased in recent decades while consumption of fish has diminished, yet is still far higher than any other developed country at about quadruple the average.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe roots of Icelandic cuisine are to be found in the traditions of Scandinavian cuisine, as Icelandic culture, from its settlement in the 9th century onwards, is a distinctly Nordic culture with a traditional economy based on subsistence farming. Several events in the history of Iceland were of special significance for its cuisine. With Christianisation in 1000 came the tradition of fasting and a ban on horse meat consumption. More significantly in terms of farming and food supply was the onset of the Little Ice Age in the 14th century. Farmers were not able to grow barley anymore and had to rely on imports for any kind of cereal grains. The cooling of the climate also led to important changes in housing and heating: the longhouse of the early settlers, with its spacious hall, was replaced by the Icelandic turf houses with many smaller rooms, including a proper kitchen. This type of dwelling was used well into the 20th century.\\r\\nHistorians often use the Reformation in 1550 as the transition between the Middle Ages and the early modern period in Icelandic history. Farming in Iceland continued with traditional practices from the 14th century to the late 18th century, when reforms were made due to the influence of the Enlightenment. A trade monopoly instituted by the Danish king in 1602 had a certain effect on culinary traditions. But the cuisine of Denmark had the most influence in the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th, when the country had close relations to Iceland. In the early 20th century, an economic boom based on commercial fishing and processing resulted in a slow transition from traditional dairy and meat-based foods to consumption of fish and root vegetables. Preserved foods began to be replaced with greater emphasis on fresh ingredients.\\r\\nWhen Iceland was settled by immigrants from Scandinavia and Viking colonies in the British Isles, they brought their farming methods and food traditions of the Norse world. Research indicates that the climate of Iceland was much milder during the Middle Ages than it is now, and sources tell of cultivation of barley and oats. Most of this would have been consumed as porridge or gruel or used for making beer. Cattle was the dominant farm animal, but farms also raised poultry, pigs, goats, horses and sheep. The poultry, horse, sheep and goat stocks first brought to Iceland have since developed in isolation, unaffected by modern selective breeding. Therefore, they are sometimes called the \\"settlement breed\\" or \\"viking breed\\".\\r\\nFish was stored in salt, and before the Black Death, Iceland exported stockfish to the fish market in Bergen. However, salt seems to have been less abundant in Iceland than in Norway. Saltmaking, which was mostly done by boiling sea water or burning seaweed, gradually disappeared when overgrazing caused a shortage of firewood in most parts of the country in the 14th century. Instead of curing with salt, the people of Iceland began to preserve meat in fermented whey. This method was also known from Norway but acquired little significance there.\\r\\nArcheological digs in medieval farms have revealed large round holes in storage rooms where the barrel containing the lactic acid was kept. Two medieval stories tell of men who save their lives in a burning house by staying submerged inside the acid barrel. Medieval Icelanders used fermentation for preserving both fish and meat, a method that greatly alters the taste of the food, making it similar to very strong cheese. Fermentation is still used to cure shark (see hkarl), skate and herring. Fermented eggs are a regional delicacy, rarely found nowadays. The practice of smoking and drying meat and fish was also practiced, although the drying of meat was seen as somewhat of a last resort.\\r\\nCheese was made from goat and sheep milk as well as cow milk. Skyr, a soft yogurt-like cheese eaten with spoons, was originally a tradition brought to Iceland from Norway. It has survived only in Iceland. The whey left over when making skyr was made to go sour and used for storing meat. It is likely that the predominance of skyr in Icelandic cuisine caused the disappearance of other cheesemaking traditions in the modern era, until industrial cheesemaking started in the first half of the 20th century. Cheesemaking was part of seter-farming (seljab~skapur), living in mountain huts in the highlands in late spring. Here farmers could separate the kids/lambs from their mothers in order to milk the adults. They often made cheese while still in the highlands. Flavors would reflect the new grasses.\\r\\nThe longhouses of the first settlers usually included a long fire in the center to warm the house. Around it, holes were dug in the floor to be used as earth ovens for baking bread and cooking meat. Women would place dough or meat in the hole along with hot embers from the fire, and cover it tightly for the time needed. They boiled liquids in wooden staved churns by putting hot stones from the fire directly into the liquid (a practice that continued to the modern age). Low stone hearths surrounded the fire, but mostly the cooking was done on the floor.\\r\\nIn the 14th century, Icelandic turf houses were developed and gradually replaced the longhouses. They had a kitchen with a raised stone hearth for cooking called hl܇eir. The cooling of the climate during the Little Ice Age made it impossible to grow barley, and sheep replaced the more expensive cattle as predominant livestock. Iceland became dependent on imports for all cereals. Due to a shortage of firewood, the people turned to peat, dung, and dried heather for fuels.\\r\\nIn medieval Iceland the people ate two meals during the day, the lunch or dagvereur at noon, and supper or nttvereur at the end of the day. Food was eaten from bowls. Wooden staved tankards with a hinged lid were used for drinking. Later these were developed into the bulging casks, called askar used for serving food. The upper class used elaborately carved drinking horns on special occasions. Spoons were the most common eating utensil, made of horn or bone, and often decorated with carvings. Except for feasts, where tables would be laid, people ate their food from their laps, while sitting on their beds, which lined the outer wall of the longhouse. In addition to processing crops and meats and cooking, the farmer's wife apportioned the food among the family and friends. In richer households this role was entrusted to a special butler called bryti.\\r\\nIcelandic subsistence farming from the Middle Ages well into the 20th century was restricted by the short production period (summer) compared to the long cold period. Apart from occasional game, the food produced in the three months of summer (including preserving meats and cheeses) had to suffice for nine months of winter. Researchers have estimated that, based on these methods of subsistence, Iceland could support a population of around 60,000. For centuries, farming methods changed very little, and fishing was done by men using hooks and lines from rowboats constructed from driftwood. Farmers also owned the boats, so fishing was limited to periods when the farmhands weren't needed for farm work. Fish was not just a food, but a trade good, and it was exchanged for products brought by foreign merchant ships. The people were dependent on trade for cereals, such as rye and oats, transported to Iceland by Danish merchants. Until the 19th century, the vast majority of Icelandic farmers were tenant farmers on land owned by the Icelandic landowner elite, the Catholic church, or (especially after the confiscation of church lands during the Reformation) the king of Denmark. Tenant farmers used surplus fish, tallow ,and butter to pay the landowner his dues.\\r\\nConsiderable regional variation in subsistence farming developed according to whether people lived close to the ocean or inland. Also, in the north of the country, the main fishing period coincided with the haymaking period in the autumn. This resulted in underdevelopment of fishing because labor was devoted to haymaking. In the South, by contrast, the main fishing period was from February to July. Some historians have described Icelandic society as a highly conservative farming society. Because of the demand for farmhands in the short summers, tenant farmers and landowners opposed the formation of fishing villages. Fishing was considered risky compared to farming, and the Altingi passed many resolutions restricting or forbidding landless tenants from living in coastal villages to pursue fishing.\\r\\nGiven the dominance of subsistence farming in Iceland, there was a lack of specialisation and commerce among farms. As testified in some of the Icelandic sagas, domestic trade seems to have been suspect as a type of usury from the age of settlement. Trade with foreign merchant ships was lively, however, and vital for the economy, especially for cereals and honey, alcohol, and (later) tobacco. Fishing ships from the coastal areas of Europe stopped for provisions in Icelandic harbors and traded what they had with the locals. This would include stale beer, salted pork, biscuits, and chewing tobacco, sold for knitted wool mittens, blankets, etc. Merchant ships put in occasionally from Holland, Germany, England, Scotland, Ireland, France and Spain, to sell their products, mainly for stockfish. It is prominently displayed in the royal seal of Iceland.\\r\\nIn 1602 the Danish king, worried about the activities of English and German ships in what he considered to be territorial waters, instituted a trade monopoly in Iceland, restricting commerce to Danish merchants. They were required to regularly send merchant ships to Iceland carrying trade goods needed by the country. While illegal trade flourished in the 17th century, from 1685 the government instituted stricter measures to enforce the monopoly. It flourished until 1787. As a result, Iceland farmers grew a type of rye predominant in Denmark, and brennivn, an akvavit produced from rye, was introduced. These products displaced other cereals and beer.\\r\\nDifferent types of bread were considered a luxury among common people, although they were not uncommon. The corn bought from the merchant would be ground using a quern-stone (called kvarnarsteinn in Icelandic) and supplemented with dried dulse (seaweed) and lichens. Sometimes it was boiled in milk and served as a thin porridge. The porridge could be mixed with skyr to form skyrhr?ringur. The most common type of bread was a pot bread called r~gbraue, a dark and dense rye bread, reminiscent of the German pumpernickel and the Danish rugbr?d, only more moist. This could also be baked by burying the dough in special wooden casks in the ground close to a hot spring and picking it up the next day. Bread baked in this manner has a slightly sulphuric taste. Dried fish with butter was served with all meals of the day, serving the same purpose as the \\"daily bread\\" in Europe.\\r\\nFrom the 14th century, food was prepared in the kitchen on a raised stone hl܇eir or hearth. Hooks were placed above in order to hold the pots at the desired height above the fire. Ovens were rare, as these required lots of firewood for heating. Baking, roasting and boiling were all done in cast iron pots, usually imported.\\r\\nThe two meals of the medieval period were replaced by three meals in the early modern period; the breakfast (morgunskattur) at around ten o'clock, lunch (n܇nmatur) at around three or four in the afternoon, and supper (kv?ldskattur) at the end of the day.[2] In the Icelandic turf houses people ate sitting on their beds, which lined the room. Food was served in askar, low and bulging wooden staved casks with a hinged lid and two handles, often decorated. Spoon food was served from the cask, and dry food placed on the open lid. Each household member had a personal askur for eating from and was responsible for keeping it clean.\\r\\nM܇euhareindin, arguably the greatest natural disaster to have hit Iceland after its settlement, took place in 1783. Ten years earlier, a ban on Danish merchants residing in Iceland had been lifted and five years later the trade monopoly was ended. Some of the Danish merchants became residents, and some Icelanders became merchants themselves.\\r\\nDuring the Napoleonic Wars (1803ÿ1815), there was a shortage of trade goods as merchant ships were diverted by war. Forced to self-reliance, Icelanders began to emphasize production and consumption of local vegetables raised during the short growing season. In the 19th century, nationalism and schools for women were influential in formalising traditional methods and shaping modern Icelandic cuisine.\\r\\nThe first written cookbooks to be published in Icelandic were collections of Danish recipes published in the 18th century. They were intended to introduce the upper-class cuisine from Denmark-Norway to their peers in Iceland. The recipes sometimes had a \\"commoner version,\\" using less expensive ingredients for farmhands and maids. The cuisine of Denmark influenced Iceland well before that through trade.\\r\\nIn addition, Danish merchants who settled in Iceland, after the ban was lifted in 1770, often ran large households characterised by a mixture of Danish and Icelandic customs. Reykjavk, which developed as village by the end of the 18th century, began to grow and became a center of a melting pot of Icelandic and Danish culinary traditions. Fishing villages formed in the 19th century, many located by the trading harbours, which previously had featured little more than a natural harbour and a locked warehouse nearby. The Danish influence was most pronounced in pastry-making, as there were few native traditions in this craft. Ethnic Danish bakers began to operate around the start of the 20th century in both Reykjavk and Akureyri. Some Danish pastry-making traditions have survived longer in Iceland than in Denmark.\\r\\nIn the late 17th century, some farmers cultivated the first vegetable gardens, but growing vegetables did not become common until the early 19th century, when the Napoleonic Wars resulted in the merchant ships staying away. Resident Danes, who brought the tradition of vegetable gardens with them, were usually the first to start growing vegetables. Popular early garden vegetables included hardy varieties of cabbage, turnip, rutabaga, and potato. They were generally prepared in Iceland as boiled accompaniments to meats and fish, and sometimes mashed with butter.\\r\\nIn the first half of the 20th century, many home economics schools, intended as secondary education for girls, were instituted around Iceland. Within these schools, during a time of nationalistic fervor, many Icelandic culinary traditions were formalised and written down by the pupils. They were published in large recipe compendia a few years later. Later emphasis on food hygiene and the use of fresh ingredients was a novelty in a country where culinary traditions had been based on preserving food for long term use.\\r\\nThe modern economy began to expand, based on commercial export of seafood. The modern generation rejected many traditional foods, embracing the concepts of \\"freshness\\" and \\"purity\\" associated with ingredients from the sea, especially when marketed abroad. During the urbanisation boom of the late 1940s, many Icelanders formed regional associations in Reykjavk. Together as fraternity, they revived some old culinary and other rural traditions. These associations organised midwinter festivals, where they started serving \\"Icelandic food,\\" traditional country foods served in a buffet. This was later called Torramatur.\\r\\nIn the beginning of the 20th century, farmers living near the towns would sell their products to shops and directly to households, often under a subscription contract. (This is similar to the concept of Community Supported Agriculture in some United States cities since the late 20th century.) To deal with the Great Depression in 1930, the Iceland government instituted state monopolies on various imports, including vegetables. They granted the regional farmers' cooperatives, most of them founded around the start of the 20th century, a monopoly on dairy and meat production for the consumer market. This meant that smaller private producers were out of business.\\r\\nThe large cooperatives were believed able to implement economies of scale in agricultural production. They invested in production facilities meeting modern standards of food hygiene. These cooperatives still dominate agricultural production in Iceland and are almost unchallenged. They pioneered new cheesemaking techniques based on popular European varieties of gouda, blue cheese, camembert, etc. Cheesemaking (apart from skyr) had been nearly extinct in Iceland since the 18th century. The cooperatives have driven product development, especially in dairy products. For instance, they market whey-based sweet drinks and variations of traditional products. One of these is \\"Skyr.is\\", a creamier, sweeter skyr, which has boosted the popularity of this age-old staple.\\r\\nFishing on an industrial scale with trawlers started before World War I. Fresh fish became a cheap commodity in Iceland and a staple in the cuisine of fishing villages around the country. Until around 1990, studies showed that Icelanders were consuming much more fish per capita than any other European nation. Since then, however, steeply rising fish prices have caused a decline in consumption.\\r\\nIcelanders consume fish caught in the waters of the North Atlantic Ocean. Fresh fish can be had all the year round. Icelanders eat mostly haddock, plaice, halibut, herring, and shrimp.\\r\\nHkarl (meaning 'shark' in Icelandic) is putrescent shark meat, which has been preserved. It is part of the torramatur, the traditional seasonal Icelandic foods. It is often accompanied by brennivn, a local schnapps.\\r\\nTraditionally, domestic sheep, the most common farm animal in Iceland, was the primary source of meat. Sheep were also used for their milk and wool, and were worth more alive than dead. When a sheep was slaughtered (usually the young rams and infertile ewes), most or all of the carcass was used for making food, which was carefully preserved and consumed. Traditionally lambs are slaughtered in the autumn, when they are more than three months old and have reached a weight of almost 20?kg. After Christianisation, horses were eaten only as a last resort. After the middle of the 18th century, attitudes changed. Horse meat, usually salted and served boiled or in bj~gu, a form of smoked sausage, has been common in Iceland since the 19th century.\\r\\nIcelandic beef is usually of top quality with good marbling due to the cold climate. Icelandic cattle are grass-fed and raised without growth hormones and drugs. However, the lack of tradition for eating beef has resulted in sales of lower quality meat, forcing buyers to be careful.\\r\\nSmall game in Iceland consists mostly of seabirds (puffin, cormorant and great black-backed gull) and waterfowl (mallard, greylag goose and pink-footed goose). The meat of some seabirds contains fish oil. It is placed in a bowl of milk overnight to extract the oil before cooking. Ptarmigan is also found in Iceland, but hunting of them has been banned because of dramatically declining stocks since the late 20th century. Ptarmigan, served with a creamy sauce and jam, has been a traditional Christmas main course in many Icelandic households.\\r\\nSeal hunting, especially the more common harbor seal, was common everywhere farmers had access to seal breeding grounds. Seal was considered an important commodity. Whereas mutton was almost never eaten fresh, seal meat was usually eaten immediately, washed in seawater, or conserved for a short time in brine. Seal meat is not commonly eaten anymore and is rarely found in stores.\\r\\nSystematic whaling was not possible in Iceland until the late 19th century, due to the lack of ocean-going ships. Small whales were hunted close to the shore with the small rowboats used for fishing. Beached whales were also eaten. The Icelandic word for beached whale, hvalreki, is still used to mean a stroke of good luck. When Iceland started commercial whaling (mostly minke whales) in the early 20th century, whale meat became popular as a low-priced red meat. It can be prepared in much the same manner as the more expensive beef. When Iceland withdrew from the International Whaling Commission in 1992, commercial whaling stopped. Some whale meat was still sold in specialised stores, coming from small whales that had beached or been accidentally caught in nets. In 2002 Iceland rejoined the IWC, and commercial whaling recommenced in 2006. Whale meat is commonly available again, although the price has gone up due to the cost of whaling.\\r\\nReindeer were introduced in Iceland in the late 18th century and live wild on the moorlands in the eastern farthing. A small number are killed by hunters each autumn. Their meat is sold in stores and prepared in restaurants most of the year. Reindeer meat is considered a special delicacy and is usually very expensive.\\r\\nImporting raw meat to Iceland is strictly regulated and dependent on specific licenses issued to importers. The government has feared contamination. Due to Iceland's isolation, most of the stocks of domestic animals raised in Iceland have no resistance to some diseases common in neighboring countries. For this reason, tourists are banned from bringing in even cured ham or sausage with them; these are confiscated by customs officers.\\r\\nDairy products are very important to Icelanders. The average Icelander consumes about 100 gallons of dairy products in one year.\\r\\nVegetable production and consumption is steadily growing, with production going from around 8,000 tonnes in 1977 to almost 30,000 tonnes in 2007.[3] The cold climate reduces the need for farmers to use pesticides. Vegetables such as rutabaga, cabbage and turnips are usually started in greenhouses in the early spring, and tomatoes and cucumbers are entirely produced indoors. Iceland relies on imports for almost any type of sweet fruit except sweet berries. Since the early 20th century, it has again been possible to grow barley for human consumption in a few places, for the first time since the Middle Ages.[citation needed]\\r\\nModern Icelandic bakeries offer a wide variety of breads and pastry. The first professional bakers in Iceland were Danish and this is still reflected in the professional traditions of Icelandic bakers. Long-time local favorites include sn~eur, a type of cinnamon roll, usually topped with glaze or melted chocolate, and sk~ffukaka, a single-layer chocolate cake baked in a roasting pan, covered with chocolate glaze and sprinkled with ground coconut.\\r\\nA variety of layer cake called randaln, randabraue or simply lagkaka has been popular in Iceland since the 19th century. These come in many varieties that all have in common five layers of 1?2-inch-thick (13?mm) cake alternated with layers of fruit preserve, jam or icing. One version called vnarterta, popular in the late 19th century, with layers of prunes, became a part of the culinary tradition of Icelandic immigrants in the U.S. and Canada.[4]\\r\\nTraditional breads, still popular in Iceland, include r~gbraue, a dense, dark and moist rye bread, traditionally baked in pots or special boxes used for baking in holes dug near hot springs, and flatkaka, a soft brown rye flatbread. A common way of serving hangikj?t is in thin slices on flatkaka. Other breads include skonsur which are soft breads, and Westfjord Wheatcakes (Vestfirskar hveitik?kur).\\r\\nTraditional pastries include kleina, a small fried dough bun where the dough is flattened and cut into small trapezoids with a special cutting wheel (kleinujrn), a slit cut in the middle and then one end pulled through the slit to form a \\"knot\\". This is then deep-fried in oil.[5] Laufabraue (lit. \\"leafbread\\"), a very thin wafer, with patterns cut into it with a sharp knife and ridged cutting wheels and fried crisp in oil, is a traditional Christmas food, sometimes served with hangikj?t.\\r\\nIn Iceland the Christmas dinner is traditionally served on Christmas Eve. Traditional main courses are hangikj?t (smoked lamb), hamborgarhryggur (salted pork rib) and various types of game, especially ptarmigan stew, puffin (sometimes lightly smoked) and roast greylag goose where these are available. These are usually accompanied by a bchamel or mushroom sauce, boiled potatoes and peas, pickled beetroot or red cabbage and jam. A traditional dessert is rice pudding with raisins, topped with ground cinnamon and sugar called j܇lagrautur (\\"Yule pudding\\").\\r\\nOn December 23 (mass of Saint Thorlak) there is a tradition (originally from the Westfjords) to serve fermented skate with melted tallow and boiled potatoes. Boiling the Christmas hangikj?t the day after serving the skate is said to dispel the strong smell which otherwise tends to linger around the house for days.\\r\\nIn the weeks before Christmas many households bake a variety of cookies to keep in store for friends and family throughout the holidays. These include pipark?kur, a type of ginger biscuits often decorated with colored glaze. Laufabraue is also fried some days before Christmas and decorating it is for many an occasion for holding a family gathering.\\r\\nThe concept of Torramatur was invented by a restaurant in Reykjavk in 1958 when they started advertising a platter with a selection of traditional country food linking it to the tradition of Torrabl܇t popular since the late 19th century. The idea became very popular and for older generations the taste of the food will have brought back fond memories of growing up or spending summers in the countryside before World War II and the urbanisation boom. In recent years, however, torramatur has come to represent the supposed strangeness and peculiarity of traditional Icelandic food, and its very mention will send shivers down the spine of many modern Icelanders, overlooking the fact that many commonplace foods are also traditional though not generally thought of as part of the torramatur category.\\r\\nThese are the various occasions for inviting the extended family to a lunch or \\"afternoon tea\\" called kaffi in Icelandic, as filter coffee is usually served[6] rather than tea. Traditional dishes include the kransakaka of Danish origin and various types of braueterta, similar to the Swedish sm?rg?st?rta with filling of e.g. shrimp, smoked salmon or hangikj?t and liberal amounts of mayonnaise between layers of white bread. Also popular for large family gatherings are various types of sponge cake, topped with fresh or canned fruit, whipped cream, marzipan and meringue. This tradition is satirised in an often-quoted passage from Halld܇r Laxness's novel, Under the Glacier, where the character Hnallt܇ra insists on serving multiple sorts of sumptuous cake for the bishop's emissary at all meals. Her name has become a byword for this type of cake.","input":"What kind of fish do they eat in iceland?"},{"output":"October 17","context":"The 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake occurred in Northern California on October 17 at 5:04 p.m. local time. The shock was centered in The Forest of Nisene Marks State Park approximately 10?mi (16?km) northeast of Santa Cruz on a section of the San Andreas Fault System and was named for the nearby Loma Prieta Peak in the Santa Cruz Mountains. With a moment magnitude of 6.9 and a maximum Mercalli intensity of IX (Violent), the shock was responsible for 63 deaths and 3,757 injuries. The Loma Prieta segment of the San Andreas Fault System had been relatively inactive since the 1906 San Francisco earthquake (to the degree that it was designated a seismic gap) until two moderate foreshocks occurred in June 1988 and again in August 1989.\\r\\nDamage was heavy in Santa Cruz County and less so to the south in Monterey County, but effects extended well to the north into the San Francisco Bay Area, both on the San Francisco Peninsula and across the bay in Oakland. No surface faulting occurred, though a large number of other ground failures and landslides were present, especially in the Summit area of the Santa Cruz Mountains. Liquefaction was also a significant issue, especially in the heavily damaged Marina District of San Francisco, but its effects were also seen in the East Bay, and near the shore of Monterey Bay, where a non-destructive tsunami was also observed.\\r\\nDue to the sports coverage of the 1989 World Series, it became the first major earthquake in the United States that was broadcast live on national television (and is sometimes referred to as the \\"World Series earthquake\\" as a result). Rush-hour traffic on the Bay Area freeways was lighter than normal because the game was about to begin, and this may have prevented a larger loss of life, as several of the Bay Area's major transportation structures suffered catastrophic failures. The collapse of a section of the double-deck Nimitz Freeway in Oakland was the site of the single largest number of casualties for the event, but the collapse of man-made structures and other related accidents contributed to casualties occurring in San Francisco, Los Altos, and Santa Cruz.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe history of earthquake investigations in California has been largely focused on the San Andreas Fault System, due to its strong influence in the state as the boundary between the Pacific Plate and the North American Plate; it is the most studied fault on Earth. Andrew Lawson, a geologist from the University of California, Berkeley, had named the fault after the San Andreas Lake (prior to the occurrence of the 1906 San Francisco earthquake) and later led an investigation into that event. The San Andreas Fault ruptured for a length of 290?mi (470?km) during the 1906 shock, both to the north of San Francisco and to the south in the Santa Cruz Mountains region. Several long term forecasts for a large shock along the San Andreas Fault in that area had been made public prior to 1989 (the event and its aftershocks occurred within a recognized seismic gap) but the earthquake that transpired was not what had been anticipated. The 1989 Loma Prieta event originated on an undiscovered oblique-slip reverse fault that is located adjacent to the San Andreas Fault.[8]\\r\\nSince many forecasts had been presented for the region near Loma Prieta, seismologists were not taken by surprise by the October 1989 event. Between 1910 and 1989 there were 20 widely varying forecasts that were announced, with some that were highly specific, covering multiple aspects of an event, while others were less complete and vague. With a M6.5 event on the San Juan Bautista segment, or an M7 event on the San Francisco Peninsula segment, United States Geological Survey (USGS) seismologist Allan Lindh's 1983 forecasted rupture length of 25 miles (40?km) (starting near Pajaro Gap, and continuing to the northwest) for the San Juan Bautista segment nearly matched the actual rupture length of the 1989 event. An updated forecast was presented in 1988, at which time Lindh took the opportunity to assign a new name to the San Juan Bautista segment ÿ the Loma Prieta segment.[9]\\r\\nIn early 1988, the Working Group for California Earthquake Probabilities (WGCEP) made several statements regarding their forecasts for the 225?mi (360?km) northern San Andreas Fault segment, the 56?mi (90?km) San Francisco Peninsula segment, and a 18.8ÿ22?mi (30ÿ35?km) portion of that segment which was referred to as the southern Santa Cruz Mountains segment. The thirty year probability for one or more M7 earthquakes in the study area was given as 50%, but because of a lack of information and low confidence, a 30% probability was assigned to the Southern Santa Cruz Mountains segment. Two moderate shocks, referred to as the Lake Elsman earthquakes by the USGS, occurred in the Santa Cruz Mountains region in June 1988 and again in August 1989. Following each event, the State office of Emergency Services issued (for the first time in Bay Area history) short term advisories for a possible large earthquake, which meant there was \\"a slightly increased likelihood of an M6.5 event on the Santa Cruz Mountains segment of the San Andreas fault\\". The advisories following the two Lake Elsman events were issued in part because of the statements made by WGCEP and because they were two of the three largest shocks to occur along the 1906 earthquake's rupture zone since 1914.[6][9]\\r\\nThe M5.3 June 1988 and the M5.4 August 1989 events (local magnitude) also occurred on previously unknown oblique reverse faults and were within 3?mi (4.8?km) of the M6.9 Loma Prieta mainshock epicenter, near the intersection of the San Andreas and Sargent faults. Total displacement for these shocks was relatively small (approximately 4?in (100?mm) of strike-slip and substantially less reverse-slip) and although they occurred on separate faults and well before the mainshock, a group of seismologists considered these to be foreshocks due to their location in space and time relative to the main event. Each event's aftershock sequence and effect on stress drop was closely examined, and their study indicated that the shocks affected the mainshock's rupture process. Following the August 8, 1989, shock, in anticipation of an upcoming large earthquake, staff at the University of California, Santa Cruz deployed four accelerometers in the area, which were positioned at the UCSC campus, two residences in Santa Cruz, and a home in Los Gatos. Unlike other nearby (high gain) seismographs that were overwhelmed (driven off scale) by the large magnitude mainshock, the four accelerometers captured a useful record of the main event and more than half an hour of the early aftershock activity.[6][10]\\r\\nThe June 27, 1988, shock occurred with a maximum intensity of VI (Strong). Its effects included broken windows in Los Gatos, and other light damage in Holy City, where increased flow was observed at a water well. Farther away from the Santa Cruz Mountains, pieces of concrete fell from a parking structure at the Sunnyvale Town Center, a two-level shopping mall in Santa Clara County. More moderate damage resulted from the August 8, 1989, shock (intensity VII, Very strong) when chimneys were toppled in Cupertino, Los Gatos, and Redwood Estates. Other damage included cracked walls and foundations and broken underground pipes. At the office of the Los Gatos City Manager, a window that was cracked had also been broken in the earlier shock. Also in Los Gatos, one man died when he exited a building through a window and fell five stories.[1][11]\\r\\nThe Loma Prieta earthquake was named for Loma Prieta Peak in the Santa Cruz Mountains, which lies just to the east of the mainshock epicenter. The duration of the heaviest shaking in the Santa Cruz Mountains was about 15 seconds, but strong ground motion recordings revealed that the duration of shaking was not uniform throughout the affected area (due to different types and thicknesses of soil). At sites with rocky terrain, the duration was shorter and the shaking was much less intense, and at locations with unconsolidated soil (like the Marina District or the Cypress Street Viaduct) the intensity of the shaking was more severe and lasted longer. The strong motion records also allowed for the causative fault to be determined ÿ the rupture was related to the San Andreas Fault System.[7]\\r\\nWhile a Mercalli Intensity of VIII (Severe) covered a large swath of territory relatively close to the epicenter (including the cities of Los Gatos, Santa Cruz, and Watsonville) further to the north, portions of San Francisco were assessed at intensity IX (Violent). At more than 44 miles (70?km) distant, the San Francisco Bay Area recorded peak horizontal accelerations that were as high as 0.26g, and close to the epicenter they peaked at more than 0.6g. In a general way, the location of aftershocks of the event delineated the extent of the faulting, which (according to seismologist Bruce Bolt) extended about 24 miles (40?km) in length. Because the rupture took place bilaterally, the duration of strong shaking was about half of what it would have been had it ruptured in one direction only. The duration of a typical M6.9 shock with a comparable rupture length would have been about twice as long.[7]\\r\\nGregory Beroza, a seismologist with Stanford University, made several distinctions regarding the 1906 and 1989 events. Near Loma Prieta, the 1906 rupture was more shallow, had more strike-slip, and occurred on a fault that was near vertical. The 1989 event's oblique-slip rupture was at 10?km and below on a fault plane that dipped 70 to the southwest. Because much of the slip in 1989 occurred at depth and the rupture propagated up dip, Beroza proposed that the overlying San Andreas Fault actually inhibited further rupture and also maintains that the occurrence of an event at the location that was forecast by the WGCEP in 1988 was coincidental.[12]\\r\\nThe contrasting characteristics of the 1906 and 1989 events were examined by seismologists Hiroo Kanamori and Kenji Satake. The significant amount of vertical displacement in 1989 was a key aspect to consider because a long-term sequence of 1989-type events (with an 80ÿ100-year recurrence interval) normally result in regions with high topographic relief, which is not seen in the Santa Cruz Mountains. Three scenarios were presented that might explain this disparity. The first is that the geometry of the San Andreas Fault goes through a transition every several thousand years. Secondly, slip type could vary from event to event. And lastly, the 1989 event did not occur on the San Andreas Fault.[13]\\r\\nWhile the effects of a four-year drought limited the potential of landslides, the steep terrain near the epicenter was prone to movement, and up to 4,000 landslides may have occurred during the event. The majority of landslides occurred to the southwest of the epicenter, especially along road cuts in the Santa Cruz Mountains and in the Summit Road area, but also along the bluffs of the Pacific Coast, and as far north as the Marin Peninsula. Highway 17 was blocked for several weeks due to a large slide and one person was killed by a rockfall along the coast. Other areas with certain soil conditions were susceptible to site amplification due to the effects of liquefaction, especially near the shore of San Francisco Bay (where its effects were severe in the Marina District) and to the west of the epicenter near rivers and other bodies of water. Minor lateral spreading was also seen along the shores of San Francisco Bay and to the south near Monterey Bay. Other ground effects included downslope movement, slumps, and ground cracks.[2]\\r\\nFifty-seven of the deaths were directly caused by the earthquake; six further fatalities were ruled to have been caused indirectly.[14] In addition, there were 3,757 injuries as a result of the earthquake, 400 of which were serious.[15][16] The highest number of fatalities, 42,[17] occurred in Oakland because of the Cypress Street Viaduct collapse on the Nimitz Freeway (Interstate 880), where the upper level of a double-deck portion of the freeway collapsed, crushing the cars on the lower level, and causing crashes on the upper level. One 50-foot (15?m) section of the San FranciscoÿOakland Bay Bridge also collapsed, leading to a single fatality, a 23-year-old woman named Anamafi Moala.[18][19] Three people were killed in the collapse of buildings along the Pacific Garden Mall in Santa Cruz,[citation needed] and five people were killed in the collapse of a brick wall on Bluxome Street in San Francisco.[citation needed]\\r\\nWhen the earthquake hit, the third game of the 1989 World Series baseball championship was about to begin. Because of the unusual circumstance that both of the World Series teams (the San Francisco Giants and Oakland Athletics) were based in the affected area, many people had left work early or were staying late to participate in after work group viewings and parties. As a consequence the normally crowded freeways contained unusually light traffic. If traffic had been normal for a Tuesday rush hour, injuries and deaths would certainly have been higher. The initial media reports failed to take into account the game's effect on traffic and initially estimated the death toll at 300, a number that was corrected to 63 in the days after the earthquake.[20][21]\\r\\nAfter the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake occurred, a group led by Antony C. Fraser-Smith of Stanford University reported that the event was preceded by disturbances in background magnetic field noise as measured by a sensor placed in Corralitos, California, about 4.5 miles (7?km) from the epicenter.[22] From October 5, they reported a substantial increase in noise was measured in the frequency range 0.01ÿ10?Hz.[22] The measurement instrument was a single-axis search-coil magnetometer that was being used for low frequency research.[22] Precursor increases of noise apparently started a few days before the earthquake, with noise in the range 0.01ÿ0.5?Hz rising to exceptionally high levels about three hours before the earthquake.[22] Though this pattern gave scientists new ideas for research into potential precursors to earthquakes, and the Fraser-Smith et al. report remains one of the most frequently cited examples of a specific earthquake precursor, more recent studies have cast doubt on the connection, attributing the Corralitos signals to either unrelated magnetic disturbance or,[23] even more simply, to sensor-system malfunction.[24]\\r\\nThe earthquake caused severe damage in some very specific locations in the San Francisco Bay Area, most notably on unstable soil in San Francisco and Oakland. Oakland City Hall was evacuated after the earthquake until US$80M seismic retrofit and hazard abatement work was completed in 1995.[26] Many other communities sustained severe damage throughout the region located in Alameda, San Mateo, Santa Clara, San Benito, Santa Cruz and Monterey counties. Major property damage in San Francisco's Marina District 60?mi (97?km) from the epicenter resulted from liquefaction of soil used to create waterfront land. Other effects included sand volcanoes, landslides and ground ruptures. Some 12,000 homes and 2,600 businesses were damaged.[15]\\r\\nIn Santa Cruz, close to the epicenter, 40 buildings collapsed, killing six people.[27] At the Santa Cruz Beach Boardwalk, the Plunge Building was significantly damaged.[28] Liquefaction also caused damage in the Watsonville area.[29] For example, sand volcanoes formed in a field near Pajaro as well as in a strawberry field.[29] The Ford's department store in Watsonville experienced significant damage, including a crack down the front of the building.[29] Many homes were dislodged if they were not bolted to their foundations.[29] There were structural failures of twin bridges across Struve Slough near Watsonville.[29] In Moss Landing, the liquefaction destroyed the causeway that carried the Moss Beach access road across tidewater basin, damaged the approach and abutment of the bridge linking Moss Landing spit to the mainland and cracked the paved road on Paul's Island.[30] In the Old Town historical district of the city of Salinas, unreinforced masonry buildings were partially destroyed.[31]\\r\\nAn estimated 1.4 million people lost power following the quake, mainly due to damaged electrical substations.[32] Many San Francisco radio and television stations were temporarily knocked off the air.[33] KRON-TV was off the air for about half an hour,[34] while KGO-AM was off the air for about 40 minutes.[33] About an hour and 40 minutes after the quake, KTVU resumed broadcasting, with their news anchors reporting from the station's parking lot.[35][36] KCBS-AM switched immediately to backup power and managed to stay on air despite a subsequent generator failure.[33] KCBS later won a Peabody Award for their news coverage, as did KGO-TV.[37] Power was restored to most of San Francisco by midnight, and all but 12,000 customers had their power restored within two days.[32]\\r\\nThe quake caused an estimated $6 billion[15] in property damage, becoming one of the most expensive natural disasters in U.S. history at the time. Private donations poured into aid relief efforts and on October 26, President George H. W. Bush signed a $1.1 billion earthquake relief package for California.[38]\\r\\nFour people died in San Francisco's Marina District, four buildings were destroyed by fire, and seven buildings collapsed. Another 63 damaged structures were judged too dangerous to live in.[39] Among the four deaths, one family lost their infant son who choked on dust while trapped for an hour inside their collapsed apartment.[18]\\r\\nThe Marina district was built on a landfill made of a mixture of sand, dirt, rubble, waste and other materials containing a high percentage of groundwater. Some of the fill was rubble dumped into San Francisco Bay after the 1906 San Francisco earthquake, but most was sand and debris laid down in preparation for the 1915 Panama-Pacific International Exposition, a celebration of San Francisco's ability to rebound after its catastrophe in 1906.[40] After the Exposition, apartment buildings were erected on the landfill. In the 1989 earthquake, the water-saturated unconsolidated mud, sand and rubble suffered liquefaction, and the earthquake's vertical shock waves rippled the ground more severely.[41]\\r\\nAt the intersection of Beach and Divisadero Streets in San Francisco, a natural gas main rupture caused a major structure fire.[42][43][44] The fire department selected bystanders to help run fire hoses from a distance because the nearby hydrant system failed. Since the bay was only two blocks from the burning buildings,[44] water from the bay was pumped by the fireboat Phoenix, to engines on the shore, and from there sprayed on the fire.[45][46] The apartment structures that collapsed were older buildings that included ground floor garages, which engineers refer to as a soft story building.[47]\\r\\nIn Santa Cruz, the Pacific Garden Mall was severely damaged, with falling debris killing three people, half of the six earthquake deaths in Santa Cruz and Monterey Counties.[27] Some 31 buildings were damaged enough to warrant demolition, seven of which had been listed in the Santa Cruz Historic Building Survey.[48] The four oldest were built in 1894, the five oldest withstood the 1906 San Francisco earthquake.[48]\\r\\nImmediately, a number of civilians began to free victims from the rubble of Ford's Department Store and the Santa Cruz Coffee Roasting Companyboth buildings had collapsed inward on customers and employees alike.[27] Two police officers crawled through voids in the debris, found one victim alive and another dead inside the coffee house.[49] Santa Cruz beach lifeguards assisted in moving the victims.[49] Police dogs were brought in to help locate other victims.[49] A woman was found dead inside Ford's.[50] The civilians who were helpful initially, were soon viewed by police and fire officials as a hindrance to operations, with frantic coworkers and friends of a coffee house employee thought to be trapped under the rubble continuing their efforts in the dark.[49] Police arrested those who refused to stop searching. This became a political issue in the following days.[51] The body of a young woman coffee worker was found under a collapsed wall late the next day.[52]\\r\\nDuring the first few days following the quake, electric power to most Santa Cruz County subscribers was out, and some areas had no water. Limited phone service remained online, providing a crucial link to rescue workers.[51] Widespread search operations were organized to find possible victims inside the remains of fallen structures. As many as six teams of dogs and their handlers were at work identifying the large number of damaged buildings that held no victims.[51]\\r\\nThe quake claimed one life in Watsonville:[51] a driver who collided with panicked horses after they escaped their collapsed corral.[53] In other Santa Cruz and Monterey county locations such as Boulder Creek and Moss Landing, a number of structures were damaged, with some knocked off of their foundations.[54] Many residents slept outside their homes out of concern for further damage from aftershocks, of which there were 51 with magnitudes greater than 3.0 in the following 24 hours, and 16 more the second day.[54] The earthquake damaged several historic buildings in the Old Town district of Salinas, and some were later demolished.[55]\\r\\nThe San FranciscoÿOakland Bay Bridge suffered severe damage, as a 76-by-50-foot (23?m G?15?m) section of the upper deck on the eastern cantilever side fell onto the deck below. The quake caused the Oakland side of the bridge to shift 7?in (18?cm) to the east, and caused the bolts of one section to shear off, sending the 250-short-ton (230?t) section of roadbed crashing down like a trapdoor.[56] Traffic on both decks came to a halt, blocked by the section of roadbed. Police began unsnarling the traffic jam, telling drivers to turn their cars around and drive back the way they had come. Eastbound drivers stuck on the lower deck between the collapse and Yerba Buena Island were routed up to the upper deck and westward back to San Francisco. A miscommunication made by emergency workers at Yerba Buena Island routed some drivers the wrong way; they were directed to the upper deck where they drove eastward toward the collapse site.[18] One of these drivers did not see the open gap in time; the car plunged over the edge and smashed onto the collapsed roadbed. The driver, Anamafi Moala, died, and the passenger was seriously injured.[42][57] Caltrans removed and replaced the collapsed section, and re-opened the bridge on November 18.[41]\\r\\nThe worst disaster of the earthquake was the collapse of the two-level Cypress Street Viaduct of Interstate 880 in West Oakland. The failure of a 1.25-mile (2.0?km) section[58] of the viaduct, also known as the \\"Cypress Structure\\" and the \\"Cypress Freeway\\",[18] killed 42 and injured many more.[59]\\r\\nBuilt in the late 1950s, the Cypress Street Viaduct, a stretch of Interstate 880, was a double-deck freeway section made of nonductile reinforced concrete[60] that was constructed above and astride Cypress Street in Oakland. Roughly half of the land the Cypress Viaduct was built on was filled marshland, and half was somewhat more stable alluvium.[61] Because of new highway structure design guidelinesthe requirement of ductile construction elementsinstituted following the 1971 San Fernando earthquake, a limited degree of earthquake reinforcement was retrofitted to the Cypress Viaduct in 1977. The added elements were longitudinal restraints at transverse expansion joints in the box girder spans, but no studies were made of possible failure modes specific to the Cypress Viaduct.[60] When the earthquake hit, the shaking was amplified on the former marshland, and soil liquefaction occurred.[54]\\r\\nDuring the earthquake, the freeway buckled and twisted to its limits before the support columns failed and sent the upper deck crashing to the lower deck. In an instant, 41 people were crushed to death in their cars. Cars on the upper deck were tossed around violently, some of them flipped sideways and some of them were left dangling at the edge of the highway. Nearby residents and factory workers came to the rescue, climbing onto the wreckage with ladders and forklifts[25] and pulling trapped people out of their mangled cars from under a four-foot gap in some sections. Sixty members of Oakland's Public Works Agency left the nearby city yard and joined rescue efforts.[58] Employees from Pacific Pipe (a now-closed factory adjoining the freeway) drove heavy lift equipment to the scene and started using it to raise sections of fallen freeway enough to allow further rescue. Hard-hatted factory workers continued their volunteer operation nonstop until October 21, 1989, when they were forced to pause as U.S. President George H. W. Bush and California Governor George Deukmejian viewed the damage.[62] The efforts of the rescue workers finally yielded results on October 21, just after dawn, when survivor Buck Helm was freed from the wreckage, having spent 90 hours trapped in his crushed car under the rubble.[63] Dubbed \\"Lucky Buck\\" by the local radio, Helm lived for another 29 days on life support, but then died of respiratory failure at the age of 57.[64]\\r\\nRebuilding the freeway took nine years.[65] In the meantime, traffic was detoured through nearby Interstate 980, causing increased congestion.[65] Instead of rebuilding Interstate 880 over the same ground, Caltrans rerouted the freeway farther west around the outskirts of West Oakland to provide better access to the Port of Oakland and the San FranciscoÿOakland Bay Bridge, and to meet community desires to keep the freeway from cutting through residential areas. Street-level Mandela Parkway now occupies the previous roadbed of the Cypress structure.[66]\\r\\nImmediately after the earthquake, San Francisco Bay Area airports were closed so officials could conduct visual inspection and damage assessment procedures. San Jose International Airport,[67] Oakland International Airport and San Francisco International Airport all opened the next morning.[68] Large cracks in Oakland's runway and taxiway reduced the usable length to two-thirds normal, and damage to the dike required quick remediation to avoid flooding the runway with water from the bay. Oakland Airport repair costs were assessed at $30 million.[69]\\r\\nSan Francisco Municipal Railway (Muni) lost all power to electric transit systems when the quake hit, but otherwise suffered little damage and no injuries to operators or riders.[70] Cable cars and electric trains and buses were stalled in placehalf of Muni's transport capability was lost for 12 hours. Muni relied on diesel buses to continue abbreviated service until electric power was restored later that night, and electric units could be inspected and readied for service on the morning of October 18.[70] After 78 hours, 96 percent of Muni services were back in operation, including the cable cars.[70] Amtrak intercity rail service into Oakland from the California Zephyr continued, but the Coast Starlight was temporarily suspended north of Salinas because of damage to the Southern Pacific's Coast Line.[71]\\r\\nThe earthquake changed the Bay Area's automobile transportation landscape. Not only did the quake force seismic retrofitting of all San Francisco Bay Area bridges,[72] it caused enough damage that some parts of the region's freeway system had to be demolished.[73] Damage to the region's transportation system was estimated at $1.8 billion.[54]\\r\\nThe 1989 World Series featured the Oakland Athletics and the San Francisco Giants in the first cross-town World Series since 1956. Game 3 of the series was scheduled to begin at San Francisco's Candlestick Park on October 17 at 17:35 PDT, and American TV network ABC began its pre-game show at 17:00 PDT. When the quake struck at approximately 17:04, sportscaster Tim McCarver was narrating taped highlights of Game 2, which had been played two days earlier across the Bay Bridge in Oakland. Television viewers saw the video signal begin to break up, heard McCarver repeat a sentence as the shaking distracted him, and heard McCarver's colleague Al Michaels exclaim, \\"I'll tell you what, we're having an earth.\\"[53] At that moment, the signal from Candlestick Park was lost.[82]\\r\\nThe network put up a green ABC Sports graphic while it scrambled to repair the video feed (the broadcast cameras and mics were powered by the local power supply), but audio from the stadium was restored after a few seconds via a telephone link. Michaels had to pick up a POTS phone in the press booth (phones work off a separate power supply) and call ABC headquarters in New York, at which point they put him back on the air. Michaels cracked, \\"Well, folks, that's the greatest open in the history of television, bar none!\\" accompanied by the combined screams of excitement and panic from fans who had no idea of the devastation elsewhere.[83] ABC then switched to an episode of Roseanne which was on standby for a rain delay situation, while attempting to restore electricity to its remote equipment.\\r\\nWith anchorman Ted Koppel in position in Washington, D.C., ABC News began continuous coverage of the quake at about 5:40?p.m., at the same time as CBS News; Al Michaels, in the process, became a de facto on-site reporter for ABC.[34] NBC News also began continuous coverage, with Tom Brokaw, about an hour later.[34] The Goodyear blimp had already been overhead to cover the baseball game, and ABC used it to capture images of damage to the Bay Bridge and other locations.[33]\\r\\nInside Candlestick Park, fewer than half of the more than 62,000 fans[18] had reached their seats by the time of the quake, and the load on the structure of the stadium was lower than maximum.[84] There had also been a seismic-strengthening project previously completed on the upper deck concrete windscreen that may have prevented large numbers of injuries in the event of serious damage or even a catastrophic collapse.[85] Fans reported that the stadium moved in an articulated manner as the earthquake wave passed through it, that the light standards swayed by many feet, and that the concrete upper deck windscreen moved in a wave-like manner over a distance of several feet. When electrical power to the stadium was lost, someone drove a police car onto the field, where an officer used the car's public address system to advise that the game had been postponed. After the shaking subsided, many of the players on both teams immediately searched for, and gathered, family and friends from the stands before evacuating the facility.[84]\\r\\nThe October 18, 1989 edition NBC's Today that covered the earthquake ran until noon Eastern Time. Bryant Gumbel, Jane Pauley and Deborah Norville anchored from Chicago (where they had planned to originally do a special celebratory edition), with reports done by Bob Jamieson and Don Oliver in San Francisco, and George Lewis in Oakland. Jim Miklasewski and Bob Hager covered disaster response from Washington. NBC Sports commentators Bob Costas and Jimmy Cefalo discussed the effect the temblor would have on the 1989 World Series.\\r\\nThe World Series was delayed while the Bay Area started the recovery process. While the teams' stadiums had suffered only minor damage, it took several days for power and transmission links at Candlestick Park to be repaired. After ten days (the longest delay in World Series history), Game 3 was held in San Francisco on October 27 and Game 4 the following afternoon as the A's swept the Giants, four games to none.[84]\\r\\nIt is likely that the World Series game saved many lives as Bay Area residents; who would have normally been on the freeways, were at home ready to watch the game when the earthquake hit. It is a rough estimate that thousands of people may have otherwise been on the Cypress Structure during the 5:00?p.m. rush-hour, as the structure was said to have carried 195,000 vehicles a day.[86]\\r\\nSources","input":"What date was the earthquake in santa cruz california?"},{"output":"\\"The Day of the Doctor\\"","context":"\\"The Day of the Doctor\\" is a special episode of the British science fiction television programme Doctor Who, marking the programme's 50th anniversary.[2][3][4] It was written by Steven Moffat,[5] an executive producer alongside Faith Penhale.[6] It was shown on BBC One on 23 November 2013, in both 2D and 3D.[7][8] The special was broadcast simultaneously in 94 countries,[8][9] and was shown concurrently in 3D in some cinemas.[10] It achieved the Guinness World Record for the largest ever simulcast of a TV drama[9] and won the Radio Times Audience Award at the 2014 British Academy Television Awards.[11]\\r\\nThe 77-minute episode shows the last day of the Time War, in which the War Doctor (John Hurt) chooses to kill both Daleks and his own race of Time Lords to end the destructive conflict, paralleling this with a present-day choice by paramilitary organisation UNIT to destroy London rather than allow an alien invasion. Revising the back story, the Doctor succumbs to Clara Oswald's plea to change his mind; and instead, at the last instant of the Time War, he hides his war-torn home planet in time, rather than destroy it. Unfortunately the time distortions incurred causes all but his latest incarnation to have no memory of his changed decision.\\r\\nThe episode starred Matt Smith as the Eleventh Doctor and Jenna Coleman as his companion, Clara Oswald. Previous lead actors David Tennant and Billie Piper returned for the episode, Tennant reprising his role as the Tenth Doctor, while Piper portrayed a sentient doomsday weapon called the Moment, projected as an image based on her character Rose Tyler. She is invisible and inaudible to everyone but the War Doctor (John Hurt). Other appearances included a very brief glimpse of the then-upcoming Twelfth Doctor (Peter Capaldi), who would succeed Matt Smith in \\"The Time of the Doctor\\",[12] and a guest appearance by Fourth Doctor actor Tom Baker, in his late 70s. Rounding out the guest cast were Joanna Page as Queen Elizabeth I[13] and Jemma Redgrave as Kate Stewart, the daughter of 1970s central figure Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart.[14] The special also featured the return of the Daleks[15] and the Zygons, shape-shifting aliens who had previously appeared only in Terror of the Zygons (1975).[16]\\r\\nAs the episode celebrates fifty years of the programme, it references and alludes to various concepts featured throughout the show's run. It has been described by series producer Marcus Wilson as a \\"love letter to the fans\\" and by the controller of BBC One, Danny Cohen, as an \\"event drama\\".[5][17]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTwo mini-episodes written by Steven Moffat, \\"The Night of the Doctor\\" (14 November 2013) and \\"The Last Day\\" (21 November 2013), were released shortly prior to \\"The Day of the Doctor\\", depicting in-series events occurring during the Time War between the Doctor's own race of Time Lords and his nemesis, the Daleks.\\r\\nIn \\"The Night of the Doctor\\", Paul McGann reprised his role as the Eighth Doctor from the 1996 television film and subsequent Big Finish audio plays. He is a conscientious objector to the ongoing Time War and intends to rescue a crew member from a crashing spaceship via the TARDIS. Realising that her rescuer is a Time Lord she refuses to comply, preferring to die rather than go with him. She and the Doctor die as the ship crashes on Karn. The Doctor is resurrected temporarily by the Sisterhood of Karn (who control a secret Elixir of Life in the 1976 serial The Brain of Morbius). They persuade the Doctor to take action to end the Time War, offering him a selection of potions to control his regeneration. He reluctantly accepts that with all of reality threatened and the universe \\"on the brink\\", there is not much need for a doctor, and chooses a potion designed to initiate his regeneration into a hitherto unknown incarnation of the Doctor as a \\"warrior\\" (described in credits as the \\"War Doctor\\" and played by John Hurt).\\r\\n\\"The Last Day\\" is filmed from the first-person perspective of a Gallifreyan soldier who has had a camera implanted in his head. The soldiers scan for Daleks at Arcadia, Gallifrey's second city and believed due to its impregnable defences to be the safest place on the Time Lords' home planet. During training exercises, a blurred object in the sky is identified shockingly as the first of a fleet of successfully invading Daleks, which kill the soldiers. The \\"Fall of Arcadia\\" becomes the central battle of the Time War around which \\"The Day of the Doctor\\" is centred.\\r\\nThe Eleventh Doctor and Clara Oswald aid the military organisation UNIT, headed by Kate Stewart, in investigating a mystery at the Undergallery, a secret vault housed at the National Gallery. Three-dimensional paintings, made with Time Lord stasis cubes, appear to have been broken from within; the figures previously in the paintings are now missing. While examining the paintings, a fissure in time opens above them and the Doctor jumps into it.\\r\\nIn the midst of the Time War between the Time Lords and the Daleks, the War Doctor  a hitherto-unknown incarnation of the Doctor  decides to trigger an ancient weapon called The Moment in order to destroy both sides completely. The Moment is sentient and manifests itself as Rose Tyler. It questions whether mass killing is the best option for ending the Time War and prescribes the Doctor's punishment if he does so  he will survive while the rest of his race dies. The Moment offers to show the Doctor what this will turn him into and opens a fissure linking him to the Tenth and Eleventh Doctors. The three Doctors converge in the year 1562, where the Tenth Doctor has been tracking down a Zygon. They discover that the Zygon is disguised as Queen Elizabeth, who captures and imprisons them in the Tower of London.\\r\\nMeanwhile, within UNIT's Black Archive, Clara learns that the Zygons from Elizabethan England have entered the three-dimensional paintings in the Undergallery and have emerged in 2013, taking the forms of UNIT members so that they could utilise UNIT's weapons and technology. While the three Doctors are in their cell, The Moment encourages the War Doctor to ask them the questions he needs answered before he decides whether to destroy Gallifrey. After a tense exchange, the Doctors devise an escape plan. They then encounter the real Queen Elizabeth and learn through her of the Zygon scheme to conquer Earth. Kate Stewart also learns of the Zygon plan and locks herself in the Black Archive with the Zygons, starting a countdown that will detonate a nuclear warhead underneath the archive. The Doctors, unable to land a TARDIS in the Black Archive, instead use the stasis cube technology to enter a painting. They exit the painting in the present and use the archive's mind-wiping equipment to render the UNIT members and Zygons temporarily unaware which of them are which. The countdown is stopped and all present negotiate a perfectly fair peace treaty, as they no longer know which way to skew it.\\r\\nThe War Doctor, now convinced that detonating the Moment will save many more lives in the longer term, is returned to his time by the Moment. The other two Doctors follow him in their TARDISes with the intention of helping him so as to share his burden. After Clara reminds them of their choice of the title \\"Doctor\\" and what it stands for, the Doctors devise an alternative solution. They plan to use the stasis technology to freeze the entire planet of Gallifrey in a single moment in time, which would be kept in a pocket universe. When Gallifrey disappears, the surrounding Dalek warships would obliterate themselves in the inevitable crossfire and both species will appear to have been wiped out. The Doctors relay their plan to the Time Lords and then surround Gallifrey, which erupts in a bright light.\\r\\nThe Doctors and Clara return to the Gallery, unsure whether the plan worked. The War Doctor is content to think that he failed in doing the right thing before realising that neither he nor the Tenth Doctor will remember what happened and will continue shouldering the guilt. The War Doctor departs in his TARDIS and begins to regenerate. The Tenth Doctor departs in his TARDIS after persuading the Eleventh Doctor to reveal that he is going to the planet Trenzalore. The Eleventh Doctor, now alone, begins to muse about retiring to become the museum's curator, when he is interrupted by the museum's actual curator. As they talk, the curator reveals that the painting's title, which was thought to be either No More or Gallifrey Falls, is in fact Gallifrey Falls No More.\\r\\nIn the closing scene, the Doctor describes a recurring dream in which he and his previous incarnations are looking together upon Gallifrey and states that he is going home.\\r\\nAs the show's 50th anniversary special, the episode contains multiple references to previous episodes. It opens with the title sequence and theme arrangement used at the series' debut in 1963. Echoing the opening of An Unearthly Child, the first episode of the first Doctor Who story, a policeman is shown walking past the sign for I.M. Foreman, the scrap merchant in whose yard the TARDIS was located, and its first few seconds are in monochrome (as had been the case in The Two Doctors, the last time more than one Doctor had featured in an official story). Coal Hill School, which the Doctor's granddaughter Susan Foreman attended when they were on Earth in 1963 in the very first story, also featured in the 1988 serial Remembrance of the Daleks. According to the school sign, the chairman of the school governors is now Ian Chesterton, one of the First Doctor's original three companions and a science teacher at the school, and the headmaster is W. Coburn, a reference to Waris Hussein and Anthony Coburn, who respectively directed and wrote An Unearthly Child.[18] Clara rides out of Coal Hill School on the Eleventh Doctor's anti-gravity motorcycle from \\"The Bells of Saint John\\" at 5:16, the time An Unearthly Child originally aired on BBC TV (the first broadcast began 1 minute 20 seconds after its scheduled time of 17:15 GMT on 23 November 1963).[19][20]\\r\\nWhen the TARDIS is picked up by UNIT, the call sign used by the helicopter to refer to UNIT is \\"Greyhound leader\\", reflecting that of Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart,[21] whose daughter Kate is now portrayed as having his role as commander of UNIT. Lethbridge-Stewart was a central character in the Third Doctor's era and also several of his successors', originally appearing in the Second Doctor serial The Web of Fear and making his last appearance in Doctor Who in Seventh Doctor serial Battlefield, which is also referenced. An image of the Brigadier is seen alongside images of various companions of the Doctor. The UNIT dating controversy, regarding whether the Third Doctor era stories took place in the 1970s or 1980s, is alluded to in dialogue by Kate Stewart, when she mentions that events occurred in \\"the '70s or '80s depending on the dating protocol used\\".[21]\\r\\nThe Tenth Doctor's era is also heavily revisited. His marriage to Queen Elizabeth I, mentioned in \\"The Shakespeare Code\\" and The End of Time, is finally depicted.[22] The Tenth Doctor mentioned the Fall of Arcadia in \\"Doomsday\\". When the Eleventh Doctor tells Clara that the situation is \\"timey-wimey stuff,\\" and the War Doctor ridicules him for it, the Tenth Doctor remarks, \\"I have no idea where he picks that stuff up\\"; the Tenth originally used the phrase in \\"Blink\\".[22] When he leaves after learning of Trenzalore, the Tenth Doctor remarks, \\"I don't want to go\\", his incarnation's final words from The End of Time; the Eleventh Doctor tells Clara that \\"he always says that\\" after his TARDIS leaves.[18] The Moment device was originally mentioned in The End of Time,[23] but had not been explored in depth until now, where it takes the form of \\"Bad Wolf\\", a seemingly omnipotent being and personalisation of the Time Vortex itself, which manifested in Rose Tyler when she absorbed the Time Vortex in the first series finale, \\"The Parting of the Ways\\".[18] During the negotiations with the Zygons Kate mentions the Sycorax from \\"The Christmas Invasion\\".\\r\\nThe Black Archive, containing alien artefacts collected by UNIT, has photographs of the Doctor's many companions. Additionally, River Song's high heels from \\"The Time of Angels\\"/\\"Flesh and Stone\\", the mass canceler from second series finale \\"Doomsday\\",[24] a Supreme Dalek head from fourth series finale, \\"The Stolen Earth\\"/\\"Journey's End\\", a Dalek tommy gun from \\"Daleks in Manhattan\\"/\\"Evolution of the Daleks\\", the restraining chair which held both the Master and the Doctor in The End of Time, and a Cyberman head are contained within the Archive. The vortex manipulator in the Archive was donated to UNIT by Captain Jack Harkness, a companion of the Ninth Doctor who was reunited with the Tenth Doctor on multiple occasions. The Black Archive was also seen in The Sarah Jane Adventures episode \\"Enemy of the Bane\\".[citation needed]\\r\\nOther references are made to previous multi-Doctor anniversary stories, The Three Doctors and The Five Doctors.[21] The Eleventh Doctor's dismissal of the Tenth Doctor and War Doctor as \\"Sandshoes and Grandad\\" to mock their respective footwear and age echo the First Doctor's description of his two successors in The Three Doctors as \\"a dandy and a clown\\".[21] (The War Doctor's initial incredulous reaction upon seeing his future selves also reflects this moment.) Likewise, a Time Lord says, \\"I didn't know when I was well-off. All twelve of them.\\" which recalls the Brigadier's line from The Three Doctors: \\"Three of them, eh? I didn't know when I was well off.\\"[25] More of the Brigadier's dialogue from the latter serial is alluded to when Kate asks for an incident report code-named \\"Cromer\\";[26] in the earlier story, upon being transported to another universe, the Brigadier initially believes himself to be near the coastal Norfolk town. A line from the First Doctor from The Five Doctors is also reused near the end as the Tenth Doctor tells the Eleventh, \\"It's good to know my future is in safe hands\\" (which the First told the Fifth in the earlier story, appended by \\"after all\\").[27] When the War Doctor appears, Clara remarks, \\"I think there's three of them,\\" to which Kate responds, \\"There's a precedent for that,\\" in reference to The Three Doctors.[21]\\r\\nLines from past serials reappear in the special. The Eleventh Doctor resurrects the phrase \\"reversing the polarity\\" associated with the Third Doctor, to comical effect. In trying to compensate for the presence of three Doctors who utilise different console rooms, the Tenth Doctor's TARDIS console briefly changes to the War Doctor's console room, seen again later in the episode, before settling on the Eleventh's.[27] The Tenth Doctor comments upon the Eleventh Doctor's TARDIS console, \\"Oh you've redecorated! I don't like it\\", a line originally used by the Second Doctor speaking to the Third in The Three Doctors and later reused by the Second and Eleventh Doctors respectively in The Five Doctors and \\"Closing Time\\".[18] One of the War Doctor's final lines of dialogue prior to regenerating is \\"....wearing a bit thin\\", echoing some of the First Doctor's final words prior to regenerating at the end of The Tenth Planet, \\"this old body of mine is wearing a bit thin\\".[18]\\r\\nThe description of the Tardis's sound as a \\"wheezing, groaning sound\\" by \\"The Moment\\" (Rose Tyler) is a reference to its description in the Terrance Dicks novels.[28]\\r\\nOn 30 March 2013, a distribution error occurred, and many subscribers to Doctor Who Magazine received the issue five days before the official release date.[13] The issue of the magazine included the official announcement that David Tennant and Billie Piper, who previously played the Tenth Doctor and Rose Tyler in Doctor Who respectively, were lined up to appear in the special, along with actor John Hurt.[13] Moffat did not want to bring Rose the character back because he felt her story was wrapped up and did not feel comfortable adding to Davies' arc. However, he liked the concept of bringing back her Bad Wolf persona and felt that Piper needed to be in the special as she symbolised the rebirth of Doctor Who.[33]\\r\\nJohn Hurt did not actually audition for the part, but had been asked by the production team and \\"said yes with remarkable speed\\".[41] His costume was meant to signify that he was \\"rougher, tougher\\", and had been around for a while; the audience had missed a lot. Hurt's request to keep his beard adds to this effect.[41]\\r\\nChristopher Eccleston discussed plans for the anniversary episode with Moffat, but eventually declined to return as the Ninth Doctor.[42] Sylvester McCoy, who played the Seventh Doctor, claimed that none of the surviving actors who portrayed the Doctor prior to Eccleston were contacted regarding the special.[43] Colin Baker confirmed this while being interviewed on Australian television alongside McCoy and Paul McGann.[44] However, McGann went on to say that he could still be in the 50th but at the last moment.[45] Radio Times reported rumours that a Doctor from the classic era (pre-2005) would feature in the special, citing unknown sources.[46] Freema Agyeman[47] and John Barrowman,[48] who played Tenth Doctor companions Martha Jones and Jack Harkness, respectively, both stated they would not be in the 50th, but may return to the show at some point. Barrowman stated that he would have liked to be in it, but speculated that the producers wanted to try some different things.[48]\\r\\n\\"The Day of the Doctor\\" was written by Steven Moffat,[5] current head writer of Doctor Who, and produced by Marcus Wilson with Nick Hurran directing.[49] Moffat was developing ideas for the 50th anniversary episode as early as late 2011, when he stated that the team \\"knew what [they] want[ed] to do\\" and were \\"revving up\\" for the episode in an interview discussing his work on the 2011 film The Adventures of Tintin,[50] and began writing the script for \\"The Day of the Doctor\\" in late 2012, announcing that, as a security precaution, he had not produced any copies, instead keeping it on his computer \\"under lock and key\\" until it was needed.[51] Moffat stated prior to the episode's release, \\"Most things that have been said about the 50th are not true... Normally I am responsible for the disinformation and the rubbish rumorsI usually put them out myself, but I haven't needed to for this one.\\"[52] On the importance of the episode, Moffat has stated that it will \\"change the narrative\\" of Doctor Who.[53]\\r\\nMoffat stated in an interview with Doctor Who Magazine that he initially began the story process with the idea that it would be the Ninth Doctor, played by Christopher Eccleston, that would have been the incarnation that ended the Time War, in spite of misgivings in his own mind regarding it:\\r\\nYes, but do you know, I was always nervous of that one, because it doesn't fit with \\"Rose\\" at all. He is a brand new Doctor in \\"Rose\\", he's absolutely, definitely new. It couldn't have been is [sic] who pushed the button in the Time War, cos that's a new man, very explicitly, in that episode. I also had trouble, I have to be honest, imagining it being Paul McGann's Doctor[54][volume?&?issue?needed]\\r\\nOnce it became clear that Eccleston would decline to appear, Moffat turned to an alternative concept he had been formulating, featuring a \\"mayfly Doctor\\" who appears for a single episode, asking, \\"Would it be weird in the run of the series to have the 45th Doctor turn up and be played by Johnny Depp or someone? Would that be a cool thing to do?\\".[54] He also indicated that the \\"classic Doctor\\" he would most like to feature in a new story was William Hartnell's First Doctor, stating, \\"You'd want him to come and say 'What in the name of God have I turned into?' That's the confrontation that you most want to see, to celebrate 50 years. Going round and round in circles on it I just thought, 'What about a Doctor that he never talks about?' And what if it is a Doctor who's done something terrible, who's much deadlier and more serious, who represents that thing that is the undertow in both David and Matt. You know there's a terrible old man inside them. Well, here he is, facing the children he becomes, as it were.\\"[55]\\r\\nMoffat felt that it was important to bring something different to the return of Billie Piper, as she had returned as Rose Tyler in various cameo appearances throughout series 4, most prominently in the finale \\"The Stolen Earth\\"/\\"Journey's End\\", in which she had a central role, and The End of Time. This led to the development of the Moment, which had previously been referenced in The End of Time. Piper agreed with Moffat's sentiments, despite loving the character of Rose.[56]\\r\\nAlthough Smith and Tennant ended up starring in the episode, neither actor was under contract for the series at the time, and at one point Moffat devised a plotline featuring Coleman as the sole regular cast member in case either declined.[57] Knowing that Matt Smith was planning to leave, Moffat wrote the special specifically with the brief appearance of the Twelfth Doctor during the sequence of all of the Doctors uniting to save Gallifrey, prior to casting anyone in the role. Moffat later stated that it was his \\"plan from the start\\" that all the Doctors would fly in to save Gallifrey, and he knew there would be a new one at that time. He wrote it before knowing who would be cast.[58]\\r\\nTypically, Doctor Who's anniversary stories are named after the number of returning Doctors, as with The Three Doctors and The Five Doctors. Moffat explained his choice of title to SFX magazine, commenting that \\"... it's very rare in Doctor Who that the story happens to the Doctor. It happens to people around him, and he helps out ÿ he's the hero figure who rides in and saves everybody from the story of the week. He is not the story of the week. In this, he is the story of the week. This is the day of the Doctor. This is his most important day. His most important moment. This is the one he'll remember, whereas I often think the Doctor wanders back to his TARDIS and forgets all about it.\\"[59]\\r\\nBecause \\"The Day of the Doctor\\" was filmed in 3D, the episode took longer than usual to shoot, and every CGI shot had to be rendered twice.[60]\\r\\n\\"The Day of the Doctor\\" took approximately five weeks in 2013 to film; regular filming began on 28 March 2013 and ended on 4 May. The first three days of shooting28 March, 29 March, and 1 Apriltook place entirely at the show's Roath Lock studios in Porth Teigr, Cardiff Bay; some of the scenes set in the National Gallery and the Eleventh Doctor's TARDIS were filmed in the period.[location 1]\\r\\nFilming for the episode's outdoor scenes began on 2 April 2013.[35] The first outdoor scene was filmed at the Ivy Tower in Tonna, Neath.[location 2] The outdoor section of the scene involving Clara driving her motorcycle into the TARDIS, as well as the beginning of the sequence in which UNIT airlifts the TARDIS via helicopter, was filmed on Gelligaer Common Road in Bedlinog.[location 3] The remaining of the latter scene was later filmed on 6 April at MOD St Athan,[location 4] and on 9 April in Trafalgar Square, London.[61][location 5]\\r\\nOn 17 April 2013 Matt Smith, Jenna Coleman, Billie Piper and David Tennant filmed scenes in Chepstow, Monmouthshire, Wales, and some scenes were shot in Chepstow Castle.[62] On 2 May 2013, scenes in Cardiff were being filmed for scenes that take place at Totter's Lane and Coal Hill school, locations which had previously featured in the first 1963 serial An Unearthly Child, the 1985 serial Attack of the Cybermen, and the 1988 serial Remembrance of the Daleks.[63] Filming for the special was completed on Sunday 5 May 2013. From 4ÿ5 May 2013, Paul McGann returned to Doctor Who to record \\"The Night of the Doctor\\".[64] The final piece of filming for the special took place on 3 October, five months after principal photography wrapped, with Peter Capaldi filming his cameo, concurrent with filming his official first appearance for \\"The Time of the Doctor\\".[65]\\r\\nMiniatures constructed by Mike Tucker and his company The Model Unit were used in filming for the Time War sequences, including a model of a Time Lord staser cannon and the War Doctor flying his TARDIS into and subsequently destroying several Daleks. The Dalek models used were 18-inch voice interactive toys produced by Character Options. The technique of using Dalek toys as models for filming was a common method of presenting entire armies in the classic series.[66]\\r\\n\\"The Night of the Doctor\\", an additional 7-minute special, was released on 14 November 2013, and featured the Eighth Doctor (Paul McGann)'s regeneration into the War Doctor (John Hurt).[67] Another 4-minute special, entitled \\"The Last Day\\", was released on 20 November 2013 and saw the start of the Fall of Arcadia.[68]\\r\\nOn 4 November 2013, the BBC released the official synopsis: \\"The Doctors embark on their greatest adventure in this 50th anniversary special. In 2013, something terrible is awakening in Londons National Gallery; in 1562, a murderous plot is afoot in Elizabethan England; and somewhere in space an ancient battle reaches its devastating conclusion. All of reality is at stake as the Doctors own dangerous past comes back to haunt him.\\"[69]\\r\\nThe first trailer for the special was shown to attendees of San Diego Comic-Con in July 2013.[70] The BBC's decision not to release the trailer online to international fans was met with controversy.[71][72][73] On 26 July, the BBC responded to criticisms by saying the trailer was intended to be exclusive to Comic-Con attendees and that content for all other audiences would be forthcoming at a later date.[74]\\r\\nOn 28 September, the BBC revealed that the trailer for the special had been shot and was in post-production.[75] On 19 October 2013, a specially made teaser trailer, directed by Matt Losasso, was shown on BBC One, and was then subsequently posted online. It contained icons from the history of the show and had a monologue by Matt Smith, as well as body doubles and CGI to create shots of previous Doctors.[76][77]\\r\\nA clip from \\"The Day of the Doctor\\" was shown at the BBC's Children in Need show on Friday 15 November.[78] The official trailer for the episode aired in the United Kingdom at 8 pm GMT on 9 November. Due to the leak of a trailer earlier on 9 November on BBC Latin America's Facebook page, the BBC officially released it ahead of schedule. A second official trailer was shortly released later.[79]\\r\\nFurthermore, before the release of the main trailers, a short clip previewed the Eleventh Doctor and Clara examining a seemingly impossible painting. On 10 November 2013, a short clip of the Eleventh Doctor announcing \\"The clock is ticking\\" interrupted a BBC One ident.[80] This was followed on Monday 11 November by another ident interruption, with the Eleventh Doctor stating \\"It's all been leading to this...\\"[81]\\r\\nOn 28 September, the BBC unveiled a Twitter hashtag (#SaveTheDay) and an ident that was used to promote the special.[82] Respectively, the hashtag and the ident were shown before and after the premiere of Atlantis on BBC One. The hashtag was used to reveal all subsequent promotional material. On 7 November 2013, a video starring Smith in character as the Doctor was released promoting the hashtag, promising exclusive content. A website was launched to reveal the content.[83]\\r\\nThe BBC broadcast the episode in 94 countries simultaneously,[84] to avoid plot leaks.[8][85] It earned a Guinness World Record for the world's largest ever simulcast of a TV drama.[9] While not a technical simulcast of BBC One, a number of non-English translations were also transmitted at the same time as the BBC's broadcast.\\r\\nThe British Board of Film Classification rated the episode PG for mild violence and threat.[86] The Australian Classification Board also rated the episode PG for \\"mild science fiction themes and violence\\", noting there was \\"very mild impact\\" with regards to sexual themes.[87] The episode broadcast at 7:50pm in the UK,[88] and was preceded and followed by other Doctor Who related programmes and broadcasts, including broadcast of an after-party.\\r\\nCanadian provincial film censors rated \\"The Day of the Doctor\\" PG in Alberta,[89] G in Manitoba[90] and G in Quebec.[91]\\r\\nThe episode aired in over 100 countries on either 23 or 24 November 2013 in cinemas and on television.[92]\\r\\nThe episode originally aired on BBC One, BBC One HD, and in 3D on BBC One HD Red Button.

It began operating on May 4, 1980, having been created after the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare was split into the Department of Education and the Department of Health and Human Services by the Department of Education Organization Act (Public Law 96-88), which President Jimmy Carter signed into law on October 17, 1979.[3]\\r\\nThe Department of Education is administered by the United States Secretary of Education. It has approximately 4,400 employees and an annual budget of $68 billion (2016).[2] Its official abbreviation is \\"ED\\" (\\"DOE\\" refers to the United States Department of Energy) and is also often abbreviated informally as \\"DoEd\\".\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe primary functions of the Department of Education are to \\"establish policy for, administer and coordinate most federal assistance to education, collect data on US schools, and to enforce federal educational laws regarding privacy and civil rights.\\"[4] The Department of Education does not establish schools or colleges.[5]\\r\\nUnlike the systems of most other countries, education in the United States is highly decentralized, and the federal government and Department of Education are not heavily involved in determining curricula or educational standards (with the recent exception of the No Child Left Behind Act). This has been left to state and local school districts. The quality of educational institutions and their degrees is maintained through an informal private process known as accreditation, over which the Department of Education has no direct public jurisdictional control.\\r\\nThe Department's mission is: to promote student achievement and preparation for global competitiveness by fostering educational excellence and ensuring equal access.[6] Aligned with this mission of ensuring equal access to education, the Department of Education is a member of the United States Interagency Council on Homelessness,[7] and works with federal partners to ensure proper education for homeless and runaway youth in the United States.\\r\\nOpposition to the Department of Education mainly stems from conservatives, who see the department as an undermining of states rights, and libertarians who believe it results in a state-imposed leveling towards the bottom and low value for taxpayers' money.[8]\\r\\nFor 2006, the ED discretionary budget was $56 billion and the mandatory budget contained $23 billion.[10] In 2009 it received additional ARRA funding of $102 billion.[11] As of 2011, the discretionary budget is $70 billion.[10]\\r\\nA previous Department of Education was created in 1867 but was soon demoted to an Office in 1868.[12][13] As an agency not represented in the president's cabinet, it quickly became a relatively minor bureau in the Department of the Interior. In 1939, the bureau was transferred to the Federal Security Agency, where it was renamed the Office of Education. In 1953, the Federal Security Agency was upgraded to cabinet-level status as the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare.\\r\\nIn 1979, President Carter advocated for creating a cabinet-level Department of Education.[14] Carter's plan was to transfer most of the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare's education-related functions to the Department of Education.[14] Carter also planned to transfer the education-related functions of the departments of Defense, Justice, Housing and Urban Development, and Agriculture, as well as a few other federal entities.[14] Among the federal education-related programs that were not proposed to be transferred were Headstart, the Department of Agriculture's school lunch and nutrition programs, the Department of the Interior's Native Americans' education programs, and the Department of Labor's education and training programs.[14]\\r\\nUpgrading Education to cabinet level status in 1979 was opposed by many in the Republican Party, who saw the department as unconstitutional, arguing that the Constitution doesn't mention education, and deemed it an unnecessary and illegal federal bureaucratic intrusion into local affairs. However, many see the department as constitutional under the Commerce Clause, and that the funding role of the Department is constitutional under the Taxing and Spending Clause. The National Education Association supported the bill, while the American Federation of Teachers opposed it.[15]\\r\\nAs of 1979, the Office of Education had 3,000 employees and an annual budget of $12 billion.[16] Congress appropriated to the Department of Education an annual budget of $14 billion and 17,000 employees when establishing the Department of Education.[17] During the 1980 presidential campaign, Gov. Reagan called for the total elimination of the U.S. Department of Education, severe curtailment of bilingual education, and massive cutbacks in the federal role in education. Once in office, President Reagan significantly reduced its budget.[18]\\r\\nThe Republican Party platform of 1980 called for the elimination of the Department of Education created under Carter and President Ronald Reagan promised during the 1980 presidential election to eliminate it as a cabinet post,[19] but he was not able to do so with a Democratic House of Representatives.[20] In the 1982 State of the Union Address, he pledged: \\"The budget plan I submit to you on Feb. 8 will realize major savings by dismantling the Department of Education.\\"[20]\\r\\nBy 1984 the GOP had dropped the call for elimination from its platform, and with the election of President George H. W. Bush the Republican position evolved in almost lockstep with that of the Democrats, with Goals 2000 a virtual joint effort.\\r\\nAfter the Newt Gingrich-led \\"revolution\\" in 1994 had taken control of both Houses of Congress, federal control of and spending on education soared. That trend continued unabated despite the fact that the Republican Party made abolition of the Department a cornerstone of 1996 platform and campaign promises, calling it an inappropriate federal intrusion into local, state, and family affairs.[20] The GOP platform read: \\"The Federal government has no constitutional authority to be involved in school curricula or to control jobs in the market place. This is why we will abolish the Department of Education, end federal meddling in our schools, and promote family choice at all levels of learning.\\"[20]\\r\\nIn 2000, the Republican Liberty Caucus passed a resolution to abolish the Department of Education.[21] Abolition of the organization was not pursued under the George W. Bush administration, which made reform of federal education a key priority of the President's first term. In 2008 and 2012, presidential candidate Ron Paul campaigned in part on an opposition to the Department.[22]\\r\\nUnder President George W. Bush, the Department primarily focused on elementary and secondary education, expanding its reach through the No Child Left Behind Act. The Department's budget increased by $14 billion between 2002 and 2004, from $46 billion to $60 billion.[20]\\r\\nOn March 23, 2007, President George W. Bush signed into law H.R. 584, which designates the ED Headquarters building as the Lyndon B. Johnson Department of Education Building.[24]\\r\\nOn February 7, 2017, Representative Thomas Massie (R-KY) introduced H.R. 899, a bill to abolish the department. Massie's bill, which is one sentence long, states, \\"The Department of Education shall terminate on December 31, 2018.\\"[25]","input":"How many employees does department of education have?"},{"output":"July 2009","context":"The minimum wage in the United States is set by US labor law and a network of state, and local laws. Employers generally must pay workers the highest minimum wage prescribed by federal, state, and local law. As of July 2016, the federal government mandates a nationwide minimum wage of $7.25 per hour. As of October 2016, there are 29 states with a minimum wage higher than the federal minimum. From 2014 to 2015, nine states increased their minimum wage levels through automatic adjustments, while increases in 11 other states occurred through referendum or legislative action. In real terms, the federal minimum wage peaked near $10.00 per hour in 1968, using 2014 inflation-adjusted dollars.[1]\\r\\nBeginning in January 2017, Massachusetts and Washington will have the highest state minimum wages.[2] There is a racial difference for support of a higher minimum wage with most black and Hispanic individuals supporting a $15.00 federal minimum wage, and 54% of whites opposing it.[3] In 2015, about 3 percent of White, Asian, and Hispanic or Latino workers earned the federal minimum wage or less. Among Black workers, the percentage was about 4 percent.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1912, Massachusetts organized a commission to recommend non-compulsory minimum wages for women and children. Within eight years, at least thirteen U.S. states and the District of Columbia would pass minimum wage laws, with pressure being placed on state legislatures by the National Consumers League in a coalition with other women's voluntary associations and organized labor.[5][6] The United States Supreme Court of the Lochner era consistently invalidated compulsory minimum wage laws. Advocates for these minimum wage laws hoped that they would be upheld under the precedent of Muller v. Oregon, which had upheld maximum working hours laws for women on the grounds that women required special protection which men did not.[6] However, the Court did not extend this principle to minimum wage laws, considering the latter as interfering with the ability of employers to freely negotiate wage contracts with employees.[5]:518\\r\\nIn 1933, the Roosevelt administration made the first attempt at establishing a national minimum wage, when a $0.25 per hour standard was set as part of the National Industrial Recovery Act. However, in the 1935 court case Schechter Poultry Corp. v. United States (295 U.S. 495), the US Supreme Court declared the act unconstitutional, and the minimum wage was abolished. In 1938, the minimum wage was re-established pursuant to the Fair Labor Standards Act, once again at $0.25 per hour ($4.23 in 2015 dollars[8]). In 1941, the Supreme Court upheld the Fair Labor Standards Act in United States v. Darby Lumber Co., holding that Congress had the power under the Commerce Clause to regulate employment conditions.[9]\\r\\nThe 1938 minimum wage law only applied to \\"employees engaged in interstate commerce or in the production of goods for interstate commerce,\\" but in amendments in 1961 and 1966, the federal minimum wage was extended (with slightly different rates) to employees in large retail and service enterprises, local transportation and construction, state and local government employees, as well as other smaller expansions; a grandfather clause in 1990 drew most employees into the purview of federal minimum wage policy, which now set the wage at $3.80.[10]\\r\\nIn 2006, voters in six states (Arizona, Colorado, Missouri, Montana, Nevada, and Ohio) approved statewide increases in the state minimum wage. The amounts of these increases ranged from $1 to $1.70 per hour and all increases were designed to annually index to inflation.[11] Some politicians in the United States have advocated linking the minimum wage to the Consumer Price Index, thereby increasing the wage automatically each year based on increases to the Consumer Price Index. So far, Ohio, Oregon, Missouri, Vermont and Washington have linked their minimum wages to the consumer price index. Minimum wage indexing also takes place each year in Florida, San Francisco, California, and Santa Fe, New Mexico.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe federal minimum wage in the United States was reset to its current rate of $7.25 per hour in July 2009.[10] Some U.S. territories (such as American Samoa) are exempt. Some types of labor are also exempt: employers may pay tipped labor a minimum of $2.13 per hour, as long as the hour wage plus tip income equals at least the minimum wage. Persons under the age of 20 may be paid $4.25 an hour for the first 90 calendar days of employment (sometimes known as a youth, teen, or training wage) unless a higher state minimum exists.[12] The 2009 increase was the last of three steps of the Fair Minimum Wage Act of 2007, which was signed into law as a rider to the U.S. Troop Readiness, Veterans' Care, Katrina Recovery, and Iraq Accountability Appropriations Act, 2007, a bill that also contained almost $5 billion in tax cuts for small businesses.\\r\\nIn April 2014, the U.S. Senate debated the Minimum Wage Fairness Act (S. 1737; 113th Congress). The bill would have amended the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (FLSA) to increase the federal minimum wage for employees to $10.10 per hour over the course of a two-year period.[13] The bill was strongly supported by President Barack Obama and many of the Democratic Senators, but strongly opposed by Republicans in the Senate and House.[14][15][16] Later in 2014, voters in the Republican-controlled states of Alaska, Arkansas, Nebraska and South Dakota considered ballot initiatives to raise the minimum wage above the national rate of $7.25 per hour, which were successful in all 4 states. The results provided evidence that raising minimum wage has support across party lines.[17]\\r\\nSince 2012, a growing protest and advocacy movement called \\"Fight for $15\\", initially growing out of fast food worker strikes, has advocated for an increase in the minimum wage. On March 27, 2014, Connecticut passed legislation to raise the minimum wage from $8.70 to $10.10 by 2017, making it one of about six states to aim at or above $10.00 per hour.[18] In 2014 and 2015, several cities, including San Francisco, Seattle, Los Angeles, and Washington passed ordinances that gradually increase the minimum wage to $15.00.[19][20] In 2016, New York and California passed legislation that would gradually raise the minimum wage to $15 in each state.[21][22]\\r\\nAs of 2017, recent legislation was passed in multiple states to raise the minimum wage a certain amount in a certain amount of time. California is set to raise their minimum wage to $15.00/hour by January 1, 2023.[23] Colorado is set to raise their minimum wage from $9.30/hour to $12/hour by January 1, 2020, raising $0.90 per year.[24] Seattle passed legislation in 2015 for a raise in minimum wage; for employers of 500 or more employees without heath benefits, the minimum wage will be raised to $15.00/hour by 2017, for employees with heath benefits, the minimum wage will raise to $15.00/hour by 2018, for smaller employees the $15.00/hour wage will be reached at different times. Seattle is one of the first cities to put in place a plan that after $15.00/hour wage is reached, they will continue to increase minimum wage by a certain percentage every year based on inflation changes.[25] New York has also recently passed legislation to increase their minimum wage to $15.00/hour over time, certain counties and larger companies are set on faster plans than others.[26] As there have only been a few places mentioned, cities and states across the United States are putting in place certain legislation to increase the minimum wage for minimum wage workers to a livable wage. Time will only tell the effects on the economy and number of jobs in those cities and states.[27]\\r\\nOn June 2, 2014, the City Council of Seattle, Washington was the first city to pass a local ordinance to increase the minimum wage of the city to $15.00 per hour,[28] which will be phased in over seven years, to be fully implemented by 2021.[29] Numerous cities have followed Seattle's example since. San Francisco is expected to become the first U.S. city to reach a minimum wage of $15.00 per hour on July 1, 2018. [30] New York City's minimum wage will be $15.00 per hour by the end of 2018.[31] The minimum wage in Los Angeles and Washington, D.C., will be $15.00 per hour in 2020.[32][33] A growing number of California cities have enacted local minimum wage ordinances, including Los Angeles, San Francisco, Oakland, Berkeley, Emeryville, Mountain View, Richmond, and San Jose.\\r\\nIn September 2014, the Los Angeles City Council approved a minimum salary for hotel workers of $15.37 per hour.[34] In April 2016, The Los Angeles Times reported that there is an exemption for unionised workers, and interviewed longtime workers at unionised Sheraton Universal who make $10.00 per hour, whereas non-union employees at a non-union Hilton a few feet away make at least the $15.37 mandated by law for non-unionised employees.[35] Similar exemptions have been adopted in San Francisco, San Jose, Oakland, and Santa Monica.\\r\\nOn August 18, 2015, the El Cerrito City Council directed city staff to draft a local minimum wage ordinance based on a template provided by a coalition for a county-wide minimum wage effort. The details are not final, but the Council discussed an initial increase of roughly 28ÿ36% ($11.52 ÿ $12.25 or more) by January 1, 2016, with annual increases that will result in a $15.00 hourly wage rate by 2018ÿ2020. The Council did not direct staff to create small business exemptions (or any other exemptions), but a slower phase-in rate may be considered for employees of small businesses. The city will have outreach for residents and business owners to discuss the details of the proposed ordinance. Staff hopes to present a draft for The Council's approval as early as October or November 2015.[36]\\r\\nAs of December 2014, unions were exempt from recent minimum wage increases in Chicago, Illinois, SeaTac, Washington, and Milwaukee County, Wisconsin, as well as the California cities of Los Angeles, San Francisco, Long Beach, San Jose, Richmond, and Oakland.[37] In 2016, the Washington, D.C. Council passed a minimum wage ordinance that included a union waiver, but Mayor Vincent Gray vetoed it. Later that year, the council approved an increase without the union waiver.[38]\\r\\nSince its inception the purchasing power of the minimum wage has fluctuated. The minimum wage had its highest purchasing power in 1968, when it was $1.60 per hour ($11.49 in 2017 dollars).[8][1] From January 1981 to April 1990, the minimum wage was frozen at $3.35 per hour, then a record-setting minimum wage freeze. From September 1, 1997 through July 23, 2007, the federal minimum wage remained constant at $5.15 per hour, breaking the old record. From the United States Department of Labor. Employment Standards Administration. Wage and Hour Division, the source page has a clickable US map with current and projected state-by-state minimum wage rates for each state. Some government entities, such as counties and cities, observe minimum wages that are higher than the state as a whole. One notable example of this is Santa Fe, New Mexico, whose $9.50 per hour minimum wage was the highest in the nation,[39][40][41] until San Francisco increased its minimum wage to $9.79 in 2009.[42] Another device to increase wages, living wage ordinances, generally apply only to businesses that are under contract to the local government itself.\\r\\nSince 1984, the purchasing power of the federal minimum wage has decreased. Measured in real terms (adjusted for inflation) using 1984 dollars, the real minimum wage was $3.35 in 1984, $2.33 in 1994, $1.84 in 2004, and $1.46 in 2014[8]. If the minimum wage had been raised to $10.10 in 2014, that would have equated to $4.40 in 1984 dollars.[43][44] This would have been equal to a 31% increase in purchasing power, despite the nominal value of the minimum wage increasing by 216% in the same time period.\\r\\nThe economic effects of raising the minimum wage are controversial. Adjusting the minimum wage may affect current and future levels of employment, prices of goods and services, economic growth, income inequality and poverty. The interconnection of price levels, central bank policy, wage agreements, and total aggregate demand creates a situation in which the conclusions drawn from macroeconomic analysis are highly influenced by the underlying assumptions of the interpreter.[45]\\r\\nThe law of demand states thatall else being equalraising the price of any particular good or service will reduce the quantity demanded.[citation needed] Thus, neoclassical economics argues thatall else being equalraising in the minimum wage will have adverse affects on employment.\\r\\nConceptually, if an employer does not believe a worker generates value equal to or in excess of the minimum wage, that worker will not be hired or retained.[46]\\r\\nEmpirical work on fast food workers in the 1990s challenged the neoclassical model. In 1994, economists David Card and Alan Krueger studied employment trends among 410 restaurants in New Jersey and eastern Pennsylvania following New Jersey's minimum wage hike (from $4.25 to $5.05) in April 1992. They found \\"no indication that the rise in the minimum wage reduced employment.\\"[47] However, a 1995 re-analysis of the evidence by David Neumark found that the increase in New Jersey's minimum wage actually resulted in a 4.6% decrease in employment.[48] Neumark's study relied on payroll records from a sample of large fast-food restaurant chains, whereas the Card-Krueger study relied on business surveys.\\r\\nAdditional research conducted by David Neumark and William Wascher (which surveyed over 100 studies related to the employment effects of minimum wages) found that the majority of peer-reviewed economic research (about two-thirds) showed a positive correlation between minimum wage hikes and increased unemploymentespecially for young and unskilled workers. Neumark's analysis further found that, when looking at only the most credible research, 85% of studies showed a positive correlation between minimum wage hikes and increased unemployment.[49]\\r\\nIn February 2014, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) reported the theoretical effects of a federal minimum wage increase under two scenarios: an increase to $9.00 and an increase to $10.10. According to the report, approximately 100,000 jobs would be lost under the $9.00 option, whereas 500,000 jobs would be lost under the $10.10 option (with a wide range of possible outcomes).[50]\\r\\nA 2013 Center for Economic and Policy Research (CEPR) review of multiple studies since 2000 indicated that there was \\"little or no employment response to modest increases in the minimum wage.\\"[51] Another CEPR study in 2014 found that job creation within the United States is faster within states that raised their minimum wage.[52] In 2014, the state with the highest minimum wage in the nation, Washington, exceeded the national average for job growth in the United States.[53]\\r\\nA 2012 study led by Joseph Sabia, professor of economics at the University of New Hampshire, estimated that the 2004-6 New York State minimum wage increase (from $5.15 to $6.75) resulted in a 20.2% to 21.8% reduction in employment for less-skilled, less-educated workers.[54] Another study conducted by Joseph Sabia, then an assistant professor at American University, found that minimum wages were ineffective at alleviating poverty for single mothers. The study further concluded that a 10% increase in the minimum wage was associated with an 8.8% reduction in employment and an 11.8% reduction in hours for uneducated single mothers.[55]\\r\\nResearch conducted by Richard Burkhauser, professor emeritus of Policy Analysis at Cornell University, concluded that minimum wage increases \\"significantly reduce the employment of the most vulnerable groups in the working-age populationyoung adults without a high school degree (aged 20-24), young black adults and teenagers (aged 16-24), and teenagers (aged 16-19).\\"[56]\\r\\nA 2007 study by Daniel Aaronson and Eric French concluded that a 10% increase in the minimum wage decreased low-skill employment by 2-4% and total restaurant employment by 1-3%.[57]\\r\\nThe Economist wrote in December 2013: \\"A minimum wage, providing it is not set too high, could thus boost pay with no ill effects on jobs...Some studies find no harm to employment from federal or state minimum wages, others see a small one, but none finds any serious damage...High minimum wages, however, particularly in rigid labour markets, do appear to hit employment. France has the rich worlds highest wage floor, at more than 60% of the median for adults and a far bigger fraction of the typical wage for the young. This helps explain why France also has shockingly high rates of youth unemployment: 26% for 15- to 24-year-olds.\\"[58]\\r\\nConceptuallyall else being equalraising the minimum wage will increase the cost of labor.[citation needed] Thus, employers may accept lower profits, raise their prices, or both.[citation needed] If prices increase, consumers may demand a lesser quantity of the product, substitute other products, or switch to imported products.[citation needed] Marginal producers (those who are barely profitable enough to survive) may be forced out of business if they cannot raise their prices sufficiently to offset the higher cost of labor. Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago research from 2007 has shown that restaurant prices rise in response to minimum wage increases.[59]\\r\\nA 2016 White House report based on \\"back of envelope calculations and literature review\\" argued that higher hourly wages led to less crime.[60]\\r\\nA report by the Council of Economic Advisers claimed that \\"raising the minimum wage reduces crime by 3 to 5 percent.\\" To get those numbers, the study determined that \\"such a minimum wage increase would have no employment impacts, with an employment elasticity of 0.1 the benefits would be somewhat lower.\\"[60]\\r\\nHowever, In a 1987 journal article based on actual study data, Masanori Hashimoto noted that minimum wage hikes lead to increased levels of property crime in areas affected by the minimum wage after its increase.[61] According to the article, by decreasing employment in poor communities, total legal trade and production are curtailed. The report also claimed that in order to compensate for the decrease in legal avenues for production and consumption, poor communities increasingly turn to illegal trade and activity.[61]\\r\\nWhether growth (GDP, a measure of both income and production) increases or decreases depends significantly on whether the income shifted from owners to workers results in an overall higher level of spending. The tendency of a consumer to spend their next dollar is referred to as the marginal propensity to consume or MPC. The transfer of income from higher income owners (who tend to save more, meaning a lower MPC) to lower income workers (who tend to save less, with a higher MPC) can actually lead to an increase in total consumption and higher demand for goods, leading to increased employment.[50] Recent research has shown that higher wages lead to greater productivity.[62]\\r\\nThe CBO reported in February 2014 that income (GDP) overall would be marginally higher after raising the minimum wage, indicating a small net positive increase in growth. Raising the minimum wage to $10.10 and indexing it to inflation would result in a net $2 billion increase in income during the second half of 2016, while raising it to $9.00 and not indexing it would result in a net $1 billion increase in income.[50]\\r\\nAn increase in the minimum wage is a form of redistribution from higher-income persons (business owners or \\"capital\\") to lower income persons (workers or \\"labor\\") and therefore should reduce income inequality. The CBO estimated in February 2014 that raising the minimum wage under either scenario described above would improve income inequality. Families with income more than 6 times the poverty threshold would see their incomes fall (due in part to their business profits declining with higher employee costs), while families with incomes below that threshold would rise.[50]\\r\\nAmong hourly-paid workers In 2016, 701,000 earned the federal minimum wage and about 1.5 million earned wages below the minimum. Together, these 2.2 million workers represented 2.7% of all hourly-paid workers.[64]\\r\\nCBO estimated in February 2014 that raising the minimum wage would reduce the number of persons below the poverty income threshold by 900,000 under the $10.10 option versus 300,000 under the $9.00 option.[50]\\r\\nResearch conducted by David Neumark and colleagues found that minimum wages are associated with reductions in the hours and employment of low-wage workers.[65] A separate study by the same researchers found that minimum wages tend to increase the proportion of families with incomes below or near the poverty line.[66] Similarly, a 2002 study led by Richard Vedder, professor of economics at Ohio University, concluded that \\"The empirical evidence is strong that minimum wages have had little or no effect on poverty in the U.S. Indeed, the evidence is stronger that minimum wages occasionally increase poverty\\"[67]\\r\\nThe CBO reported in February 2014 that \\"[T]he net effect on the federal budget of raising the minimum wage would probably be a small decrease in budget deficits for several years but a small increase in budget deficits thereafter. It is unclear whether the effect for the coming decade as a whole would be a small increase or a small decrease in budget deficits.\\" On the cost side, the report cited higher wages paid by the government to some of its employees along with higher costs for certain procured goods and services. This might be offset by fewer government benefits paid, as some workers with higher incomes would receive fewer government transfer payments. On the revenue side, some would pay higher taxes and others less.[50]\\r\\nAccording to a survey conducted by economist Greg Mankiw, 79% of economists agreed that \\"a minimum wage increases unemployment among young and unskilled workers.\\"[70]\\r\\nA 2015 survey conducted by the University of New Hampshire Survey Center found that a majority of economists believed raising the minimum wage to $15 per hour would have negative effects on youth employment levels (83%), adult employment levels (52%), and the number of jobs available (76%). Additionally, 67% of economists surveyed believed that a $15 minimum wage would make it harder for small businesses with less than 50 employees to stay in business.[71]\\r\\nA 2006 survey conducted by Robert Whaples, professor of economics at Wake Forest University, found that, among the economists surveyed[How many?], opinions about the minimum wage were as follows:[72]\\r\\nIn 2014, over 600 economists signed a letter in support of increasing the minimum wage to $10.10 with research suggesting that a minimum wage increase could have a small stimulative effect on the economy as low-wage workers spend their additional earnings, raising demand and job growth.[73][74][75][76] Also, seven recipients of the Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences were among 75 economists endorsing an increase in the minimum wage for U.S. workers and said \\"the weight\\" of economic research shows higher pay doesnt lead to fewer jobs.[77][78]\\r\\nAccording to a February 2013 survey of the University of Chicago IGM Forum, which includes approximately 40 economists:\\r\\nAccording to a fall 2000 survey conducted by Fuller and Geide-Stevenson, 73.5% (27.9% of which agreed with provisos) of American economists surveyed[How many?] agreed that minimum wage laws increase unemployment among unskilled and young workers, while 26.5% disagreed with the statement.[80]\\r\\nEconomist Paul Krugman advocated raising the minimum wage moderately in 2013, citing several reasons, including:\\r\\nFormer President Bill Clinton advocated raising the minimum wage in 2014: \\"I think we ought to raise the minimum wage because it doesnt just raise wages for the three or four million people who are directly affected by it, it bumps the wage structure everywhere...The estimates are that 35 million Americans would get a pay raise if the federal minimum wage was raised...If you [raise the minimum wage] in a phased way, it always creates jobs. Why? Because people who make the minimum wage or near it are struggling to get by, they spend every penny they make, they turn it over in the economy, they create jobs, they create opportunity, and they take better care of their children. Its just the right thing to do, but its also very good economics.\\"[82]\\r\\nThe #RaiseTheWage movement is an activist movement that takes place on Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, and other social media platforms.[citation needed] The aim of this movement is to set the federal minimum wage to $15.00.[citation needed] While there is not definitive beginning to the movement, former president Barack Obama has been attributed[by whom?] with popularizing it in media with this commentof course, nothing helps families make ends meet like higher wages.  And to everyone in this Congress who still refuses to raise the minimum wage, I say this: If you truly believe you could work full-time and support a family on less than $15,000 a year, go try it. If not, vote to give millions of the hardest-working people in America a raise.[83] While the vast majority of #RaiseTheWage's influence is on social media there are a number of affiliated groups, and movements who have taken the movement to the streetsmainly through nonviolent protests.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe Pew Center reported in January 2014 that 73% of Americans supported raising the minimum wage from $7.25 to $10. By party, 53% of Republicans and 90% of Democrats favored this action.[84] Pew found a racial difference for support of a higher minimum wage in 2017 with most blacks and Hispanics supporting a $15.00 federal minimum wage, and 54% of whites opposing it.[3]\\r\\nA Lake Research Partners poll in February 2012 found the following:\\r\\nThis is a list of the minimum wages (per hour) in each state and territory of the United States, for jobs covered by federal minimum wage laws. If the job is not subject to the federal Fair Labor Standards Act, then state, city, or other local laws may determine the minimum wage.[86] A common exemption to the federal minimum wage is a company having revenue of less than $500,000 per year while not engaging in any interstate commerce.\\r\\nUnder the federal law, workers who receive a portion of their salary from tips, such as waitstaff, are required only to have their total compensation, including tips, meet the minimum wage. Therefore, often, their hourly wage, before tips, is less than the minimum wage.[87] Seven states, and Guam, do not allow for a tip credit.[88] Additional exemptions to the minimum wage include many seasonal employees, student employees, and certain disabled employees as specified by the FLSA.[89]\\r\\nIn addition, some counties and cities within states may observe a higher minimum wage than the rest of the state in which they are located; sometimes this higher wage will apply only to businesses that are under contract to the local government itself, while in other cases the higher minimum will be enforced across the board.\\r\\nThe average US minimum wage per capita (2017) is $8.49 based on the population size of each state and generally represents the average minimum wage experienced by a person working in one of the fifty US states. Cities, counties, districts, and territories are not included in the calculation.[citation needed] As of October 2016, there have been 29 states with a minimum wage higher than the federal minimum. From 2014 to 2015, nine states increased their minimum wage levels through automatic adjustments, while increases in 11 other states occurred through referendum or legislative action.[1] Beginning in January 2017, Massachusetts and Washington state have the highest minimum wages in the country, at $11.00 per hour.[94] New York City's minimum wage will be $15.00 per hour by the end of 2018.[95] |-\\r\\nFor employees working in Prince George's County, the minimum wage is $10.75 per hour, effective October 1, 2016, and increases to $11.50 on October 1, 2017.[132]\\r\\nFor employees working in Montgomery County, the minimum wage is $11.50 per hour starting July 1, 2017.[134] County Council bill 12-16 was enacted on January 17, 2017 to adjust the minimum wage to $15 and base future adjustments on the Consumer Price Index, but was later vetoed by the County Executive.[135][136]\\r\\nA 2016 law changed the minimum wage over the following six years. \\"Large\\" employers have 11 or more employees, and \\"small\\" have between 1 and 10. \\"Downstate\\" includes Nassau, Suffolk, and Westchester Counties.[160] NYC large employers: $11.00, NYC small employers: $10.50, Downstate employers: $10.00, Upstate employers: $9.70.

These rates range from a minimum of $5.08 to $7.25 per hour.\\r\\nIn accordance with a law signed on June 27, 2016,[193][194] the minimum wage will be $12.50 per hour as of July 1, 2017; $13.25 per hour as of July 1, 2018; 14.00 per hour as of July 1, 2019; and $15.00 per hour as of July 1, 2020.[195] As of each successive July 1, the minimum wage will increase by the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers in the Washington Metropolitan Statistical Area for the preceding twelve months.[195]\\r\\nThe minimum wage for tipped-employees will increase to $4.17 per hour as of July 1, 2018; $4.87 per hour as of July 1, 2019; and $5.55 per hour as of July 1, 2020.[195]\\r\\nThe minimum wage established by the federal government may be paid to newly hired individuals during their first 90 calendar days of employment, students employed by colleges and universities, and individuals under 18 years of age.[196]\\r\\nThe jobs that are most likely to be directly affected by the minimum wage are those which pay a wage close to the minimum.\\r\\nAccording to the May 2006 National Occupational Employment and Wage Estimates, the four lowest-paid occupational sectors in May 2006 (when the federal minimum wage was $5.15 per hour) were the following:[197]\\r\\nTwo years later, in May 2008, when the federal minimum wage was $5.85 per hour and was about to increase to $6.55 per hour in July 2008, these same sectors were still the lowest-paying, but their situation (according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data)[198] was:\\r\\nIn 2006, workers in the following 13 individual occupations received, on average, a median hourly wage of less than $8.00 per hour:[197]\\r\\nIn 2008, only two occupations paid a median wage less than $8.00 per hour:[198]\\r\\nAccording to the May 2009 National Occupational Employment and Wage Estimates,[199] the lowest-paid occupational sectors in May 2009 (when the federal minimum wage was $7.25 per hour) were the following:","input":"When was the national minimum wage last raised?"},{"output":"June 20, 2006","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nBlu-ray or Blu-ray Disc (BD) is a digital optical disc data storage format. It was designed to supersede the DVD format, and is capable of storing several hours of video in high-definition (HDTV 720p and 1080p) and ultra high-definition resolution (2160p). The main application of Blu-ray is as a medium for video material such as feature films and for the physical distribution of video games for the PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. The name \\"Blu-ray\\" refers to the blue laser (actually a violet laser) used to read the disc, which allows information to be stored at a greater density than is possible with the longer-wavelength red laser used for DVDs.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe plastic disc is 120 millimetres (4.7?in) in diameter and 1.2 millimetres (0.047?in) thick, the same size as DVDs and CDs.[5] Conventional or pre-BD-XL Blu-ray discs contain 25?GB per layer, with dual layer discs (50?GB) being the industry standard for feature-length video discs. Triple-layer discs (100?GB) and quadruple-layer discs (200/300 GB) are available for BD-XL re-writer drives.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nHigh-definition (HD) video may be stored on Blu-ray discs with up to 2160p resolution (3840G2160 pixels) and at up to 60 frames per second. DVD-Video discs were limited to a maximum resolution of 480p (NTSC, 720G480 pixels) or 576p (PAL, 720G576 pixels).[7] Besides these hardware specifications, Blu-ray is associated with a set of multimedia formats.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe BD format was developed by the Blu-ray Disc Association, a group representing makers of consumer electronics, computer hardware, and motion pictures. Sony unveiled the first Blu-ray disc prototypes in October 2000, and the first prototype player was released in April 2003 in Japan. Afterwards, it continued to be developed until its official release on June 20, 2006, beginning the high definition optical disc format war, where Blu-ray Disc competed with the HD DVD format. Toshiba, the main company supporting HD DVD, conceded in February 2008,[8] and later released its own Blu-ray Disc player in late 2009.[9] According to Media Research, high-definition software sales in the United States were slower in the first two years than DVD software sales.[10] Blu-ray faces competition from video on demand (VOD) and the continued sale of DVDs.[11] Notably, as of January 2016, 44% of U.S. broadband households had a Blu-ray player.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe information density of the DVD format was limited by the wavelength of the laser diodes used. Following protracted development, blue laser diodes operating at 405 nanometers became available on a production basis. Sony started two projects in collaboration with Philips[13] applying the new diodes: UDO (Ultra Density Optical),[14] and DVR Blue (together with Pioneer),[15] a format of rewritable discs that would eventually become Blu-ray Disc (more specifically, BD-RE). The core technologies of the formats are similar. The first DVR Blue prototypes were unveiled at the CEATEC exhibition in October 2000 by Sony.[16] A trademark for the \\"Blue Disc\\" logo was filed February 9, 2001.[17] On February 19, 2002, the project was officially announced as Blu-ray Disc,[18][19] and Blu-ray Disc Founders was founded by the nine initial members.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first consumer device arrived in stores on April 10, 2003: the Sony BDZ-S77, a $3,800 (US) BD-RE recorder that was made available only in Japan.[20] But there was no standard for prerecorded video, and no movies were released for this player. Hollywood studios insisted that players be equipped with digital rights management before they would release movies for the new format, and they wanted a new DRM system that would be more secure than the failed Content Scramble System (CSS) used on DVDs. On October 4, 2004, the name \\"Blu-ray Disc Founders\\" was officially changed to the Blu-ray Disc Association (BDA), and 20th Century Fox joined the BDA's Board of Directors.[21] The Blu-ray Disc physical specifications were completed in 2004.[22]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn January 2005, TDK announced that they had now developed an ultra-hard yet very thin polymer coating (\\"Durabis\\") for Blu-ray discs; this was a significant technical advance because a far tougher protection was desired in the consumer market to protect bare discs against scratching and damage compared to DVD, while technically Blu-ray Disc required a much thinner layer for the denser and higher frequency blue laser.[23] Cartridges, originally used for scratch protection, were no longer necessary and were scrapped. The BD-ROM specifications were finalized in early 2006.[24]\\r\\n\\r\\nAACS LA, a consortium founded in 2004,[25] had been developing the DRM platform that could be used to securely distribute movies to consumers. However, the final AACS standard was delayed,[26] and then delayed again when an important member of the Blu-ray Disc group voiced concerns.[27] At the request of the initial hardware manufacturers, including Toshiba, Pioneer, and Samsung, an interim standard was published that did not include some features, such as managed copy.[28]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first BD-ROM players (Samsung BD-P1000) were shipped in mid-June 2006, though HD DVD players beat them to market by a few months.[29][30] The first Blu-ray Disc titles were released on June 20, 2006: 50 First Dates, The Fifth Element, Hitch, House of Flying Daggers, Underworld: Evolution, xXx (all Sony), Twister (Warner Bros.), and MGM's The Terminator.[31] The earliest releases used MPEG-2 video compression, the same method used on standard DVDs. The first releases using the newer VC-1 and AVC formats were introduced in September 2006.[32] The first movies using 50?GB dual-layer discs were introduced in October 2006.[33] The first audio-only albums were released in May 2008.[34][35]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first mass-market Blu-ray Disc rewritable drive for the PC was the BWU-100A, released by Sony on July 18, 2006.[36] It recorded both single and dual-layer BD-Rs as well as BD-REs and had a suggested retail price of US $699. As of  June 2008[update], more than 2,500 Blu-ray Disc titles were available in Australia and the United Kingdom, with 3,500 in the United States and Canada.[37] In Japan, as of  July 2010[update], more than 3,300 titles have been released.[38]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe DVD Forum, chaired by Toshiba, was split over whether to develop the more expensive blue laser technology. In March 2002 the forum approved a proposal, which was endorsed by Warner Bros. and other motion picture studios. The proposal involved compressing HD video onto dual-layer standard DVD-9 discs.[39][40] In spite of this decision, however, the DVD Forum's Steering Committee announced in April that it was pursuing its own blue-laser high-definition video solution. In August, Toshiba and NEC announced their competing standard, Advanced Optical Disc.[41] It was finally adopted by the DVD Forum and renamed HD DVD the next year,[42] after being voted down twice by DVD Forum members who were also Blu-ray Disc Association membersa situation that drew preliminary investigations by the U.S. Department of Justice.[43]\\r\\n\\r\\nHD DVD had a head start in the high-definition video market, as Blu-ray Disc sales were slow to gain market share. The first Blu-ray Disc player was perceived as expensive and buggy, and there were few titles available.[44]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe appearance of the Sony PlayStation 3, which contained a Blu-ray Disc player for primary storage, helped support Blu-ray.[45] Sony also ran a more thorough and influential marketing campaign for the format.[46] AVCHD camcorders were also introduced in 2006. These recordings can be played back on many Blu-ray Disc players without re-encoding but are not compatible with HD DVD players. By January 2007, Blu-ray Discs had outsold HD DVDs,[47] and during the first three-quarters of 2007, BD outsold HD DVD by about two to one. At CES 2007, Warner proposed Total Hi Defa hybrid disc containing Blu-ray on one side and HD DVD on the other, but it was never released.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a June 28, 2007, press release, Twentieth Century Fox cited Blu-ray Disc's adoption of the BD+ anticopying system as key to their decision to support the Blu-ray Disc format.[48][49]\\r\\nOn January 4, 2008, a day before CES 2008, Warner Bros. (the only major studio still releasing movies in both HD DVD and Blu-ray Disc format) announced that it would release only in Blu-ray Disc after May 2008.[50] This effectively included other studios that came under the Warner umbrella, such as New Line Cinema and HBOthough in Europe, HBO distribution partner, the BBC, announced it would, while keeping an eye on market forces, continue to release product on both formats. This led to a chain reaction in the industry, with major U.S. retailers such as Best Buy, Walmart, and Circuit City and Canadian chains such as Future Shop dropping HD DVD in their stores. A then major European retailer, Woolworths, dropped HD DVD from its inventory.[51] Netflix and Blockbustermajor DVD rental companiessaid they would no longer carry HD DVD.\\r\\n\\r\\nFollowing these new developments, on February 19, 2008, Toshiba announced it would end production of HD DVD devices,[52] allowing Blu-ray Disc to become the industry standard for high-density optical discs. Universal Studios, the sole major movie studio to back HD DVD since its inception, said shortly after Toshiba's announcement: \\"While Universal values the close partnership we have shared with Toshiba, it is time to turn our focus to releasing new and catalog titles on Blu-ray Disc.\\"[53] Paramount Pictures, which started releasing movies only in HD DVD format during late 2007, also said it would start releasing in Blu-ray Disc. Both studios announced initial Blu-ray lineups in May 2008. With this, all major Hollywood studios supported Blu-ray.[54]\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to Media Research, high-definition software sales in the US were slower in the first two years than DVD software sales.[10] 16.3 million DVD software units were sold in the first two years (1997ÿ98) compared to 8.3 million high-definition software units (2006ÿ07).[10][55] One reason given for this difference was the smaller marketplace (26.5 million HDTVs in 2007 compared to 100 million SDTVs in 1998).[55] Former HD DVD supporter Microsoft did not make a Blu-ray Disc drive for the Xbox 360.[56] The 360's successor Xbox One features a Blu-ray drive, as does the PS4, with both supporting 3D Blu-ray after later firmware updates.[57][58]\\r\\n\\r\\nShortly after the \\"format war\\" ended, Blu-ray disc sales began to increase. A study by The NPD Group found that awareness of Blu-ray Disc had reached 60% of U.S. households. Nielsen VideoScan sales numbers showed that for some titles, such as 20th Century Fox's Hitman, up to 14% of total disc sales were from Blu-ray, although the average Blu-ray sales for the first half of the year were only around 5%. In December 2008, the Blu-ray Disc version of The Dark Knight sold 600,000 copies on the first day of its launch in the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom.[59] A week after the launch, The Dark Knight BD had sold over 1.7 million copies worldwide, making it the first Blu-ray Disc title to sell over a million copies in the first week of release.[60]\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to Singulus Technologies AG, Blu-ray is being adopted faster than the DVD format was at a similar period in its development. This conclusion was based on the fact that Singulus Technologies has received orders for 21 Blu-ray dual-layer machines during the first quarter of 2008, while 17 DVD machines of this type were made in the same period in 1997.[63] According to GfK Retail and Technology, in the first week of November 2008, sales of Blu-ray recorders surpassed DVD recorders in Japan.[64] According to the Digital Entertainment Group, the number of Blu-ray Disc playback devices (both set-top box and game console) sold in the U.S. had reached 28.5 million by the end of 2010.[62]\\r\\n\\r\\nBlu-ray faces competition from video on demand[65] and from new technologies that allow access to movies on any format or device, such as Digital Entertainment Content Ecosystem or Disney's Keychest.[66] Some commentators have suggested that renting Blu-ray will play a vital part in keeping the technology affordable while allowing it to move forward.[67] In an effort to increase sales, studios are releasing movies in combo packs with Blu-ray Discs and DVDs as well as digital copies that can be played on computers and mobile devices. Some are released on \\"flipper\\" discs with Blu-ray on one side and DVD on the other. Other strategies are to release movies with the special features only on Blu-ray Discs and none on DVDs.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Holographic Versatile Disc (HVD), described in the ECMA-377 standard, has been in development by The Holography System Development (HSD) Forum using a green writing/reading laser (532?nm) and a red positioning/addressing laser (650?nm). It is to offer MPEG-2, MPEG-4 AVC (H.264), HEVC (H.265), and VC-1 encoding, supporting a maximum storage capacity of 6TB.[68] No systems corresponding to the Ecma International HVD standard have been released.[69] Because the Blu-ray Disc format is upgradable it poses challenges to the adoption of the HVD format. 4K Blu-ray discs and players became available in the first quarter of 2016, having a storage capacity of up to 100?GB.[70][71]\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough the Blu-ray Disc specification has been finalized, engineers continue to work on advancing the technology. By 2005, quad-layer (128?GB) discs had been demonstrated on a drive with modified optics[72] and standard unaltered optics.[73] Hitachi stated that such a disc could be used to store 7?hours of 32?Mbit/s video (HDTV) or 3?hours and 30?minutes of 64?Mbit/s video (Ultra high definition television). In August 2006, TDK announced that they had created a working experimental Blu-ray Disc capable of holding 200?GB of data on a single side, using six 33?GB data layers.[74]\\r\\n\\r\\nAlso, behind closed doors at CES 2007, Ritek revealed that they had successfully developed a High Definition optical disc process that extends the disc capacity to ten layers, which increases the capacity of the discs to 250?GB. However, they noted that the major obstacle is that current read/write technology does not allow additional layers.[75] JVC has developed a three-layer technology that allows putting both standard-definition DVD data and HD data on a BD/(standard) DVD combination.[76] This would have enabled the consumer to purchase a disc that can be played on DVD players and can also reveal its HD version when played on a BD player.[77] Japanese optical disc manufacturer Infinity announced the first \\"hybrid\\" Blu-ray Disc/(standard) DVD combo, to be released February 18, 2009. This disc set of the TV series \\"Code Blue\\" featured four hybrid discs containing a single Blu-ray Disc layer (25?GB) and two DVD layers (9?GB) on the same side of the disc.[78]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn January 2007, Hitachi showcased a 100?GB Blu-ray Disc, consisting of four layers containing 25?GB each.[79] Unlike TDK and Panasonic's 100?GB discs, they claim this disc is readable on standard Blu-ray Disc drives that are currently in circulation, and it is believed that a firmware update is the only requirement to make it readable to current players and drives.[80]\\r\\nIn December 2008, Pioneer Corporation unveiled a 400?GB Blu-ray Disc (containing 16 data layers, 25?GB each) that will be compatible with current players after a firmware update. Its planned launch was in the 2009ÿ10 time frame for ROM and 2010ÿ13 for rewritable discs. Ongoing development was underway to create a 1?TB Blu-ray Disc.[81]\\r\\n\\r\\nAt CES 2009, Panasonic unveiled the DMP-B15, the first portable Blu-ray Disc player, and Sharp introduced the LC-BD60U and LC-BD80U series, the first LCD HDTVs with integrated Blu-ray Disc players. Sharp has also announced that they will sell HDTVs with integrated Blu-ray Disc recorders in the United States by the end of 2009. Set-top box recorders were not being sold in the U.S. for fear of unauthorized copying. However, personal computers with Blu-ray recorder drives were available. On January 1, 2010, Sony, in association with Panasonic, announced plans to increase the storage capacity on their Blu-ray Discs from 25?GB to 33.4?GB via a technology called i-MLSE (Maximum likelihood Sequence Estimation). The higher-capacity discs, according to Sony, would be readable on existing Blu-ray Disc players with a firmware upgrade.[82]This technology is later used on BDXL discs.[83]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn July 20, 2010, the research team of Sony and Japanese Tohoku University announced the joint development of a blue-violet laser,[84] to help create Blu-ray discs with a capacity of 1 TB using only two layers (and potentially more than 1 TB with additional layering). By comparison, the first blue laser was invented in 1996, with the first prototype discs coming four years later.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOn January 7, 2013, Sony announced that it would release \\"Mastered in 4K\\" Blu-ray Disc titles which are sourced at 4K and encoded at 1080p.[85] \\"Mastered in 4K\\" Blu-ray Disc titles can be played on existing Blu-ray Disc players and have a larger color space using xvYCC.[85][86] On January 14, 2013, Blu-ray Disc Association president, Andy Parsons, stated that a task force was created three months prior to conduct a study concerning an extension to the Blu-ray Disc specification that would add the ability to contain 4K Ultra HD video.[87][88]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn August 5, 2015, The Blu-ray Disc Association (BDA) announced it will commence licensing the Ultra HD Blu-ray format starting August 24, 2015. The Ultra HD Blu-ray format delivered high dynamic range content that significantly expanded the range between the brightest and darkest elements, expanded color range, high frame rate (up to 60fps) and up to 3840G2160 resolution, object-based sound formats, and an optional \\"digital bridge\\" feature. New players were required to play this format, which were able to play both DVDs, traditional Blu-rays and the new format. New Ultra HD Blu-ray discs hold up to 66?GB and 100?GB of data on dual and triple layer discs respectively.[89]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile a DVD uses a 650?nm red laser, Blu-ray Disc uses a 405?nm \\"blue\\" laser diode. Although the laser is called \\"blue\\", its color is actually in the violet range. The shorter wavelength can be focused to a smaller area, thus enabling it to read information recorded in pits that are less than half the size of those on a DVD, and can consequently be spaced more closely, resulting in a shorter track pitch, enabling a Blu-ray Disc to hold about five times the amount of information that can be stored on a DVD. The lasers are GaN (gallium nitride) laser diodes that produce 405?nm light directly, that is, without frequency doubling or other nonlinear optical mechanisms.[91] Conventional DVDs use 650?nm red lasers, and CDs use 780?nm near-infrared lasers.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe minimum \\"spot size\\" on which a laser can be focused is limited by diffraction and depends on the wavelength of the light and the numerical aperture of the lens used to focus it. By decreasing the wavelength, increasing the numerical aperture from 0.60 to 0.85, and making the cover layer thinner to avoid unwanted optical effects, designers can cause the laser beam to focus on a smaller spot, which effectively allows more information to be stored in the same area.[92] For Blu-ray Disc, the spot size is 580?nm.[93] This allows a reduction of the pit size from 400?nm for DVD to 150?nm for Blu-ray Disc, and of the track pitch from 740?nm to 320?nm.[92] See Compact Disc for information on optical discs' physical structure. In addition to the optical improvements, Blu-ray Discs feature improvements in data encoding that further increase the amount of content that can be stored.[94]\\r\\n\\r\\nSince the Blu-ray Disc data layer is closer to the surface of the disc compared to the DVD standard, it was more vulnerable to scratches in early designs.[95] The first discs were therefore housed in cartridges for protection, resembling Professional Discs introduced by Sony in 2003. Using a cartridge would increase the price of an already expensive medium, so designers chose hard-coating of the pickup surface instead. TDK was the first company to develop a working scratch-protection coating for Blu-ray Discs, naming it Durabis. In addition, both Sony's and Panasonic's replication methods include proprietary hard-coat technologies. Sony's rewritable media are spin-coated, using a scratch-resistant and antistatic coating. Verbatim's recordable and rewritable Blu-ray Discs use their own proprietary technology, called Hard Coat.[96]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Blu-ray Disc specification requires the testing of resistance to scratches by mechanical abrasion.[92] In contrast, DVD media are not required to be scratch-resistant, but since development of the technology, some companies, such as Verbatim, implemented hard-coating for more expensive lines of recordable DVDs.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe table shows the speeds available. Even the lowest speed (1x) is sufficient to play and record real-time 1080p video; the higher speeds are relevant for general data storage and more sophisticated handling of video.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe usable data rate of a Blu-ray Disc drive can be limited by the capacity of the drive's data interface. With a USB 2.0 interface, the maximum exploitable drive speed is 288?Mbit/s or 36?MB/s (also called 8G speed).[97] A USB 3.0 interface (with proper cabling) does not have this limitation,[98] nor do even the oldest version of Serial ATA (SATA, 150 MB/s)[99] nor the latest Parallel ATA (133 MB/s) standards. Blu-ray drives that are integrated into a computer (as opposed to physically separate and connected via a cable) typically have a SATA interface.[100]\\r\\n\\r\\nPre-recorded Blu-ray Disc titles usually ship in packages similar to but slightly smaller (18.5?mm shorter and 2?mm thinner: 135?mm x 171.5?mm x 13?mm.[101]), as well as more rounded than a standard DVD keep case,  generally with the format prominently displayed in a horizontal stripe across the top of the case (translucent blue for Blu-ray video discs, clear for Blu-ray 3D video releases, red for PlayStation 3 Greatest Hits Games, transparent for regular PlayStation 3 games, transparent dark blue for PlayStation 4 games, transparent green for Xbox One games and black for Ultra HD Blu-ray video releases). Warren Osborn and The Seastone Media Group, LLC created the package that was adopted worldwide following the Blu-ray vs. HD DVD market adoption choice.[102] Because of the fact that Blu-ray cases are smaller than DVD cases, more Blu-Rays than DVDs can fit on a shelf, making Blu-ray an arguably better choice for situations with limited storage space.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe \\"Mini Blu-ray Disc\\" (also, \\"Mini-BD\\" and \\"Mini Blu-ray\\") is a compact 8?cm (~3?in)-diameter variant of the Blu-ray Disc that can store 7.8?GB of data in its single layer configuration, or 15.6?GB on a dual layer disc.[103] It is similar in concept to the MiniDVD and MiniCD. Recordable (BD-R) and rewritable (BD-RE) versions of Mini Blu-ray Disc have been developed specifically for compact camcorders and other compact recording devices.[104]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\"Blu-ray Disc recordable\\" refers to two optical disc formats that can be recorded with an optical disc recorder. BD-Rs can be written to once, whereas BD-REs can be erased and re-recorded multiple times. The current practical maximum speed for Blu-ray Discs is about 12G (54?MB/s).[105](1.7) Higher speeds of rotation (10,000+ rpm) cause too much wobble for the discs to be written properly,[citation needed] as with the 20G (27.7?MB/s) and 52G(7.8?MB/s) maximum speeds, respectively, of standard DVDs and CDs. Since September 2007, BD-RE is also available in the smaller 8?cm Mini Blu-ray Disc size.[104][106]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn September 18, 2007, Pioneer and Mitsubishi codeveloped BD-R LTH (\\"Low to High\\" in groove recording), which features an organic dye recording layer that can be manufactured by modifying existing CD-R and DVD-R production equipment, significantly reducing manufacturing costs.[107] In February 2008, Taiyo Yuden, Mitsubishi, and Maxell released the first BD-R LTH Discs,[108] and in March 2008, Sony's PlayStation 3 officially gained the ability to use BD-R LTH Discs with the 2.20 firmware update.[109] In May 2009 Verbatim/Mitsubishi announced the industry's first 6X BD-R LTH media, which allows recording a 25?GB disc in about 16 minutes.[110] Unlike with the previous releases of 120?mm optical discs (i.e. CDs and standard DVDs), Blu-ray recorders hit the market almost simultaneously with Blu-ray's debut.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe BD9 format was proposed to the Blu-ray Disc Association by Warner Home Video as a cost-effective alternative to the 25/50?GB BD-ROM discs. The format was supposed to use the same codecs and program structure as Blu-ray Disc video but recorded onto less expensive 8.5?GB dual-layer DVD. This red-laser media could be manufactured on existing DVD production lines with lower costs of production than the 25/50?GB Blu-ray media.[111]\\r\\n\\r\\nUsage of BD9 for releasing content on \\"pressed\\" discs never caught on. With the end of the format war, manufacturers ramped production of Blu-ray Discs and lowered prices to compete with DVDs. On the other hand, the idea of using inexpensive DVD media became popular among individual users. A lower-capacity version of this format that uses single-layer 4.7?GB DVDs has been unofficially called BD5. Both formats are being used by individuals for recording high definition content in Blu-ray format onto recordable DVD media.[112][113] Despite the fact that the BD9 format has been adopted as part of the BD-ROM basic format, none of the existing Blu-ray player models explicitly claim to be able to read it. Consequently, the discs recorded in BD9 and BD5 formats are not guaranteed to play on standard Blu-ray Disc players. AVCHD and AVCREC also use inexpensive media like DVDs, but unlike BD9 and BD5 these formats have limited interactivity, codec types, and data rates. As of March 2011, BD9 was removed as an official BD-ROM disc.[114]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe BDXL format allows 100?GB and 128?GB write-once discs,[115][116] and 100?GB rewritable discs for commercial applications. It was defined in June 2010.[citation needed] BD-R 3.0 Format Specification (BDXL) defined a multi-layered disc recordable in BDAV format with the speed of 2G and 4G, capable of 100/128?GB and usage of UDF2.5/2.6.[117] BD-RE 4.0 Format Specification (BDXL) defined a multi-layered disc rewritable in BDAV with the speed of 2G and 4G, capable of 100?GB and usage of UDF2.5 as file system.[118]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe IH-BD (Intra-Hybrid Blu-ray) format includes a 25?GB rewritable layer (BD-RE) and a 25?GB write once layer (BD-ROM), designed to work with existing Blu-ray Discs.[115][116]\\r\\n\\r\\nBlu-ray Disc specifies the use of Universal Disk Format (UDF) 2.50 as a convergent friendly format for both PC and consumer electronics environments. It is used in the latest specifications of BD-ROM, BD-RE, and BD-R.[119][120][121] In the first BD-RE specification (defined in 2002), the BDFS (Blu-ray Disc File System) was used. The BD-RE 1.0 specification was defined mainly for the digital recording of high-definition television (HDTV) broadcast television. The BDFS was replaced by UDF 2.50 in the second BD-RE specification in 2005, in order to enable interoperability among consumer electronics Blu-ray recorders and personal computer systems. These optical disc recording technologies enabled PC recording and playback of BD-RE.[121][122][123] BD-R can use UDF 2.50/2.60.[124]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Blu-ray Disc application for recording of digital broadcasting has been developed as System Description Blu-ray Rewritable Disc Format part 3 Audio Visual Basic Specifications (BDAV). The requirements related with computer file system have been specified in System Description Blu-ray Rewritable Disc Format part 2 File System Specifications version 1.0 (BDFS).[125] Initially, the BD-RE version 1.0 (BDFS) was specifically developed for recording of digital broadcasts using the Blu-ray Disc application (BDAV application). But these requirements are superseded by the Blu-ray Rewritable Disc File System Specifications version 2.0 (UDF) (a.k.a. RE 2.0) and Blu-ray Recordable Disc File System Specifications version 1.0 (UDF) (a.k.a. R 1.0). Additionally, a new application format, BDMV (System Description Blu-ray Disc Prerecorded Format part 3 Audio Visual Basic Specifications) for High Definition Content Distribution was developed for BD-ROM. The only file system developed for BDMV is the System Description Blu-ray Read-Only Disc Format part 2 File System Specifications version 1.0 (UDF) which defines the requirements for UDF 2.50.[121][125]\\r\\n\\r\\nAll BDMV application files are stored under a BDMV directory.[130][131][132][133]\\r\\n\\r\\nAudio, video, and other streams are multiplexed and stored on Blu-ray Discs in a container format based on the MPEG transport stream. It is also known as BDAV MPEG-2 transport stream and can use filename extension .m2ts.[130][134] Blu-ray Disc titles authored with menus are in the BDMV (Blu-ray Disc Movie) format and contain audio, video, and other streams in BDAV container.[135][136] There is also the BDAV (Blu-ray Disc Audio/Visual) format, the consumer oriented alternative to the BDMV format used for movie releases. The BDAV format is used on BD-REs and BD-Rs for audio/video recording.[136] BDMV format was later defined also for BD-RE and BD-R (in September 2006, in the third revision of BD-RE specification and second revision of BD-R specification).[119][120]\\r\\n\\r\\nBlu-ray Disc employs the MPEG transport stream recording method. That enables transport streams of digital broadcasts to be recorded as they are broadcast, without altering the format.[137] It also enables flexible editing of a digital broadcast that is recorded as is and where the data can be edited just by rewriting the playback stream. Although it is quite natural, a function for high-speed and easy-to-use retrieval is built in.[137][138] Blu-ray Disc Video use MPEG transport streams, compared to DVD's MPEG program streams. An MPEG transport stream contains one or more MPEG program streams, so this allows multiple video programs to be stored in the same file so they can be played back simultaneously (e.g. with \\"picture-in-picture\\" effect).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe BD-ROM specification mandates certain codec compatibilities for both hardware decoders (players) and movie software (content).[134][139] Windows Media Player does not come with the codecs required to play Blu-ray discs.[140]\\r\\n\\r\\nOriginally BD-ROMs stored video up to 1920G1080 pixel resolution at up to 60 (59.94) fields per second. Currently with UHD BD-ROM videos can be stored at a maximum of 3840G2160 pixel resolution at up to 60 (59.94) frames per second, progressively scanned.  While most current Blu-ray players and recorders can read and write 1920G1080 video at the full 59.94p and 50p progressive format, new players for the UHD specifications will be able to read at 3840G2160 video at either 59.94p and 50p formats.\\r\\n\\r\\n^ a Interlaced formats are listed in fields per second.\\r\\n^ b MPEG-2 at 1440G1080 was previously not included in a draft version of the specification from March 2005.[143]\\r\\n\\r\\nFor video, all players are required to process H.262/MPEG-2 Part 2, H.264/MPEG-4 Part 10: AVC, and SMPTE VC-1.[144] BD-ROM titles with video must store video using one of the three mandatory formats; multiple formats on a single title are allowed. Blu-ray Disc allows video with a bit depth of 8-bits per color YCbCr with 4:2:0 chroma subsampling.[145][146] The choice of formats affects the producer's licensing/royalty costs as well as the title's maximum run time, due to differences in compression efficiency. Discs encoded in MPEG-2 video typically limit content producers to around two hours of high-definition content on a single-layer (25?GB) BD-ROM. The more-advanced video formats (VC-1 and MPEG-4 AVC) typically achieve a video run time twice that of MPEG-2, with comparable quality.\\r\\n\\r\\nMPEG-2 was used by many studios (including Paramount Pictures, which initially used the VC-1 format for HD DVD releases) for the first series of Blu-ray Discs, which were launched throughout 2006.[147] Modern releases are now often encoded in either MPEG-4 AVC or VC-1, allowing film studios to place all content on one disc, reducing costs and improving ease of use. Using these formats also frees a lot of space for storage of bonus content in HD (1080i/p), as opposed to the SD (480i/p) typically used for most titles. Some studios, such as Warner Bros., have released bonus content on discs encoded in a different format than the main feature title. For example, the Blu-ray Disc release of Superman Returns uses VC-1 for the feature film and MPEG-2 for some of its bonus content.[148] Today, Warner and other studios typically provide bonus content in the video format that matches the feature.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor audio, BD-ROM players are required to implement Dolby Digital (AC-3), DTS, and linear PCM. Players may optionally implement Dolby Digital Plus and DTS-HD High Resolution Audio as well as lossless formats Dolby TrueHD and DTS-HD Master Audio.[149] BD-ROM titles must use one of the mandatory schemes for the primary soundtrack. A secondary audiotrack, if present, may use any of the mandatory or optional codecs.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor users recording digital television programming, the recordable Blu-ray Disc standard's initial data rate of 36?Mbit/s is more than adequate to record high-definition broadcasts from any source (IPTV, cable/satellite, or terrestrial). BD Video movies have a maximum data transfer rate of 54?Mbit/s, a maximum AV bitrate of 48?Mbit/s (for both audio and video data), and a maximum video bit rate of 40?Mbit/s. This compares to HD DVD movies, which have a maximum data transfer rate of 36?Mbit/s, a maximum AV bitrate of 30.24?Mbit/s, and a maximum video bitrate of 29.4?Mbit/s.[151]\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the 2005 JavaOne trade show, it was announced that Sun Microsystems' Java cross-platform software environment would be included in all Blu-ray Disc players as a mandatory part of the standard.[152] Java is used to implement interactive menus on Blu-ray Discs, as opposed to the method used on DVD-video discs. DVDs use pre-rendered MPEG segments and selectable subtitle pictures, which are considerably more primitive and rarely seamless. At the conference, Java creator James Gosling suggested that the inclusion of a Java virtual machine, as well as network connectivity in some BD devices, will allow updates to Blu-ray Discs via the Internet, adding content such as additional subtitle languages and promotional features not included on the disc at pressing time.[153] This Java Version is called BD-J and is built on a profile of the Globally Executable MHP (GEM) standard; GEM is the worldwide version of the Multimedia Home Platform standard.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe BD-ROM specification defines four Blu-ray Disc player profiles, including an audio-only player profile (BD-Audio) that does not require video decoding or BD-J. All of the video-based player profiles (BD-Video) are required to have a full implementation of BD-J.\\r\\n\\r\\n^ a This is used for storing audio/video and title updates. It can either be built-in memory or removable media, such as a memory card or USB flash memory.\\r\\n^ b A secondary audio decoder is typically used for interactive audio and commentary.\\r\\n^ c Profile 3.0 is a separate audio-only player profile. The first Blu-ray Disc album to be released was Divertimenti, by record label Lindberg Lyd, and it has been confirmed to work on the PS3.[154][155]^ d Also known as Initial Standard profile.\\r\\n^ e Also known as Final Standard profile.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn November 2, 2007, the Grace Period Profile was superseded by Bonus View as the minimum profile for new BD-Video players released to the market.[156] When Blu-ray Disc software not authored with interactive features dependent on Bonus View or BD-Live hardware capabilities is played on Profile 1.0 players, it is able to play the main feature of the disc, but some extra features may not be available or will have limited capability.[157]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe biggest difference between Bonus View and BD-Live is that BD-Live requires the Blu-ray Disc player to have an Internet connection to access Internet-based content. BD-Live features have included Internet chats, scheduled chats with the director, Internet games, downloadable featurettes, downloadable quizzes, and downloadable movie trailers.[158][159][160] While some Bonus View players may have an Ethernet port, it is used for firmware updates and is not used for Internet-based content.[161] In addition, Profile 2.0 also requires more local storage in order to handle this content.\\r\\n\\r\\nProfile 1.0 players are not eligible for Bonus View or BD-Live compliant upgrades and do not have the function or capability to access these upgrades, with the exception of the latest players and the PlayStation 3. Internet is required to use.[162][163][164]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs with the implementation of region codes for DVDs, Blu-ray Disc players sold in a specific geographical region are designed to play only discs authorized by the content provider for that region. This is intended to permit content providers (motion picture studios, television production company etc.) to enact regional price discrimination. According to the Blu-ray Disc Association, all Blu-ray Disc players and Blu-ray Disc-equipped computer systems are required to enforce regional coding. However, content providers need not use region playback codes.[166] Some current estimates suggest 70% of available [movie] Blu-ray Discs from the major studios are region-code-free and can, therefore, be played on any Blu-ray Disc player, in any region.[167]\\r\\n\\r\\nMovie distributors have different region coding policies. Among major U.S. studios, Walt Disney Pictures, Warner Bros., Paramount Pictures, Universal Studios, and Sony Pictures have released most of their titles region-free.[168][169][170][171][172][173] MGM and Lions Gate Entertainment have released a mix of region-free and region-coded titles.[174][175] 20th Century Fox has released most of their titles region-coded.[176] Vintage film restoration and distribution company The Criterion Collection uses US region coding in all Blu-ray releases.[177][178]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Blu-ray Disc region coding scheme divides the world into three regions, labeled A, B, and C.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn circumvention of region coding restrictions, stand-alone Blu-ray Disc players are sometimes modified by third parties to allow for playback of Blu-ray Discs (and DVDs) with any region code.[179] Instructions (\\"hacks\\") describing how to reset the Blu-ray region counter of computer player applications to make them multi-region indefinitely are also regularly posted to video enthusiast websites and forums. Unlike DVD region codes, Blu-ray region codes are verified only by the player software, not by the optical drive's firmware.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe latest type of Blu-Ray disc, suitable for UltraHD content, is region-free.[180]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Blu-ray Disc format employs several layers of digital rights management (DRM) which restrict the usage of the discs.[181][182] This has led to extensive criticism of the format by organizations opposed to DRM, such as the Free Software Foundation,[183] and consumers because new releases require player firmware updates to allow disc playback.[184][185]\\r\\n\\r\\nBlu-ray equipment is required to implement the High-bandwidth Digital Content Protection (HDCP) system to encrypt the data sent by players to rendering devices through physical connections. This is aimed at preventing the copying of copyrighted content as it travels across cables. Through a protocol flag in the media stream called the Image Constraint Token (ICT), a Blu-ray Disc can enforce its reproduction in a lower resolution whenever a full HDCP-compliant link is not used. In order to ease the transition to high definition formats, the adoption of this protection method was postponed until 2011.[186]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Advanced Access Content System (AACS) is a standard for content distribution and digital rights management. It was developed by AS Licensing Administrator, LLC (AACS LA), a consortium that includes Disney, Intel, Microsoft, Panasonic, Warner Bros., IBM, Toshiba, and Sony. Since the appearance of the format on devices in 2006, several successful attacks have been made on it. The first known attack relied on the trusted client problem. In addition, decryption keys have been extracted from a weakly protected player (WinDVD). Since keys can be revoked in newer releases,[187] this is only a temporary attack, and new keys must continually be discovered in order to decrypt the latest discs.\\r\\n\\r\\nBD+ was developed by Cryptography Research Inc. and is based on their concept of Self-Protecting Digital Content.[188] BD+, effectively a small virtual machine embedded in authorized players, allows content providers to include executable programs on Blu-ray Discs. Such programs can:[181]\\r\\n\\r\\nIf a playback device manufacturer finds that its devices have been hacked, it can potentially release BD+ code that detects and circumvents the vulnerability. These programs can then be included in all new content releases.[189] The specifications of the BD+ virtual machine are available only to licensed device manufacturers. A list of licensed commercial adopters is available from the BD+ website.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first titles using BD+ were released in October 2007. Since November 2007, versions of BD+ protection have been circumvented by various versions of the AnyDVD HD program.[190][191] Other programs known to be capable of circumventing BD+ protection are DumpHD (versions 0.6 and above, along with some supporting software),[192] MakeMKV,[193] and two applications from DVDFab (Passkey and HD Decrypter[194]).\\r\\n\\r\\nBD-ROM Mark is a small amount of cryptographic data that is stored separately from normal Blu-ray Disc data, aiming to prevent replication of the discs. The cryptographic data is needed to decrypt the copyrighted disc content protected by AACS.[195] A specially licensed piece of hardware is required to insert the ROM-Mark into the media during mastering. During replication, this ROM Mark is transferred together with the recorded data to the disc. In consequence, any copies of a disc made with a regular recorder will lack the ROM-Mark data and will be unreadable on standard players.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Blu-ray Disc Association recommends but does not require that Blu-ray Disc drives be capable of reading standard DVDs and CDs, for backward compatibility.[196] Most Blu-ray Disc players are capable of reading both CDs and DVDs; however, a few of the early Blu-ray Disc players released in 2006, such as the Sony BDP-S1, could play DVDs but not CDs.[197][198][199] In addition, Blu-ray players cannot play HD DVDs, and HD DVD players cannot play Blu-ray discs. Some Blu-ray players can also play Video CDs, and all 4k Blu-ray players can play regular Blu-ray discs, and most can play DVDs and CDs. The PlayStation 4 does not support CDs.\\r\\n\\r\\nHigh Fidelity Pure Audio (HFPA) is a marketing initiative, spearheaded by the Universal Music Group, for audio-only Blu-ray optical discs. Launched in 2013 as a potential successor to the Compact disc, it has been compared with DVD-A and SACD, which had similar aims.\\r\\n\\r\\nAVCHD was originally developed as a high definition format for consumer tapeless camcorders. Derived from the Blu-ray Disc specification, AVCHD shares a similar random access directory structure but is restricted to lower audio and video bitrates, simpler interactivity, and the use of AVC-video and Dolby AC-3 (or linear PCM) audio. Being primarily an acquisition format, AVCHD playback is not recognized by all devices that play Blu-ray Disc. Nevertheless, many such devices are capable of playing AVCHD recordings from removable media, such as DVDs, SD/SDHC memory cards, \\"Memory Stick\\" cards, and hard disk drives.[200]\\r\\n\\r\\nAVCREC uses a BDAV container to record high definition content on conventional DVDs.[201] Presently AVCREC is tightly integrated with the Japanese ISDB broadcast standard and is not marketed outside of Japan. AVCREC is used primarily in set-top digital video recorders and in this regard is comparable to HD REC.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Blu-ray Disc Association (BDA) created a task force made up of executives from the film industry and the consumer electronics and IT sectors to help define standards for putting 3D film and 3D television content on a Blu-ray Disc.[202] On December 17, 2009, the BDA officially announced 3D specs for Blu-ray Disc, allowing backward compatibility with current 2D Blu-ray players.[203] The BDA has said, \\"The Blu-ray 3D specification calls for encoding 3D video using the \\"Stereo High\\" profile defined by Multiview Video Coding (MVC), an extension to the ITU-T H.264 Advanced Video Coding (AVC) codec currently implemented by all Blu-ray Disc players. MPEG4-MVC compresses both left and right eye views with a typical 50% overhead compared to equivalent 2D content, and can provide full 1080p resolution backward compatibility with current 2D Blu-ray Disc players.\\"[204] This means the MVC (3D) stream is backward compatible with H.264/AVC (2D) stream, allowing older 2D devices and software to decode stereoscopic video streams, ignoring additional information for the second view.\\r\\n\\r\\nSony added Blu-ray 3D support to its PlayStation 3 console via a firmware upgrade on 21 September 2010.[205] The console had previously gained 3D gaming capability via an update on 21 April 2010.[206] Since the version 3.70 software update in August 9, 2011, the PlayStation 3 can play DTS-HD Master Audio and DTS-HD High Resolution Audio while playing 3D Blu-ray.[207] Dolby TrueHD is used on a small minority of Blu-ray 3D releases, and bitstreaming implemented in slim PlayStation 3 models only (original \\"fat\\" PS3 models decode internally and send audio as LPCM).[208]\\r\\n\\r\\nUltra HD Blu-ray is a new disc format, incompatible with existing Blu-ray Disc players, that supports 60fps 4K UHD video encoded in HEVC with 10-bit HDR and a wider color gamut.","input":"When was the first blu ray player released?"},{"output":"Virad Tyagi","context":"Sabse Bada Kalakar is an auditioning Reality show on Sony TV Channel.

In his adult years he became a member of the Fenians.\\r\\nBarrett was the last man to be publicly hanged in England, for his part in the Clerkenwell explosion in December 1867.[1] The bombing killed 12?bystanders and severely injured many more. Barrett was arrested with several others in a wide ranging sweep of sympathisers with the Irish cause and was the only one found guilty.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMichael Barrett was born in 1841.[2] At the age of 27 he joined the Fenians, which, in the 1860s, was a political movement that dominated Irish politics and defied the Catholic Church and middle-class nationalists who advocated milder approaches. Tens of thousands of Irishmen in both Ireland and Great Britain were recruited into its ranks.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe Clerkenwell bombing was the most infamous action carried out by the Fenians in Britain. It resulted in a long-lived backlash that fomented much hostility against the Irish community in Britain.\\r\\nThe events that led up to the bombing started with the arrest, in November 1867, of Richard O'Sullivan-Burke, a senior Fenian arms agent who planned the \\"prison-van escape\\" in Manchester a few months earlier. O'Sullivan-Burke was subsequently imprisoned on remand in the Middlesex House of Detention, Clerkenwell. On 13 December an attempt to rescue him was made by blowing a hole in the prison wall. The explosion was seriously misjudged; it demolished not only a large section of the wall, but also a number of tenement houses opposite in Corporation Lane (now Row) resulting in 12 people being killed and over 50 suffering a range of injuries.\\r\\nThe bombing had a traumatic effect on British working-class opinion. Karl Marx, then living in London, observed:\\r\\nThe London masses, who have shown great sympathy towards Ireland, will be made wild and driven into the arms of a reactionary government. One cannot expect the London proletarians to allow themselves to be blown up in honour of Fenian emissaries.\\r\\nThe Radical, Charles Bradlaugh, condemned the incident in his newspaper The National Reformer as an act \\"calculated to destroy all sympathy, and to evoke the opposition of all classes\\".\\r\\nThe day before the explosion, the Prime Minister, Benjamin Disraeli, had banned all political demonstrations in London in an attempt to put a stop to the weekly meetings and marches that were being held in support of the Fenians. He had feared that the ban might be challenged, but the explosion had the effect of turning public opinion in his favour.\\r\\nMonths earlier, Barrett had been arrested in Glasgow for illegally discharging a firearm and allegedly false evidence was used to implicate him in the Clerkenwell Prison explosion which occurred the previous December.[3]\\r\\nIn court, he produced witnesses who testified that he had been in Scotland on the date of the incident. The main case against him rested on the evidence of Patrick Mullany (a Dubliner known to have given false testimony before and whose price was a free passage to Australia), who told the court that Barrett had informed him that he had carried out the explosion with an accomplice by the name of Murphy.[4] After two hours of deliberation the jury pronounced Barrett guilty.\\r\\nOne of the trial lawyers, Montagu Williams, wrote:\\r\\nOn looking at the dock, one's attention was attracted by the appearance of Barrett, for whom I must confess I felt great commiseration. He was a square-built fellow, scarcely five feet eight in height and dressed like a well-to-do farmer. This resemblance was increased by the frank, open, expression on his face. A less murderous countenance than Barrett's I have not seen. Good humour was latent in his every feature and he took the greatest interest in the proceedings.\\r\\nOn being asked if he had anything to say before sentence was passed, Barrett delivered an emotional speech from the dock, which ended:\\r\\nI am far from denying, nor will the force of circumstances compel me to deny my love of my native land. I love my country and if it is murderous to love Ireland dearer than I love my life, then it is true, I am a murderer. If my life were ten times dearer than it is and if I could by any means, redress the wrongs of that persecuted land by the sacrifice of my life, I would willingly and gladly do so\\".[5]\\r\\nThe next day the Daily Telegraph reported that Barrett had:\\r\\n... delivered a most remarkable speech, criticising with great acuteness the evidence against him, protesting that he had been condemned on insufficient grounds, and eloquently asserting his innocence.\\r\\nMany people, including a number of Radical MPs, pressed for clemency. In Fermanagh, Barrett's aged mother walked several miles in the snow to appeal to the local Conservative MP, Captain Archdale, a staunch Orangeman, who rejected her.\\r\\nBarrett was executed outside the walls of Newgate Prison on 26 May 1868 before a crowd of two thousand who booed, jeered and sang Rule Britannia and Champagne Charlie as his body dropped.[1]\\r\\nOn 27 May, following the execution, Reynold's News commented:\\r\\nMillions will continue to doubt that a guilty man has been hanged at all; and the future historian of the Fenian panic may declare that Michael Barrett was sacrificed to the exigencies of the police, and the vindication of the good Tory principle, that there is nothing like blood.\\r\\nBarrett's execution was the last public hanging to take place in England.[6] The hangman was William Calcraft.\\r\\nUntil their transfer to the City of London Cemetery, Michael Barrett's remains lay for 35 years in a lime grave inside the walls of Newgate Prison. When the prison was demolished in 1903 his remains were taken to their present resting place. Today the grave is a place of Irish pilgrimage and is marked by a small plaque.\\r\\nAfter the explosion the Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli advocated the suspension of the Habeas Corpus Act in Great Britain, as was already the case in Ireland. Greater security measures were quickly introduced. Thousands of special constables were enrolled to aid the police and at Scotland Yard a special secret service department was established to meet the Fenian threat. Although a number of people were arrested and brought to trial, Michael Barrett was the only one to receive the death sentence.[citation needed]\\r\\nWithin days of the explosion, the Liberal leader, William Ewart Gladstone, then in opposition, announced his concern about Irish grievances and said that it was the duty of the British people to remove them. Later, he said that it was the Fenian action at Clerkenwell that turned his mind towards Home Rule.[citation needed] When Gladstone discovered at Hawarden later that year that Queen Victoria had invited him to form a government he famously stated, \\"my mission is to pacify Ireland\\".[citation needed]","input":"When was the last public execution in britain?"},{"output":"a cold desert","context":"The Gobi Desert (/?o?.bi/) is a large desert region in Asia.[1] It covers parts of northern and northwestern China, and of southern Mongolia. The desert basins of the Gobi are bounded by the Altai Mountains and the grasslands and steppes of Mongolia on the north, by the Taklamakan Desert to the west, by the Hexi Corridor and Tibetan Plateau to the southwest, and by the North China Plain to the southeast. The Gobi is notable in history as part of the great Mongol Empire, and as the location of several important cities along the Silk Road.\\r\\nThe Gobi is a rain shadow desert, formed by the Tibetan Plateau blocking precipitation from the Indian Ocean reaching the Gobi territory.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Gobi measures over 1,600?km (1,000?mi) from southwest to northeast and 800?km (500?mi) from north to south. The desert is widest in the west, along the line joining the Lake Bosten and the Lop Nor (87ÿ89 east). It occupies an arc of land 1,295,000?km2 (500,000?sq?mi)[2] in area as of 2007; it is the fifth-largest desert in the world and Asia's second largest. Much of the Gobi is not sandy but has exposed bare rock.\\r\\nIn its broadest definition, the Gobi includes the long stretch of desert extending from the foot of the Pamirs (77 east) to the Greater Khingan Mountains, 116-118 east, on the border of Manchuria; and from the foothills of the Altay, Sayan, and Yablonoi mountain ranges on the north to the Kunlun, Altyn-Tagh, and Qilian mountain ranges, which form the northern edges of the Tibetan Plateau, on the south.[3]\\r\\nA relatively large area on the east side of the Greater Khingan range, between the upper waters of the Songhua (Sungari) and the upper waters of the Liao-ho, is reckoned to belong to the Gobi by conventional usage. Some geographers and ecologists prefer to regard the western area of the Gobi region (as defined above): the basin of the Tarim in Xinjiang and the desert basin of Lop Nor and Hami (Kumul), as forming a separate and independent desert, called the Taklamakan Desert.\\r\\nArcheologists and paleontologists have done excavations in the Nemegt Basin in the northwestern part of the Gobi Desert (in Mongolia), which is noted for its fossil treasures, including early mammals, dinosaur eggs, and prehistoric stone implements, some 100,000 years old.[4]\\r\\nThe Gobi is a cold desert, with frost and occasionally snow occurring on its dunes. Besides being quite far north, it is also located on a plateau roughly 910ÿ1,520 metres (2,990ÿ4,990?ft) above sea level, which contributes to its low temperatures. An average of approximately 194 millimetres (7.6?in) of rain falls annually in the Gobi. Additional moisture reaches parts of the Gobi in winter as snow is blown by the wind from the Siberian Steppes. These winds may cause the Gobi to reach ?40?C (?40?F) in winter to 45?C (113?F) in summer.[5]\\r\\nThe climate of the Gobi is one of great extremes, combined with rapid changes of temperature of as much as 35?C (63?F). These can occur not only seasonally but within 24 hours.\\r\\nIn southern Mongolia, the temperature has been recorded as low as ?32.8?C (?27.0?F). In contrast, in Alxa, Inner Mongolia, it rises as high as 37?C (99?F) in July.\\r\\nAverage winter minimums are a frigid ?21?C (?6?F), while summertime maximums are a warm 27?C (81?F). Most of the precipitation falls during the summer.[6]\\r\\nAlthough the southeast monsoons reach the southeast parts of the Gobi, the area throughout this region is generally characterized by extreme dryness, especially during the winter, when the Siberian anticyclone is at its strongest. The southern and central parts of the Gobi Desert have variable plant growth due to this monsoon activity. The more northern areas of the Gobi are very cold and dry, making it unable to support much plant growth; this cold and dry weather is attributed to Siberian-Mongolian high pressure cells.[1] Hence, the icy sandstorms and snowstorms of spring and early summer plus early January (winter).\\r\\nThe Gobi Desert is the source of many important fossil finds, including the first dinosaur eggs.\\r\\nDespite the harsh conditions, these deserts and the surrounding regions sustain many animals, including black-tailed gazelles, marbled polecats, wild Bactrian camels, Mongolian wild ass and sandplovers. They are occasionally visited by snow leopards, brown bears, and wolves. Lizards are especially well-adapted to the climate of the Gobi Desert, with approximately 30 species distributed across its southern Mongolian border.[7] The most common vegetation in the Gobi desert are shrubs adapted to drought.[8] These shrubs included gray sparrow's saltwort (Salsola passerina), gray sagebrush, and low grasses such as needle grass and bridlegrass. Due to livestock grazing, the amount of shrubs in the desert has decreased.[8] Several large nature reserves have been established in the Gobi, including Gobi Gurvansaikhan National Park, Great Gobi A and Great Gobi B Strictly Protected Area.\\r\\nThe area is vulnerable to trampling by livestock and off-road vehicles (effects from human intervention are greater in the eastern Gobi Desert, where rainfall is heavier and may sustain livestock). In Mongolia, grasslands have been degraded by goats, which are raised by nomadic herders as source of cashmere wool.[9] The economic trends of livestock privatization and the collapse of the urban economy have caused people to return to subsistence rural lifestyles, away from urbanization.\\r\\nLarge copper and gold deposits located at Oyuu Tolgoi, about 80 kilometres from the Chinese border into Mongolia, are being investigated for development as mining operations.[10] The Oyu Tolgoi copper and gold mine, under construction by Rio Tinto in the South Gobi Desert, is expected to begin operation in early 2013, and is the biggest economic undertaking in the country's history. Rio Tinto estimates that taxes, royalties and dividends generated by the Oyu Tolgoi project is expected to add a third to the country's gross domestic product by 2020. Rio Tinto forecasts average annual production of 450,000 tonnes of copper and 330,000 ounces of gold, and with 1.4 billion tonnes of reserves and a resource of 3.1 billion tonnes, the mine is expected to last for more than 50 years.[11]\\r\\nThe mine has been and remains controversial. There is significant opposition in Mongolia's parliament to the terms under which the mine will proceed, and some are calling for the terms to be renegotiated. Specifically, the contention revolves primarily around the question of whether negotiations were fair (Rio Tinto is far better resourced) and whether Rio Tinto will pay adequate taxes on the revenues it derives from the mine (an agreement was reached whereby the operation will be exempt from windfall tax.[12]\\r\\nThe Gobi Desert is expanding at an alarming rate, in a process known as desertification. The expansion is particularly rapid on the southern edge into China, which has seen 3,600?km2 (1,390?sq?mi) of grassland overtaken every year by the Gobi Desert. Dust storms, which used to occur regularly in China, have increased in frequency in the past 20 years, mainly due to desertification. They have caused further damage to China's agriculture economy.\\r\\nThe northern and eastern boundaries between desert and grassland are constantly changing. This is mostly due to the climate conditions before the growing season, which influence the rate of evapotranspiration and subsequent plant growth.[13]\\r\\nThe expansion of the Gobi is attributed mostly to human activities, notably deforestation, overgrazing, and depletion of water resources. China has tried various plans to slow the expansion of the desert, which have met with some small degree of success, but no major effects. The most recent plan involves the planting of the Green Wall of China, a huge ring of newly planted forests; the government hopes the forests will help stabilize the soil, retain moisture, and act as a buffer against further desertification.[14]\\r\\nThe Gobi, broadly defined, can be divided into five distinct dry ecoregions, based on variations in climate and topography.\\r\\nThe surface is extremely diversified, although there are no great differences in vertical elevation. Between Ulaanbaatar (4800N 10700E? / ?48.000N 107.000E? / 48.000; 107.000) and the small lake of Iren-dubasu-nor (4345N 11150E? / ?43.750N 111.833E? / 43.750; 111.833), the surface is greatly eroded. Broad flat depressions and basins are separated by groups of flat-topped mountains of relatively low elevation 150 to 180?m (490 to 590?ft)), through which archaic rocks crop out as crags and isolated rugged masses. The floors of the depressions lie mostly between 900 to 1,000?m (3,000 to 3,300?ft) above sea-level. Farther south, between Iren-dutiasu-nor and the Yellow River, comes a region of broad tablelands alternating with flat plains, the latter ranging at altitudes of 1000ÿ1100?m and the former at 1,070 to 1,200?m (3,510 to 3,940?ft). The slopes of the plateaus are more or less steep, and are sometimes penetrated by \\"bays\\" of the lowlands.\\r\\nAs the border-range of the Hyangan is approached, the country steadily rises up to 1,370?m (4,490?ft) and then to 1,630?m (5,350?ft). Here small lakes frequently fill the depressions, though the water in them is generally salt or brackish. Both here and for 320?km (199?mi) south of Ulaanbaatar, streams are frequent and grass grows more or less abundantly. Through all the central parts, until the bordering mountains are reached, trees and shrubs are utterly absent. Clay and sand are the predominant formations; the watercourses, especially in the north, being frequently excavated 2 to 3?m (6?ft 7?in to 9?ft 10?in) deep. In many places in the flat, dry valleys or depressions farther south, beds of loess, 5 to 6?m (16 to 20?ft) thick, are exposed. West of the route from Ulaanbaatar to Kalgan, the country presents approximately the same general features, except that the mountains are not so irregularly scattered in groups but have more strongly defined strikes, mostly east to west, west-north-west to east-south-east, and west-south-west to east-north-east.\\r\\nThe altitudes are higher, those of the lowlands ranging from 1,000 to 1,700?m (3,300 to 5,600?ft), and those of the ranges from 200 to 500?m (660 to 1,640?ft) higher, though in a few cases they reach altitudes of 2,400?m (7,900?ft). The elevations do not form continuous chains, but make up a congeries of short ridges and groups rising from a common base and intersected by a labyrinth of ravines, gullies, glens and basins. But the tablelands, built up of the horizontal red deposits of the Han-gai (Obruchev's Gobi formation) which are characteristic of the southern parts of eastern Mongolia, are absent here or occur only in one locality, near the Shara-muren river. They are greatly intersected by gullies or dry watercourses. Water is scarce, with no streams, no lakes, no wells, and precipitation falls seldom. The prevailing winds blow from the west and northwest, and the pall of dust overhangs the country as in the Takla Makan and the desert of Lop. Characteristic of the flora are wild garlic, Kalidium gracile, wormwood, saxaul, Nitraria schoberi, Caragana, Ephedra, saltwort and the grass Lasiagrostis splendens. The taana wild onion Allium polyrrhizum is the main browse eaten by many herd animals, and Mongolians claim that this is essential to produce the correct, slightly hazelnut-like flavour of camel airag (fermented milk).\\r\\nThis great desert country of Gobi is crossed by several trade routes, some of which have been in use for thousands of years. Among the most important are those from Kalgan (at the Great Wall) to Ulaanbaatar (960?km (597?mi)); from Jiuquan (in Gansu) to Hami 670?km (416?mi); from Hami to Beijing (2,000?km (1,243?mi)); from Hohhot to Hami and Barkul; and from Lanzhou (in Gansu) to Hami.\\r\\nThe southwestern portion of the Gobi, known also as the Hsi-tau and the Little Gobi, fills the space between the great north loop of the Yellow River on the east, the Ejin River on the west, and the Qilian Mountains and narrow rocky chain of Longshou, 3,200 to 3,500?m (10,500 to 11,500?ft) in altitude, on the southwest. The Ordos Desert, which covers the northeastern portion of the Ordos Plateau, in the great north loop of the Yellow River, is part of this ecoregion. It belongs to the middle basin of the three great depressions into which Potanin divides the Gobi as a whole.\\r\\n\\"Topographically,\\" says Nikolai Przhevalsky, \\"it is a perfectly level plain, which in all probability once formed the bed of a huge lake or inland sea.\\" He concludes this based on the level area of the region as a whole, the hard saldgine clay and the sand-strewn surface and, lastly, the salt lakes which occupy its lowest parts. For hundreds of kilometers, nothing can be seen but bare sands; in some places they continue so far without a break that the Mongols call them Tengger (i.e. sky). These vast expanses are absolutely waterless, nor do any oases relieve the unbroken stretches of yellow sand, which alternate with equally vast areas of saline clay or, nearer the foot of the mountains, with barren shingle. Although on the whole a level country with a general altitude of 1,000 to 1,500?m (3,300 to 4,900?ft), this section, like most other parts of the Gobi, is crowned by a chequered network of hills and broken ranges going up 300?m higher. The vegetation is confined to a few varieties of bushes and a dozen kinds of grasses and herbs, the most conspicuous being saxaul (Haloxylon ammondendron) and Agriophyllum gobicum. The others include prickly convolvulus, field wormwood (Artemisia campestris), acacia, Inula ammophila, Sophora flavescens, Convolvulus ammanii, Peganum and Astragalus, but all dwarfed, deformed and starved. The fauna consists of little but antelope, wolf, fox, hare, hedgehog, marten, numerous lizards and a few birds, e.g. the sandgrouse, lark, stonechat, sparrow, crane, Henderson's ground jay (Podoces hendersoni), horned lark (Eremophila alpestris), and crested lark (Galerida cristata).\\r\\nThe structure here is that of the mighty T'ien Shan, or Heavenly Mountains, running from west to east. It divides the northern one-third of Sinkiang from the southern two-thirds. On the northern side, rivers formed from the snow and glaciers of the high mountains break through barren foothill ranges and flow out into an immense, hollow plain. Here the rivers begin to straggle and fan out, and form great marshes with dense reed-beds. Westerners call this terrain the Dzungarian desert. The Chinese also call it a desert, but the Mongols call it a 'gobi'that is, a land of thin herbage, more suitable for camels than for cows, but capable also, if herds are kept small and moved frequently, of sustaining horses, sheep, and goats. The herbage comprises a high proportion of woody, fragrant plants. Gobi mutton is the most aromatic in the world.[15]\\r\\nThe Yulduz valley or valley of the Haidag-gol (43N 83E? / ?43N 83E? / 43; 83ÿ43N 86E? / ?43N 86E? / 43; 86) is a mini desert enclosed by two prominent members of the Shanashen Trahen Osh mountain range, namely the chucis and the kracenard pine rallies, running perpendicular and far from one another. As they proceed south, they transcend and transpose, sweeping back on east and west respectively, with Lake Bosten in between. These two ranges mark the northern and the southern edges respectively of a great swelling, which extends eastward for nearly twenty degrees of longitude. On its northern side, the Chol-tagh descends steeply, and its foot is fringed by a string of deep depressions, ranging from Lukchun (130?m (427?ft) below sea level) to Hami (850?m (2,789?ft) above sea-level). To the south of the Kuruk-tagh lie the desert of Lop Nur, the Kum-tagh desert, and the valley of the Bulunzir-gol. To this great swelling, which arches up between the two border-ranges of the Chol-tagh and Kuruk-tagh, the Mongols give the name of Ghashuun-Gobi or \\"Salt Desert\\". It is some 130 to 160?km (81 to 99?mi) across from north to south, and is traversed by a number of minor parallel ranges, ridges and chains of hills. Down its middle runs a broad stony valley, 40 to 80?km (25 to 50?mi) wide, at an elevation of 900 to 1,370?m (2,950 to 4,490?ft). The Chol-tagh, which reaches an average altitude of 1,800?m (5,900?ft), is absolutely sterile, and its northern foot rests upon a narrow belt of barren sand, which leads down to the depressions mentioned above.\\r\\nThe Kuruk-tagh is the greatly disintegrated, denuded and wasted relic of a mountain range which used to be of incomparably greater magnitude. In the west, between Lake Bosten and the Tarim, it consists of two, possibly of three, principal ranges, which, although broken in continuity, run generally parallel to one another, and embrace between them numerous minor chains of heights. These minor ranges, together with the principal ranges, divide the region into a series of long; narrow valleys, mostly parallel to one another and to the enclosing mountain chains, which descend like terraced steps, on the one side towards the depression of Lukchun and on the other towards the desert of Lop. In many cases these latitudinal valleys are barred transversely by ridges or spurs, generally elevations en masse of the bottom of the valley. Where such elevations exist, there is generally found, on the east side of the transverse ridge, a cauldron-shaped depression, which some time or other has been the bottom of a former lake, but is now nearly a dry salt-basin. The surface configuration is in fact markedly similar to that which occurs in the inter-mount latitudinal valleys of the Kunlun Mountains. The hydrography of the Ghashiun-Gobi and the Kuruk-tagh is determined by these chequered arrangements of the latitudinal valleys. Most of the principal streams, instead of flowing straight down these valleys, cross them diagonally and only turn west after they have cut their way through one or more of the transverse barrier ranges. To the highest range on the great swelling Grumm-Grzhimailo gives the name of Tuge-tau, its altitude being 2,700?m (8,858?ft) above the level of the sea and some 1,200?m (3,937?ft) above the crown of the swelling itself. This range he considers to belong to the Choltagh system, whereas Sven Hedin would assign it to the Kuruk-tagh. This last, which is pretty certainly identical with the range of Kharateken-ula (also known as the Kyzyl-sanghir, Sinir, and Singher Mountains), that overlooks the southern shore of the Lake Bosten, though parted from it by the drift-sand desert of Ak-bel-kum (White Pass Sands), has at first a west-northwest to east-southeast strike, but it gradually curves round like a scimitar towards the east-northeast and at the same time gradually decreases in elevation. In 91 east, while the principal range of the Kuruk-tagh system wheels to the east-northeast, four of its subsidiary ranges terminate, or rather die away somewhat suddenly, on the brink of a long narrow depression (in which Sven Hedin sees a northeast bay of the former great Central Asian lake of Lop-nor), having over against them the cheloned terminals of similar subordinate ranges of the Pe-shan (Boy-san) system (see below). The Kuruk-tagh is throughout a relatively low, but almost completely barren range, being entirely destitute of animal life, save for hares, antelopes and wild camels, which frequent its few small, widely scattered oases. The vegetation, which is confined to these same relatively favoured spots, is of the scantiest and is mainly confined to bushes of saxaul (Haloxylon), anabasis, reeds (kamish), tamarisks, poplars, and Ephedra.\\r\\nThe Gobi had a long history of human habitation, mostly by nomadic peoples. By the early 20th century the region was under the nominal control of Manchu-China, and inhabited mostly by Mongols, Uyghurs, and Kazakhs. The Gobi Desert as a whole was only very imperfectly known to outsiders, information being confined to observations by individual travellers from their respective itineraries across the desert. Among the European explorers who contributed to early-20th-century understanding of the Gobi, the most important were:\\r\\nCoordinates: 4235N 10326E? / ?42.59N 103.43E? / 42.59; 103.43","input":"What is the climate in the gobi desert?"},{"output":"S18 million","context":"Kevin De Bruyne (Dutch pronunciation: [?k?v?n d? ?br?yn?]; born 28 June 1991) is a Belgian professional footballer who plays as a midfielder for English club Manchester City and the Belgian national team.

Other fish in the same family include trout, char, grayling and whitefish. Salmon are native to tributaries of the North Atlantic (genus Salmo) and Pacific Ocean  (genus Oncorhynchus). Many species of salmon have been introduced into non-native environments such as the Great Lakes of North America and Patagonia in South America. Salmon are intensively farmed in many parts of the world.\\r\\n\\r\\nTypically, salmon are anadromous: they hatch in fresh water, migrate to the ocean, then return to fresh water to reproduce. However, populations of several species are restricted to fresh water through their lives. Various species of salmon display anadromous life strategies while others display freshwater resident life strategies. Folklore has it that the fish return to the exact spot where they hatched to spawn; tracking studies have shown this to be mostly true. A portion of a returning salmon run may stray and spawn in different freshwater systems. The percent of straying depends on the species of salmon.[2] Homing behavior has been shown to depend on olfactory memory.[3][4] Salmon date back to the Neogene.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe term \\"salmon\\" comes from the Latin salmo, which in turn might have originated from salire, meaning \\"to leap\\".[5] The nine commercially important species of salmon occur in two genera. The genus Salmo contains the Atlantic salmon, found in the north Atlantic, as well as many species commonly named trout. The genus Oncorhynchus contains eight species which occur naturally only in the North Pacific. As a group, these are known as Pacific salmon. Chinook salmon have been introduced in New Zealand and Patagonia. Coho, freshwater sockeye, and Atlantic salmon have been established in Patagonia, as well.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\n ? ? ?\\r\\nBoth the Salmo and Oncorhynchus genera also contain a number of species referred to as trout. Within Salmo, additional minor taxa have been called salmon in English, i.e. the Adriatic salmon (Salmo obtusirostris) and Black Sea salmon (Salmo labrax). The steelhead anadromous form of the rainbow trout migrates to sea, but it is not termed \\"salmon\\".\\r\\n\\r\\nAlso a number of other species have common names which refer to them as being salmon. Of those listed below, the Danube salmon or huchen is a large freshwater salmonid related to the salmon above, but others are marine fishes of the unrelated Perciformes order:\\r\\n\\r\\nEosalmo driftwoodensis, the oldest known salmon in the fossil record, helps scientists figure how the different species of salmon diverged from a common ancestor. The British Columbia salmon fossil provides evidence that the divergence between Pacific and Atlantic salmon had not yet occurred 40 million years ago. Both the fossil record and analysis of mitochondrial DNA suggest the divergence occurred by 10 to 20 million years ago. This independent evidence from DNA analysis and the fossil record rejects the glacial theory of salmon divergence.[39]\\r\\n\\r\\nSalmon eggs are laid in freshwater streams typically at high latitudes. The eggs hatch into alevin or sac fry. The fry quickly develop into parr with camouflaging vertical stripes. The parr stay for six months to three years in their natal stream before becoming smolts, which are distinguished by their bright, silvery colour with scales that are easily rubbed off. Only 10% of all salmon eggs are estimated to survive to this stage.[49] The smolt body chemistry changes, allowing them to live in salt water. Smolts spend a portion of their out-migration time in brackish water, where their body chemistry becomes accustomed to osmoregulation in the ocean.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe salmon spend about one to five years (depending on the species) in the open ocean, where they gradually become sexually mature. The adult salmon then return primarily to their natal streams to spawn. Atlantic salmon spend between one and four years at sea. When a fish returns after just one year's sea feeding, it is called a grilse in Canada, Britain, and Ireland. Grilse may be present at spawning, and go unnoticed by large males, releasing their own sperm on the eggs.[50] Prior to spawning, depending on the species, salmon undergo changes. They may grow a hump, develop canine-like teeth, or develop a kype (a pronounced curvature of the jaws in male salmon). All change from the silvery blue of a fresh-run fish from the sea to a darker colour. Salmon can make amazing journeys, sometimes moving hundreds of miles upstream against strong currents and rapids to reproduce. Chinook and sockeye salmon from central Idaho, for example, travel over 1,400?km (900?mi) and climb nearly 2,100?m (7,000?ft) from the Pacific Ocean as they return to spawn. Condition tends to deteriorate the longer the fish remain in fresh water, and they then deteriorate further after they spawn, when they are known as kelts. In all species of Pacific salmon, the mature individuals die within a few days or weeks of spawning, a trait known as semelparity. Between 2 and 4% of Atlantic salmon kelts survive to spawn again, all females. However, even in those species of salmon that may survive to spawn more than once (iteroparity), postspawning mortality is quite high (perhaps as high as 40 to 50%).\\r\\n\\r\\nTo lay her roe, the female salmon uses her tail (caudal fin), to create a low-pressure zone, lifting gravel to be swept downstream, excavating a shallow depression, called a redd. The redd may sometimes contain 5,000 eggs covering 2.8?m2 (30?sq?ft).[51] The eggs usually range from orange to red. One or more males approach the female in her redd, depositing sperm, or milt, over the roe.[48] The female then covers the eggs by disturbing the gravel at the upstream edge of the depression before moving on to make another redd. The female may make as many as seven redds before her supply of eggs is exhausted.[48]\\r\\n\\r\\nEach year, the fish experiences a period of rapid growth, often in summer, and one of slower growth, normally in winter. This results in ring formation around an earbone called the otolith (annuli), analogous to the growth rings visible in a tree trunk. Freshwater growth shows as densely crowded rings, sea growth as widely spaced rings; spawning is marked by significant erosion as body mass is converted into eggs and milt.\\r\\n\\r\\nFreshwater streams and estuaries provide important habitat for many salmon species. They feed on terrestrial and aquatic insects, amphipods, and other crustaceans while young, and primarily on other fish when older. Eggs are laid in deeper water with larger gravel, and need cool water and good water flow (to supply oxygen) to the developing embryos. Mortality of salmon in the early life stages is usually high due to natural predation and human-induced changes in habitat, such as siltation, high water temperatures, low oxygen concentration, loss of stream cover, and reductions in river flow. Estuaries and their associated wetlands provide vital nursery areas for the salmon prior to their departure to the open ocean. Wetlands not only help buffer the estuary from silt and pollutants, but also provide important feeding and hiding areas.\\r\\n\\r\\nSalmon not killed by other means show greatly accelerated deterioration (phenoptosis, or \\"programmed aging\\") at the end of their lives. Their bodies rapidly deteriorate right after they spawn as a result of the release of massive amounts of corticosteroids.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the Pacific Northwest and Alaska, salmon are keystone species, supporting wildlife such as birds, bears and otters.[52] The bodies of salmon represent a transfer of nutrients from the ocean, rich in nitrogen, sulfur, carbon and phosphorus, to the forest ecosystem.\\r\\n\\r\\nGrizzly bears function as ecosystem engineers, capturing salmon and carrying them into adjacent wooded areas. There they deposit nutrient-rich urine and feces and partially eaten carcasses. Bears are estimated to leave up to half the salmon they harvest on the forest floor,[53][54] in densities that can reach 4,000 kilograms per hectare,[55] providing as much as 24% of the total nitrogen available to the riparian woodlands. The foliage of spruce trees up to 500?m (1,600?ft) from a stream where grizzlies fish salmon have been found to contain nitrogen originating from fished salmon.[56]\\r\\n\\r\\nBeavers also function as ecosystem engineers; in the process of clear-cutting and damming, beavers alter their ecosystems extensively. Beaver ponds can provide critical habitat for juvenile salmon. An example of this was seen in the years following 1818 in the Columbia River Basin. In 1818, the British government made an agreement with the U.S. government to allow U.S. citizens access to the Columbia catchment (see Treaty of 1818). At the time, the Hudson's Bay Company sent word to trappers to extirpate all furbearers from the area in an effort to make the area less attractive to U.S. fur traders. In response to the elimination of beavers from large parts of the river system, salmon runs plummeted, even in the absence of many of the factors usually associated with the demise of salmon runs. Salmon recruitment can be affected by beavers' dams because dams can:[57][58][59]\\r\\n\\r\\nBeavers' dams are able to nurture salmon juveniles in estuarine tidal marshes where the salinity is less than 10?ppm. Beavers build small dams of generally less than 60?cm (2?ft) high in channels in the myrtle zone. These dams can be overtopped at high tide and hold water at low tide. This provides refuges for juvenile salmon so they do not have to swim into large channels where they are subject to predation.[60]\\r\\n\\r\\nIt has been discovered that rivers which have seen a decline or disappearance of anadromous lampreys also affects the salmon in a negative way. Like salmon, the adults stop feeding and die after spawning, and their decomposing bodies release nutrients into the stream. Along with species like steelhead redds and Sacramento sucker, lampreys clean the gravel in the rivers during spawning.[61] Their larvae, called ammocoetes, are filter feeders that contributes to the health of the waters. They are a food source for the young salmon, and being fattier and oilier, it is assumed predators prefer them over salmon offspring, taking off some of the predation pressure on smolts.[62] Adult lampreys are also the preferred prey of seals and sea lions, which can eat 30 lampreys to every salmon, allowing more adult salmon to enter the rivers to spawn without being eaten by the marine mammals.[63][64]\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to Canadian biologist Dorothy Kieser, the myxozoan parasite Henneguya salminicola is commonly found in the flesh of salmonids. It has been recorded in the field samples of salmon returning to the Haida Gwaii Islands. The fish responds by walling off the parasitic infection into a number of cysts that contain milky fluid. This fluid is an accumulation of a large number of parasites.\\r\\n\\r\\nHenneguya and other parasites in the myxosporean group have complex life cycles, where the salmon is one of two hosts. The fish releases the spores after spawning. In the Henneguya case, the spores enter a second host, most likely an invertebrate, in the spawning stream. When juvenile salmon migrate to the Pacific Ocean, the second host releases a stage infective to salmon. The parasite is then carried in the salmon until the next spawning cycle. The myxosporean parasite that causes whirling disease in trout has a similar life cycle.[65] However, as opposed to whirling disease, the Henneguya infestation does not appear to cause disease in the host salmon? even heavily infected fish tend to return to spawn successfully.\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to Dr. Kieser, a lot of work on Henneguya salminicola was done by scientists at the Pacific Biological Station in Nanaimo in the mid-1980s, in particular, an overview report[66] which states, \\"the fish that have the longest fresh water residence time as juveniles have the most noticeable infections. Hence in order of prevalence coho are most infected followed by sockeye, chinook, chum and pink.\\" As well, the report says, at the time the studies were conducted, stocks from the middle and upper reaches of large river systems in British Columbia such as Fraser, Skeena, Nass and from mainland coastal streams in the southern half of B.C., \\"are more likely to have a low prevalence of infection.\\" The report also states, \\"It should be stressed that Henneguya, economically deleterious though it is, is harmless from the view of public health. It is strictly a fish parasite that cannot live in or affect warm blooded animals, including man\\".\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to Klaus Schallie, Molluscan Shellfish Program Specialist with the Canadian Food Inspection Agency, \\"Henneguya salminicola is found in southern B.C. also and in all species of salmon. I have previously examined smoked chum salmon sides that were riddled with cysts and some sockeye runs in Barkley Sound (southern B.C., west coast of Vancouver Island) are noted for their high incidence of infestation.\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSea lice, particularly Lepeophtheirus salmonis and various Caligus species, including C. clemensi and C. rogercresseyi, can cause deadly infestations of both farm-grown and wild salmon.[67][68] Sea lice are ectoparasites which feed on mucus, blood, and skin, and migrate and latch onto the skin of wild salmon during free-swimming, planktonic nauplii and copepodid larval stages, which can persist for several days.[69][70][71] Large numbers of highly populated, open-net salmon farms can create exceptionally large concentrations of sea lice; when exposed in river estuaries containing large numbers of open-net farms, many young wild salmon are infected, and do not survive as a result.[72][73] Adult salmon may survive otherwise critical numbers of sea lice, but small, thin-skinned juvenile salmon migrating to sea are highly vulnerable. On the Pacific coast of Canada, the louse-induced mortality of pink salmon in some regions is commonly over 80%.[74]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe risk of injury caused by underwater pile driving has been studied by Dr. Halvorsen and her co-workers.[75]  The study concluded that the fish are at risk of injury if the cumulative sound exposure level exceeds 210 dB relative to 1 Pa2 s.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs can be seen from the production chart at the left, the global capture reported by different countries to the FAO of commercial wild salmon has remained fairly steady since 1990 at about one million tonnes per year. This is in contrast to farmed salmon (below) which has increased in the same period from about 0.6 million tonnes to well over two million tonnes.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nNearly all captured wild salmon are Pacific salmon. The capture of wild Atlantic salmon has always been relatively small, and has declined steadily since 1990. In 2011 only 2,500 tonnes were reported.[8] In contrast about half of all farmed salmon are Atlantic salmon.\\r\\n\\r\\nRecreational salmon fishing can be a technically demanding kind of sport fishing, not necessarily congenial for beginning fishermen.[76] A conflict exists between commercial fishermen and recreational fishermen for the right to salmon stock resources. Commercial fishing in estuaries and coastal areas is often restricted so enough salmon can return to their natal rivers where they can spawn and be available for sport fishing. On parts of the North American west coast sport salmon fishing completely replaces inshore commercial fishing.[77] The commercial value of a salmon can be several times less than the value of the same fish caught by a sport fisherman. This is \\"a powerful economic argument for allocating stock resources preferentially to sport fishing.\\"[77]\\r\\n\\r\\nSalmon aquaculture is a major contributor to the world production of farmed finfish, representing about US$10?billion annually. Other commonly cultured fish species include tilapia, catfish, sea bass, carp and bream. Salmon farming is significant in Chile, Norway, Scotland, Canada and the Faroe Islands; it is the source for most salmon consumed in the United States and Europe. Atlantic salmon are also, in very small volumes, farmed in Russia and Tasmania, Australia.\\r\\n\\r\\nSalmon are carnivorous. They are fed a meal produced from catching other wild fish and other marine organisms. Salmon farming leads to a high demand for wild forage fish. Salmon require large nutritional intakes of protein, and farmed salmon consume more fish than they generate as a final product. On a dry weight basis, 2ÿ4?kg of wild-caught fish are needed to produce one kg of salmon.[78] As the salmon farming industry expands, it requires more wild forage fish for feed, at a time when 75% of the world's monitored fisheries are already near to or have exceeded their maximum sustainable yield.[79] The industrial-scale extraction of wild forage fish for salmon farming affects the survivability of the wild predator fish which rely on them for food.\\r\\n\\r\\nWork continues on substituting vegetable proteins for animal proteins in the salmon diet. This substitution results in lower levels of the highly valued omega-3 fatty acid content in the farmed product.\\r\\n\\r\\nIntensive salmon farming uses open-net cages, which have low production costs. It has the drawback of allowing disease and sea lice to spread to local wild salmon stocks.[80]\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother form of salmon production, which is safer but less controllable, is to raise salmon in hatcheries until they are old enough to become independent. They are released into rivers in an attempt to increase the salmon population. This system is referred to as ranching. It was very common in countries such as Sweden, before the Norwegians developed salmon farming, but is seldom done by private companies. As anyone may catch the salmon when they return to spawn, a company is limited in benefiting financially from their investment.\\r\\n\\r\\nBecause of this, the ranching method has mainly been used by various public authorities and nonprofit groups, such as the Cook Inlet Aquaculture Association, as a way to increase salmon populations in situations where they have declined due to overharvesting, construction of dams, and habitat destruction or fragmentation. Negative consequences to this sort of population manipulation include genetic \\"dilution\\" of the wild stocks. Many jurisdictions are now beginning to discourage supplemental fish planting in favour of harvest controls, and habitat improvement and protection.\\r\\n\\r\\nA variant method of fish stocking, called ocean ranching, is under development in Alaska. There, the young salmon are released into the ocean far from any wild salmon streams. When it is time for them to spawn, they return to where they were released, where fishermen can catch them.\\r\\n\\r\\nAn alternative method to hatcheries is to use spawning channels. These are artificial streams, usually parallel to an existing stream, with concrete or rip-rap sides and gravel bottoms. Water from the adjacent stream is piped into the top of the channel, sometimes via a header pond, to settle out sediment. Spawning success is often much better in channels than in adjacent streams due to the control of floods, which in some years can wash out the natural redds. Because of the lack of floods, spawning channels must sometimes be cleaned out to remove accumulated sediment. The same floods that destroy natural redds also clean the regular streams. Spawning channels preserve the natural selection of natural streams, as there is no benefit, as in hatcheries, to use prophylactic chemicals to control diseases.\\r\\n\\r\\nFarm-raised salmon are fed the carotenoids astaxanthin and canthaxanthin to match their flesh colour to wild salmon[81] to improve their marketability.[82]\\r\\n\\r\\nOne proposed alternative to the use of wild-caught fish as feed for the salmon, is the use of soy-based products. This should be better for the local environment of the fish farm, but producing soy beans has a high environmental cost for the producing region. The fish omega-3 fatty acid content would be reduced compared to fish-fed salmon.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother possible alternative is a yeast-based coproduct of bioethanol production, proteinaceous fermentation biomass. Substituting such products for engineered feed can result in equal (sometimes enhanced) growth in fish.[83] With its increasing availability, this would address the problems of rising costs for buying hatchery fish feed.\\r\\n\\r\\nYet another attractive alternative is the increased use of seaweed. Seaweed provides essential minerals and vitamins for growing organisms. It offers the advantage of providing natural amounts of dietary fiber and having a lower glycemic load than grain-based fish meal.[83] In the best-case scenario, widespread use of seaweed could yield a future in aquaculture that eliminates the need for land, freshwater, or fertilizer to raise fish.[84]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe population of wild salmon declined markedly in recent decades, especially North Atlantic populations, which spawn in the waters of western Europe and eastern Canada, and wild salmon in the Snake and Columbia River systems in northwestern United States.\\r\\n\\r\\nSalmon population levels are of concern in the Atlantic and in some parts of the Pacific. Alaska fishery stocks are still abundant, and catches have been on the rise in recent decades, after the state initiated limitations in 1972.[85][86] Some of the most important Alaskan salmon sustainable wild fisheries are located near the Kenai River, Copper River, and in Bristol Bay. Fish farming of Pacific salmon is outlawed in the United States Exclusive Economic Zone,[citation needed] however, there is a substantial network of publicly funded hatcheries,[87] and the State of Alaska's fisheries management system is viewed as a leader in the management of wild fish stocks. In Canada, returning Skeena River wild salmon support commercial, subsistence and recreational fisheries, as well as the area's diverse wildlife on the coast and around communities hundreds of miles inland in the watershed. The status of wild salmon in Washington is mixed. Of 435 wild stocks of salmon and steelhead, only 187 of them were classified as healthy; 113 had an unknown status, one was extinct, 12 were in critical condition and 122 were experiencing depressed populations.[88]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe commercial salmon fisheries in California have been either severely curtailed or closed completely in recent years, due to critically low returns on the Klamath and or Sacramento rivers, causing millions of dollars in losses to commercial fishermen.[89] Both Atlantic and Pacific salmon are popular sportfish.\\r\\n\\r\\nSalmon populations have been established in all the Great Lakes. Coho stocks were planted by the state of Michigan in the late 1960s to control the growing population of non-native alewife. Now Chinook (king), Atlantic, and coho (silver) salmon are annually stocked in all Great Lakes by most bordering states and provinces. These populations are not self-sustaining and do not provide much in the way of a commercial fishery, but have led to the development of a thriving sport fishery.\\r\\n\\r\\nSalmon is a popular food. Classified as an oily fish,[90] salmon is considered to be healthy due to the fish's high protein, high omega-3 fatty acids, and high vitamin D[91] content. Salmon is also a source of cholesterol, with a range of 23ÿ214?mg/100?g depending on the species.[92] According to reports in the journal Science, farmed salmon may contain high levels of dioxins.[medical citation needed] PCB (polychlorinated biphenyl) levels may be up to eight times higher in farmed salmon than in wild salmon,[93] but still well below levels considered dangerous.[94][95] Nonetheless, according to a 2006 study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, the benefits of eating even farmed salmon still outweigh any risks imposed by contaminants.[96] Farmed salmon has a high omega 3 fatty acid content comparable to wild salmon.[97] The type of omega-3 present may not be a factor for other important health functions.\\r\\n\\r\\nSalmon flesh is generally orange to red, although white-fleshed wild salmon with white-black skin colour occurs. The natural colour of salmon results from carotenoid pigments, largely astaxanthin, but also canthaxanthin, in the flesh.[98] Wild salmon get these carotenoids from eating krill and other tiny shellfish.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe vast majority of Atlantic salmon available around the world are farmed (almost 99%),[99] whereas the majority of Pacific salmon are wild-caught (greater than 80%). Canned salmon in the US is usually wild Pacific catch, though some farmed salmon is available in canned form. Smoked salmon is another popular preparation method, and can either be hot or cold smoked. Lox can refer to either cold-smoked salmon or salmon cured in a brine solution (also called gravlax).  Traditional canned salmon includes some skin (which is harmless) and bone (which adds calcium). Skinless and boneless canned salmon is also available.\\r\\n\\r\\nRaw salmon flesh may contain Anisakis nematodes, marine parasites that cause anisakiasis. Before the availability of refrigeration, the Japanese did not consume raw salmon. Salmon and salmon roe have only recently come into use in making sashimi (raw fish) and sushi.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo the Indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest Coast, salmon is considered a vital part of the diet. Specifically, the indigenous peoples of Haida Gwaii, located near former Queen Charlotte Island in British Columbia, rely on salmon as one of their main sources of food, although many other bands have fished Pacific waters for centuries.[100] Salmon are not only ancient and unique, but it is important because it is expressed in culture, art forms, and ceremonial feasts. Annually, salmon spawn in Haida, feeding on everything on the way upstream and down.[100] Within the Haida nation, salmon is referred to as \\"tsiin\\",[100] and is prepared in several ways including smoking, baking, frying, and making soup.\\r\\n\\r\\nHistorically, there has always been enough salmon, as people would not overfish, and only took what they needed.[101] In 2003, a report on First Nation participation in commercial fisheries, including salmon, commissioned by BCs Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Fisheries found that there were 595\\r\\nFirst Nation-owned and operated commercial vessels in the province. Of those vessels, First Nations members owned 564.[101] However, employment within the industry has decreased overall by 50% in the last decade, with 8,142 registered commercial fishermen in 2003. This has affected employment for many fisherman, who rely on salmon as a source of income.\\r\\n\\r\\nBlack bears also rely on salmon as food. The leftovers the bears leave behind are considered important nutrients for the Canadian forest, such as the soil, trees, and plants. In this sense, the salmon feed the forest and in return receive clean water and gravel in which to hatch and grow, sheltered from extremes of temperature and water flow in times of high and low rainfall.[100] However, the condition of the salmon in Haida has been affected in recent decades. Due to logging and development, much of the salmon's habitat (i.e., Ain River) has been destroyed, resulting in the fish being close to endangered.[100] For residents, this has resulted in limits on catches, in turn, has affected families diets, and cultural events such as feasts. Some of the salmon systems in danger include: the Davidon, Naden, Mamim, and Mathers.[100] It is clear that further protection is needed for salmon, such as their habitats, where logging commonly occurs.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe salmon has long been at the heart of the culture and livelihood of coastal dwellers, which can be traced as far back as 5,000 years when archeologists discovered Nisqually tribes remnants.[102] The original distribution of the Genus Oncorhynchus covered the Pacific Rim coastline.[103] History shows salmon used tributaries, rivers and estuaries without regard to jurisdiction for 18ÿ22 million years. Baseline data is near impossible to recreate based off the inconsistent historical data, but confirmed there have been massive depletion since 1900s. The Pacific Northwest was once sprawled with native inhabitants who practiced eco management, to ensure little degradation was caused by their actions to salmon habitats.? As animists, the indigenous people relied not only for salmon for food, but spiritual guidance. The role of the salmon spirit guided the people to respect ecological systems such as the rivers and tributaries the salmon used for spawning. Natives often used the entire fish and left no waste by creating items such turning the bladder into glue, bones for toys, and skin for clothing and shoes. The first salmon ceremony was introduced by indigenous tribes on the pacific coast, which consists of three major parts. First is the welcoming of the first catch, then comes the cooking and lastly, the return of the bones to the Sea to induce hospitality so that other salmon would give their lives to the people of that village.[104] Many tribes such as the Yurok had a taboo against harvesting the first fish that swam upriver in summer, but once they confirmed that the salmon had returned in abundance they would begin to catch them in plentiful.[105] The indigenous practices were guided by deep ecological wisdom, which was eradicated when Euro-American settlements began to be developed.[106] Salmon have a much grander history than what is presently shown today. The Salmon that once dominated the Pacific Ocean are now just a fraction in population and size. The Pacific salmon population is now less than 1ÿ3% of what it was when Lewis and Clark arrived at the region.[107] In his 1908 State of the Union address, U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt observed that the fisheries were in significant decline:[108][109]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe salmon fisheries of the Columbia River are now but a fraction of what they were twenty-five years ago, and what they would be now if the United States Government had taken complete charge of them by intervening between Oregon and Washington. During these twenty-five years the fishermen of each State have naturally tried to take all they could get, and the two legislatures have never been able to agree on joint action of any kind adequate in degree for the protection of the fisheries. At the moment the fishing on the Oregon side is practically closed, while there is no limit on the Washington side of any kind, and no one can tell what the courts will decide as to the very statutes under which this action and non-action result. Meanwhile very few salmon reach the spawning grounds, and probably four years hence the fisheries will amount to nothing; and this comes from a struggle between the associated, or gill-net, fishermen on the one hand, and the owners of the fishing wheels up the river.\\r\\nOn the Columbia River the Chief Joseph Dam completed in 1955 completely blocks salmon migration to the upper Columbia River system.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Fraser River salmon population was affected by the 1914 slide caused by the Canadian Pacific Railway at Hells Gate. The 1917 catch was one quarter of the 1913 catch.[110]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe salmon is an important creature in several strands of Celtic mythology and poetry, which often associated them with wisdom and venerability. In Irish mythology, a creature called the Salmon of Knowledge[111] plays key role in the tale The Boyhood Deeds of Fionn. In the tale, the Salmon will grant powers of knowledge to whoever eats it, and is sought by poet Finn Eces for seven years. Finally Finn Eces catches the fish and gives it to his young pupil, Fionn mac Cumhaill, to prepare it for him. However, Fionn burns his thumb on the salmon's juices, and he instinctively puts it in his mouth. In so doing, he inadvertently gains the Salmon's wisdom. Elsewhere in Irish mythology, the salmon is also one of the incarnations of both Tuan mac Cairill[112] and Fintan mac B܇chra.[113]\\r\\n\\r\\nSalmon also feature in Welsh mythology. In the prose tale Culhwch and Olwen, the Salmon of Llyn Llyw is the oldest animal in Britain, and the only creature who knows the location of Mabon ap Modron. After speaking to a string of other ancient animals who do not know his whereabouts, King Arthur's men Cai and Bedwyr are led to the Salmon of Llyn Llyw, who lets them ride its back to the walls of Mabon's prison in Gloucester.[114]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Norse mythology, after Loki tricked the blind god H?er into killing his brother Baldr, Loki jumped into a river and transformed himself into a salmon to escape punishment from the other gods. When they held out a net to trap him he attempted to leap over it but was caught by Thor who grabbed him by the tail with his hand, and this is why the salmon's tail is tapered.[115]\\r\\n\\r\\nSalmon are central spiritually and culturally to Native American mythology on the Pacific coast, from the Haida and Coast Salish peoples, to the Nuu-chah-nulth peoples in British Columbia.[116]","input":"How many types of salmon fish are there?"},{"output":"pictographs","context":"In archaeology, rock art is human-made markings placed on natural stone; it is largely synonymous with parietal art. A global phenomenon, rock art is found in many culturally diverse regions of the world. It has been produced in many contexts throughout human history, although the majority of rock art that has been ethnographically recorded has been produced as a part of ritual. Such artworks are often divided into three forms: petroglyphs, which are carved into the rock surface, pictographs, which are painted onto the surface, and earth figures, formed on the ground. The oldest known rock art dates from the Upper Palaeolithic period, having been found in Europe, Australia, Asia and Africa. Archaeologists studying these artworks believe that they likely had magico-religious significance.\\r\\nThe archaeological sub-discipline of rock art studies first developed in the late-19th century among Francophone scholars studying the Upper Palaeolithic rock art found in the cave systems of Western Europe. Rock art continues to be of importance to indigenous peoples in various parts of the world, who view them as both sacred items and significant components of their cultural patrimony.[1] Such archaeological sites are also significant sources of cultural tourism, and have been utilised in popular culture for their aesthetic qualities.[2]\\r\\nNormally found in literate cultures, a rock relief or rock-cut relief is a relief sculpture carved on solid or \\"living rock\\" such as a cliff, rather than a detached piece of stone. They are a category of rock art, and sometimes found in conjunction with rock-cut architecture.[3] However, they tend to be omitted in most works on rock art, which concentrate on engravings and paintings by prehistoric peoples. A few such works exploit the natural contours of the rock and use them to define an image, but they do not amount to man-made reliefs. Rock reliefs have been made in many cultures, and were especially important in the art of the Ancient Near East.[4] Rock reliefs are generally fairly large, as they need to be to make an impact in the open air. Most have figures that are over life-size, and in many the figures are multiples of life-size.\\r\\nStylistically they normally relate to other types of sculpture from the culture and period concerned, and except for Hittite and Persian examples they are generally discussed as part of that wider subject.[5] The vertical relief is most common, but reliefs on essentially horizontal surfaces are also found. The term typically excludes relief carvings inside caves, whether natural or themselves man-made, which are especially found in India. Natural rock formations made into statues or other sculpture in the round, most famously at the Great Sphinx of Giza, are also usually excluded. Reliefs on large boulders left in their natural location, like the Hittite ?mamkullu relief, are likely to be included, but smaller boulders may be called stelae or carved orthostats.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe term rock art appears in the published literature as early as the 1940s.[6][7] It has also been described as \\"rock carvings\\",[8] \\"rock drawings\\",[9] \\"rock engravings\\",[10] \\"rock inscriptions\\",[11] \\"rock paintings\\",[12] \\"rock pictures\\",[13] \\"rock records\\"[14] \\"rock sculptures.,[15][16]\\r\\nThe defining characteristic of rock art is that it is placed on natural rock surfaces; in this way it is distinct from artworks placed on constructed walls or free-standing sculpture.[17] As such, rock art is a form of landscape art, and includes designs that have been placed on boulder and cliff faces, cave walls and ceilings, and on the ground surface.[17] Rock art is a global phenomenon, being found in many different regions of the world.[1]\\r\\nThere are various forms of rock art. These include pictographs, which were painted or drawn onto the panel (rock surface), petroglyphs, which were carved or engraved onto the panel, and earth figures such as earthforms, intaglios and geoglyphs. Some archaeologists also consider pits and grooves in the rock, known as cups, rings or cupules, as a form of rock art.[17]\\r\\nAlthough there are exceptions, the majority of rock art whose creation was ethnographically recorded had been produced during rituals.[17] As such, the study of rock art is a component of the archaeology of religion.[18]\\r\\nRock art serves multiple purposes in the contemporary world. In several regions, it remains spiritually important to indigenous peoples, who view it as a significant component of their cultural patrimony.[1] It also serves as an important source of cultural tourism, and hence as economic revenue in certain parts of the world. As such, images taken from cave art have appeared on memorabilia and other artefacts sold as a part of the tourist industry.[2]\\r\\nPictographs are paintings or drawings that have been placed onto the rock face. Such artworks have typically been made with mineral earths and other natural compounds found across much of the world. The predominantly used colours are red, black and white. Red paint is usually attained through the use of ground ochre, while black paint is typically composed of charcoal, or sometimes from minerals such as manganese. White paint is usually created from natural chalk, kaolinite clay or diatomaceous earth.[19] Once the pigments had been obtained, they would be ground and mixed with a liquid, such as water, blood, urine, or egg yolk, and then applied to the stone as paint using a brush, fingers, or a stamp. Alternately, the pigment could have been applied on dry, such as with a stick of charcoal.[20] In some societies, the paint itself has symbolic and religious meaning; for instance, among hunter-gatherer groups in California, paint was only allowed to be traded by the group shamans, while in other parts of North America, the word for \\"paint\\" was the same as the word for \\"supernatural spirit\\".[21]\\r\\nOne unusual form of pictograph, found in many, although not all rock-art producing cultures, is the hand print. There are three forms of this; the first involves covering the hand in wet paint and then applying it to the rock. The second involves a design being painted onto the hand, which is then in turn added to the surface. The third involves the hand first being placed against the panel, with dry paint then being blown onto it through a tube, in a process that is akin to air-brush or spray-painting. The resulting image is a negative print of the hand, and is sometimes described as a \\"stencil\\" in Australian archaeology.[22]\\r\\nPetroglyphs are engravings or carvings into the rock panel. They are created with the use of a hard hammerstone, which is battered against the stone surface. In certain societies, the choice of hammerstone itself has religious significance.[23] In other instances, the rock art is pecked out through indirect percussion, as a second rock is used like a chisel between the hammerstone and the panel.[23] A third, rarer form of engraving rock art was through incision, or scratching, into the surface of the stone with a lithic flake or metal blade. The motifs produced using this technique are fine-lined and often difficult to see.[24]\\r\\nEarth figures are large designs and motifs that are created on the stone ground surface. They can be classified through their method of manufacture.[25] Intaglios are created by scraping away the desert pavements (pebbles covering the ground) to reveal a negative image on the bedrock below. The best known example of such intaglio rock art is the Nazca Lines of Peru.[25] In contrast, geoglyphs are positive images, which are created by piling up rocks on the ground surface to resulting in a visible motif or design.[25]\\r\\nTraditionally, individual markings are called motifs and groups of motifs are known as panels. Sequences of panels are treated as archaeological sites. This method of classifying rock art however has become less popular as the structure imposed is unlikely to have had any relevance to the art's creators. Even the word 'art' carries with it many modern prejudices about the purpose of the features.[citation needed]\\r\\nRock art can be found across a wide geographical and temporal spread of cultures perhaps to mark territory, to record historical events or stories or to help enact rituals. Some art seems to depict real events whilst many other examples are apparently entirely abstract.[citation needed]\\r\\nPrehistoric rock depictions were not purely descriptive. Each motif and design had a \\"deep significance\\" that is not always understandable to modern scholars.[26]\\r\\nIn many instances, the creation of rock art was itself a ritual act.[24] Some rock art has been interpreted to represent presumed cultural behaviors. Common features in rock art that are related to portraying shamans were bones and other skeletal remains on their coats. One reason for the bones would be that they were used as a type of armor for protecting the shaman on his journeys through different worlds. Devlet, the author of \\"Rock Art and the Material Culture of Siberian and Central Asian Shamanism\\" highlights, \\"Another interpretation of these skeletal costume elements explains them as representations of a shaman brought back to life after the dismemberment that occurs during the initiation process: the depicted bones thus refer to the wearer's own skeleton\\" (43). The concept of death and revival is often associated with shamans and the way they are portrayed. The bones were usually on the back of the shaman's jacket or used on the breast-piece.\\r\\nIn Central Asia, spiritual practitioners were depicted wearing fringed fabric. There are differences in the lengths of the fringe and where on the shaman the fringe is located. In the rock art, the fringe was usually long single strands attached to different parts of the shaman's body. The symbolism of the fringe can be interpreted in several ways. One example is, \\"The fringe on a shaman's coat is an important element, which marks his or her ornithomorphic nature (i.e. the ability to transform into a bird or to gain its abilities such as the capacity for flight) \\" (Devlet 44). The concept of fringe being correlated with flying was mainly used in rock art in the Altai, Tuva, and Mongolian regions.\\r\\nA more mainstream characteristic is the detection of the shaman's ritualistic drum. Even though there are different types, shapes, and images painted on the shaman's drum, it is clearly depicted in the rock art. The range of decoration used on the drums varied from simplistic to innately elaborate. The resemblance is remarkably illustrated, \\"In the Altai region, images depicted on historical shamanic drums demonstrate a striking similarity with what is shown on the rock engravings\\" (Devlet 47).\\r\\nIn the Upper Palaeolithic of Europe, rock art was produced inside cave systems by the hunter-gatherer peoples who inhabited the continent. The oldest known example is the Chauvet Cave in France, although others have been located, including Lascaux in France, Alta Mira in Spain and Creswell Crags in Britain and Grotta del Genovese in Sicily.\\r\\nThe late prehistoric rock art of Europe has been divided into three regions by archaeologists. In Atlantic Europe, the coastal seaboard on the west of the continent, which stretches from Iberia up through France and encompasses the British Isles, a variety of different rock arts were produced from the Neolithic through to the Late Bronze Age. A second area of the continent to contain a significant rock art tradition was that of Alpine Europe, with the majority of artworks being clustered in the southern slopes of the mountainous region, in what is now south-eastern France and northern Italy.\\r\\nSites in Africa featuring rock art include:\\r\\nCave paintings are found in all parts of Southern Africa that have rock overhangs with smooth surfaces. Among these sites are the cave sandstone of Natal, Orange Free State and North-Eastern Cape, the granite and Waterberg sandstone of the Northern Transvaal, and the Table Mountain sandstone of the Southern and Western Cape.[27]\\r\\nThe oldest reliably dated rock art in the Americas is known as the \\"Horny Little Man.\\" It is petroglyph depicting a stick figure with an oversized phallus and carved in Lapa do Santo, a cave in central-eastern Brazil.[28] The most important site is Serra da Capivara National Park at Piau state. It is a UNESCO world heritage site with the largest collection in the american continent and one of the most studied.\\r\\nRock paintings or pictographs are located in many areas across Canada. There are over 400 sites attributed to the Ojibway from northern Saskatchewan to the Ottawa River.[29]\\r\\nAustralian Indigenous art is the oldest unbroken tradition of art in the world. The oldest firmly dated rock art painting in Australia is a charcoal drawing on a rock fragment found during the excavation of the Nawarla Gabarnmang rock shelter in south western Arnhem Land in the Northern Territory. Dated at 28,000 years, it is one of the oldest known pieces of rock art on Earth with a confirmed date. Nawarla Gabarnmang is considered to have one of the most extensive collections of rock art in the world and predates both Lascaux and Chauvet cave art, the earliest known art in Europe by at least 10,000 years.[34][35]\\r\\nIn 2008, rock art depicting what is thought to be a Thylacoleo was discovered on the north-western coast of the Kimberley.[36] As the Thylacoleo is believed to have become extinct 45000ÿ46000 years ago (Roberts et al. 2001) (Gillespie 2004), this suggests a similar age for the associated Bradshaw rock paintings. Archaeologist Kim Akerman however believes that the megafauna may have persisted later in refugia (wetter areas of the continent) as suggested by Wells (1985: 228) and has suggested a much younger age for the paintings.[36] Pigments from the \\"Bradshaw paintings\\" of the Kimberley are so old they have become part of the rock itself, making carbon dating impossible. Some experts suggest that these paintings are in the vicinity of 50,000 years old and may even predate Aboriginal settlement.[37][38]\\r\\nThe archaeological sub-discipline devoted to the investigation of rock art is known as \\"rock art studies.\\" Rock art specialist David S. Whitley noted that research in this area required an \\"integrated effort\\" that brings together archaeological theory, method, fieldwork, analytical techniques and interpretation.[41]\\r\\nAlthough French archaeologists had undertaken much research into rock art, Anglophone archaeology had largely neglected the subject for decades.[42]\\r\\nThe discipline of rock art studies witnessed what Whitley called a \\"revolution\\" during the 1980s and 1990s, as increasing numbers of archaeologists in the Anglophone world and Latin America turned their attention to the subject.[43] In doing so, they recognised that rock art could be used to understand symbolic and religious systems, gender relations, cultural boundaries, cultural change and the origins of art and belief.[1] One of the most significant figures in this movement was the South African archaeologist David Lewis-Williams, who published his studies of San rock art from southern Africa, in which he combined ethnographic data to reveal the original purpose of the artworks. Lewis-Williams would come to be praised for elevating rock art studies to a \\"theoretically sophisticated research domain\\" by Whitley.[44] However, the study of rock art worldwide is marked by considerable differences of opinion with respect to the appropriateness of various methods and the most relevant and defensible theoretical framework.\\r\\nThe UNESCO World Rock Art Archive Working Group met in 2011 to discuss the base model for a World Rock Art Archive.[45] While no official output has been generated to date various projects around the world, such as for example The Global Rock Art Database,[46] are looking at making rock art heritage information more accessible and more visible to assist with rock art awareness, conservation and preservation issues.","input":"What is the art of drawing or painting on stone called?"},{"output":"January 1, 1968","context":"Most seat belt laws in the United States are left to the states. However, the first seat belt law was a federal law, Title 49 of the United States Code, Chapter 301, Motor Vehicle Safety Standard, which took effect on January 1, 1968, that required all vehicles (except buses) to be fitted with seat belts in all designated seating positions.[1] This law has since been modified to require three-point seat belts in outboard-seating positions, and finally three-point seat belts in all seating positions.[2] Initially, seat belt use was voluntary. New York was the first state to pass a law which required vehicle occupants to wear seat belts, a law that came into effect on December 1, 1984. Officer Nicholas Cimmino of the Westchester County Department of Public Safety wrote the nations first ticket for such violation.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nU.S. seatbelt laws may be subject to primary enforcement or secondary enforcement. Primary enforcement allows a police officer to stop and ticket a driver if he or she observes a violation. Secondary enforcement means that a police officer may only stop or cite a driver for a seatbelt violation if the driver committed another primary violation (such as speeding, running a stop sign, etc.) at the same time. New Hampshire is the only U.S. state that does not by law require adult drivers to wear safety belts while operating a motor vehicle.\\r\\nIn 18 of the 50 states, the seat belt law is considered a secondary offense, which means that a police officer cannot stop and ticket a driver for the sole offense of not wearing a seatbelt. (One exception to this is Colorado, where children not properly restrained is a primary offense and brings a much larger fine.) If a driver commits a primary violation (e.g., for speeding) he may additionally be charged for not wearing a seatbelt. In most states the seat belt law was originally a secondary offense; in many it was later changed to a primary offense: California was the first state to do this, in 1993. Of the 30 with primary seat belt laws, all but 8, Connecticut, Hawaii, Iowa, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, and Texas, originally had only secondary enforcement laws.\\r\\nThis table contains a brief summary of all seatbelt laws in the United States.[3][4] This list includes only seatbelt laws, which often do not themselves apply to children; however, all 50 states and the District of Columbia have separate child restraint laws. Keep in mind these fines are the base fines only. In many cases considerable extra fees such as the head injury fund and court security fees can mark up the fine to almost five times as much in some cases. These are also \\"first offense\\" fines; a subsequent offense may be much higher.\\r\\nunder 18 in all seats\\r\\n1 Colorado and Missouri's law is Secondary for adults but Primary for under the age of 16.\\r\\n2 Idaho, North Dakota, Pennsylvania, Vermont and Virginia's law is Secondary for adults but Primary for under 18.\\r\\n3 Kansas, Maryland, and New Jersey, law is Secondary Enforcement for rear seat occupants (18+ in Kansas).\\r\\n4 These states assess points on one's driving record for the seat belt violation.\\r\\n5 In California- An additional penalty of $24 shall be levied upon every $10 or fraction thereof, of every fine, penalty, or forfeiture imposed by and collected by the court for criminal offenses, including all traffic offenses, except parking offenses as defined in subdivision (i) of Penal Code  1463. The additional penalty is calculated as follows:\\r\\n? State penalty required by PC 1464 $10,\\r\\n? County penalty required by GC 76000(e), $ 7 ? Court facilities construction penalty required by GC 70372(a),$ 3 ?

However, when in court, most states protect motorists from having their damages reduced in a lawsuit due to the nonuse of a seatbelt, even if they were acting in violation of the law by not wearing the seatbelt. Currently, damages may be reduced for the nonuse of a seatbelt in 16 states: Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida (See F.S.A. 316.614(10)), Iowa, Michigan, Missouri, Nebraska, New Jersey, New York, North Dakota, Ohio, Oregon, West Virginia, and Wisconsin.[11]\\r\\nSeat belt laws are effective in reducing car crash deaths.[12] One study found that mandatory-seatbelt laws reduced traffic fatalities by 8% and serious traffic-related injuries by 9%, respectively.[13] Primary-seatbelt laws seem to be more effective at reducing crash deaths than secondary laws.[14][15]","input":"When were seat belts first required in cars?"},{"output":"102 tiles","context":"Editions of the word board game Scrabble in different languages have differing letter distributions of the tiles, because the frequency of each letter of the alphabet is different for every language. As a general rule, the rarer the letter, the more points it is worth.\\r\\n\\r\\nMany languages use sets of 102 tiles, since the original distribution of one hundred tiles was later augmented with two blank tiles.

These letters, however, cannot be used even if with a blank.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Anglo-Saxon editions use these 101 tiles:[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nAnglo-Saxon uses the letter K, but it only occurs in one word (kyning) and loanwords, so there is no tile for it. J, V, Q, and Z are only used in loanwords. Anglo-Saxon uses the letter ?, but it was replaced by W in this set because it can be easily confused with P.

This is not an official version of the game, although Hasbro did create their own licensed \\"Star Trek Scrabble\\" game in which players can receive bonus points by playing Klingon words.  \\"Star Trek Scrabble\\" uses standard English-language tiles.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are three kinds of Latin-language Scrabble sets developed by three authorities in the language.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first distribution, developed by the Centre for Medieval Studies of the University of Toronto, uses these 100 tiles:\\r\\n\\r\\nAn extension of the first distribution for Latin Paleography, developed by the Centre for Medieval Studies of the University of Toronto, uses these 120 tiles:\\r\\n\\r\\nThe point value of ? is unknown, but it is believed to be 3. ?, which represents con, can only be played as the first tile of a word. ?, which represents rum, and ;, which represents is or us, can only be played as the last tile of a word. ? (e caudata), also written as ?, represents ae.  represents em or en. & represents et. ؐ represents im or in. ? represents oe. ? represents per, P? represents prae. ? represents pro. V? represents vm or vn (as there was no U at the time). Note that W, unlike ?/? and ?, which were created at the same time, has no tile because there is no vv digraph in Latin. ?? represents 2 minims: ii, v, or n. ??? represents 3 minims: iii, iv, in, vi, ni, or m.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe second distribution below was made \\"in conjunction with scholars from the University of Cambridge and elsewhere, together with the Cambridge Schools Classics Project.\\" This distribution distinguishes U from V, with the semi-vocalic V scoring five times the points.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe third distribution is as follows:[38]\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, with this set, according to the rules, if a blank is used as a Y it is worth 10 points, if a blank is used as a Z it is worth 15 points, and if a blank is used as a K it is worth 20 points. Each of those letters are so high in points, because they are used only in borrowed words. The score of 20 for a K is the highest known point value for any letter in any Scrabble score distribution worldwide. Y is absent in all sets except the paleographic extension of the first set because it is rare in Latin. K and Z are also absent in all sets because they are rare in Latin, while J is not considered separate from I in all sets except the third one, in which it is  not included because it is rare in Latin. W is also absent in all sets because it did not exist in ancient times, and is used only in modern borrowed words.\\r\\n\\r\\nLatvian-language sets use these 104 tiles:[39]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe letters Q, W, X and Y are absent, because they are not used in Latvian.

The combination ZO is absent as it is only used in 7 words (brazo, kinzo, zo'a, zo'e, zo'i, zo'o, and zo'u). The combination ['Y] is absent as it is only used in 1 word (.y'y). The letter . occurs in Lojban, but it is so infrequent that it has no tile. Blanks can be used to represent any of the above letters (including .) and digrams(including XO, ZO, and ['Y]). The letter ['] occurs in Lojban, but only in digrams and never as one letter. The letters H, Q, and W  are absent, because these letters are not used in Lojban.\\r\\n\\r\\nLojban-language sets in the 1990s (which include lujvo) use these 100 tiles:\\r\\n\\r\\nLojban-language sets in the 1990s (which do not include lujvo) use these 100 tiles:\\r\\n\\r\\nY is absent because it is very rare outside lujvo.\\r\\n\\r\\nMalagasy-language sets use these 102 tiles:[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nC, Q, U, W, and X are absent because these letters are not used in Malagasy.

H is absent because it is only used in the digraphs above. , , and ܇ are absent since they are rarely used in the Scottish Gaelic language. J, K, Q, V, W, X, Y, and Z are absent since they are not used in the Scottish Gaelic language. This version is used by Scrabble3D and is not an official edition by Mattel.\\r\\n\\r\\nSlovak-language sets use these 100 tiles:\\r\\n\\r\\nQ, W, , ?, ?, and  are absent because they are only used in loanwords. Arguably X does not exist in Slovak either, but the designer included it as it is used in loanwords.\\r\\n\\r\\nSince 2013, a new 112-tile set was introduced:\\r\\n\\r\\nArguably the Q,W, and X tiles should still not be included, but the manufacturer decided to include them, so that loanwords can be played.\\r\\n\\r\\nSlovenian-language sets use these 100 tiles:\\r\\n\\r\\nQ, W, X and Y are absent, because Slovenian does not use those letters.\\r\\n\\r\\nSpanish-language sets sold outside North America use these 100 tiles:\\r\\n\\r\\nStress accents are disregarded.

According to FISE (Federaci܇n Internacional de Scrabble en Espa?ol) rules, a blank cannot be used to represent K or W.\\r\\n\\r\\nUsing one C and one H tile in place of the CH tile, two L tiles for the LL tile, or two R tiles for the RR tile is also not allowed in Spanish Scrabble (see rules in Spanish provided by the FISE).\\r\\n\\r\\nSpanish-language sets sold within North America (known as Scrabble?ÿ Edici܇n en Espa?ol) use - including \\"K\\" and \\"W\\" but without \\"CH\\" - these 103 tiles:\\r\\n\\r\\nStress accents are still disregarded. Arguably the K and W tiles should not be included in this Scrabble set, but they are anyway, so that loanwords can be played.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Spanish Scrabble, the tile Q can be played as with or without a U, which means the Q-without-U stuck in most Scrabble variants in other languages does not exist in Spanish Scrabble.\\r\\n\\r\\nSwedish-language Scrabble sets (until 1990 sold in Sweden as Alfapet, but that became a different game) use these 100 tiles:\\r\\n\\r\\n?, ? and ? have separate tiles; other diacritics like that on  are ignored (except ). Q and W, found only in loanwords, are absent but can be played with a blank.  and ? require a blank, and as of 2010 only occur in one and three playable words respectively: msli and three forms of Laestadianism (l?stadianism in Swedish).\\r\\n\\r\\nOriginally (starting in 1954), Swedish Scrabble sets (called Alfa-pet, made by the Swedish company Alga, a member of the BRIO Group) used a slightly different distribution:\\r\\n\\r\\nNote that Z was absent in this distribution as it is almost exclusively used in loanwords. However, it could be played with a blank.\\r\\n\\r\\nBetween 1956 and 1961, the makers of Alfa-pet revised the distribution, altering the number of tiles for the letters B, E, N, O, P, S, and U. The letter C was reduced in value to 5 and the X was increased to 10:\\r\\n\\r\\nCirca 1961, the hyphen was dropped from the game's name, and the original Swedish distribution of the game had been restored. Sometime later, produced under BRIO's subsidiary, Joker, the number of Ts in the set were reduced by one and an 8-point Z tile was added.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2002, under the ownership of Mattel and its brand name Scrabble, the Swedish language set tile values of the C and Z were changed, respectively, to 8 and 10.\\r\\n\\r\\nThough Alga had lost its license to Mattel Europa in the early 1990s in the production of the game, the company held onto its ownership of the name Alfapet. ssubsequently it produced a different yet similar crossword board game. Played on a different grid layout, this game is played with a distribution which contains these 120 tiles, with Q but not W:\\r\\n\\r\\nThe black tile may be put in front of a word to create another word adjacent to the black tile and thus diagonally away from the original word. The arrows lets the player change the direction of a word anywhere between the first and last letter of the word, and are always placed under letters. Anyway, Q is only used in loanwords in modern Swedish, so it is included.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Tswana editions use these 104 tiles:[50]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe letters C, Q, V, X, and Z have no tiles as these letters are rarely used in Tswana. However, they can still be played with a blank. Diacritical marks are ignored. This is a hand-made edition and not an official one.\\r\\n\\r\\nTurkish-language sets use these 100 tiles (including distinct dotted and dotless I tiles):\\r\\n\\r\\nThe letters Q, W, and X are not used in Turkish and therefore do not appear in the set.  Blanks may not represent these letters, meaning loanwords that may use them may not appear in the game at all.\\r\\n\\r\\n(See a completed Turkish Scrabble board:)\\r\\n\\r\\nTuvan-language Scrabble sets, which use Cyrillic letters, use these 125 tiles:[51]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe distribution lacks four letters used only in loanwords: , , , and ƨ.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis version is made for educational purposes and is not an official edition by Mattel.\\r\\n\\r\\nAn optimum Ukrainian-language Scrabble sets, which use Cyrillic letters, contain 104 tiles using this distribution:\\r\\n\\r\\nThe apostrophe sign is also included, even though it is not a letter in the Ukrainian alphabet.\\r\\n\\r\\nWelsh-language Scrabble sets use these 105 tiles:\\r\\n\\r\\nSince there are specific tiles for the digraphs that are considered to be separate letters in Welsh orthography (such as DD), it is not permissible to use the individual letters to spell these out. Diacritics on letters are ignored.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe digraph PH also exists in Welsh, but is omitted because it is used almost exclusively in mutated words, which the rules disallow. K, Q, V, X and Z also do not exist in Welsh. J does not exist in traditional Welsh either, but it is included as it is used in some borrowed words.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nZhuyin Chinese-language editions of Scrabble use these 100 tiles.[52]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe letter ٬ (S) has no tile as it is almost exclusively used in the letter  (SH) in this edition. The letters  (C), ٩ (CH),  (F),  (K), and  (P) are used in Zhuyin, but so infrequently that they have no tiles.","input":"How many scrabble tiles are in a game?"},{"output":"near-future New England","context":"The Handmaid's Tale is a 1985 dystopian novel[2] by Canadian author Margaret Atwood.[3][4] Set in a near-future New England, in a totalitarian, Christian theonomy that has overthrown the United States government,[5] the novel explores themes of women in subjugation and the various means by which they gain individualism and independence. The novel's title echoes the component parts of Geoffrey Chaucer's The Canterbury Tales, which is a series of connected stories (\\"The Merchant's Tale\\", \\"The Parson's Tale\\", etc.).[6]\\r\\nThe Handmaid's Tale is structured into two parts, night and other various events. This novel can be interpreted as a double narrative, Offred's tale, and the Handmaid's tales. The night sections are solely about Offred, and the other sections (shopping, waiting room, household etc.) are the stories that describe the possible life of every Handmaid.\\r\\nThe Handmaid's Tale won the 1985 Governor General's Award and the first Arthur C. Clarke Award in 1987; it was also nominated for the 1986 Nebula Award, the 1986 Booker Prize, and the 1987 Prometheus Award. The book has been adapted into a film (1990), an opera (2000), a TV series (2017), and other media.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Handmaid's Tale is set in the Republic of Gilead, a theonomic military dictatorship formed within the borders of what was formerly the United States of America.[5]\\r\\nBeginning with a staged attack that kills the President and most of Congress, a fundamentalist Christian Reconstructionist movement calling itself the \\"Sons of Jacob\\" launches a revolution and suspends the United States Constitution under the pretext of restoring order.[7] They are quickly able to take away women's rights, largely attributed to financial records being stored electronically and labelled by sex. The new regime, the Republic of Gilead, moves quickly to consolidate its power and reorganize society along a new militarized, hierarchical model of Old Testament-inspired social and religious fanaticism among its newly created social classes. In this society, human rights are severely limited and women's rights are even more curtailed; for example, women are forbidden to read.\\r\\nThe story is told in the first person by a woman called Offred. She has an odd name which is explained as the book progresses. The character is one of a class of women kept for reproductive purposes and known as \\"handmaids\\" by the ruling class in an era of declining births due to sterility from pollution and sexually transmitted diseases. Offred describes her life during her third assignment as a handmaid, in this case to Fred (referred to as \\"The Commander\\"). Interspersed in flashbacks are portions of her life from before and during the beginning of the revolution, when she finds she has lost all autonomy to her husband, through her failed attempt to escape with her husband and daughter to Canada, to her indoctrination into life as a handmaid. Offred describes the structure of Gilead's society, including the several different classes of women and their circumscribed lives in the new theonomy.\\r\\nThe Commander is a high-ranking official in Gilead. Although he is supposed to have contact with Offred only during \\"the ceremony\\", a ritual of sexual intercourse intended to result in conception and at which his wife is present, he begins an illegal and ambiguous relationship with her. He offers her hidden or contraband products, such as old (1970s) fashion magazines, cosmetics and clothes, takes her to a secret brothel run by the government, and furtively meets with her in his study, where he allows her to read, an activity otherwise prohibited for women. The Commander's wife, Serena Joy, also has secret interactions with Offred, arranging for her secretly to have sex with Nick, the Commander's driver, in an effort to get Offred pregnant. In exchange for Offred's cooperation, Serena Joy gives her news of her daughter, whom Offred has not seen since she and her family were captured trying to escape Gilead.\\r\\nAfter Offred's initial meeting with Nick, they begin to meet more frequently. Offred discovers she enjoys sex with Nick, despite her indoctrination and her memories of her husband. She shares potentially dangerous information about her past with him. Through another handmaid, Ofglen, Offred learns of the Mayday resistance, an underground network working to overthrow Gilead. Shortly after Ofglen's disappearance (later revealed as a suicide), the Commander's wife finds evidence of the relationship between Offred and the Commander. Offred contemplates suicide. As the novel concludes, she is being taken away by the secret police, the Eyes of God, known informally as \\"the Eyes\\", under orders from Nick. Before she is put in the large black van, Nick tells her that the men are part of the Mayday resistance and that Offred must trust him. Offred does not know if Nick is a member of the Mayday resistance or a government agent posing as one, and she does not know if going with the men will result in her escape or her capture. She enters the van with her future uncertain.\\r\\nThe novel concludes with a metafictional epilogue that explains that the events of the novel occurred shortly after the beginning of what is called \\"the Gilead Period\\". The epilogue is \\"a partial transcript of the proceedings of the Twelfth Symposium on Gileadean Studies\\" written in 2195. According to the symposium's \\"keynote speaker\\" Professor Pieixoto, he and his colleague Professor Knotly Wade discovered Offred's story recorded onto cassette tapes. They transcribed the tapes, calling them collectively \\"the handmaid's tale\\". Through the tone and actions of the professionals in this final section of the book, the world of academia is highlighted and critiqued, and Pieixoto discusses his team's search for the characters named in the Tale, and the impossibility of proving the tapes' authenticity.[8] Nevertheless, the epilogue implies that, following the collapse of the theonomic Republic of Gilead, a more equal societythough not the United States that previously existedre-emerged, with a restoration of full rights for women and freedom of religion.\\r\\nOffred is the protagonist and narrator. She was labeled a \\"wanton woman\\" when Gilead was established because she had married a man who was divorced. All divorces were nullified by the new government, meaning her husband was now considered still married to his first wife, making Offred an adulteress. In trying to escape Gilead, she was separated from her husband and daughter. She is part of the first generation of Gilead's women, those who remember pre-Gilead times. Proved fertile, she is considered an important commodity and has been placed as a handmaid in the home of the Commander Fred and his wife Serena Joy, to bear a child for them (Serena Joy is believed to be infertile).[9]\\r\\nOffred is a slave name that describes her function: she is \\"of Fred\\", i.e. she belongs to Fred, her commander, and is considered a concubine. In the novel, Offred says that she is not a concubine, but a tool; a \\"two legged womb\\". The Handmaids' names say nothing about who the women really are (Offred Of Fred, Ofglen Of Glen); their only identity is as the Commander's property. \\"Offred\\" is also pun on the word \\"offered\\", as in \\"offered as a sacrifice\\". And it is a play on the words \\"off-red\\", referencing the color that handmaids wear and the character's frustrations with her assigned position.[6] It is implied that her birth name is June. The women in training to be handmaids whisper names across their beds at night. The names are \\"Alma. Janine. Dolores. Moira. June\\", and all are later accounted for except June. In addition, one of the Aunts tells the handmaids-in-training to stop \\"mooning and June-ing\\".[10] Miner suggests that \\"June\\" is a pseudonym. As \\"Mayday\\" is the name of the Gilead resistance, June could be an invention by the protagonist. The Nunavit conference covered in the epilogue takes place in June.[11] Atwood wrote that it was not her original intention to imply that Offred's real name is June \\"but it fits, so readers are welcome to it if they wish.\\"[6]\\r\\nThe Commander says that he is a sort of scientist and was previously involved in something similar to market research, pre-Gilead. Later, it is hypothesized, but not confirmed, that he might have been one of the architects of the Republic and its laws. Presumably, his first name is \\"Fred\\", though that, too, may be a pseudonym.\\r\\nHe engages in forbidden intellectual pursuits with Offred, such as playing Scrabble, and introduces her to a secret club that serves as a brothel for high-ranking officers. Offred learns that the Commander carried on a similar relationship with his previous handmaid and that she killed herself when his wife found out. In the epilogue the academics speculate that one of two figures, both instrumental in the establishment of Gilead, may have been Fred, based on his first name. It is strongly suggested that the Commander was a man named Frederick R. Waterford who was killed in a purge shortly after Offred was taken away, charged with harboring an enemy agent.\\r\\nSerena Joy is a former televangelist and the Commander's wife in the fundamentalist theonomy. The state took away her power and public recognition, and tries to hide her past as a television figure. Offred identifies her master's wife by recalling seeing her on TV when she was a little girl early on Saturday mornings while waiting for the cartoons to air. Believed to be sterile (although the suggestion is made that the Commander is sterile - Gileadean laws attribute sterility only to women), she is forced to accept that he has use of a handmaid. She resents having to take part in the monthly fertility ritual. She strikes a deal with Offred to arrange for her to have sex with Nick in order to become pregnant. According to Professor Pieixoto in the epilogue, \\"Serena Joy\\" or \\"Pam\\" are pseudonyms; the character's real name is implied to be Thelma.\\r\\nOfglen is a neighbour of Offred's and a fellow Handmaid. She is partnered with Offred to do the daily shopping. Handmaids are never alone and are expected to police each other's behaviour. Ofglen is a member of the Mayday resistance. In contrast to Offred, she is daring. She knocks out a Mayday spy who is to be tortured and killed in order to save him the pain of a violent death. Offred is told that when Ofglen vanishes, it is because she has committed suicide before the government can take her into custody due to her membership in the resistance, possibly to avoid giving away any information.\\r\\nA new handmaid, also called Ofglen, takes Ofglen's place, and is assigned as Offred's shopping partner. She threatens Offred against any thought of resistance. She breaks protocol by telling her what happened to the first Ofglen.\\r\\nNick is the Commander's chauffeur, who lives above the garage. By Serena Joy's arrangement, he and Offred start a sexual relationship to increase her chance of getting pregnant. If she were unable to bear the Commander a child, she would be declared sterile and shipped to the ecological wastelands of the Colonies. Offred begins to develop feelings for him. Nick is an ambiguous character, and Offred does not know if he is a party loyalist or part of the resistance, though he identifies himself as the former. The epilogue suggests that he really was part of the resistance, and aided Offred in escaping the Commander's house.\\r\\nMoira has been a close friend of Offred's since college. A lesbian, she has resisted the homophobia of Gilead society. Moira is taken to be a Handmaid soon after Offred. She escapes by stealing an Aunt's pass and clothes, but Offred later finds her working as a prostitute in a party-run brothel. She was caught and chose the brothel rather than be sent to the Colonies.\\r\\nLuke was Offred's husband prior to the formation of Gilead. He had divorced his first wife to marry her. Under Gilead, all divorces were retroactively nullified, resulting in Offred being considered an adulteress and their daughter a bastard. Offred was forced to become a Handmaid and her daughter was given to a loyalist family. Since their attempt to escape to Canada, Offred has heard nothing of Luke.\\r\\nPieixoto is the \\"co-discoverer [with Professor Knotly Wade] of Offred's tapes\\". He talks in his presentation about \\"the 'Problems of Authentication in Reference to The Handmaid's Tale'\\".[9]\\r\\nThe novel is set in an indeterminate future, speculated to be around the year 2005,[12] with a fundamentalist theonomy ruling the territory of what had been the United States but is now the Republic of Gilead. Individuals are segregated by categories and dressed according to their social functions. The complex sumptuary laws (dress codes) play a key role in imposing social control within the new society and serve to distinguish people by sex, occupation, and caste.\\r\\nThe action takes place in what once was the Harvard Square neighbourhood of Cambridge, Massachusetts;[13][14] Atwood studied at Radcliffe College, located in this area.\\r\\nIn Gilead, the bodies of fertile women are politicized and controlled. The North American population is falling as more men and women become infertile (though in Gilead, legally, it is only women who can be the cause of infertility). Gilead's treatment of women is based upon what the author portrays as a narrow, fundamentalist interpretation of the Bible, meaning that women are the property of and subordinate to their husband, father, or head of household. They are not allowed to do anything that would grant them any power independent of this system. They are not allowed to vote, hold a job, read, possess money, or own anything, among many other restrictions. A particular quote from The Handmaid's Tale sums this up: \\"The Republic of Gilead, said Aunt Lydia, knows no bounds. Gilead is within you\\" (HT 5.2). This describes that there is no way around the societal bounds of women in this new state of government. Handmaids, being not allowed to wed, are given two-year assignments with a commander, and lose their own name: they are called \\"Of [their Commander's first name]\\", such as the novel's protagonist, known only as Offred. When a handmaid is reassigned, her name changes with her. Their original identities before the revolution are suppressed, although while being reeducated as handmaids, they surreptitiously share their names with each other.\\r\\nIn this book, the government appears to be strong though \\"no one in Gilead seems to be a true believer in its revolution\\" (Beauchamp). The Commanders, portrayed via Commander Fred, do not agree with their own doctrines. The commander takes Offred at one point to a brothel in order to have sex with her in an informal setting apart from the Ceremony. The wives, portrayed via Serena Joy, former television evangelist, disobey the rules set forth by their commander husbands. Serena smokes black market cigarettes and expresses the forbidden idea that men may be infertile, and schemes to get Offred impregnated by her chauffeur.\\r\\nBruce Miller, the executive producer of The Handmaid's Tale television serial, declared with regard to Atwood's book, as well as his series, that Gilead is \\"a society thats based kind of in a perverse misreading of Old Testament laws and codes\\".[15] The author explains that Gilead tries to embody the \\"utopian idealism\\" present in 20th-century rgimes, such as Cambodia and Romania, as well as earlier New England Puritanism.[16] Both Atwood and Miller stated that the people running Gilead are \\"not genuinely Christian\\".[17][15] The group running Gilead, according to Atwood, is \\"not really interested in religion; they're interested in power.\\"[18] In fact, in her prayers to God, June (Offred), reflecting on Gilead, prays I don't believe for an instant that what's going on out there is what You meant. I suppose I should say I forgive whoever did this, and whatever theyre doing now. Ill try, but it isnt easy.[19] Margaret Atwood, writing on this, says that \\"Offred herself has a private version of the Lord's Prayer and refuses to believe that this regime has been mandated by a just and merciful God.\\"[20] Christian churches that do not support the actions of the Sons of Jacob are systematically demolished, and the people living in Gilead are never seen attending church.[15] Christian denominations, including Quakers, Baptists and Roman Catholics, as well as Jews, are specifically named as enemies of the Sons of Jacob.[18][15] To this end, the book includes a scene in which a Catholic Christian nun is \\"forced to renounce her vow of chastity in order to become a child-bearing handmaid.\\"[17] Likewise, a Catholic Christian priest was hanged from a bridge for refusing to renounce his faith.[21] Atwood pits Quaker Christians against the rgime by having them help the oppressed, something she feels they would do in reality: \\"The Quakers have gone underground, and are running an escape route to Canada, asI suspectthey would.\\"[20]\\r\\nAfrican Americans, the main non-white ethnic group in this society, are called the Children of Ham. A state TV broadcast mentions they have been relocated en masse to \\"National Homelands\\" in the Midwest, which are suggestive of the Apartheid-era homelands set up by South Africa. Roman Catholics are only briefly mentioned: nuns who refuse conversion are considered \\"Unwomen\\" and banished to the Colonies, owing to their reluctance to marry and refusal (or inability) to bear children. Priests unwilling to convert are executed and hanged from the Wall. Jews are called Sons of Jacob, also the name of the fundamentalist group that rules the Republic of Gilead. Offred observes that Jews refusing to convert are allowed to emigrate to Israel, and most choose to leave. However, in the Epilogue, Professor Pieixoto reveals that many of the emigrating Jews ended up being dumped into the sea while on the ships ostensibly tasked with transporting them to Israel, due to privatization of the \\"repatriation program\\" and capitalists' effort to maximize profits. Offred mentions that many Jews who chose to stay were caught secretly practicing Judaism and executed.\\r\\nThe sexes are strictly divided. Gilead's society values reproduction by white women most highly. Women are categorised \\"hierarchically according to class status and reproductive capacity\\" as well as \\"metonymically colour-coded according to their function and their labour\\" (Kauffman 232). The Commander expresses the prevailing opinion that women are considered intellectually and emotionally inferior to men.\\r\\nWomen are segregated by clothing, as are men. With rare exception, men wear military or paramilitary uniforms, which takes away their individualism as it does the women, but also gives them a sense of bravado and empowerment. All classes of men and women are defined by the colours they wear (as in Aldous Huxley's dystopian Brave New World), drawing on colour symbolism and psychology. All lower-status individuals are regulated by this dress code. All non-persons are banished to the \\"Colonies\\" (usually forced-labor camps in which they clean up radioactive waste, becoming exposed and dying painful deaths as a result). Sterile, unmarried women are considered to be non-persons. Both men and women sent there wear grey dresses.\\r\\nSix main categories of \\"legitimate\\" women make up mainstream society. Two chief categories of \\"illegitimate\\" women live outside of mainstream society:\\r\\nThe division of labour among the women generates some resentment. Marthas, Wives and Econowives perceive Handmaids as promiscuous and are taught to scorn them. Offred mourns that the women of the various groups have lost their ability to empathize with each other. They are divided in their oppression.\\r\\nMen are classified into four main categories:\\r\\nMen who engage in homosexuality or related acts are declared \\"Gender Traitors\\"; they are either hanged or sent to the \\"colonies\\" to die a slow death.\\r\\nIn this society, birth defects have become increasingly common.\\r\\nThere are two main categories of human children:\\r\\n\\"The Ceremony\\" is a non-marital sexual act sanctioned for reproduction. The ritual requires the Handmaid to lie on her back between the legs of the Wife during the sex act as if they were one person. The Wife has to invite the Handmaid to share her power this way; many Wives consider this both humiliating and offensive. Offred describes the ceremony:\\r\\nMy red skirt is hitched up to my waist, though no higher. Below it the Commander is fucking. What he is fucking is the lower part of my body. I do not say making love, because this is not what he's doing. Copulating too would be inaccurate, because it would imply two people and only one is involved. Nor does rape cover it: nothing is going on here that I haven't signed up for.[22]\\r\\nIn the novel's fictional fundamentalist society, sterile is an \\"outlawed\\" word.[23] In this society, there is no such thing as a sterile man anymore. In this culture, women are either fruitful or barren, the latter of which is declared to be an \\"unwoman\\" and is sent to the colonies with the rest of the \\"unwomen\\" to do life-threatening work until their death, which is, on average, three years.\\r\\nAtwood emphasises how changes in context affect behaviours and attitudes by repeating the phrase \\"Context is all\\" throughout the novel, establishing this precept as a motif.[24] Playing the game of Scrabble with her Commander illustrates the key significance of changes in \\"context\\"; once \\"the game of old men and women\\", the game became forbidden for women to play and therefore \\"desirable\\".[25] Through living in a morally rigid society, Offred has come to perceive the world differently from earlier. Offred expresses amazement at how \\"It has taken so little time to change our minds about things\\".[26] Wearing revealing clothes and makeup had been part of her former life, but when she sees Japanese tourists dressed that way, she now feels the women are inappropriately dressed.[26]\\r\\nOffred can read but not translate the phrase \\"nolite te bastardes carborundorum\\" carved into the closet wall of her small bedroom; this mock-Latin aphorism signifies \\"Don't let the bastards grind you down\\".[27] The significance of this phrase is intensified by the challenges the book has faced, creating a \\"Mise en abyme\\" as both the protagonist and the reader decipher subversive texts.\\r\\nIn interviews and essays Atwood has discussed generic classification of The Handmaid's Tale as \\"science fiction\\" or \\"speculative fiction\\", observing:\\r\\nI like to make a distinction between science fiction proper and speculative fiction. For me, the science fiction label belongs on books with things in them that we can't yet do, such as going through a wormhole in space to another universe; and speculative fiction means a work that employs the means already to hand, such as DNA identification and credit cards, and that takes place on Planet Earth. But the terms are fluid.[3]\\r\\nHugo-winning science fiction critic David Langford observed in a column: \\"The Handmaid's Tale won the very first Arthur C. Clarke Award in 1987. She's been trying to live this down ever since.\\" He says:\\r\\nAtwood prefers to say that she writes speculative fictiona term coined by SF author Robert A. Heinlein. As she told the Guardian, \\"Science fiction has monsters and spaceships; speculative fiction could really happen.\\" She used a subtly different phrasing for New Scientist, \\"Oryx and Crake is not science fiction. It is fact within fiction. Science fiction is when you have rockets and chemicals.\\" So it was very cruel of New Scientist to describe this interview in the contents list as: \\"Margaret Atwood explains why science is crucial to her science fiction.\\" ... Play it again, Ms Atwoodthis time for the Book-of-the-Month Club: \\"Oryx and Crake is a speculative fiction, not a science fiction proper. It contains no intergalactic space travel, no teleportation, no Martians.\\" On BBC1 Breakfast News the distinguished author explained that science fiction, as opposed to what she writes, is characterized by \\"talking squids in outer space\\".[4]\\r\\nIn distinguishing between these genre labels science fiction and speculative fiction, Atwood acknowledges that others may use the terms interchangeably. But she notes her interest in this type of work to explore themes in ways that \\"realistic fiction\\" cannot do.[3]\\r\\nFitting with her claims that The Handmaid's Tale is a work of speculative fiction, not science fiction, Atwood's novel offers a satirical view of various social, political, and religious trends of the 1980s United States. Further, Atwood questions what would happen if these trends, and especially \\"casually held attitudes about women\\" were taken to their logical end.[28] Atwood continues to argue that all of the scenarios offered in The Handmaid's Tale have actually occurred in real lifein an interview she gave regarding Oryx and Crake, Atwood maintains that \\"As with The Handmaid's Tale, I didn't put in anything that we haven't already done, we're not already doing, we're seriously trying to do, coupled with trends that are already in progress... So all of those things are real, and therefore the amount of pure invention is close to nil.\\"[29] Atwood was also known to carry around newspaper clippings to her various interviews to support her fiction's basis in reality.[30] Atwood has explained that The Handmaid's Tale is a response to those who claim the oppressive, totalitarian, and religious governments that have taken hold in other countries throughout the years \\"can't happen here\\"but in this work, she has tried to show how such a takeover might play out.[31]\\r\\nAtwood's inspiration for the Republic of Gilead came from her time studying early American Puritans while at Harvard, which she attended on a Woodrow Wilson Fellowship.[28] Atwood argues that the modern view of the Puritansthat they came to America to flee religious persecution in England and set up a religiously tolerant societyis misleading, and that instead, these Puritan leaders wanted to establish a monolithic theocracy where religious dissent would not be accepted.[28] Atwood also had a personal connection to the Puritans, and she dedicates the novel to her own ancestor Mary Webster, who was accused of witchcraft in Puritan New England but survived her hanging.[32] Due to the totalitarian nature of Gileadan society, Atwood, in creating the setting, drew from the \\"utopian idealism\\" present in 20th century rgimes, such as Cambodia and Romania, as well as earlier New England Puritanism.[16] Atwood has argued that a coup, such as the one depicted in The Handmaid's Tale, would misuse religion in order to achieve its own ends:[33]\\r\\n... if you wanted to seize power in the US, abolish liberal democracy and set up a dictatorship, how would you go about it? What would be your cover story? It would not resemble any form of communism or socialism: those would be too unpopular... Nations never build apparently radical forms of government on foundations that aren't there already. Thus China replaced a state bureaucracy with a similar state bureaucracy under a different name, the USSR replaced the dreaded imperial secret police with an even more dreaded secret police, and so forth. The deep foundation of the US ÿ so went my thinking ÿ was not the comparatively recent 18th-century Enlightenment structures of the republic, with their talk of equality and their separation of church and state, but the heavy-handed theocracy of 17th-century Puritan New England, with its marked bias against women, which would need only the opportunity of a period of social chaos to reassert itself. Like any theocracy, this one would select a few passages from the Bible to justify its actions, and it would lean heavily towards the Old Testament, not towards the New.[16]\\r\\nAtwood, with respect to those leading Gilead, further stated:[18]\\r\\nI don't consider these people to be Christians because they do not have at the core of their behavior and ideologies what I, in my feeble Canadian way, would consider to be the core of Christianity  and that would be not only love your neighbors but love your enemies. That would also be 'I was sick and you visited me not' and such and such And that would include also concern for the environment, because you can't love your neighbor or even your enemy, unless you love your neighbor's oxygen, food, and water. You can't love your neighbor or your enemy if you're presuming policies that are going to cause those people to die.  Of course faith can be a force for good and often has been. So faith is a force for good particularly when people are feeling beleaguered and in need of hope. So you can have bad iterations and you can also have the iteration in which people have got too much power and then start abusing it. But that is human behavior, so you can't lay it down to religion. You can find the same in any power situation, such as politics or ideologies that purport to be atheist. Need I mention the former Soviet Union? So it is not a question of religion making people behave badly. It is a question of human beings getting power and then wanting more of it.[18]\\r\\nIn the same vein, Atwood also declared that \\"In the real world today, some religious groups are leading movements for the protection of vulnerable groups, including women.\\"[20] Atwood also draws connections between the ways in which Gilead's leaders maintain their power and other examples of actual totalitarian governments. In her interviews, Atwood offers up Iran and Afghanistan as examples of religious theocracies forcing women out of the public sphere and into their homes, as in Gilead.[30][28] The \\"state-sanctioned murder of dissidents\\" was inspired by the Philippines, and the last General Secretary of the Romanian Communist Party Nicolae Ceausescu's obsession with increasing the birth rate led to the strict policing of pregnant women and the outlawing of birth control and abortion.[30] However, Atwood clearly explains that many of these deplorable acts were not just present in other cultures and countries, \\"but within Western society, and within the 'Christian' tradition itself\\".[16]\\r\\nThe Republic of Gilead struggles with infertility, making Offred's services as a Handmaid vital to producing children and thus reproducing the society. Handmaids themselves are \\"untouchable\\", but their ability to signify status is equated to that of slaves or servants throughout history.[16] Atwood connects their concerns with infertility to real-life problems our world faces, such as radiation, chemical pollution, and venereal disease (HIV/AIDS is specifically mentioned in the \\"Historical Notes\\" section at the end of the novel, which was a relatively new disease at the time of Atwood's writing whose long-term impact was likely still unknown). Atwood's strong stance on environmental issues and their negative consequences for our society has presented itself in other works such as her MaddAddam trilogy, and refers back to her growing up with biologists and her own scientific curiosity.[34]\\r\\nThe Handmaid's Tale was well received by critics, helping to cement Atwood's status as a prominent writer of the 20th century. Not only was the book deemed well-written and compelling, but Atwood's work was notable for sparking intense debates both in and out of academia.[35] Atwood maintains that the Republic of Gilead is only an extrapolation of trends already seen in the United States at the time of her writing, a view supported by other scholars studying The Handmaid's Tale.[36] Indeed, many have placed The Handmaid's Tale in the same category of dystopian fiction as Nineteen Eighty-Four and Brave New World,[31] with the added feature of confronting patriarchy, a categorization that Atwood has accepted and reiterated in many articles and interviews.[37] Even today, many reviewers hold that Atwood's novel remains as foreboding and powerful as ever, largely because of its basis in historical fact.[38][39] Yet when her book was first published in 1985, not all reviewers were convinced of the \\"cautionary tale\\" Atwood presented. For example, Mary McCarthy's New York Times review argued that The Handmaid's Tale lacked the \\"surprised recognition\\" necessary for readers to see \\"our present selves in a distorting mirror, of what we may be turning into if current trends are allowed to continue\\".[40]\\r\\nIn the aftermath of the television series' debut in 2017, there was much debate on whether parallels could be drawn between the series (and by extension, this book) and American society following Donald Trump's and Mike Pence's election as President of the United States and Vice President of the United States, respectively.[41][42]\\r\\nMuch of the discussion about The Handmaid's Tale has centered on its categorization as feminist literature. Atwood does not see the Republic of Gilead as a purely feminist dystopia, as not all men have greater rights than women.[16] Instead, this society presents a typical dictatorship: \\"shaped like a pyramid, with the powerful of both sexes at the apex, the men generally outranking the women at the same level; then descending levels of power and status with men and women in each, all the way down to the bottom, where the unmarried men must serve in the ranks before being awarded an Econowife\\".[16] Additionally, Atwood has argued that while some of the observations that informed the content of The Handmaid's Tale may be feminist, her novel is not meant to say \\"one thing to one person\\" or serve as a political messageinstead, The Handmaid's Tale is \\"a study of power, and how it operates and how it deforms or shapes the people who are living within that kind of regime\\".[31][37] Some scholars have offered such a feminist interpretation, however, connecting Atwood's use of religious fundamentalism in the pages of The Handmaid's Tale to a condemnation of their presence in current American society.[43][44] Yet others have argued that The Handmaid's Tale critiques typical notions of feminism, as Atwood's novel appears to subvert the traditional \\"women helping women\\" ideals of the movement and turn toward the possibility of \\"the matriarchal network ... and a new form of misogyny: women's hatred of women\\".[45]\\r\\nAtwood's novels, and especially her works of speculative fiction The Handmaid's Tale and Oryx and Crake, are frequently offered as examples for the final, open-ended question on the North American Advanced Placement English Literature and Composition exam each year.[46] As such, her books are often assigned in high-school classrooms to students taking this Advanced Placement course, despite the mature themes the work presents. Atwood herself has expressed surprise that her books are being assigned to high-school audiences, largely due to her own censored education in the 1950s, but she has assured readers that this increased attention from high-school students has not altered the material she has chosen to write about since.[47]\\r\\nMany people have expressed discontent at The Handmaid's Tale's presence in the classroom, as it has been frequently challenged or banned over the last 30 years. Some of these challenges have come from parents concerned about the explicit sexuality and other adult themes represented in the book. Others have argued that The Handmaid's Tale depicts a negative view of religion, a view supported by several academics who propose that Atwood's work satirizes contemporary religious fundamentalists in the United States, offering a feminist critique of the trends this movement to the Right represents.[43][44]\\r\\nThe American Library Association (ALA) lists The Handmaid's Tale as number 37 on the \\"100 Most Frequently Challenged Books of 1990ÿ2000\\".[48] Atwood participated in discussing The Handmaid's Tale as the subject of an ALA discussion series titled \\"One Book, One Conference\\".[49]\\r\\nSome complaints have included:\\r\\nAccording to Education Reporter Kristin Rushowy of the Toronto Star (16 January 2009), in 2008 a parent in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, wrote a letter to his son's high school principal, asking that the book no longer be assigned as required reading, stating that the novel is \\"rife with brutality towards and mistreatment of women (and men at times), sexual scenes, and bleak depression\\".[51] Rushowy quotes the response of Russell Morton Brown, a retired University of Toronto English professor, who acknowledged that\\r\\n\\"The Handmaid's Tale wasn't likely written for 17-year-olds, but neither are a lot of things we teach in high school, like Shakespeare... And they are all the better for reading it. They are on the edge of adulthood already, and there's no point in coddling them,\\" he said, adding, \\"they aren't coddled in terms of mass media today anyway\\"... He said the book has been accused of being anti-Christian and, more recently, anti-Islamic because the women are veiled and polygamy is allowed... But that \\"misses the point\\", said Brown. \\"It's really anti-fundamentalism.\\"[51]\\r\\nIn her earlier account (14 January 2009), Rushowy reported that a Toronto District School Board committee was \\"reviewing the novel\\". While noting that \\"The Handmaid's Tale is listed as one of the 100 'most frequently challenged books' from 1990 to 1999 on the American Library Association's website\\", Rushowy reports that \\"The Canadian Library Association says there is 'no known instance of a challenge to this novel in Canada' but says the book was called anti-Christian and pornographic by parents after being placed on a reading list for secondary students in Texas in the 1990s.\\"[52]\\r\\nIn November 2012 two parents in Guilford County, North Carolina protested against inclusion of the book on a required reading list at a local high school. The parents presented the school board with a petition signed by 2,300 people, prompting a review of the book by the school's media advisory committee. According to local news reports, one of the parents said \\"she felt Christian students are bullied in society, in that they're made to feel uncomfortable about their beliefs by non-believers. She said including books like The Handmaid's Tale contributes to that discomfort, because of its negative view on religion and its anti-biblical attitudes toward sex.\\"[53]\\r\\nIn institutions of higher education, professors have found The Handmaid's Tale to be useful, largely because of its historical and religious basis and Atwood's captivating delivery. The novel's teaching points include: introducing politics and the social sciences to students in a more concrete way;[54][55] demonstrating the importance of reading to our freedom, both intellectual and political;[56] and acknowledging the \\"most insidious and violent manifestations of power in Western history\\" in a compelling manner.[57] The chapter entitled \\"Historical Notes\\" at the end of the novel also represents a warning to academics who run the risk of misreading and misunderstanding historical texts, pointing to the satirized Professor Pieixoto as an example of a male scholar who has taken over and overpowered Offred's narrative with his own interpretation.[58]","input":"What is the setting of handmaid's tale?"},{"output":"15:45 EST (20:45 UTC) on February 6, 2018","context":"Elon Musk's Tesla Roadster is an electric sports car that was the dummy payload for the Falcon Heavy test flight in February 2018. Starman, a mannequin dressed in a spacesuit, occupies the driver's seat. The 2008 Tesla Roadster car and Falcon Heavy rocket are products of Elon Musk's companies, Tesla and SpaceX. This electric car was previously used by Musk for commuting, and it is the only consumer car sent into space.\\r\\nThe rocket's second stage, with the car attached, imparted sufficient velocity to escape Earth's gravity and enter an elliptical heliocentric orbit that crosses the orbit of Mars. The orbit reaches a maximum distance from the Sun at aphelion of 1.66 astronomical units (au).[3][4] During the early portion of its voyage, the combination sent live video back to Earth for slightly over four hours.[5]\\r\\nAdvertising analysts lauded Musk's sense of brand management and effective use of new media for his decision to launch a Tesla Roadster into space. Some commenters were concerned that the car contributes to space debris, and others perceived it as a work of art.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn March 2017, Musk stated that the launch of the new Falcon Heavy vehicle was risky, so it would carry the \\"silliest thing we can imagine\\".[6] On December 1, 2017 he said that the payload would be his personal Roadster,[7][8] subsequently verifying that he was not joking.[9] On December 22, Musk published pictures of the car taken before payload encapsulation.\\r\\nTraditionally, concrete or steel blocks are used as ballast in risky test flights. SpaceX wanted to demonstrate that their new rocket could carry a payload as far as the orbit of Mars. They reportedly had offered NASA to carry a scientific payload, but these plans did not come to fruition.[10]\\r\\nThis Roadster became the first consumer car sent into space.[11] Three manned rovers were sent to space on the Apollo 15, 16, and 17 missions in the 1970s and these vehicles were left on the Moon.[12]\\r\\nThe first-generation Tesla Roadster is an all-electric sports car. The red Roadster launched into space is one of Elon Musk's privately owned vehicles.[13][14] Musk said in a 2012 interview that the Roadster was \\"the one I drive to work\\".[15] The car was installed in the Falcon Heavy rocket at an inclined position above the payload adapter in order to account for the mass distribution.[16]\\r\\nA number of whimsical objects were included in the Roadster. Positioned in the driver's seat is \\"Starman\\", a full-scale human mannequin named after the David Bowie song \\"Starman\\"[17] and clad in SpaceX's pressure spacesuit.[18] The mannequin has its right hand on the steering wheel and left elbow resting on the open window sill. The car's sound system was looping the Bowie song \\"Space Oddity\\"[19][20] as a symbolic gesture[21] even though the car's speakers cannot emit sound in space.[22]\\r\\nThere is a copy of Douglas Adams' 1979 novel The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy in the glovebox, along with references to the book in the form of a towel and a sign on the dashboard that reads \\"Don't Panic!\\".[23][24][25] A Hot Wheels miniature Roadster with a miniature Starman is mounted on the dashboard. A plaque bearing the names of the employees who worked on the project is underneath the car, and a message on the vehicle's circuit board reads \\"Made on Earth by humans\\".[26] A copy of Isaac Asimov's Foundation trilogy on a 5D optical data storage disc was included?ÿ the disk holds 360 terabytes but the books only comprised 3 megabytes. It was created by the Arch Mission Foundation and added at the last minute after Musk was informed that the disk, previously created as a proof of concept and never intended to be launched into space, was available?ÿ Musk was a fan of the trilogy.[27][28][29]\\r\\nThe Roadster is attached to a Merlin 1D Vacuum second stage with extended nozzle by a payload attachment fitting.[30]\\r\\nA license for the launch was issued by the US Office of Commercial Space Transportation on February 2, 2018.[31] The rocket lifted off from Launch Complex 39A at Kennedy Space Center[31] at 15:45 EST (20:45 UTC) on February 6, 2018,[32] and was initially placed in Earth parking orbit while remaining attached to the Falcon Heavy second stage.[4] After a longer-than-usual six-hour coast phase through the Van Allen radiation belts, thereby demonstrating a new capability requested by the U.S. Air Force for direct geostationary orbit (GEO) insertion of heavy intelligence satellites, the second stage reignited for the Earth-escape trajectory.[33][34][35]\\r\\nLike all its previous launches, SpaceX live streamed a video feed. It started at the rocket's launch, and once in space showed the Roadster at different angles from cameras mounted inside and outside the car.\\r\\nSpaceX did not say how long the feed was to run, and Musk had said the car's battery would last for about twelve hours, but the live stream actually ran for just over four hours, thus ending before the final boost out of Earth orbit.[5][36][37][38] The images were released by SpaceX into the public domain on its Flickr account.[39][40]\\r\\nFollowing the launch, the car and rocket booster were given the Satellite Catalog Number 43205, named \\"TESLA ROADSTER/FALCON 9H\\", along with the COSPAR designation 2018-017A.[41] The JPL Horizons system publishes solutions for the trajectory as target body \\"-143205\\".[1] The Roadster remains attached to the Falcon second stage.[42]\\r\\nThe car was launched into an heliocentric orbit that will cross the orbit of Mars and reach a distance of 1.66 au from the Sun.[4] With an inclination of roughly 1 degree to the ecliptic plane, compared to Mars' 1.85 inclination, the trajectory by design cannot intercept Mars, so the car will not fly by Mars nor enter an orbit around Mars.[43] This was the second object launched by SpaceX to leave Earth orbit (after the DSCOVR mission to SunÿEarth L1).\\r\\nEven if the launch had targeted an actual Mars transfer orbit, the Falcon Heavy upper stage, which is still attached to the car, lacks the propellant, maneuvering, and communications capabilities required to enter Mars orbit. Launching the Roadster into this orbit has demonstrated that Falcon Heavy can launch payloads that could reach Mars.[43] The car and second stage combination is moving away from Earth at a speed of 12,908?km/h (8,021?mph).[44] The maximum speed of the car relative to the Sun will be close to 121,600?km/h (75,600?mph) at perihelion.\\r\\nThe car in space quickly became a topic for Internet memes.[45][46] Western Australia Police distributed a picture of a Radar gun aimed at the Roadster whilst above Australia.[47][48] ?koda produced a parody video of a ?koda Superb being driven to Mars (a village in central France).[49][50] An attempt was made by Donut Media to launch a Hot Wheels-sized Tesla Model X to the stratosphere using a weather balloon.[51][52]\\r\\nSome news reports observed a similarity between the real pictures of a car orbiting the Earth and the title sequence of the 1981 animation film Heavy Metal, where a space traveler lands on Earth in a two-seater Chevrolet Corvette convertible.[53][54]\\r\\nThe SpaceX launch live stream reached over 2.3 million concurrent viewers on YouTube, which makes it the second most watched live event on the platform as of 2018, being surpassed only by the Red Bull Stratos jump in 2012.[55]\\r\\nThe choice of this car as a dummy payload was variously interpreted as a shrewd marketing move for Tesla, a work of art, or a contribution to space debris.\\r\\nMusk was lauded as a visionary marketer and brand manager by controlling both the timing and the content of his corporate public relations.[56][57][58][59] After the launch, Scientific American said using a car was not entirely pointless, in the sense that something of that size and weight was necessary for a meaningful test. \\"Thematically, it was a perfect fit\\" to use the Tesla car, and there was no reason not to take the opportunity to remind the auto industry that Musk was challenging the status quo in that arena, as well as in space.[56] Advertising Age agreed with Business Insider that the Roadster space launch was the \\"greatest ever car commercial without a dime spent on advertising\\", demonstrating that Musk is \\"miles ahead of the rest\\" in reaching young consumers, where \\"mere mortals scrabble about spending millions to fight each other over seconds of air time\\", Musk \\"just executes his vision.\\"[57][58] Alex Hern, technology reporter for The Guardian, said the choice to launch a car was a \\"hybrid of genuine breakthrough and nerd-baiting publicity stunt\\" without \\"any real point beyond generating good press pics\\", which should not detract from the much more important technological milestone represented by the launch of the rocket itself.[60]\\r\\nLori Garver, a former NASA deputy director initially said the choice of payload for the Falcon Heavy maiden flight is a gimmick and a loss of opportunity to further advance sciencebut later clarified that \\"I was told by a SpaceX VP (vice president) at the launch that they offered free launches to NASA, Air Force etc. but got no takers.\\"[61]\\r\\nAlice Gorman, a lecturer in archaeology and space studies at Flinders University, Australia, said that its primary purpose is symbolic communication, that \\"the red sports car symbolises masculinity ÿ power, wealth and speed[62] ÿ but also how fragile masculinity is\\". Drawing on anthropological theories of symbols, she argues that \\"The car is also an armour against dying, a talisman that quells a profound fear of mortality.\\"[63] Gorman wrote that \\"the spacesuit is also about death. [] The Starman was never alive, but now he's haunting space.\\"[63]\\r\\nThe Verge likened the Roadster to a \\"Readymade\\" work of art, such as Marcel Duchamp's 1917 piece Fountain, created by placing an everyday object in an unusual position, context and orientation.[64]\\r\\nOrbital-debris expert Darren McKnight said that since the car is out of Earth orbit, he sees no risk here, and added: \\"The enthusiasm and interest that [Musk] generates more than offsets the infinitesimally small 'littering' of the cosmos.\\"[65] Tommy Sanford, director of the Commercial Spaceflight Federation, opined that the car and its rocket stage are no more \\"space junk\\" than the mundane material usually launched on other test flights. Mass simulators are often deliberately placed in a graveyard orbit or sent on a deep space trajectory, where they are not a hazard.[66] Hugh Lewis, an expert in space debris at the University of Southampton, tweeted \\"Intentionally launching a car to a long-lived orbit is not what you want to hear from a company planning to fly 1000s satellites in LEO.\\"[67]\\r\\nThe Planetary Society was concerned that launching a non-sterile object to interplanetary space may risk biological contamination of a planetary object.[68] Scientists at Purdue University thought it was the \\"dirtiest\\" man-made object ever sent into space, in terms of bacteria amount, noting the car had previously driven on Los Angeles freeways. Although the vehicle will be sterilized by solar radiation over time, they are concerned some bacteria might live on in pieces of plastic which could contaminate Mars in the distant future.[69][70]\\r\\nThe car and second stage were passivated by intentionally removing remaining chemical and electrical energy, at which point the car and rocket booster ceased transmitting telemetry. Based on optical observations made using a robotic telescope at the Warrumbungle Observatory, Dubbo, Australia and refinement of the orbit, a close re-encounter with Earth (originally predicted for 2073) is not possible.[71] In 2020, the car will pass about 6.9 million kilometers (4.3 million miles) from Mars, well outside Mars' gravitational sphere of influence.[72]\\r\\nThe Virtual Telescope Project observed the Tesla two days after its launch, where it had a magnitude of 15.5,[73] comparable to Pluto's moon Charon. The Roadster was automatically spotted and logged by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) telescope operated by the University of Hawaii.[74] The car was observed by the Deimos Sky Survey (DeSS) at a distance of 720,000 kilometres (450,000?mi) with a flashing effect suggesting spinning.[75]\\r\\nThrough measuring changes in apparent brightness of the object, astronomers have determined that the Roadster is rotating with a period of 4.7589 +/- 0.0060 minutes.[76] By February 11, 2018, astrometry measurements from 241 independent observations had been collated, refining the positions to within one-tenth of an arcsecond[77]more accurate than for most observations of objects in space.[77]\\r\\nSimulations over a 3-million-year timespan found a probability of the Roadster colliding with Earth at approximately 6%, or with Venus at approximately 2.5%.[78] These probabilities of collision are similar to those of other near-Earth objects.[78] The half-life for the tested orbits was calculated as approximately 20 million years, but with trajectories varying significantly following a close approach to the EarthÿMoon system in 2091.[78]\\r\\nMusk had originally speculated that the car could drift in space for a billion years.[14] According to chemist William Carroll, solar radiation, cosmic radiation, and micrometeoroid impacts will structurally damage the car over time.[79] Radiation will eventually break down any material with carbonÿcarbon bonds, including carbon fiber parts. Tires, paint, plastic and leather might last only about a year, while carbon fiber parts will last considerably longer. Eventually, only the aluminum frame, inert metals, and glass not shattered by meteoroids will remain.[79]","input":"When was the tesla roadster launched into space?"},{"output":"Guitar Hero Encore: Rocks the 80s","context":"","input":"What was the last guitar hero game developed by harmonix?"},{"output":"Aconcagua","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nAconcagua (Spanish pronunciation:?[ako??ka?wa]), with a summit elevation of 6,960.8 metres (22,837?ft), is the highest mountain in both the Southern and Western Hemispheres.[1] It is located in the Andes mountain range, in the Mendoza Province, Argentina, and lies 112 kilometres (70?mi) northwest of its capital, the city of Mendoza, about five kilometres from San Juan Province and 15 kilometres from the international border with Chile. The mountain itself lies entirely within Argentina, immediately east of Argentina's border with Chile.[3] Its nearest higher neighbor is Tirich Mir in the Hindu Kush, 16,520 kilometres (10,270?mi) away. It is one of the Seven Summits.\\r\\n\\r\\nAconcagua is bounded by the Valle de las Vacas to the north and east and the Valle de los Horcones Inferior to the west and south. The mountain and its surroundings are part of the Aconcagua Provincial Park. The mountain has a number of glaciers. The largest glacier is the Ventisquero Horcones Inferior at about 10?kilometres long, which descends from the south face to about 3600?metres in altitude near the Confluencia camp.[4] \\r\\nTwo other large glacier systems are the Ventisquero de las Vacas Sur and Glaciar Este/Ventisquero Relinchos system at about 5?kilometres long.  The most well-known is the north-eastern or Polish Glacier, as it is a common route of ascent.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe origin of the name is contested; it is either from the Mapudungun Aconca-Hue, which refers to the Aconcagua River and means \\"comes from the other side\\",[3] the Quechua Ackon Cahuak, meaning \\"'Sentinel of Stone\\",[5] the Quechua Anco Cahuac, meaning \\"White Sentinel\\",[2] or the Aymara Janq'u Q'awa, meaning \\"White Ravine\\".[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe mountain was created by the subduction of the Nazca Plate beneath the South American Plate. Aconcagua used to be an active stratovolcano (from the Late Cretaceous or Early Paleocene through the Miocene) and consisted of several volcanic complexes on the edge of a basin with a shallow sea. However, sometime in the Miocene, about 8 to 10 million years ago, the subduction angle started to decrease resulting in a stop of the melting and more horizontal stresses between the oceanic plate and the continent, causing the thrust faults that lifted Aconcagua up off its volcanic root. The rocks found on Aconcaguas flanks are all volcanic and consist of lavas, breccias and pyroclastics. The shallow marine basin had already formed earlier (Triassic), even before Aconcagua arose as a volcano. However, volcanism has been present in this region for as long as this basin was around and volcanic deposits interfinger with marine deposits throughout the sequence. The colorful greenish, blueish and grey deposits that can be seen in the Horcones Valley and south of Puente Del Inca, are carbonates, limestones, turbidites and evaporates that filled this basin. The red colored rocks are intrusions, cinder deposits and conglomerates of volcanic origin.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn mountaineering terms, Aconcagua is technically an easy mountain if approached from the north, via the normal route. Aconcagua is arguably the highest non-technical mountain in the world, since the northern route does not absolutely require ropes, axes, and pins.  Although the effects of altitude are severe (atmospheric pressure is 40% of sea-level at the summit), the use of supplemental oxygen is not common. Altitude sickness will affect most climbers to some extent, depending on the degree of acclimatization.[8] Even if the normal climb is technically easy, multiple casualties occur every year on this mountain (in January 2009 alone five climbers died).[citation needed] This is due to the large numbers of climbers who make the attempt and because many climbers underestimate the objective risks of the elevation and of cold weather, which is the real challenge on this mountain. Given the weather conditions close to the summit, cold weather injuries are very common.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Polish Glacier Traverse route, also known as the \\"Falso de los Polacos\\" route, crosses through the Vacas valley, ascends to the base of the Polish Glacier, then traverses across to the normal route for the final ascent to the summit. The third most popular route is by the Polish Glacier itself.\\r\\n\\r\\nProvincial Park rangers do not maintain records of successful summits but estimates suggest a summit rate of 30-40%[citation needed]. About 75% of climbers are foreigners and 25% are Argentinean. Among foreigners, the United States leads in number of climbers, followed by Germany and the UK. About 54% of climbers ascend the Normal Route, 43% up the Polish Glacier Route, and the remaining 3% on other routes.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe routes to the peak from the south and south-west ridges are more demanding and the south face climb is considered quite difficult.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe camp sites on the normal route are listed below (altitudes are approximate).\\r\\n\\r\\nSummit attempts are usually made from a high camp at either Berln or Colera, or from the lower camp at Nido de C܇ndores.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first attempt to reach the summit of Aconcagua by a European was made in 1883 by a party led by the German geologist and explorer Paul Gssfeldt. Bribing porters with the story of treasure on the mountain, he approached the mountain via the Rio Volcan, making two attempts on the peak by the north-west ridge and reaching an altitude of 6,500 metres (21,300?ft). The route that he prospected is now the normal route up the mountain.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first recorded[2] ascent was in 1897 by a European expedition led by the British mountaineer Edward FitzGerald. FitzGerald failed to reach the summit himself over eight attempts between December 1896 and February 1897, but the (Swiss) guide of the expedition, Matthias Zurbriggen reached the summit on January 14. On the final attempt a month later, two other expedition members, Stuart Vines and Nicola Lanti, reached the summit on February 13.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe east side of Aconcagua was first scaled by a Polish expedition, with Konstanty Narkiewicz-Jodko, Stefan Daszyski, Wiktor Ostrowski and Stefan Osiecki summiting on March 9, 1934, over what is now known as the Polish Glacier. A route over the Southwest Ridge was pioneered over seven days in January 1953 by the Swiss-Argentine team of Frederico and Dorly Marmillod, Francisco Ibanez and Fernando Grajales. The famously difficult South Face was conquered by a French team led by Ren Ferlet?(fr). Pierre Lesueur, Adrien Dagory, Robert Paragot, Edmond Denis, Lucien Berardini and Guy Poulet reached the summit after a month of effort on 25 February 1954.[13][14]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe youngest person to reach the summit of Aconcagua was Tyler Armstrong of California.  He was nine years old when he reached the summit on December 24, 2013.[15] The oldest person to climb it was Scott Lewis, who reached the summit on November 26, 2007, when he was 87 years old.[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the base camp Plaza de Mulas (at 4300 meters above sea level) there is the highest contemporary art gallery tent called \\"Nautilus\\" of the Argentine painter Miguel Doura.[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2014 Kilian Jornet set a record for climbing and descending Aconcagua from Horcones in 12 hours and 49 minutes.[18] The record was broken less than two months later by Ecuadorian-Swiss Karl Egloff, in a time of 11 hours 52 minutes, nearly an hour faster than Kilian Jornet.[19]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe mountain has a cameo in a 1942 Disney cartoon called Pedro.[20] The cartoon stars an anthropomorphic small airplane named Pedro who makes an air mail run over the Andes and has a near-disastrous encounter with Aconcagua, which is depicted in the film as an anthropomorphic menace.\\r\\nAconcagua is the highest peak in the Americas and is also considered an easy high altitude peak, being nearly seven thousand metres.[21] And through that, Aconcagua is believed to have the highest death rate of any mountain in South America ÿ around three a year ÿ which has earned it the nickname Mountain of Death. More than a hundred people have died on Aconcagua since records began.[22]\\r\\n\\r\\nDue to the improper disposal of human waste in the mountain environment there are significant health hazards[21] that pose a threat to both animals and human beings.[23] Only boiled or chemically treated water is accepted for drinking. Additionally, Ecofriendly toilets are available only to members of an organised expedition, meaning climbers have to be contracted to a toilet service at the base camp and similar camps along the route. Currently, from two base camps (Plaza de Mulas and Plaza Argentina), over 120 barrels of waste (approx. 22,500?kg) are flown out by helicopter each season.[24] In addition, individual mountaineers must make a payment before using these toilets. Some large organisers will give a price up to US$100, some smaller US$5/day or US$10 for the entire stay. Thus, many independent mountaineers defecate on the mountainside.[21]","input":"What is the biggest mountain in south america?"},{"output":"popularly used for the language that was spoken and written by the Anglo-Saxons in England and eastern Scotland between at least the mid-5th century and the mid-12th century","context":"","input":"How did the anglo saxons get their name?"},{"output":"the second-biggest in the world","context":"Tourism in Spain is the 3rd major contributor to the national economic life just after the industry and the business/banking sector, contributing about 10-11% of Spain's GDP.[1] Ever since the 1960s and 1970s, the country has been a popular destination for summer holidays, especially with large numbers of tourists from the UK, France, Germany, Italy, the Benelux and the United States, among others. Accordingly, Spain's foreign tourist industry has grown into the second-biggest in the world.[2]\\r\\nIn 2016 Spain was the third most visited country in the world, recording 75.3 million tourists which marked the fourth consecutive year of record-beating numbers.[3]\\r\\nSpain ranks first among 136 countries in the biannual Travel and Tourism Competitiveness Index published by the World Economic Forum in 2017,[4] matching the top position already achieved in 2015.[5]\\r\\nThe World Tourism Organization has its headquarters in Madrid.\\r\\nAccording to The Economist 2005 year list, Spain has the world's 10th highest quality of life.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMost visitors arriving to Spain on short term basis were from the following countries:[7]\\r\\nSpain's national airline is Iberia, but the country can be flown into on many international passenger airlines and charter airlines.\\r\\nTourists also arrive in Spain by road, rail and over the water. Spanish freeways interconnecting the touristic cities are also linked up with the French freeway network across the Pyrenees. The main train operator is RENFE, including AVE (Spanish high speed train) or Talgo intercity services. Spain's high-speed rail link is the largest in Europe[8] and second largest in the world after China. There is also a number of high-end tourism oriented hotel-train services, such as Transcantbrico.\\r\\nThis type of tourism was the first to be developed in Spain, and today, generates the most income for the Spanish economy. The mild climate during the whole year and the extensive sandy beaches of the Mediterranean and Atlantic Ocean as well as of its two archipelagoes (the Balearic Islands and the Canary Islands respectively) have been attracting tourists from Northern Europe for decades. The leading source markets of Spanish beach tourism are the UK (around 24% of the total arrivals in Spain in recent years), Germany and France (around 15-16% each), followed by Scandinavia and Italy (around 7% each) and the Netherlands (around 5%).[11][12]\\r\\nThe most popular Spanish mainland coasts are on its Mediterranean side, and include, from north to south clockwise:\\r\\nSpain's two archipelagoes, the Balearic Islands off the mainland coast in the Mediterranean and the volcanic Canary Islands in the Atlantic, are also both very popular destinations with Spaniards and Europeans.\\r\\nIn addition to the summer tourism, other modalities like cultural and monumental tourism congresses, sport or fun tourism have been developed in these areas, including such famous cities as Barcelona and Valencia, the biggest harbours of the Spanish Mediterranean coast.\\r\\nMany coastal or island places also have great ecological and natural importance. Theme Parks like PortAventura, Terra Mtica or diverse water-fun parks are also popular.\\r\\nIn 2014 Spain broke its own record of blue flag beaches, achieving 681 flags and becoming the leader in the Northern hemisphere.[13] Spain is also the leader in blue flags for marinas.[13]\\r\\nAs a crossroads of several civilizations, Spain offers a number of historical cities and towns. Major destinations include Spain's two largest cities: Madrid and Barcelona, which stand as two of the leading city destinations in Europe. Both offer a matchless number of attractions and their importance in commerce, education, entertainment, media, fashion, science, sports and arts contribute to their status as two of the world's major global cities. Thirteen Spanish cities have been declared World Heritage Cities by the UNESCO:[14] Alcal de Henares, vila, Cceres, C܇rdoba, Cuenca, Ibiza, Mrida, Salamanca, San Crist܇bal de La Laguna, Santiago de Compostela, Segovia, Tarragona and Toledo. As of October 2016, Spain has 45 total sites inscribed on the list, third only to Italy (51) and China (50).[15] Of these 45 sites, 40 are cultural, 3 are natural, and 2 are mixed (meeting both cultural and natural criteria), as determined by the organization's selection criteria.[16] Other first-class destinations are Seville, Granada, Santander, Oviedo, Gij܇n, Bilbao and San Sebastin. All of them with historical landmarks and a lively cultural agenda.\\r\\nBesides hosting some of the most renowned business schools in the world such as IE Business School, ESADE or IESE Business School, Spain is a popular destination for students from abroad. In particular, during the 2010-11 academic year Spain was the European country receiving the most Erasmus programme students.[17]\\r\\nSpain is an important place for Catholicism. In fact, some of the holiest places for the Catholic Church are in Spain: city of Santiago de Compostela in Galicia (North-West Spain), the third holiest place after the Vatican City in Rome and Jerusalem. It is also the terminus of the Way of Saint James. Santo Toribio de Libana, Cantabria (also in North Spain) is the fourth, followed by Caravaca de la Cruz at the South-East, Region of Murcia (fifth holiest place). These places attract pilgrims and tourists from all over the world. Religion also has found its artistic expression through the popular Holy Week processions, which become important in almost every town.\\r\\nMost festivals turn around patron saints, legends, local customs and folklore. Among the most singular ones stand out the Seville Fair (Feria de Abril in Spanish), the Romera de El Roco in Almonte, Huelva, the world-famous Running of the Bulls in Pamplona, the Fallas in Valencia, the Tomatina in Bu?ol, Valencia and the Fiestas del Pilar in Zaragoza.\\r\\nThe Carnival is also popular all over Spain, but especially in the Canary Islands (Carnival of Santa Cruz de Tenerife) and Cadiz. There are renowned movie festivals all over the country, the most recognizable being the famous San Sebastin International Film Festival, the Mlaga Spanish Film Festival, the Seminci (Valladolid International Film Festival), the Mostra de Valencia and the Sitges Film Festival, the world's foremost international festival specializing in fantasy and horror movies. Music festivals includes the S܇nar, the FIB, the Festimad, the Primavera Sound, the Bilbao BBK Live, the Monegros Desert Festival and the SOS 4.8 Festival.\\r\\nSeveral cities have hosted international events: the 1888 Barcelona Universal Exposition, the 1929 Barcelona International Exposition, the 1992 Summer Olympics, all in Barcelona, the Universal fair of 1992 in Seville, the 2007 America's Cup in Valencia, and the Expo 2008 in Zaragoza. In addition, some Spanish cities have been or will be European Capital of Culture: Madrid in 1992; Santiago de Compostela in 2000, Salamanca in 2002, and San Sebastin in 2016.\\r\\nThere are many villas in Spain in the different regions that provide comfortable living standards and other rental services to the tourists. Many people who need a villa may find it very easily. The regions like Costa Brava, Ibiza etc.[18]\\r\\nThe nightlife in Spain is very attractive to both tourists and locals. Spain is known to have some of the best nightlife in the world. Big cities such as Madrid and Barcelona are favorites amongst the large and popular discothques. For instance, Madrid is known as the number one party city for clubs such as Pacha and Kapital (seven floors), and Barcelona is famous for Opium and Sutton famous clubs. The discothques in Spain are open until odd hours such as 7am. The Baleraric Islands, such as Ibiza and Mallorca, are known to be major party destinations, as well as favored summer resort and in Andalusia, Malaga, specially the area of the Costa del Sol.\\r\\nIbiza is a relatively small island and its cities have become world-famous for their associations with tourism, nightlife, and the electronic music the island has originated. It is well known for its summer club scene which attracts very large numbers of tourists, but the island's government and the Spanish Tourist Office have controversially been working to promote more family-oriented tourism. Noted clubs include Space, Privilege, Amnesia, Ushua?a, Pacha, DC10, Eden, and Es Paradis. Ibiza is also home to the legendary \\"port\\" in Ibiza Town, a popular stop for many tourists and now a UNESCO World Heritage Site.[19]\\r\\nMajorca or Mallorca (Catalan: Mallorca [m?????k?, m?????c?]; Spanish: Mallorca [ma??orka])[20] is an island located in the Mediterranean Sea. It is the largest island in the Balearic Islands archipelago, in Spain.\\r\\nThe capital of the island, Palma, is also the capital of the autonomous community of the Balearic Islands. The Cabrera Archipelago is administratively grouped with Majorca (in the municipality of Palma). The anthem of Majorca is La Balanguera.\\r\\nLike the other Balearic Islands of Menorca, Ibiza, and Formentera, the island is an extremely popular holiday destination, particularly for tourists from Germany, Ireland, Poland, the Scandinavian countries, and the United Kingdom. The name derives from Latin insula maior, \\"larger island\\"; later Maiorica, \\"the larger one\\" in comparison to Menorca, \\"the smaller one\\".\\r\\nSpain is a generally mountainous country, with well-known ski resorts located in several parts of the country, including the Pyrenees, the Sistema Central, the Sistema Ibrico and Sierra Nevada. For the most part, the main crest forms a massive divider between France and Spain, with the tiny country of Andorra sandwiched in between. The Crown of Aragon and the Kingdom of Navarre have historically extended on both sides of the mountain range, with small northern portions now in France and much larger southern parts now in Spain.[21][22]\\r\\nSierra Nevada in Spain is a popular tourist destination, as its high peaks make skiing possible in one of Europe's most southerly ski resorts, in an area along the Mediterranean Sea predominantly known for its warm temperatures and abundant sunshine. At its foothills is found the city of Granada and, a little further, Almera and Mlaga.\\r\\nParts of the range have been included in the Sierra Nevada National Park. The range has also been declared a biosphere reserve. The Sierra Nevada Observatory is located on the northern slopes at an elevation of 2,800 metres (9,200?ft). The Sierra Nevada was formed during the Alpine Orogeny, a mountain-building event that also formed the European Alps to the east and the Atlas Mountains of northern Africa across the Mediterranean Sea to the south. The Sierra as observed today formed during the Paleogene and Neogene Periods (66 to 1.8 million years ago) from the collision of the African and Eurasian continental plates.\\r\\nSpain is the second largest country in the European Union. Its latitude puts part of the country in direct contact with the typical southern end of the Atlantic polar jet. Hence, Spain's geographical position allows for Atlantic fronts typically affecting its western and northern part whereas a Mediterranean influenced climate is generally prevalent in its eastern and southern parts, with transition climates linking both main bioclimatic regions. Additionally the presence of several mountain ranges ultimately shape the diverse landscape of Spain. Another remarkable feature of the country is its vast coast, as a result of being in a Peninsula; moreover, there is the coast of the two Spanish archipelagos: the Balearic Islands and the Canary Islands.\\r\\nTo date, Spain has a total of 15 National Parks, of which 10 are on the mainland, 1 in the Balearic Islands and 4 in the Canary Islands. Spain's most visited National Park is the Teide National Park in the Canary Islands, with 3,142,148 visitors in 2007 and crowned with the third largest Volcano in the world from its base, the Teide, with 3,718 meters above the sea level (also the highest point in Spain). The Teide also has the distinction of being the most visited national park in Europe and second in the world.[23]\\r\\nOn top of that, by 2016 Spain is home to 48 biosphere reserves, covering 5.5 million hectares, almost 11% of the country, making Spain the world leader of such protected areas[24]\\r\\nMadrid is considered one of the top European destinations concerning art museums.[citation needed] Best known is the Golden Triangle of Art, located along the Paseo del Prado and comprising three museums. The most famous one is the Prado Museum, known for such highlights as Diego Velzquez's Las Meninas and Francisco de Goya's La maja vestida and La maja desnuda. The other two museums are the Thyssen Bornemisza Museum, established from a mixed private collection, and the Reina Sofia Museum, where Pablo Picasso's Guernica hangs, returning to Spain from New York after more than two decades.\\r\\nThe Museo del Prado is a museum and art gallery that features one of the world's finest collections of European art, from the 12th century to the early 19th century, based on the former Spanish Royal Collection. The collection currently comprises around 7,600 paintings, 1,000 sculptures, 4,800 prints and 8,200 drawings, in addition to a large number of works of art and historic documents. El Prado is one of the most visited museums in the world, and it is considered to be among the greatest museums of art. It has the best collection of artworks by Goya, Velzquez, El Greco, Rubens, Titian, Hieronymus Bosch, Jos de Ribera and Patinir; and works by Rogier van der Weyden, Raphael Sanzio, Tintoretto, Veronese, Caravaggio, Van Dyck, Albrecht Drer, Claude Lorrain, Murillo and Zurbarn, among others.\\r\\nThe Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sofa (MNCARS) is the Spain's national museum of 20th-century art. The museum is mainly dedicated to Spanish art. Highlights of the museum include excellent collections of Spain's greatest 20th-century masters, Pablo Picasso, Salvador Dal, Joan Mir܇, Juan Gris and Julio Gonzlez. Certainly the most famous masterpiece in the museum is Picasso's painting Guernica. The Reina Sofa also hosts a free-access library specializing in art, with a collection of over 100,000 books, over 3,500 sound recordings and almost 1,000 videos.[25]\\r\\nThe Thyssen-Bornemisza Museum is an art museum that fills the historical gaps in its counterparts' collections: in the Prado's case this includes Italian primitives and works from the English, Dutch and German schools, while in the case of the Reina Sofia the Thyssen-Bornemisza collection, once the second largest private collection in the world after the British Royal Collection,[26] includes Impressionists, Expressionists, and European and American paintings from the second half of the 20th century, with over 1,600 paintings.[27]\\r\\nThe Royal Academy of Fine Arts of San Fernando currently functions as a museum and gallery that houses a fine art collection of paintings from the 15th to 20th centuries: Giovanni Bellini, Correggio, Rubens, Zurbarn, Murillo, Goya, Juan Gris, Pablo Serrano. The academy is also the headquarters of the Madrid Academy of Art. Francisco Goya was once one of the academy's directors, and, its alumni include Pablo Picasso, Salvador Dal, Antonio L܇pez Garca, Juan Luna, and Fernando Botero.[28][29]\\r\\nThe Royal Palace of Madrid is the official residence of Felipe VI of Spain, but he uses it only for official acts. It is a baroque palace full of artworks is one of the largest European Royal Palaces, which is characterized by its luxurious rooms and its rich collections of armors and weapons, pharmaceutical, silverware, watches, paintings, tapestries and the most comprehensive collection of Stradivarius in the world[30]\\r\\nThe National Archaeological Museum of Spain collection includes, among others, Pre-historic, Celtic, Iberian, Greek and Roman antiquities and medieval (Visigothic, Muslim and Christian) objects. Highlights include a replica of the Altamira cave (the first cave in which prehistoric cave paintings were discovered), Lady of Elche (an enigmatic polychrome stone bust), Lady of Baza (a famous example of Iberian sculpture), Biche of Balazote (an Iberian sculpture) and Treasure of Guarrazar (a treasure that represents the best surviving group of Early Medieval Christian votive offerings and the high point of Visigothic goldsmith's work).[31]\\r\\nThe Museum of the Americas (Spanish: Museo de Amrica) is a National museum that holds artistic, archaeological and ethnographic collections from the whole American continent, ranging from the Paleolithic period to the present day. The permanent exhibit is divided into five major thematical areas: an awareness of America, the reality of America, society, religion and communication.[32]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe National Museum of Natural Sciences is the National Museum of Natural History of Spain. The research departments of the museum are: Biodiversity and Evolutionary Biology, Evolutionary Ecology, Paleobiology, Vulcanology and Geology.[33]\\r\\nThe Naval Museum is managed by the Ministry of Defence. The Museum's mission is to acquire, preserve, investigate, report and display for study, education and contemplation, parts, sets and collections of historical, artistic, scientific and technical related to naval activity in order to disseminate the story sea of Spain; to help illustrate, highlight and preserve their traditions and promote national maritime awareness.\\r\\nThe Monastery of Las Descalzas Reales resides in the former palace of King Charles I of Spain and Isabel of Portugal. Their daughter, Joan of Austria, founded this convent of nuns of the Poor Clare order in 1559. Throughout the remainder of the 16th century and into the 17th century, the convent attracted young widowed or spinster noblewomen. Each woman brought with her a dowry. The riches quickly piled up, and the convent became one of the richest convents in all of Europe. It has many works of Renaissance and Baroque art, including a recumbent Christ by Gaspar Becerra, a staircase whose paintings were painted by unknown author (perhaps Velzquez) and they are considered of the masterpieces of Spanish illusionist painting, and Brussels tapestries inspired by paintings of Rubens.[34]\\r\\nThe Museum of Lzaro Galdiano houses an encyclopedic collection specializing in decorative arts.\\r\\nApart from paintings and sculptures it displays 10th-century Byzantine enamel; Arab and Byzantine ivory chests; Hellenistic, Roman, medieval, renaissance, baroque and romantic jewelry; Pisanello and Pompeo Leoni medals; Spanish and Italian ceramics; Italian and Arab clothes and a collection of weapons including the sword of Pope Innocent VIII.[35]\\r\\nThe Museo Nacional de Artes Decorativas (National Museum of Decorative Arts) is one of the oldest museums in the city. It illustrates the evolution of the called \\"minor arts\\" (furniture, ceramics and glass, textile, etc.). Its 60 rooms expones 15,000 objects, of the approximate 40,000 which it has.[36]\\r\\nThe Museo Nacional del Romanticismo (National Museum of Romanticism) contains a large collection of artefacts and art, focusing on daily life and customs of the 19th century, with special attention to the aesthetics about Romanticism.[37]\\r\\nThe Museo Cerralbo houses a private collection of ancient works of art, artifacts and other antiquities collected by Enrique de Aguilera y Gamboa, XVII Cerralbo Marquis.[38]\\r\\nThe Museo Nacional de Antropologa(National Museum of Anthropology) provides an overview of the different cultures in the world, with objects and human remains from around the world, highlighting a Guanche mummy of the island of Tenerife.[39]\\r\\nThe Museo Sorolla is located in the building in which the Valencian Impressionist painter had his home and workshop. The collection includes, in addition to numerous works of Joaqun Sorolla, a large number of objects that possessed the artist, including sculptures by Auguste Rodin.[40]\\r\\nCaixaForum Madrid is a post-modern art gallery in the centre of Madrid. It is sponsored by the Catalan-Balearic bank la Caixa and located next to the Sal܇n del Prado. Although the CaixaForum is a modern building, it also exhibits retrospectives of artists from earlier time periods and has evolved into one of the most visited museums in Madrid. It was constructed by the Swiss architects Herzog & de Meuron from 2001 to 2007, which combined an old unused industrial building and hollowed it out at the base and inside and placed on top further floors which are encased with rusted steel. Next to it is an art installation of green plants growing on the wall of the neighbouring house by French botanist Patrick Blanc. The red of the top floors with the green of the wall next to it form a contrast. The green is in reflection of the neighbouring Royal Botanical Gardens.\\r\\nOther art galleries and museums in Madrid include:\\r\\nThis is a list of museums in Barcelona (Catalonia) and in its surrounding metropolitan area.","input":"How important is spain as a tourism destination in the world?"},{"output":"Russian Synodal Bible","context":"The Russian Synodal Bible (Russian: ҷ^ֳ Ťѿ־, The Synodal Translation) is a Russian non-Church Slavonic translation of the Bible commonly used by the Russian Orthodox Church, Russian Baptists[1] and other Protestant as well as Roman Catholic communities in Russia.\\r\\nThe translation began in 1813, after the establishment of the Russian Bible Society and by permission of Czar Alexander I. The complete New Testament was published in 1820 and the Old Testament was already translated up to the book of Ruth when work on the project was halted in 1825(?). In that year the Russian Bible Society was disbanded and its translation work discontinued under a more conservative emperor Nicholas I (between 1825 and 1855) due to its suspected seditious influence on the Russian population. It was again resumed and completed in the next reign, of Alexander II.\\r\\nThe Most Holy Synod entrusted the completion of the translation to four Orthodox theological academies, in Moscow, Saint Petersburg, Kazan and Kiev. The complete Bible was published in 1876 and included the 1820s translation of the New Testament with very few changes, as well as the Old Testament, whose translation reflected the work done both before and after the period of reaction. The final editorship was performed by Filaret, Metropolitan of Moscow.\\r\\nThe translation of the Old Testament is based on the Jewish Masoretic Text, while that of the New Testament is based on the Greek printed editions of that time.[2] This decision was grounded on Filaret's 1834 note \\"On the need of the Russian Church for a translation of the whole Bible from the original texts to the modern Russian language\\" and reflected the growing acceptance in the Russian theological community of the contemporary Western standards of Biblical scholarship of the time.\\r\\nOfficial permission to use the Masoretic Text as preserved by the Jews (rather than relying on the Septuagint and/or the Church Slavonic translations as preserved by the Christians) was granted to Filaret by the Synod in 1862, even though technically the translation was already mostly completed by that time.\\r\\nIn the 1870s, when the complete Russian Bible was being finalized, the linguistic norms of the Russian language had already changed when compared to those of the early 19th century, when most of the translation work was completed. Nevertheless, the translations that were done earlier remained largely unchanged, due mostly to the considerably smaller scale of the entire translation project compared to what was done by the Russian Bible Society before it was closed in the 1820s.\\r\\nAlso, due to its strong vocabulary and stylistic reliance on the more-than-1000-year-old Church Slavonic translationa translation that in fact was done not into the Russian language of the time, but into a language spoken by the Southern Slavsthe Synodal version remains a linguistic phenomenon of its own kind that helped to shape some distinctive Slavonic-inspired features used both in the Russian spoken language and in Russian literature to this day.","input":"What bible translation does the orthodox church use?"},{"output":"a neighborhood in downtown San Francisco, California, in the flatlands on the southern slope of Nob Hill, situated between the Union Square shopping district to the northeast and the Civic Center office district to the southwest","context":"The Tenderloin is a neighborhood in downtown San Francisco, California, in the flatlands on the southern slope of Nob Hill, situated between the Union Square shopping district to the northeast and the Civic Center office district to the southwest. It encompasses about 50 square blocks, is a large wedge/triangle in shape (point faces East). It is historically bounded on the north by Geary Street, on the east by Mason Street, on the south by Market Street and on the west by Van Ness Avenue. The northern boundary with Lower Nob Hill historically has been set at Geary Street.\\r\\nThe terms \\"Tenderloin Heights\\" and \\"The Tendernob\\" refer to the area around the indefinite boundary between the Upper Tenderloin and Lower Nob Hill. The eastern extent, near Union Square, overlaps with the Theater District.\\r\\nPart of the western extent of the Tenderloin, Larkin and Hyde Streets between Turk and O'Farrell, was officially named \\"Little Saigon\\" by the City of San Francisco.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Tenderloin took its name from an older neighborhood in New York with similar characteristics. There are several explanations of how that neighborhood was named. Some said it was a reference to the neighborhood as the \\"soft underbelly\\" (analogous to the cut of meat) of the city, with allusions to vice and corruption, especially graft. Another popular explanation, probably folklore, attributes the name to a New York City police captain, Alexander S. Williams, who was overheard saying that when he was assigned to another part of the city, he could only afford to eat chuck steak on the salary he was earning, but after he was transferred to this neighborhood he was making so much money on the side soliciting bribes that now he could eat tenderloin instead.[5][6] Another version of that story says that the officers who worked in the Tenderloin received a \\"hazard pay\\" bonus for working in such a violent area, and thus were able to afford the good cut of meat. Yet another story, also likely apocryphal, is that the name is a reference to the \\"loins\\" of prostitutes.\\r\\nThe Tenderloin borders the Mission/Market Street corridor, which follows the Spaniards' El Camino Real, which in turn traced an ancient north/south Indian trail. The Tenderloin is sheltered by Nob Hill, and far enough from the bay to be on solid ground. There is evidence that a community resided here several thousand years ago. In the 1960s, the area was excavated to develop the BART/MUNI subway station at Civic Center. During the excavation, the remains of a woman dated to be 5,000 years old were found.\\r\\nThe Tenderloin has been a downtown residential community since shortly after the California Gold Rush in 1849. However, the name \\"Tenderloin\\" does not appear on any maps of San Francisco prior to the 1930s; before then, it was labeled as \\"Downtown\\", although it was informally referred to as \\"the Tenderloin\\" as early as the 1890s. The area had an active nightlife in the late 19th century with many theaters, restaurants and hotels. Notorious madam Tessie Wall opened her first brothel on O'Farrell Street in 1898. Almost all of the buildings in the neighborhood were destroyed by the 1906 earthquake and the backfires that were set by firefighters to contain the devastation. The area was immediately rebuilt with some hotels opening by 1907 and apartment buildings shortly thereafter, including the historic Cadillac Hotel.[7] By the 1920s, the neighborhood was notorious for its gambling, billiard halls, boxing gyms, \\"speakeasies\\", theaters, restaurants and other nightlife depicted in the hard boiled detective fiction of Dashiell Hammett, who lived at 891 Post Street, the apartment he gave to Sam Spade in The Maltese Falcon. Also around this time, due to Red Light Abatement Act, Prostitution and other vice began to be pushed out from the Barbary Coast district to the more southern and less business-occupied Tenderloin.[8]\\r\\nIn the mid-20th century the Tenderloin provided work for many musicians in the neighborhood's theaters, hotels, burlesque houses, bars and clubs and was the location of the Musician's Union Building on Jones Street. The most famous jazz club was the Black Hawk[9] at Hyde and Turk Streets where Dave Brubeck, Miles Davis,[10] Thelonious Monk,[11] Gerry Mulligan, and other jazz greats recorded live albums for Fantasy Records in the late 1950s and early 1960s.\\r\\nWith housing consisting almost entirely of single-room-occupancy hotel rooms, studio and one bedroom apartments, the Tenderloin historically housed single adults and couples.[12] After World War II, with the decline in central cities throughout the United States, the Tenderloin lost population, creating a large amount of vacant housing units by the mid-1970s. Beginning in the late 1970s, after the Vietnam War, the Tenderloin received large numbers of refugees from Southeast Asiafirst ethnic Chinese from Vietnam, then Khmer from Cambodia and Hmong from Laos. The low-cost vacant housing, and the proximity to Chinatown through the Stockton Street Tunnel, made the area appealing to refugees and resettlement agencies. Studio apartments became home for families of four and five people and became what a local police officer called \\"vertical villages.\\" The Tenderloin quickly increased from having just a few children to having over 3,500 and this population has remained. A number of neighborhood Southeast Asian restaurants, bnh m coffee shops, ethnic grocery stores, video shops, and other stores opened at this time, which still exist.\\r\\nThe Tenderloin has a long history as a center of alternate sexualities, including several historic confrontations with police. The legendary female impersonator Ray Bourbon, a performer during the Pansy Craze, was arrested in 1933 while his show \\"Boys Will Be Girls\\" was being broadcast live on the radio from Tait's Cafe at 44 Ellis Street.[13] In the evening of August 13, 1961, 103 gay and lesbian patrons were raided in the Tay-Bush Inn, a caf visited by gay and lesbian patrons.[14] As a response to police harassment, S.F. bar owners formed the San Francisco Tavern Guild.[15][page?needed] A study into prostitution in the Tenderloin found that while trans women face discrimination from certain professions and their sexual partners, sex workers in the Tenderloin area were adept at overcoming some such difficulties.[16]\\r\\nOn New Years Day in 1965 police raided a Mardi Gras Ball at California Hall[17] on Polk Street sponsored by the Council on Religion and the Homosexual, lining up and photographing 600 participants and arresting several prominent citizens. One of the first \\"gay riots\\", pre-dating the Stonewall riots in New York, happened at Compton's Cafeteria[18] at Turk and Taylor Streets in August 1966 when the police, attempting to arrest a drag queen, sparked a riot that spilled into the streets. The group ended up smashing the windows of the police car and burned a nearby newspaper stand to the ground; the riot promoted the formation of the Gay Activists Alliance.[19] Prior to the emergence of The Castro as a major gay village, the center of the Tenderloin at Turk and Taylor and the Polk Gulch at the western side of the Tenderloin were two of the city's first gay neighborhoods and a few of these historic gay bars and clubs still exist.\\r\\nThe apartment where Dashiell Hammett wrote The Maltese Falcon was once in the boundaries of the Tenderloin at the corner of Hyde and Post. Both the movie and book were based in San Francisco's Tenderloin. There is also an alley in what is now Nob Hill, named for the book's author (Dashiell Hammett). It lies outside the Tenderloin because the boundary was defined with borders different from today's. Some locations, such as Sam Spade's apartment and John's Grill, also no longer lie in the Tenderloin because local economics and real estate have changed the character and labeling of areas over time.\\r\\nIn July 2008, the area was designated as a historic district on the National Register of Historic Places.[20]\\r\\nNestled near the downtown area, the Tenderloin has historically resisted gentrification, maintaining a seedy character and reputation for crime.[21] Squalid conditions, homelessness, crime, illegal drug trade, prostitution, liquor stores, and strip clubs give the neighborhood a seedy reputation.[22]\\r\\nPart of the neighborhood forms part of the theater district. Prominent theatres include the Geary, the home of the American Conservatory Theater, and the Curran, Golden Gate and Orpheum Theatres operated by the Shorenstein Nederlander Organization. Alternative theaters in the Tenderloin include EXIT Theatre, which operates four storefront theaters and produces the San Francisco Fringe Festival, the New Conservatory Theater, the Phoenix Theater, CounterPulse, PianoFight, the New Music Center and others. Alternate galleries include The Luggage Store, the 509 Cultural Center, and others. The neighborhood had many bars dating to prohibition and before with dive bars, including some left over from when the neighborhood housed large numbers of merchant seamen but most of those have closed or been transformed. One bar is built on the site of a previous speakeasy, Bourbon and Branch, at the corner of Jones and O'Farrell Streets. The original speakeasy was restored in the bar's basement, including many of the original decorations. Many bars have entertainment including the historic drag bar Aunt Charlie's. Larger live music venues include the Great American Music Hall and the Warfield Theater. Historically, the Tenderloin has had a number of strip clubs, although their number has decreased in recent decades. The most well known is the Mitchell Brothers O'Farrell Theatre. The Tenderloin is also a hub for the gender diverse community. The categoriesof LGBTIQ created a new gender politics that helped to distinguish between the different groups - the Tenderloin was heavily populated by the transgender community. Many street activisits paved the way for change, such as Anne Ogborn.[23]\\r\\nIn his seminar 'Take Charge of Your Life', Jim Rohn recounted his visits to the Tenderloin to experience the \\"human tragedy\\". He described his visit to a bar in the Tenderloin where the bar tender told him about a dancer by the name of Cookie, who was severely crippled and had a child suffering from leukemia.\\r\\nThe position held by policy-makers regarding gentrification is often divided, with one side of the debate arguing that it is of benefit to the public economy and revitalisation of the built setting, whilst the other side argues that the huge social costs and displacement of people, especially the poor, outweigh all potential strengths of the process.[24]\\r\\nThe Tenderloin serves as a mecca for the art scene in San Francisco, housing the \\"White Walls\\" gallery and \\"Shooting Gallery\\". The Tenderloin has been home to mural work by artists such as Johanna Poethig, Mona Caron, Banksy, Shepard Fairey, Barry McGee, Mike Giant, Blek Le Rat and Dan Plasma.[25]\\r\\nThe \\"Book & Job\\" gallery has become known for hosting skating legends such as Tommy Guerrero and promoting \\"Zine Weekends.\\"\\r\\nThe Tenderloin is a high-crime neighborhood, particularly violent street crime such as robbery and aggravated assault. Seven of the top 10 violent crime plots (out of 665 in the entire city as measured by the San Francisco Police Department) are adjacent plots in the Tenderloin and Sixth and Market area. The neighborhood was considered to be the origin of a notorious Filipino gang Bahala Na Gang or BNG, a gang imported from the Philippines. In the late 1960s to the mid-1970s, the gang was involved in extortion, drug sales, and murder for hire.\\r\\nGraffiti art and tagging are a common problem in the neighborhood. Dealing and use of illicit drugs occurs on the streets. Property crimes are common, especially theft from parked vehicles. Violent acts occur more often here and are generally related to drugs. The area has been the scene of escalating drug violence in 2007, including brazen daylight shootings, as local gangs from San Francisco, and others from around the Bay Area battle for turf.[26] 14 of the city's 98 homicides took place in the area in 2007.[27]\\r\\nThe first block of Turk Street, between Taylor and Mason, had one of the highest rates of violence and drug activity in San Francisco, according to a survey conducted by the Tenderloin Housing Clinic. On January 31, 2014, parking was banned on both sides of the street in an effort to reduce violence and drug activity. Without parked cars to hide illegal activity, there were fewer loiterers, and a decrease in drug activity.[28]\\r\\nHigh rates of sex work in the Tenderloin area has been associated with a high rate of sexually transmitted infections, including HIV, especially among men who have sex with other men and those who also inject drugs. Contributing factors include a lack of sex education and safe sex practices, including condom use. In a 2000 survey, 59% of men who performed sex with other men did not report condom use, with higher rates of unsafe sex practices among those who are not engaged in paid sex work.[29]\\r\\nThe Tenderloin has been the home of Raphael House, the first provider in the city of shelter for homeless parents and children, since 1971. It is an ethnically diverse community, consisting of families, young people living in cheap apartments, downtown bohemian artists, and recent immigrants from Latin America and Southeast Asia. It is home to a large population of homeless, those living in extreme poverty, and numerous non-profit social service agencies, soup kitchens, religious rescue missions, homeless shelters and single room occupancy hotels.[30] Many homeless youths in the Tenderloin district are at risk of serious emotional and psychological problems arising from past traumatic experiences. Lack of appropriately targeted options available in the area has meant many youths will have few viable paths to deal effectively with their problems.[31]\\r\\nThe Tenderloin Housing Clinic has offered important social services to the poor of this neighborhood for decades. According to its director, Randy Shaw, the clinic's \\"mission is to prevent tenant displacement, preserve and expand the city's low cost housing stock and to provide comprehensive legal assistance to low income tenants. The Clinic is successful in fulfilling this mission by providing free legal services, securing SRO units through the Master Lease program and offering comprehensive support services to our clients.\\"\\r\\nThe Care Through Touch Institute, located between Hyde and Leavenworth Streets, offers free seated massage therapy to clients in the Tenderloin community. The founder and director of CTI, Mary Ann Finch, began offering services here in 1997, after being inspired by her volunteer work with Mother Teresa in India. Today, CTI serves primarily low-income and homeless clients at sites such as the Gubbio Project at St. Boniface Church, Tenderloin Self-Help, Tom Waddell health clinic, MCSC, and Martin de Porres House of Hospitality. CTI also offers a 180-hour training in \\"Seated Massage Therapy, Social Consciousness, and Spiritual Practice\\" for people who are interested in volunteering with CTI. Sausa, Keatley & Operaria (2007) found in their study on the perceived risks and benefits of sex work among transgender women of color in San Franciscos Tenderloin that transgender community life has been shown to be shaped by non-local structural conditions of poverty and sexual inequality - therefore, when it comes to health promotion and social service programs for transgender sex workers, it is imperative that these are informed and instructed by the fabric of such community.[32]\\r\\nReligious institutions providing community services to the Tenderloin include Glide Memorial Church, which was reinvigorated by Cecil Williams in 1963, St. Anthony's, a program of the Franciscans and San Francisco City Impact founded in 1984 by Pastor Roger Huang. San Francisco City Impact's K-8 private school, the San Francisco City Academy, was the first K-8 school in the Tenderloin District; founded in 1997. These all provide meals and other social services to poor and homeless residents and others. Glide and the surrounding neighborhood provided much of the setting for the 2006 film The Pursuit of Happyness. In 2008, The Salvation Army opened the Ray and Joan Kroc Community Center, a multipurpose center featuring a gym, swimming pool and fitness center among other amenities. The funding for this center was made possible by a $1.5 billion bequest from Joan Kroc, the widow of McDonald's founder, Ray Kroc. Adjacent to the Kroc center is Railton Place, a 110-unit apartment complex run by the Salvation Army for former foster youth, homeless veterans, and adults recovering from addictions. In 2016, the Tenderloin Community Benefit District (TLCBD) announced the implementation of a new public-private initiative, Operation Leadership, which aims to help strengthen existing street cleaning and beautification services.[33]\\r\\nAs transgender women often face barriers such as discrimination and stigma when accessing health care, and show reluctance to disclose their gender when seeking health related services, a collaborative project named TRANS was set up near the Tenderloin to appropriately address the multifaceted needs of this diverse population, as well as offering support.[34]\\r\\nIn their study, Sausa, Keatley, Operario (2007) concluded that sex work for transgender women of colour must be viewed as a forced consequence of structural barriers that they face, as well as an informed choice for survival as a result of these barriers [35]\\r\\nThe Tenderloin Senior Outreach Project (TSOP) was initiated when local university staff realized that many seniors felt afraid of crime, rent increases, and inadequate income. They facilitate interpersonal communication through coffee & refreshments, groups of elderly people were encouraged to meet each other.[36]\\r\\nLarkin Street Youth Services is a non-profit organization that offers a continuum of services that inspires youth to move beyond the street. Services run the gamut from street outreach and temporary shelters to transitional living programs, health and wellness services, and comprehensive education and employment programs.[37]\\r\\nIn recent years, residents have spearheaded a local arts revival.\\r\\nIn 1987, residents and others from the Aarti Hotel on Leavenworth Street founded the 509 Cultural Center at 509 Ellis Street. After the 1989 earthquake damaged that facility, artists founded The Luggage Store at 1007 Market, at the intersection of 6th Street, Market, Taylor and Golden Gate Avenue. In 1989 the Tenderloin Reflection and Education Center (TREC) spun off from St Anthony foundation and operated a cultural center including dance, music, writing quilting, and other arts workshops in the St. Boniface Neighborhood Center. Artists and activists such as Eric Ehn from the Iowa Writing Workshop and Theatre Artaud; Miya Masoaka, a recording artist with Asian Improv Records; Lucy Jane Bledsoe, published novelist and writer for the East Bay Express; Pearl Ubungen, choreographer; Ben Clarke, Founding Editor of Freedom Voices; and Maketa Groves, poet and published author at Curbstone Press; and Tenderloin resident and Athabaskan poet Mary TallMountain offered numerous free workshops. TREC and its publishing project Freedom Voices continue to offer workshops on an occasional basis at the Public Library, Hospitality House, the Faithful Fools and other locations in the neighborhood. Tender Leaves, the Center's literary journal was published from 1987 to 2006.\\r\\nFrom 2006 to 2009, The Loin's Mouth, conceived by its editor Rachel M., was a semi-quarterly publication about life in the Tenderloin and Tendernob areas. Since then, others have come about to fill the gap including the Tenderloin Reading Series, which is a quarterly literary event in the neighborhood as well as The Tender, a local journal focusing on the events, food, and politics of the neighborhood.\\r\\nIn 2006, Gray Area Foundation for the Arts was formed to produce, exhibit, and develop creativity with the most contemporary new media technologies. Initially located on Taylor Street in an 8,000?sq?ft (740?m2) space, they have since moved across the street to rent space from The Warfield.[38]\\r\\nIn years past, the local Vietnamese Community has hosted the T?t celebration of the Vietnamese Lunar New Year in the Little Saigon section of the Tenderloin.\\r\\nHistorically, the downtown Tenderloin had no parks between Union Square to the East and Civic Center Plaza to the West until a number of activists, who organized the City's Citizens Committee for Open Space, advocated for more open space in the Tenderloin in the 1970s. As a result, a number of parks and playgrounds were created including first Boeddeker Park, a multi-use facility, then the youth-oriented Tenderloin Playground, followed by a number of mini-playgrounds.\\r\\nBoeddeker Park, located at the corner of Eddy and Jones Streets, is one of the most used parks per square foot in the City. It underwent a renovation, completed in December 2014, which has revitalized the park. YMCA and the Boys and Girls Club occupy the clubhouse, providing programming for youth and seniors. Its the hub of positive community togetherness, Tenderloin police Capt. Jason Cherniss said of the park. Its not necessarily police, its community. Its ripe for that now. Were all getting more connected and sharing information.[39]\\r\\nThe Tenderloin Children's Playground, on Ellis Street between Leavenworth and Hyde Streets, was opened in 1995 and has attractive indoor and outdoor recreational facilities and hosts a number of community and family events.\\r\\nSgt. John Macaulay Park, named after a San Francisco police officer who was killed in the adjacent alley while on duty, is a small gated playground at the corner of O'Farrell and Larkin Streets. Although the park is located across the street from a strip club, it is frequented by parents and children from the neighborhood.\\r\\nThe \\"Tenderloin National Forest\\" (a project of the nonprofit organization The Luggage Store/509 Cultural Center) is an unofficial park that was established from 1987ÿpresent that maintains the park and opening hours. It is located on Cohen Alley just off Ellis Street.\\r\\nIn March 2011, People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) Vice President Tracy Reiman sent Mayor Ed Lee a letter proposing for renaming of the neighborhood and suggesting alternative name like the Tempeh District,[40] claiming \\"the city deserves a neighborhood named after a delicious cruelty-free food instead of the flesh of an abused animal\\".[41] The proposal was met with ridicule by locals and Mayor Lee responded that it was more important to improve the lives of the residents than rename the neighborhood.[42][43]\\r\\nCoordinates: 3747N 12225W? / ?37.783N 122.417W? / 37.783; -122.417","input":"What is the tenderloin district of san francisco?"},{"output":"new information on the behavioural evolution of modern humans","context":"Blombos Cave is an archaeological site located in Blombosfontein Nature Reserve, about 300?km east of Cape Town on the Southern Cape coastline, South Africa.

In 1997 GSF8 was renamed Blombos Cave and given its current acronym: BBC.[5] From 1999 to 2011 in total ten field seasons, each six weeks long, have been carried out at the cave site.\\r\\nFrom the initial excavations conducted in the early 1990s, the Blombos Cave project has adopted and established new and innovative research agendas in the study of southern African prehistory. While Henshilwoods initial, doctoral research was directed towards the more recent Later Stone Age occupation levels, the focus since 1997 has been on the Middle Stone Age sequence. The Blombos Cave project has since then developed academically, economically and administratively; from being a local and small-scale test excavation to becoming an international, full scale, high-technological archaeological project. In 2010ÿ2015 the cave site is the focus of the multi-disciplinary, pan-continental research program TRACSYMBOLS.\\r\\nThe TRACSYMBOLS project is led by Professor Christopher S. Henshilwood based at the Department of Archaeology, History, Cultural Studies and Religion[25] at the University of Bergen and the University of the Witwatersrand, South Africa, together with Professor Francesco dErrico from the University of Bordeaux 1, France. The aim of TRACSYMBOLS project is to examine how key behavioural innovations emerged among Homo sapiens and Homo neanderthalensis in southern Africa and Europe respectively, and to explore whether and how environmental variability influenced this development between 180,000 ÿ 25,000 years ago; primarily by combining archaeological results, original multiproxy palaeoenvironmental data and climatic simulations for two continents.\\r\\nThe cave is situated in a south-facing cliff face 34.5 meter above sea level, ca. 100 meters from the present day shore line. The cave formation is set in calcretes of the Wankoe Formation, and the geological setting indicates that the cave was formed by wave action sometime during the Plio-Pleistocene.[26]\\r\\nThe interior of Blombos Cave comprises a single main chamber, and the entire (accessible) interior cave floor is about 39m2 behind the drip line. West of the cave's main chamber, anthropogenic deposit extends inwardly 3-5 meter. In this area, however, the cave ceiling lowers to a point where it falls in level with the surface, preventing access to the deposit beneath. In the area north-east of the main chamber, deposit expands into a low laying ante-chamber of unknown extent due to the sand filling it. By the end of the 2011 field season about 19.5m2 of interior cave has been dug during the Blombos Cave excavations.\\r\\nBlombos Cave's outer talus forms a gently sloping platform of about 23m2 that extends 4-5 meter southwards, before the terrain abruptly drops down towards shoreline that lies some 34,5 meters below the cave entrance. The talus, which primarily consists of Middle Stone Age deposit, rock fall and unconsolidated sediments, is stabilised by an area of large, exposed blocks (14m2). At some stage - and in between the prehistoric occupation of the cave site - these blocks have fallen down from the rock face above, effectively preventing site erosion and allowing sediments to stabilize and accumulate in front of the cave's drip line.\\r\\nCalcium carbonate (CaCO3) rich ground water seeps in from the cave roof and percolates through the interior sediments, resulting in an alkaline environment with good preservation conditions. The excavated Middle Stone Age deposit in Blombos Cave consists of aeolian (wind-borne) dune sand, blown in through the cave entrance, and roof spall from the cave ceiling. Intermixed with these sandy matrixes are decomposed marine and terrestrial faunal remains (fish, shell fish, egg shell and animal bones) and organic material [20][22][26][27] Large combustion features, small basin-shaped hearths and carbonized horizons are recorded throughout the whole MSA sequence.[21][28]\\r\\nWhen the excavation started at Blombos Cave in 1992 the cave entrance was partially sealed by dune sand, and about 20?cm of sterile Aeolian deposit covered the interior Later Stone Age deposit. Underneath the aeolian sand surface, seven main phases of occupation have been identified in the 2.5-3 meter deep Blombos Cave stratigraphic sequence; three in the Later Stone Age (L1-L3) and four in the Middle Stone Age (M1, Upper M2, Lower M2 and M3). These phases are further divided into finer lenses and sub-lenses, most of them less than 10?cm thick. The Later Stone Age and Middle Stone Age levels are separated by a 5ÿ50?cm thick, sterile unit named Hiatus or DUN. The Hiatus consists of yellow Aeolian sand that blew into the cave at about 68,000-70,000 years BP, and shows little disturbance from the overlying Later Stone Age units.\\r\\nHumans have briefly and sporadically occupied Blombos Cave throughout the Middle Stone Age (101,000-70,000 years BP) and in the latter parts of the Later Stone Age (2,000ÿ300 years BP). The occupational hiatus between ca. 68,000 and 2,000 years BP, combined with the geological evidence, indicates that the cave site was sealed off by aeolian sand during this period [2][21] The cave entrance appear to have reopened during the mid-Holocene transgression (c. 4,000ÿ3000 years ago), when high sea levels eroded away most of the dune. Remnants of this eroded calcarenite dune are still visible in the surrounding coastal landscape.\\r\\nThe Later Stone Age sequence has been radiocarbon dated to 2000ÿ290 years BP,[24] while the Middle Stone Age sequence is dated to ca. 101,000-70,000 years ago through a number of methods, including: thermo-luminescence (TL),[1] optically stimulated luminescence (OSL),[2][3][4][29][30] uranium-thorium series (U/Th)[3] and electron spin resonance (ESR).[31] The lowest levels of the M3 phase has a preliminary age of >130,000 years ago, while the unexcavated sediments below these levels remains undated (June 2013).\\r\\nThe hiatus level (DUN) composed of undisturbed aeolian sand overlying the M1 phase is dated by OSL to 69,000 I 5,000 and 70,000 I 5000 years BP, while OSL ages ranging from 74,900 I 4,300 to 72,500 I 4,600 years BP have been obtained for the upper part of the M1 phase; i.e. the units associated with the Still Bay techno-tradition.[2][4][10][29][30] Jacobs et al. 2013[4] consider the Still Bay sequence at Blombos Cave (with 95% confidence) to have begun only after 75,500 years BP and ended 67,800 years ago, lasting no longer than 6,600 years.[4] The true age of the Still Bay has been debated, and ages presented by Jacobs et al. 2013 has been challenged on methodological grounds [32][33][34] (see next paragraphs). TL ages for the M1 phase are 74,000 I 5,000 and 78,000 I 6,000 years BP.[1]\\r\\nThe lower layers in the M2 phase (layer CG, CGAA, CGAB, CGAC) have been dated to between 78,900 I 5,900 and 78,800 I 5,600 years BP.[4] The upper levels of the M3 phase are dated to ca. 100,000 years ago, coinciding with the high sea-level stand during Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 5c.[3] A preliminary age of >130,000 years BP is attributed to the lower M3 phase (the lowest excavated level at the site).\\r\\nCritical remarks were in 2013 [32] raised towards the luminescence-based Middle Stone Age chronology established by Jacobs et al. 2008 [35] on methodological grounds related to errors in the manipulation of the luminescence data and estimation of uncertainties in the dose rates. The Middle Stone Age chronology for Blombos Cave derived from optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) ages[4] is, nonetheless, consistent with the ages obtained through alternative methods (TL, ESR, U/Th), and remains uncontested.\\r\\nThe most extensive and well documented sample of so-called Still Bay points in southern African comes from the Still Bay sequence in Blombos Cave.[18][19][21] Still Bay points are the fossiles directeurs of the Still Bay techno-complex, and they conform to bifacially worked stone points, popularly referred to as \\"lance-heads\\", \\"laurel leaf-shaped\\" or \\"willow leaf-shaped\\" stone points.[36][37] Still Bay points have bifacially retouched sides, are elliptic to lanceolate shaped and most often they have two pointed apices.\\r\\nSince the excavation in Blombos Cave began more than 500 points or point fragments have been recovered, of which 352 have been described in detail[18] The dominant raw material used for Still Bay point production in Blombos Cave is silcrete (72%), followed by quartzite (15%) and quartz (13%). Whereas the quartzite and quartz raw material is easily available in close vicinity to the cave, the exact source for silcrete has not been established. It is speculated that it may come from outcrops in Riversdale or Albertinia ÿ some 30?km away ÿ or from now underwater sources[18][21] Ca. 90% of the Still Bay points recovered from Blombos Cave have been classified as \\"production rejects\\", and preliminary analysis of the lithic material from the CC unit suggests that the majority of the lithic debitage are by-products of bifacial point manufacture.[18] Villa et al. (2009:458) conclude that: Blombos was a workshop in the sense that the making of points was a primary ÿ though not exclusive ÿ activity at the site.[18]\\r\\nThe manufacture sequence of Still Bay points has been divided into four main production phases.[18][38] While hard hammer and direct percussion was used in the initial reduction phase (phase 1), followed by soft hammer and marginal percussion (phase 2), pressure flaking was only used during the final retouch phase (3), and a few points were also reworked by hard hammer percussion (phase 4) ([19] ). For the moment, the Still Bay points from Blombos Cave represent some of the earliest evidence for pressure flaking, a technique more common in considerably more recent lithic techno-complexes.[19] Experimental replication by Mourre et al. 2010 and microscopic study of Still Bay points from Blombos Cave indicates that some silcrete blanks were deliberately heat-treated, before pressure flaking was employed in the final reduction sequence; and thus improving the silcretes flaking quality.[19]\\r\\nIt has been argued that the bifacial points were hafted and used primarily as spear points[18] or knives [39] or both [40] Some researchers have suggested that the seeming concern for the appearance of the finished point may represent evidence for social and stylistic elaboration during the MSA.[21] Still Bay points may have served as tools with symbolic values attached to them ÿ perhaps used as markers of identity ÿ and integrated in social exchange networks,[41] similar to the ones observed ethnographically.[42][43] H?gberg and Larsson 2011 hypothesise that blanks and unfinished Still Bay points were purposely left behind in Hollow Rock Shelter, perhaps for being used at a later stage or as an act of solidarity with other hunter-gatherer groups.[38]\\r\\nOchre ÿ an iron-rich mineral ÿ is regularly found at Stone Age sites throughout southern Africa, and has also been recovered from the Middle Stone Age levels in Blombos Cave.[9][10][44] More than 8,000 pieces of ochre-like material, of which more than 1500 are 10mm in length, have been recovered from the Middle Stone Age levels of Blombos Cave. Many of them show use-wear traces from intentional use and processing [9][10] Some of these recovered ochre pieces have been deliberately engraved or incised and it is argued that they represent a kind of early abstract or symbolic depiction and is arguably among the most complex and clearly formed of objects claimed to be early abstract representations.[10][45]\\r\\nIn 2002 the recovery of two finely engraved ochre pieces ÿ both deriving from the Still Bay units (M1 phase) ÿ was reported in Science Magazine.[10] The surfaces of both pieces were intentionally modified by scraping and grinding, and the engraved pattern formed a distinct cross-hatched design in combination with parallel incised lines. In 2009, six additional pieces of engraved ochre ÿ this time recovered from entire Middle Stone Age sequence dated to between 70,000 and 100,000 years old ÿ were announced.[9] Comparable geometric designs have also been observed on an engraved bone fragment from Blombos Cave M1 phase [11] Engraved ochre has also been reported from other Middle Stone Age sites, such as Klein Kliphuis,[46] Wonderwerk Cave[47] and Klasies River Cave 1.[48] Arguably, these engraved pieces of ochre represent ÿ together with the engraved ostrich egg shells from Diepkloof[49][50] ÿ the earliest forms of abstract representation and conventional design tradition hitherto recorded.\\r\\nGeometric or iconographic representations have traditionally been archaeological categories associated with modern human behaviour and cognitive complexity .[9][10][48] Evidence for abstract representations is well documented in Europe after 40,000 years ago, and for a long time it was therefore thought that the earliest form of art originated there.[51] The evidence from Blombos Cave ÿ and from sites like Klasies River, Diepkloof Rock Shelter, Klein Kliphuis and Wonderwerk cave ÿ implies that abstract representations were made in southern Africa at least 30,000 years earlier than in Europe and that stylistic elaboration and symbolic traditions were common in southern Africa 70,000ÿ100,000 years ago.[52] The incised ochre pieces recovered from Blombos Cave and various other Middle Stone Age sites indicates that there was a spatial and temporal continuity in the production and use of conventional symbols in the region.\\r\\nYet, recent studies also demonstrate that the mere occurrence of ochre in MSA contexts cannot be limited to a symbolic interpretation alone, but its use may also have served some functional role, e.g. as an ingredient in mastic, skin protection against sun or insects, as soft-hammers for delicate knapping, as a hide preservative or as medicine.[53][54][55][56][57]\\r\\nIn 2008 an ochre processing workshop consisting of two toolkits was uncovered in the 100,000-year-old levels at Blombos Cave, South Africa.[3] Analysis shows that a liquefied pigment-rich mixture was produced and stored in the shells of two Haliotis midae (abalone), and that ochre, bone, charcoal, grindstones and hammer-stones also formed a composite part of the toolkits. As both toolkits were left in situ, and as there are few other archaeological remains in the same layer, it seems the site was used primarily as a workshop and was abandoned shortly after the pigment-rich compounds were made. Dune sand then blew into the cave from the outside, encapsulated the toolkits and by happenstance ensured their preservation before the next occupants arrived, possibly several decades or centuries later.\\r\\nThe application or use of the compound is not self-evident. No resins or wax were detected that might indicate it was an adhesive for hafting. Possible uses could include painting a surface in order to decorate or protect it, or to create a design. The recovery of these toolkits at Blombos Cave nevertheless adds evidence for early technological and behavioural developments associated with Middle Stone Age humans. It documents the first known instance for the deliberate planning, production and curation of a pigmented compound and for the use of a container. Evidence for the complexity of the task includes procuring and combining raw materials from various sources (implying they had a mental template of the process they would follow), possibly using pyrotechnology to facilitate fat extraction from bone, using a probable recipe to produce the compound, and the use of shell containers for mixing and storage for later use. An elementary knowledge of chemistry and the ability for long-term planning suggests conceptual and cognitive abilities previously unknown for this time and serves as a benchmark during the early evolution of the technological and cognitive abilities of Homo sapiens in southern Africa.\\r\\nFormal bone tools are relatively rare artefacts to find at MSA sites.[6] At Blombos Cave several bone tools, including awls and bone points, have been recovered from both the Later Stone Age and Middle Stone Age sequence. More than thirty bone tools, e.g. awls and polished bone points, have been attributed to the Still Bay units.[15][16][17][21] The awls that have been recovered are primarily made on long-bone shaft fragments, are shaped by scraping and may have been used to pierce through soft material - such as leather ÿ or shell beads.[13] Some of the bone points, which may have been used as projectile points and hafted, were besides being scraped also carefully polished in the final production phase of the tool. It has been questioned whether the polish have improved the bone tools functionality, and it has been hypothesized the polish might represent a technique applied deliberately to primarily enhance the bone points aesthetic quality and to give them added value.[41] The polished bone points may have formed part of a material culture exchange system amongst groups to maintain or even enhance social relations, perhaps similar to the stone point exchange systems observed ethnographically.[42][43] The behavioural and evolutionary significance of prehistoric bone shaping is, however, not entirely clear and has been ÿ and still is ÿ critically examined and discussed by academics.[7][17][58][59]\\r\\nIn addition to conventional bone tools, a modified bone fragment marked with eight parallel lines has also been recovered from the Still Bay phase.[11] The bone incisions do not look like ordinary butchery marks. Microscopic analysis shows that the incisions most likely represent a deliberately engraved pattern made with a stone tool, and it may be comparable with the geometric design observed on the engraved pieces of ochre.\\r\\nMore than 70 marine shell beads of the sea snail species Nassarius kraussianus have been found in the M1 and Upper M2 phases at Blombos Cave.[12][13][14] The beads are exclusively confined to the Still Bay occupation units, and the majority have been found in the M1 phase. It has been argued that the marine shells were deliberately pierced through the aperture, probably with a bone tool, thus creating of a small-sized perforation.[13] Contextual information, morphometric, technological and use-wear analysis of the Blombos Cave beads, alongside experimental reproduction of wear patterns, show that the Nassarius kraussianus shells were strung, perhaps on cord or sinew and worn as a personal ornament. A cluster of 24 perforated Nassarius kraussianus has been recovered from one of the Still Bay units and strengthens this interpretation, as it appears that these shells originated from a single beadwork. Beside the deliberate perforation of the Nassarius shells, repeated rubbing of the beads against one another and against the cord, have resulted in discrete use wear facets on each bead that are not observed on these shells in their natural environment. These use-wear patterns are the principal factor that defines the shells as beads. Also, the consistency in shell size and colour indicates that the Nassarius shells were carefully selected. Ochre has been detected inside some of the shell beads, implicating that they were subject to deliberate or indirect use of ochre as a colouring agent.\\r\\nThe wearing and display of personal ornaments during the Still Bay phase was not idiosyncratic. In-depth analyses of the Blombos Cave shell beads deriving from various levels and squares within the site demonstrate chronological regularities and variability, in terms of manufacture, stringing method and design of the bead works.[14] Discrete groups of beads with wear patterns and colouring specific to that group have been recovered, a patterning that suggests that at least a number of individuals may have worn beads, perhaps on their person or attached to clothing or other artifacts. Thus, the Blombos Cave beads may document one of the first examples where changes in complex social conventions directly can be traced through distinct variations in the production and use of symbolic material culture over time.\\r\\nThe shell beads also provide insights into technological and behavioral aspects of the humans living in the Still Bay phase, including the ability to drill, the use of cord or gut for threading and the probable tying of knots to secure the beads. A comprehension of self-awareness or self-recognition is implied by the wearing of beads or other personal ornaments and was likely an important factor in cognitive evolution that was selected for long before the introduction of beads. Further, syntactical language would have been essential for the sharing and transmission of the symbolic meaning of personal ornaments within and between groups and also over generations, as is also suggested for the engraved ochre pieces.\\r\\nUntil recently, the first use of personal ornaments was thought to occur with the arrival of Homo sapiens in Europe, some 40,000 years ago.[60] Most academics now believes that marine shells were used as beads in the Near East, North Africa, and Sub-Saharan Africa at least 30,000 years earlier than their first use in Europe. Besides Blombos Cave, there are a number of African and Middle East sites that all have yielded strong evidence for the early use of personal ornaments: Skul and Qafzeh, Israel,[61][62] Oued Djebbana, Algeria,[62] Grotte des Pigeons, Rhafas, Ifri n'Ammar and Contrebandiers, Morocco[63] .[64]\\r\\nNo skeletal remains have been found in Blombos Cave and the amount of other types of recovered human material from the Middle Stone Age units amounts only to seven teeth.[65][66] The crown diameters of at least some of these teeth are morphometric \\"modern\\" in terms of tooth size reduction, implying that the humans occupying Blombos Cave were anatomically modern. This conclusion is supported by similar evidence from a nearby archaeological site, Klasies River, that dates to a similar time period.[67]\\r\\nAt Blombos Cave a great variety of terrestrial and marine faunal remains are consistently found throughout the Later Stone Age and Middle Stone age phases.[20][21][22] The faunal record from Blombos Cave shows that Middle Stone Age people practiced a subsistence strategy that included a very broad range of animals. This means they were able to hunt large animals, such as eland, but also gathered, collected or trapped small animals such as tortoises, hyraxes and dune mole rats. They also brought seal, dolphin and probably whale meat back to the cave. The latter two were almost certainly scavenged from beach wash-ups, but seals may have been speared or clubbed.\\r\\nThe faunal remains recovered include specifically: fish,[20] shellfish, birds, tortoise and ostrich egg shell [21] and mammals of various sizes.[21][22] The amount of shell fish recovered from the various Middle Stone Age units show that people were regularly collecting them at the shore and bringing them back to the cave for consumption. Common species include the giant periwinkle (Turbo sarmaticus), limpets (Patella spp.) and brown mussels (Perna perna).\\r\\nSpecies variations may, with larger sample sizes, inform us of past changes in ocean palaeo-temperatures. In terms of kilograms of shell fish per cubic meter (kg/m3), Still Bay is the Middle Stone Age phase in Blombos Cave where shellfish are found in least abundance (17.5?kg/m3), and they seem to have been more intensively exploited in the earlier occupation phases. The changes observed in shellfish procurement through the various MSA phases may relate to fluctuating climatic conditions and changing sea levels, which have altered the caves proximity to the coastline and affected the sea level temperatures.[68][69][70][71]\\r\\nFish remains are present, but not abundant, in all phases at Blombos Cave.[20] Fish are more abundant in the Later Stone Age but a wider range of species are present in the Middle Stone Age sequence. Chemical analysis of fish bone from the Later Stone Age and Middle Stone Age levels, using the carbon/nitrogen method, confirms the antiquity of the Middle Stone Age specimens. Most of the species present are not known to wash up after cold water upwelling events, hence scavenging of wash-ups was not the primary source of fish. No artefacts that appear to be obvious fishing equipment have been found, but the range and sizes of species present indicate that a number of methods must have been employed. These may have included: baited hooks, spearing and tidal traps.\\r\\nWhere the same fish species have survived in both Later Stone Age and Middle Stone Age levels, analysis of relative bone element occurrence show a significant deficit in the Middle Stone Age. In other words, age-related taphonomic processes have resulted in the loss of many fish bones, and it is likely that more fish were originally deposited in the Middle Stone Age levels than have been recovered through archaeological excavations. Fish are seldom reported from other southern African MSA sites, and by implication, it was thought that Middle Stone Age people were incapable of exploiting coastal resources efficiently. The evidence for fishing at Blombos Cave and Klasies River contradicts this theory.[20]\\r\\nThe huge variety of faunal and the shell fish remains recovered from all parts of the Blombos Cave Middle Stone Age sequence demonstrate that people during this period practiced a diverse set of subsistence and procurements strategies and were able to effectively hunt, trap and collect coastal, as well as terrestrial, resources. The subsistence behaviour inferred from the faunal assemblages can hardly be distinguished from the remains and behaviour seen in more recent Later Stone Age contexts.Thus, the overall subsistence pattern at Blombos Cave signifies that no clear distinction can be made between Later Stone Age and Middle Stone Age subsistence behaviour at the site.[5][21]\\r\\nEpisodes of past environmental change are typically defined by marine oxygen isotope stages (MIS) that are derived from oxygen isotope signals in planktonic foraminifera found in marine cores. The climatic fluctuations documented from MIS 6 through to MIS 3 spans the duration of the southern African MSA. These stages are therefore most pertinent. In the archaeological context, environmental proxies typically come from a broad range of sources such as microfauna, macrofauna, fossil pollen, dune sediments and speleothems. In recent years, there has been a growing interest in improving our understanding of the environments in which MSA peoples lived and interacted with each other [5][72][73][74][75][76] This is because aspects of MSA behaviours related to artefact production, subsistence, pigment use and migration patterns are increasingly being linked to periods of climatic, and by extension environmental change [70][71][74][75][77][78]\\r\\nEstablishing a link, if any, between MSA lifeways and the environmental context in which MSA behaviours developed is complex.[38][41][55][79] While some researchers argue for links between extreme climate change and social change [7][80][81][82] there is some debate.[5][35][68][72][76] The differing views regarding the role of past environmental change on Middle Stone Age people is also complicated by the wide range of climate proxies which can be interpreted at varying spatial and temporal resolutions.[71][83] The aim of current research efforts focusing on MSA environments is therefore two-fold. Firstly, improving the temporal resolution of proxies by applying suitable dating methods such as radiocarbon, uranium-series, luminescence, etc. Secondly and most importantly, is to refine the available proxy database so that ambiguous and often, conflicting interpretations can be re-assessed as new information emerges. In light of this, two key studies have emerged; Jacobs and Roberts[72] who evaluate and synthesise the dates for the Still Bay and Howiesons Poort periods across southern Africa and Chase[68] who addresses the issues about MIS 4 environments and the role of climate forcing during this period. A current synthesis of environmental proxy evidence associated with MIS 4 indicates that the Still Bay and Howiesons Poort occurred during relatively humid conditions.[68] It is however not clear what environmental conditions during earlier periods of the MSA (i.e. MSA I, II, III & MSA 2) were like. These early MSA periods are broadly correlated with MIS 6 and MIS 5 (b, c, d, e) but have not been investigated in any detail.\\r\\nBlombos Cave was declared a provincial heritage site by Heritage Western Cape on the 29 May 2015 in terms of Section 27 of the National Heritage Resources Act.[23] This gives the site Grade II status and provides it with protection under South African heritage law.\\r\\nAlso in 2015, the South African government submitted a proposal to add the cave to the list of World Heritage Sites and it has been placed on the UNESCO list of tentative sites as a potential future 'serial nomination' together with Pinnacle Point, Sibudu Cave, Klasies River Caves, Border Cave and Diepkloof Rock Shelter.[84]","input":"What is so special about the blombos cave?"},{"output":"21 April 1526","context":"The First Battle of Panipat, on 21 April 1526, was fought between the invading forces of Babur and the Lodi Kingdom. It took place in north India and marked the beginning of the Mughal Empire. This was one of the earliest battles involving gunpowder firearms and field artillery in the Indian subcontinent which were introduced by Mughals in this battle.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter losing Samarkand for the second time, Babur gave attention to conquer India as he reached the banks of the Chenab in 1519.[4] Until 1524, his aim was to only expand his rule to Punjab, mainly to fulfil his ancestor Timur's legacy, since it used to be part of his empire.[5] At the time parts of north India were under the rule of Ibrahim Lodi of the Lodi dynasty, but the empire was crumbling and there were many defectors. He received invitations from Daulat Khan Lodi, Governor of Punjab and Ala-ud-Din, uncle of Ibrahim.[6] He sent an ambassador to Ibrahim, claiming himself the rightful heir to the throne of the country, however the ambassador was detained at Lahore and released months later.[7]\\r\\nBabur started for Lahore, Punjab, in 1524 but found that Daulat Khan Lodi had been driven out by forces sent by Ibrahim Lodi.[8] When Babur arrived at Lahore, the Lodi army marched out and his army was routed.[8] In response, Babur burned Lahore for two days, then marched to Dipalpur, placing Alam Khan, another rebel uncle of Lodi's, as governor.[8] Alam Khan was quickly overthrown and fled to Kabul. In response, Babur supplied Alam Khan with troops who later joined up with Daulat Khan Lodi and together with about 30,000 troops, they besieged Ibrahim Lodi at Delhi.[9] He defeated them and drove off Alam's army and Babur realised Lodhi would not allow him to occupy the Punjab.[9]\\r\\nHearing of the size of Ibrahim's army, Babur secured his right flank against the city of Panipat, while digging a trench covered with tree branches to secure his left flank. In the center, he placed 700 carts tied together with ropes. Between every two carts there were breastworks for his matchlockmen. Babur also ensured there was enough space for his cavalry to charge between these carts.[3]\\r\\nWhen Ibrahim's army arrived, he found the approach to Babur's army too narrow to attack. While Ibrahim redeployed his forces to allow for the narrower front, Babur quickly took advantage of the situation to flank (tulghuma) the Lodi army.[3] Many of Ibrahim's troops were unable to get into action, and fled when the battle turned against Ibrahim.[10] Faced with musket fire, cannon fire and cavalry attacks from all sides, Ibrahim Lodi fought and died with 6,000 of his remaining troops.[3]\\r\\nBabur's guns proved decisive in battle, firstly because Ibrahim lacked any field artillery, but also because the sound of the cannon frightened Ibrahim's elephants, causing them to trample his own men.[10]\\r\\nNew tactics introduced by Babur were the tulghuma and the araba. Tulghuma meant dividing the whole army into various units, viz. the Left, the Right and the Centre. The Left and Right divisions were further subdivided into Forward and Rear divisions. Through this a small army could be used to surround the enemy from all sides. The Centre Forward division was then provided with carts (araba) which were placed in rows facing the enemy and tied to each other with animal hide ropes. Behind them were placed cannons protected and supported by mantlets which could be used to easily maneuver the cannons. These two tactics made Babur's artillery lethal. The cannons could be fired without any fear of being hit, as they were shielded by the bullock carts held in place by hide ropes. The heavy cannons could also be easily traversed onto new targets, as they could be maneuvered by the mantlets which were on wheels.\\r\\nIbrahim Lodi died on the field of battle along with 15,000 of his troops.

The regiment is currently based in Sennelager, Germany, where it is the armoured regiment for 20th Armoured Brigade, part of British Forces Germany.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Queen's Royal Hussars was formed in Fallingbostel on 1 September 1993 from the amalgamation of the Queen's Own Hussars and the Queen's Royal Irish Hussars.[1]\\r\\nThe Queen's Own Hussars, normally referred to by the abbreviation QOH, was a cavalry regiment of the British Army, formed from the amalgamation of 3rd The King's Own Hussars and the 7th Queen's Own Hussars at Candahar Barracks, Tidworth in 1958.[2]\\r\\nThe Queen's Royal Irish Hussars, abbreviated as QRIH, was a cavalry regiment of the British Army formed from the amalgamation of the 4th Queen's Own Hussars and the 8th King's Royal Irish Hussars in Hohne, West Germany in 1958.[3]\\r\\nThe regiment, in January 1996, became the first to be deployed in Challenger 1 tanks to Bosnia with NATO's British-led Implementation Force IFOR.[4] In August 1996 the regiment deployed to Northern Ireland on Operation Banner and then moved to Athlone Barracks at Sennelager as armoured regiment for 20th Armoured Brigade in January 1998.[4] An independent tank squadron deployed to Kosovo in 2001, with the rest of the regiment deploying later that year in the dismounted role.[5]\\r\\nDecember 2003 saw the regiment deploy once again, this time to Iraq on Operation Telic 3.[4] The regiment saw its first Military Cross awarded to Lance corporal Christopher Balmforth of B Squadron for his actions during an ambush in Basra.[6]\\r\\nApril 2006 saw the regiment deploy once again to Iraq on Operation Telic 8[4] and December 2008 saw the regiment deployed to Iraq on Operation Telic 13.[4] As the final Operation Telic the Queen's Royal Hussars were intimately involved in the drawdown from the main British base and spent many hours escorting convoys to and from Kuwait.[7]\\r\\nIn 2011 the regiment deployed on Operation Herrick 15 as a ground holding Battle Group to Afghanistan in the infantry role: they worked with the Afghan National Police handing over control of checkpoints.[5]\\r\\nOn return from Afghanistan in 2012 the regiment was called on to support the security for the London Olympic Games. The remainder of the year was used to return to the armoured role. 2013 saw C Squadron training with 5 Rifles on Exercise Baverian Charger, mounted on Challenger 2.[8] The Queen's Royal Hussars Battlegroup, comprising sub-units from 5 Rifles and 1 PWRR deployed on Exercise Prairie Thunder 2 between July and August 2013.[9]\\r\\nIn June 2014, the regiment deployed C Squadron to Operation Herrick 20 in Afghanistan, as the Warthog Group. This role involved crewing Warthog armoured tracked vehicles and operating with dismounted infantry from 5 RIFLES to disrupt insurgents in Helmand during the draw down of British troops from Camp Bastion. They were the last British combat units on the ground in Helmand.[10]\\r\\nThe regiment will move to Tidworth with 20 Armoured Infantry Brigade, forming the senior of three Type 56 heavy armoured regiments of British Army's Reactive Force.[11]\\r\\nHolders of the Victoria Cross included:\\r\\nThe regiment is equipped with 56 Challenger 2 tanks.[12] In addition the Regiment also fields a squadron with a close reconnaissance troop mounted in eight FV107 Scimitars.[13]\\r\\nThe regiment has three museums:[14]\\r\\nThe crest and cap badge are as follows:[14]\\r\\nThe regiment has gained a number of unique privileges and traditions:\\r\\nThe Loyal Toast: After the Jacobite rebellion in 1745, all officers of the army were required to drink the health of the Sovereign in their mess after dinner as a token of loyalty to the King. The King, however, absolved the regiment from this duty, saying that their loyalty had always been beyond question, and gave the officers the privilege of never drinking the Loyal Toast in the Officers' Mess and of ignoring the National Anthem (they remain seated) when it is played by the band after dinner. This privilege was reaffirmed by the Sovereign prior to the formation of the regiment in 1993.[14]\\r\\nThe White Horse of Hanover: Ranking second, after the Crown, among the regiment's military badges, it was bestowed by the first three King Georges to certain regiments for their part in suppressing the Jacobites. It was first granted, as a special head-dress badge, by King George I to the 3rd King's Own Regiment of Dragoons in 1715 for their part in defeating James Francis Edward Stuart (The Old Pretender).[15]\\r\\nCrossbelts: At the Battle of Almenar in 1710 the 8th Dragoons pursued the Spanish Cavalry Corps and, equipping themselves with the crossbelts of the enemy, cut down the Spaniards with their own swords. The crossbelts were worn with distinction for many years, and the nickname 'St Georges Crossbelts' was given to the regiment. Although the crossbelt worn today is based on the original 4th Hussar pattern, the continuing tradition of titling the Regimental Journal 'The Crossbelts' is in recognition of this famous action.[14]\\r\\nThe Maid of Warsaw: Every member of the regiment wears the Maid of Warsaw, the crest of the City of Warsaw, on the left sleeve of his No. 2 (Service) Dress. This honour was awarded to the 7th Hussars by the Commander of the Second Polish Corps in recognition of their valour in support of the Polish Forces during the Italian Campaign in World War II. Traditionally the original crest presented to the regiment is placed in front of the Commanding Officer on Dinner Nights.[14]\\r\\nThe Fern Leaf: All vehicles in the regiment display the emblem of New Zealand, the Fern Leaf, to commemorate the association of the 3rd Hussars with the 2nd New Zealand Division at the Battle of El Alamein where the regiment lost all but five tanks breaching the German line. This honour was granted by General Lord Freyberg VC.[14]\\r\\nKettle Drums: By command of King George II the silver kettle drums captured by The King's Own Regiment of Dragoons, later the 3rd Hussars, at Dettingen are borne by a drum horse ridden by a Sergeant Kettledrummer - both being additional to the regimental establishment. The drums are always carried at the head of the regiment on ceremonial parades and are, uniquely amongst cavalry regiments, never covered by drum banners, the battle honours being engraved directly onto the sides of the drums. In 1772 when Lord Southampton commanded the regiment, his wife gave a silver collar to be worn by the Kettledrummer, which is still worn today when parading in full dress with the drums. The present drum horse is named Alamein and its nickname is Dudley.[14]\\r\\nWinston Churchill: Winston Churchill, who has been described as 'the greatest Hussar of them all', was commissioned into the 4th Hussars in 1895, and later became the Colonel of the regiment from 1941, until the 4th Queen's Own Hussars was amalgamated with the 8th Hussars in 1958, after which he became Colonel of the new regiment, Queen's Own Royal Irish Hussars, remaining so until his death in 1965. In recognition of this, The Churchill Cup is awarded to the top-scoring troop in the regiment's annual gunnery competition. The Commanding Officer's tank is also named 'Churchill'.[14]\\r\\nThe colours are as follows:[14]\\r\\nThe lyrics of the song go:[5]\\r\\nI'm a soldier in the Queen's Army.\\r\\nI'm a galloping Queen's Hussar.\\r\\nI've sailed the ocean wide and blue.\\r\\nI'm a chap who knows a thing or two.\\r\\nBeen in many a tight corner.\\r\\nShown the enemy who we are.\\r\\nI can ride a horse.\\r\\nGo on a spree, or sing a comic song.\\r\\nAnd that denotes a Queen's Hussar.\\r\\nThe Pipes and Drums were inherited from the Queen's Royal Irish Hussars. There has been no formal adoption of pipe music by the regiment, but the pipe tunes have become very much a part of Regimental Parades, the following tunes have become part of the Regiment's Music.[16]\\r\\nThe following are celebrated as battle honour days:[14]\\r\\nSt Patrick's Day is also celebrated.\\r\\nCommonwealth\\r\\nNon-Commonwealth","input":"Where are the queen's royal hussars based?"},{"output":"cuisines belonging to various ethnic groups","context":"The cuisine of New York City comprises many cuisines belonging to various ethnic groups that have entered the United States through the city.

Mattathias killed a Hellenistic Jew who stepped forward to offer a sacrifice to an idol in Mattathias' place. He and his five sons fled to the wilderness of Judah. After Mattathias' death about one year later in 166?BC, his son Judah Maccabee led an army of Jewish dissidents to victory over the Seleucid dynasty in guerrilla warfare, which at first was directed against Hellenized Jews, of whom there were many. The Maccabees destroyed pagan altars in the villages, circumcised boys and forced Hellenized Jews into outlawry.[1] The term Maccabees as used to describe the Jewish army is taken from the Hebrew word for \\"hammer\\".[2]\\r\\nThe revolt itself involved many battles, in which the light, quick and mobile Maccabean forces gained notoriety among the slow and bulky Seleucid army, and also for their use of guerrilla tactics. After the victory, the Maccabees entered Jerusalem in triumph and ritually cleansed the Temple, reestablishing traditional Jewish worship there and installing Jonathan Maccabee as high priest. A large Seleucid army was sent to quash the revolt, but returned to Syria on the death of Antiochus IV. Its commander Lysias, preoccupied with internal Seleucid affairs, agreed to a political compromise that restored religious freedom.\\r\\nIn the First and Second Books of the Maccabees, the Maccabean Revolt is described as a response to cultural oppression and national resistance to a foreign power. Modern scholars, however, argue that the king intervened in a civil war between traditionalist Jews in the countryside and Hellenized Jews in Jerusalem.[3][4][5] As Joseph P. Schultz puts it:\\r\\n\\"Modern scholarship ... considers the Maccabean revolt less as an uprising against foreign oppression than as a civil war between the orthodox and reformist parties in the Jewish camp.\\"[6]\\r\\nProfessor John Ma of Oxford University argues that the main sources indicate that the loss of religious and civil rights by the Jews in 168 BC was not the result of religious persecution but rather an administrative punishment by the Seleucid Empire in the aftermath of local unrest, and that the Temple was restored upon petition by the High Priest Menelaus, not liberated and rededicated by the Maccabees. However, his theories are speculative.[7]\\r\\nThe Jewish festival of Hanukkah celebrates the re-dedication of the Temple following Judah Maccabee's victory over the Seleucids. According to Rabbinic tradition, the victorious Maccabees could only find a small jug of oil that had remained uncontaminated by virtue of a seal, and although it only contained enough oil to sustain the Menorah for one day, it miraculously lasted for eight days, by which time further oil could be procured.[8]\\r\\n Texts on Wikisource:","input":"What specific events led to the maccabean revolt?"},{"output":"the series premiered in May 2003","context":"America's Next Top Model (abbreviated ANTM and Top Model) is an American reality television series and interactive competition in which a number of aspiring models compete for the title of \\"America's Next Top Model\\" and a chance to begin their career in the modeling industry. Created and executive produced by Tyra Banks, the series premiered in May 2003, and was aired semiannually until 2012, then annually from 2013. The first six seasons (referred to as \\"cycles\\") were aired on UPN, before UPN merged The WB to create The CW in 2006. The following sixteen cycles were aired on The CW until the series was first cancelled in October 2015.[3] The series has since been revived, with cycle 23 currently airing on VH1. The series was among the highest-rated programs on UPN, and was the highest-rated show on The CW from 2007 to 2010.[4] Advertisers paid $61,315 per 30-second slot during the 2011ÿ12 television seasons, the highest of any series on The CW.[5]\\r\\nThe first twenty-two cycles of the series were presented by Banks, with cycle 23 being presented by Rita Ora. The series employs a panel of three or four judges. The original panel consisted of Banks, Janice Dickinson, Beau Quillian and Kimora Lee Simmons. Quillian and Simmons were replaced by Nigel Barker and Eric Nicholson in cycle 2, before Nicholson was replaced by Nol Marin in cycle 3. After cycle 4, Marin and Dickinson were replaced by J. Alexander and Twiggy in cycle 5. Paulina Porizkova joined the panel in cycle 10, in place of Twiggy. After cycle 12, Porizkova was fired by Banks and the panel was left with three judges (Banks, Alexander and Barker) in cycle 13. In cycle 14, Alexander left the panel and was replaced by Andr Leon Talley, but continued as the series' runway coach. In cycle 18, Kelly Cutrone replaced Talley. After cycle 18, Banks fired long-standing cast members Barker, Alexander and photo shoot director Jay Manuel. Barker was replaced by Rob Evans in cycle 19, and Manuel by Johnny Wujek. Alexander returned to the panel in cycle 21 in place of Evans, before the entire panel was replaced with Ora, Ashley Graham, Drew Elliott and Law Roach in cycle 23.[6] Ora will be replaced as presenter and judge by the returning Banks for the upcoming cycle 24.[7]\\r\\nCycles 1ÿ16 and cycle 19 each consisted of a cast of between 10 and 14 (13 or 14 from cycle 3 onwards) female contestants with no previous participation on the series. Cycle 17's cast consisted entirely of previous participants, while cycle 18's had seven new contestants and seven former Britain's Next Top Model participants, one of whom was the eventual winner, Sophie Sumner. Cycles 20ÿ22 featured male contestants in the contest, including two eventual winners (Keith Carlos in cycle 21 and Nyle DiMarco in cycle 22). Cycle 23 follows the series' original format of an all-new, all-female cast. As of March 2017[update], 23 people have won the competition: Adrianne Curry, Yoanna House, Eva Pigford, Naima Mora, Nicole Linkletter, Danielle Evans, CariDee English, Jaslene Gonzalez, Saleisha Stowers, Whitney Thompson, McKey Sullivan, Teyona Anderson, Nicole Fox, Krista White, Ann Ward, Brittani Kline, Lisa D'Amato, Sophie Sumner, Laura James, Jourdan Miller, Keith Carlos, Nyle DiMarco and India Gants. Winners typically receive a feature in a magazine and a contract with a modeling agency among other prizes.\\r\\nThe series is the originator of the international Top Model franchise. Over 30 versions of the series have been produced internationally.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was announced on January 24, 2006, that Top Model would be part of the new The CW network, a merge between UPN and The WB, when the seventh cycle started in September airing on Wednesdays. The series became the first series among regular programming to air on the network. Prior to the announcement of merging with The WB, UPN had committed to renewing the series through its ninth cycle on January 20, 2006,[8] for which casting was conducted throughout mid-2006. America's Next Top Model is the only show left on the network that was originally from UPN.\\r\\nOn July 21, 2006, the writers of America's Next Top Model went on strike while working on cycle 7, set to premiere on the new CW Network in September 2006. The writers sought representation through the Writers Guild of America, West, which would allow them regulated wages, access to portable health insurance, and pension benefits. These benefits would be similar to those given to writers on scripted shows. The strike was the focus of a large rally of Hollywood writers coinciding with the premiere of the new network on September 20, 2006.[9] The dispute was chronicled in a July 24 interview on the website Television Without Pity with Daniel J. Blau, a former recapper on the site who covered the series, and at the time was an America's Next Top Model show producer.[10] In November 2006, the writers on strike were taken off payroll.[11]\\r\\nTo celebrate its tenth cycle, America's Next Top Model aired a special installment called America's Next Top Model: Exposed in two parts on the CW on Wednesday, February 6 & 13, 2008. It reviewed the best cat fights, mishaps and most memorable photoshoots, personalities, defining moments and contained other segments about the show since cycles 1 to 9, and featured a special opening fusing all three openings together. Camille McDonald (cycles 2 and 17), Toccara Jones (cycle 3), Eva Pigford (cycle 3 winner), Bre Scullark (cycles 5 and 17), Cassandra Whitehead (cycle 5), Joanie Dodds (cycle 6), Jael Strauss (cycle 8), Dionne Walters (cycle 8), Heather Kuzmich (cycle 9), and Bianca Golden (cycles 9 and 17) all returned to comment on events that happened in their or other cycles.\\r\\nAfter announcing that the seventeenth season would be an All-Stars version, Banks said on The CW upfronts in May 2011, that there wouldn't be a \\"normal\\" season of the show anymore.[12] With the start of the eighteenth British Invasion cycle, the program converted to high definition, becoming the second-to-last primetime show on the five major English-language broadcast networks in the United States to make the switch, and the last to air in the regular season to do so.\\r\\nThe show is syndicated to NBCUniversal's cable division, with Oxygen as well as Style Network carrying the series, usually in marathon form throughout the daytime period on either network, and running through most of or an entire cycle. Bravo, MTV, and VH1 have also aired the series in the past. E! also currently airs reruns of ANTM.\\r\\nEach season of America's Next Top Model has from 9ÿ16 episodes and starts with 10ÿ16 contestants. Contestants are judged weekly on their overall appearance, participation in challenges, and best shot from that week's photo shoot; each episode, one contestant is eliminated, though in rare cases a double elimination or non-elimination was given by consensus of the judging panel. Makeovers are administered to contestants early in the season (usually after the first or second elimination in the finals) and a trip to an international destination is scheduled about two-thirds of the way through the season.\\r\\nThe series employs a panel of judges who critique contestants' progress throughout the competition. Throughout its broadcast, the program has employed thirteen judges. The original panel consisted of Banks (who also serves as its presenter), Janice Dickinson, Kimora Lee Simmons, and Beau Quillian. In the first eighteen cycles, an additional guest judge was welcomed to the panel each week. The recent lineup features Banks, Kelly Cutrone, and runway coach J. Alexander. For the nineteenth and twentieth cycles, public voting was represented on the panel by Bryanboy. Though not a judge, Jay Manuel served as the creative director during contestants' photo shoots for the first to eighteenth cycles. During the nineteenth and twentieth cycles, Johnny Wujek replaced Manuel as the creative director of all the shoots, and Yu Tsai replaced Wujek in the twenty-first and twenty-second cycles.[13]\\r\\nUpon the return of the series, the judging panel were revamped. For the 23rd cycle, Banks was replaced by British singer-model Rita Ora as the main judge and presenter, but still serves as its executive producer. She was joined by model Ashley Graham, Drew Elliott and runway coach/fashion expert Law Roach.\\r\\nThe first three cycles of America's Next Top Model were filmed in New York City, and was relocated back and forth in cycles 10, 12 and 14. Los Angeles has been the filming location of most of the cycles starting with the fourth cycle up until the 22nd cycle. New York City has filmed once again since the series' revival.\\r\\nAmerica's Next Top Model was also connected with Banks' talk show, on which several contestants have appeared, most notably Natasha Galkina (cycle 8), who worked as a correspondent for the show.[18] The show's stage was also used for the cycle 5 reunion show.\\r\\nIn 2008, Banks launched a new reality show inside the Tyra Show, called Modelville which featured past contestants Renee DeWitt (cycle 8), Bianca Golden (cycle 9), Dominique Reighard, Fatima Siad and Lauren Utter (all cycle 10) vying for a $50,000 contract with Carol's Daughter. The competition was ultimately won by Reighard.[19]\\r\\nThe ANTM franchise released a clothing and accessories line based on the television show, which is sold at most Walmart stores. It ranges from cosmetic products to handbags.[20] Dolls were also released based on the show that were made by MGA Entertainment.\\r\\nThe show has been referred to in many series, such as ABC Family's GREEK, CBS's The Big Bang Theory, and Fox's Family Guy. It also had its own E! True Hollywood Story episode, featuring past contestants Ebony Haith, Giselle Samson, Elyse Sewell (all cycle 1), Adrianne Curry (cycle 1 winner), Camille McDonald (cycles 2 & 17), April Wilkner, Mercedes Scelba-Shorte (both cycle 2), Toccara Jones, Ann Markley, Amanda Swafford (all cycle 3), Eva Pigford (cycle 3 winner), Michelle Deighton (cycle 4), Brittany Brower (cycles 4 & 17), Naima Mora (cycle 4 winner), Ebony Taylor (cycle 5), Lisa D'Amato (cycle 5 & cycle 17 winner), Kim Stolz (cycle 5) and Bre Scullark (cycles 5 & 17) as well as judges & personals Janice Dickinson, Tyra Banks, Nigel Barker, J. Alexander, Jay Manuel, Ken Mok and Michelle Mock-Falcon. It covered the first five cycles and recently re-aired with a few added minutes of footage which cover cycles 6 to 10 and Stylista.\\r\\nIn 2009, Oxygen Network aired a series based on the show called Top Model Obsessed, featuring past contestants Lisa D'Amato (cycle 5 & cycle 17 winner), CariDee English (cycle 7 winner) and Bianca Golden (cycle 9).[21]\\r\\nFor the 2006ÿ2009 and 2010ÿ2011 television seasons, America's Next Top Model was the No.1 show in average viewers on The CW.[22]\\r\\nYahoo!'s Shine lifestyle website said the show contained cruelty and elements of humiliation, and that some critiques from the judges are \\"really cruel and cringe-inducing\\", claiming that the show \\"humiliates and degrades young women.\\"[37] The site created the list \\"10 reasons why 'America's Next Top Model' is bad for women, humans\\", citing such things as giving the contestants and women viewers unrealistic visions of life as a model, and \\"always espousing empowerment and female strength and then forcing the contestants into embarrassing scenarios far outside the realm of real-life modeling\\". One such scenario highlighted was when cycle 12's final two contestants \\"were made to wear bikinis so skimpy that the producers had to blur out Allison Harvard's butt cheeks\\", and performed a \\"creepily sexual mud fight,\\" after which contestant and winner Teyona Anderson was \\"commended for taking her weave in her hand and whipping it around on the runway like a sexy feather boa.\\"[37]\\r\\nAllure magazine criticized the show in its October 2006 issue, saying that ANTM \\"hasn't exactly produced any actual supermodels.\\"[38]\\r\\nKen Mok and Banks noticed that most of cycle 8's girls were unusually heavy smokers. \\"Tyra and I understand the influence 'Top Model' has on a generation of young people, and we want to make sure we get the right message to our audience,\\" Mok said, which then prompted the \\"green\\" theme of cycle 9.[39]\\r\\nThe winner of cycle 9, Saleisha Stowers, was discovered to have been in a Wendy's commercial, on a catwalk in the cycle 6 show and an episode of Tyra Banks Show prior to her participation. The rules of the competition stated that a contestant must not have appeared as a model in a national campaign during the five years prior to the production of the cycle in which they participate. The CW network said she had revealed her role in the Wendy's commercial, and \\"after reviewing the commercial, it was determined that her appearance did not amount to 'modeling' experience, and therefore did not exclude her from participating in the show.\\"[40]\\r\\nAfter filming cycle 10, the producers of America's Next Top Model were served with a lawsuit from Michael Marvisi, the owner of the loft used as the Top Model house. The lawsuit claimed that the contestants as well as the production crew caused an estimated $500,000 in damages to the loft. Marvisi claims the contestants engaged in food fights, made holes in the walls, caused water damage to the bathroom, damaged a $15,000 chandelier beyond repair, and caused $90,000 worth of damage to an electrical store. Also, the production crew was accused of damaging the flooring and making holes in the ceiling for lighting equipment.[41]\\r\\nAmerica's Next Top Model is currently shown on TV internationally in 170 countries and regions, namely: Australia, the United Kingdom, Japan, Hong Kong, Macau, Taiwan and the whole of Southeast Asia (except Timor-Leste).

The proposed show would have starred ANTM creative director Jay Manuel and runway coach Mrs. J. Alexander as they travel the country to provide makeovers to everyday women. Tyra Banks and Ken Mok would have served as executive producers for the new show. However, The CW ultimately declined to pick up the show.[44]\\r\\nUntil 2012, only cycle 1 had been released domestically on DVD. This is because the home video license was formerly held by UPN, and was distributed for them by Paramount Home Entertainment. Since the series is now independently produced, the video rights to the remaining seasons have, until recently, been open for acquisition (and therefore, the remaining seasons had yet to be issued on DVD or Blu-ray). However, on May 30, it was announced on the CW that cycles 2 and 3 were available to pre-order on DVD via new licensee CBS Home Entertainment. They are now available for purchase on Amazon.com\\r\\nFor cycle 1, Revlon sponsored this show with the products and prizes. For cycle 2, Sephora replaced Revlon as the commercial sponsor. Through cycles 3-18, CoverGirl replaced Sephora as the continuation on products and prizes. For cycle 19, shoe retailer Nine West and Smashbox sponsored with campaigns, but the cosmetics sponsorship has ended. For cycle 20, Guess sponsored with a US$100,000 ad campaign for the winner.\\r\\n Media related to America's Next Top Model at Wikimedia Commons","input":"When did america's next top model first air?"},{"output":"near Dubbo, New South Wales, Australia","context":"Taronga Western Plains Zoo, formerly known as (and still commonly referred to as) Western Plains Zoo and commonly known as Dubbo Zoo, is a large zoo near Dubbo, New South Wales, Australia. It opened to the public on 28 February 1977,[1] to provide more living and breeding space for large animals such as elephants and antelopes which needed more space than was available at the restricted Sydney site. The zoo is run by the Taronga Conservation Society (formerly Zoological Parks Board of New South Wales), along with Taronga Zoo Sydney. Western Plains Zoo is located on the Newell Highway in west Dubbo about 4?km from the city.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the late 1960s, plans to develop a large plains zoo to complement Sydneys Taronga Zoo were established. The new zoo would provide breeding facilities particularly suited to the large plains dwelling animals and to fulfil a need for an open range facility for the display of mainly grazing animals. After considerable planning and preparation, a site on the outskirts of Dubbo in central West New South Wales was chosen. Formerly an army camp during World War Two, the site was transformed into a 300 hectare zoo of woodland and irrigated grasslands.\\r\\nWestern Plains Zoo opened to the public on 28 February 1977. When the zoo opened, it contained 35 different animals from six countries. The zoo is an open-range design, with walls and fences replaced by concealed moats which divide the animals from the visitors. This creates the impression of actually being with the animals in the wild.
