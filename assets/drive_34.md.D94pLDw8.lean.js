Hypercomplex cells are responsive to shapes with well-defined corners."},{"question":"According to the opponent process theory, what happens when red and green receptors are stimulated at the same time?","answer":"When red and green receptors are stimulated at the same time, they produce opposite responses. The red receptor will send a signal indicating the presence of red, while the green receptor will send a signal indicating the presence of green. The brain then interprets this opposing information as yellow."},{"question":"According to the trichromatic theory, what causes color blindness?","answer":"Color blindness is caused by a genetic defect that affects one or more of the three types of color receptors in the retina, resulting in an inability to perceive certain colors."},{"question":"According to Hubel and Wiesel's research on receptive fields, what happens when a bar of light is presented to a receptive field of a visual neuron?","answer":"When a bar of light is presented to a receptive field of a visual neuron, it will respond selectively to specific features of the bar, such as its orientation, location, and size. This process is essential for the encoding of visual information in the brain."},{"question":"According to the visual cliff experiment, why do infants hesitate to crawl over the cliff edge?","answer":"Infants hesitate to crawl over the cliff edge in the visual cliff experiment because they perceive the drop as a danger signal, indicating a potential for harm. This response suggests that depth perception is an innate ability in humans."},{"question":"According to the opponent process theory, what causes the color afterimage effect?","answer":"The color afterimage effect is caused by the opponent processing of color signals in the retina, where the stimulation of one color causes the inhibition of its opponent color. When the stimulus is removed, there is a residual activation of the opponent color system, resulting in a color afterimage."},{"question":"According to the model of parallel processing, how is information processed in the visual system?","answer":"According to the model of parallel processing, information is processed in the visual system through the simultaneous activity of multiple processing pathways, each dedicated to a different aspect of the visual scene, such as color, form, depth, and motion."},{"question":"According to the dual-process theory, what process is involved in automatic processing?","answer":"Automatic processing is characterized by speedy, effortless, and unconscious processing of sensory information.

Justification of effort is a phenomenon where people increase their sense of value or commitment towards a goal or group as a result of having undergone a difficult initiation process."},{"question":"Why is cognitive dissonance more likely to occur in situations where attitudes or beliefs are freely chosen?","answer":"Cognitive dissonance is more likely to occur in situations where attitudes or beliefs are freely chosen because people tend to feel a greater sense of responsibility and ownership for their choices. This makes inconsistencies in beliefs, attitudes, or behaviours more discomforting, and motivates people to reduce the dissonance."},{"question":"What is the difference between consonant and dissonant cognitions?","answer":"Consonant cognitions are beliefs or attitudes that are consistent with each other, while dissonant cognitions are beliefs or attitudes that are inconsistent with each other. Resolving dissonance involves changing one or more of the dissonant cognitions to create consonance."},{"question":"How does the existence of cognitive dissonance affect attitudes and persuasion?","answer":"The existence of cognitive dissonance suggests that people may not always make rational decisions based on their attitudes or beliefs, but may instead make choices that reduce psychological discomfort. This means that attitudes and beliefs can be influenced by factors such as effort justification or confirmation bias."},{"question":"Why might individuals not always change their behaviour to reduce dissonance?","answer":"Individuals may not always change their behaviour to reduce dissonance because there may be factors that prevent them from doing so, such as social norms, situational constraints, or a lack of alternative options. In some cases, people may instead change their beliefs or attitudes to achieve cognitive consistency."},{"question":"How can cognitive dissonance be measured in research?","answer":"Cognitive dissonance can be measured using various methods such as self-report measures, behavioural observation, or physiological measures such as heart rate or skin conductance. Researchers may also use manipulations of dissonance-inducing situations to observe changes in behaviour or attitudes."},{"question":"What is the role of cognitive consistency in cognitive dissonance theory?","answer":"Cognitive consistency is the principle that humans strive to maintain a degree of harmony among their beliefs, attitudes, and behaviours. Cognitive dissonance theory suggests that when inconsistencies arise, people are motivated to restore cognitive consistency to reduce the discomfort caused by cognitive dissonance."},{"question":"How does cognitive dissonance theory explain why people may change their attitudes?","answer":"Cognitive dissonance theory suggests that when people experience cognitive dissonance, they may change their attitudes to reduce the inconsistency and discomfort. This change in attitude can happen even if it contradicts previous beliefs or attitudes, as people are motivated to achieve cognitive consistency."},{"question":"What is the role of self-justification in cognitive dissonance?","answer":"Self-justification is the process through which individuals create rationalizations or justifications for their behaviour or decisions. In cognitive dissonance theory, self-justification is a way of reducing the discomfort caused by inconsistencies between behaviour and beliefs or attitudes."},{"question":"Why might people choose to engage in counter-attitudinal behaviour?","answer":"People may choose to engage in counter-attitudinal behaviour because they may receive some reward or benefit for doing so, such as acceptance by a group. In such situations, cognitive dissonance can arise if the behaviour contradicts existing beliefs or attitudes."},{"question":"What is the difference between a forced compliance attitude change and a free choice attitude change?","answer":"A forced compliance attitude change is a change in attitude that occurs when an individual is forced to behave in a way that is inconsistent with their true attitudes or beliefs. A free choice attitude change occurs when an individual freely chooses to engage in a behaviour that contradicts their existing attitudes or beliefs."},{"question":"How does cognitive dissonance apply to the phenomenon of rationalisation?","answer":"In the context of cognitive dissonance, rationalisation is the process of making illogical or irrational arguments to justify one's behaviour or beliefs. This is a way of reducing the discomfort caused by cognitive dissonance by finding reasons to support one's choices."},{"question":"What is the role of cognitive dissonance in the development of cults?","answer":"Cognitive dissonance can play a role in the development of cults by creating a sense of psychological discomfort in individuals who are not fully aligned with the group's beliefs or behaviours. This discomfort can motivate people to reduce the dissonance by accepting the group's ideology and conforming to its norms."},{"question":"What is cognitive dissonance theory?","answer":"Cognitive dissonance theory suggests that individuals experience psychological discomfort when their beliefs, attitudes, or behaviours are inconsistent with each other. This discomfort motivates people to reduce the inconsistency by modifying their beliefs, attitudes, or behaviours."},{"question":"How does cognitive dissonance theory explain post-decision regret?","answer":"Cognitive dissonance theory suggests that after making a decision, individuals may experience psychological discomfort if they have doubts about whether they made the right decision. This discomfort motivates people to reduce the dissonance by justifying their decision and finding reasons to support it."},{"question":"How does cognitive dissonance theory explain the effects of effort justification?","answer":"Cognitive dissonance theory suggests that when individuals put in a lot of effort towards a goal, they experience cognitive dissonance if the goal turns out to be less valuable or enjoyable than expected. This discomfort motivates people to reduce the dissonance by exaggerating the value of the goal and finding reasons to justify the effort put in."},{"question":"What is the role of self-perception theory in cognitive dissonance?","answer":"Self-perception theory suggests that when people are unsure about their attitudes or beliefs, they may look to their behaviours as a cue for their inner states. This means that people may infer their attitudes and beliefs based on their behaviours, which can create cognitive consistency without the need for dissonance reduction."},{"question":"Why is cognitive dissonance considered a motivational state rather than a cognitive state?","answer":"Cognitive dissonance is considered a motivational state because it involves the desire to reduce psychological discomfort, which motivates people to change their beliefs, attitudes, or behaviours. This motivation leads to behaviour change, which is not a purely cognitive process."},{"question":"How does selective exposure relate to cognitive dissonance?","answer":"Selective exposure is a phenomenon where people actively seek out information or views that confirm their existing beliefs or attitudes, and avoid information that contradicts them.
