A continuing resolution continues the pre-existing appropriations at the same levels as the previous fiscal year ( or with minor modifications ) for a set amount of time . Continuing resolutions typically provide funding at a rate or formula based on the previous year 's funding . The funding extends until a specific date or regular appropriations bills are passed , whichever comes first . There can be some changes to some of the accounts in a continuing resolution . The continuing resolution takes the form of a joint resolution , and may provide bridging funding for existing federal programs at current , reduced , or expanded levels ."},{"query":"when was the last time the bears won the superbowl","short_answer":"1985","abstract":""},{"query":"who were the opposing sides in the french revolution","short_answer":"","abstract":""},{"query":"a sentence of 1 to 15 years is an example of a determinate sentence","short_answer":"","abstract":"Sentencing in England and Wales refers to a bench of magistrates or district judge in a Magistrate 's Court or a judge in a Crown Court passing sentence on a person found guilty of a criminal offence .

It is produced artificially in nuclear reactors . Deliberate industrial production depends on neutron activation of bulk samples of the monoisotopic and mononuclidic cobalt isotope Co . Measurable quantities are also produced as a by - product of typical nuclear power plant operation and may be detected externally when leaks occur . In the latter case ( in the absence of added cobalt ) the incidentally produced Co is largely the result of multiple stages of neutron activation of iron isotopes in the reactor 's steel structures via the creation of Co precursor . The simplest case of the latter would result from the activation of Fe . Co decays by beta decay to the stable isotope nickel - 60 ( Ni ) . The activated nickel nucleus emits two gamma rays with energies of 1.17 and 1.33 MeV , hence the overall nuclear equation of the reaction is Co + n → Co → Ni + e + ν + gamma rays ."},{"query":"what is the shortest version of the bible","short_answer":"","abstract":"\`\` Jesus wept '' ( Greek : ἐδάκρυσεν ὁ Ἰησοῦς , edákrysen o Iesoús lit . \`\` Jesus shed tears '' ) is a phrase famous for being the shortest verse in the King James Version of the Bible , as well as many other versions .

They are tyrosine - based hormones that are primarily responsible for regulation of metabolism . T and T are partially composed of iodine . A deficiency of iodine leads to decreased production of T and T , enlarges the thyroid tissue and will cause the disease known as simple goitre . The major form of thyroid hormone in the blood is thyroxine ( T ) , which has a longer half - life than T. In humans , the ratio of T to T released into the blood is sometimes claimed to be quite high , but thyroid removal patient data suggests it to vary between 4 : 1 to 2 : 1 , the average being 100 : 36 ( roughly 2.8 : 1 ) . T is converted to the active T ( three to four times more potent than T ) within cells by deiodinases ( 5 ' - iodinase ) . These are further processed by decarboxylation and deiodination to produce iodothyronamine ( T a ) and thyronamine ( T a ) .

It is also less commonly known as a balanced parliament or a legislature under no overall control . If the legislature is bicameral , and the government is responsible only to the lower house , then \`\` hung parliament '' is used only with respect to that chamber . It is the objective of parliamentary systems for the parliament to be able to form a stable government , preferably one that lasts until the next election . This requires the government to be able to muster up sufficient votes in parliament to pass important legislation , especially the government 's budget . It also needs sufficient votes to defeat votes of no - confidence in the government . If the state of the parliament is such that a majority government can not be formed , the government may be referred to as a \`\` minority government '' . The term hung parliament is used mainly in systems with two parties or two party blocs . Most general elections in such a system will result in one or other party having an absolute majority and thus quickly forming a new government ; a \`\` hung parliament '' is an exception to this pattern , and may by some be considered anomalous or undesirable , and by others ideal as it blocks the dangers of absolute power . One or both main parties may seek to form a coalition government with smaller third parties , or a minority government relying on confidence and supply support from third parties or independents . If these efforts fail , a dissolution of parliament and a fresh election may be the last resort ."},{"query":"so u think u can dance india episodes","short_answer":"","abstract":""},{"query":"who's opening for janet jackson state of the world tour","short_answer":"","abstract":""},{"query":"the moral of the story of the lion and the mouse","short_answer":"that mercy brings its reward and that there is no being so small that it can not help a greater","abstract":"The Lion and the Mouse is one of Aesop 's Fables , numbered 150 in the Perry Index .

As a larger volume of blood flows into the ventricle , the blood stretches the cardiac muscle fibers , leading to an increase in the force of contraction . The Frank - Starling mechanism allows the cardiac output to be synchronized with the venous return , arterial blood supply and humoral length , without depending upon external regulation to make alterations .

With insufficient understanding of the ecology of the plains , farmers had conducted extensive deep plowing of the virgin topsoil of the Great Plains during the previous decade ; this had displaced the native , deep - rooted grasses that normally trapped soil and moisture even during periods of drought and high winds .

In such methods , each of the neural network 's weights receives an update proportional to the partial derivative of the error function with respect to the current weight in each iteration of training . The problem is that in some cases , the gradient will be vanishingly small , effectively preventing the weight from changing its value . In the worst case , this may completely stop the neural network from further training . As one example of the problem cause , traditional activation functions such as the hyperbolic tangent function have gradients in the range ( 0 , 1 ) , and backpropagation computes gradients by the chain rule . This has the effect of multiplying n of these small numbers to compute gradients of the \`\` front '' layers in an n - layer network , meaning that the gradient ( error signal ) decreases exponentially with n while the front layers train very slowly ."},{"query":"what is the name of west bengal rajyapal","short_answer":"","abstract":"The Governor of West Bengal is the constitutional head of the West Bengal government ."},{"query":"athletics at the 1972 summer olympics men's 800 metres","short_answer":"","abstract":"The men 's 800 metres at the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich , West Germany took place on September 2 , 1972 ."},{"query":"how did the new deal change the course of history for the united states","short_answer":"","abstract":"The New Deal was a series of federal programs , public work projects , financial reforms and regulations enacted in the United States during the 1930s in response to the Great Depression .

Most programs were enacted between 1933 -- 1938 , though some were later . They included both laws passed by Congress as well as presidential executive orders , most during the first term of the presidency of Franklin D. Roosevelt . The programs focused on what historians refer to as the \`\` 3 Rs '' : relief for the unemployed and poor , recovery of the economy back to normal levels and reform of the financial system to prevent a repeat depression . The New Deal produced a political realignment , making the Democratic Party the majority ( as well as the party that held the White House for seven out of the nine presidential terms from 1933 -- 1969 ) with its base in liberal ideas , the South , traditional Democrats , big city machines and the newly empowered labor unions and ethnic minorities . The Republicans were split , with conservatives opposing the entire New Deal as an alleged enemy of business and growth and liberals accepting some of it and promising to make it more efficient .

The concept of the common good differs significantly among philosophical doctrines . Early conceptions of the common good were set out by Ancient Greek philosophers , including Aristotle and Plato . One understanding of the common good rooted in Aristotle 's philosophy remains in common usage today , referring to what one contemporary scholar calls the \`\` good proper to , and attainable only by , the community , yet individually shared by its members . '' The concept of common good developed through the work of political theorists , moral philosophers , and public economists , including Thomas Aquinas , Niccolò Machiavelli , John Locke , Jean - Jacques Rousseau , James Madison , Adam Smith , Karl Marx , John Stuart Mill , John Rawls , and many other thinkers . In contemporary economic theory , a common good is any good which is rivalrous yet non-excludable , while the common good , by contrast , arises in the subfield of welfare economics and refers to the outcome of a social welfare function . Such a social welfare function , in turn , would be rooted in a moral theory of the good ( such as utilitarianism ) . Social choice theory aims to understand processes by which the common good may or may not be realized in societies through the study of collective decision rules . And public choice theory applies microeconomic methodology to the study of political science in order to explain how private interests affect political activities and outcomes ."},{"query":"the office episode jim and pam's first date","short_answer":"","abstract":"\`\` The Dundies '' is the first episode of the second season of the American comedy television series The Office , and the show 's seventh episode overall .

The empire was developed as the Roman Republic invaded and occupied most of Europe and portions of northern Africa and western Asia . Under the republic , regions of the empire were ruled by provincial governors answerable to and authorised by the \`\` Senate and People of Rome '' . Rome and its senate were ruled by a variety of magistrates -- of whom the consuls were the most powerful . The republic ended , and the emperors were created , when these magistrates became legally and practically subservient to one citizen with power over all other magistrates . Augustus , the first emperor , was careful to maintain the façade of republican rule , taking no specific title for his position and calling the concentration of magisterial power princeps senatus ( the first man of the senate ) . This style of government lasted for 300 years , and is thus called the Principate . The modern word ' emperor ' derives from the title imperator , which was granted by an army to a successful general ; during the initial phase of the empire , it still had to be earned by the princeps . The term emperor is a modern construction , used when describing rulers of the Roman Empire because it emphasises the strong links between the ruler and the army ( on whose support the ruler 's power depended ) , and does not discriminate between the personal styles of rule and titles in different phases of the Empire ."},{"query":"off west coast of northern sumatra earthquake 2004","short_answer":"","abstract":"The 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake occurred at 00 : 58 : 53 UTC on 26 December with the epicentre off the west coast of Sumatra , Indonesia .

It can also be described as the unit revenue the last item sold has generated for the firm . In a perfectly competitive market , the additional revenue generated by selling an additional unit of a good is equal to the price the firm is able to charge the buyer of the good . This is because a firm in a competitive market will always get the same price for every unit it sells regardless of the number of units the firm sells since the firm 's sales can never impact the industry 's price .

Cell division usually occurs as part of a larger cell cycle . In eukaryotes , there are two distinct types of cell division : a vegetative division , whereby each daughter cell is genetically identical to the parent cell ( mitosis ) , and a reproductive cell division , whereby the number of chromosomes in the daughter cells is reduced by half to produce haploid gametes ( meiosis ) . Meiosis results in four haploid daughter cells by undergoing one round of DNA replication followed by two divisions . Homologous chromosomes are separated in the first division , and sister chromatids are separated in the second division . Both of these cell division cycles are used in the process of sexual reproduction at some point in their life cycle . Both are believed to be present in the last eukaryotic common ancestor . Prokaryotes undergo a vegetative cell division known as binary fission , where their genetic material is segregated equally into two daughter cells .

The higher the octane number , the more compression the fuel can withstand before detonating ( igniting ) . In broad terms , fuels with a higher octane rating are used in high performance gasoline engines that require higher compression ratios . In contrast , fuels with lower octane numbers ( but higher cetane numbers ) are ideal for diesel engines , because diesel engines ( also referred to as compression - ignition engines ) do not compress the fuel , but rather compress only air and then inject fuel into the air which was heated by compression . Gasoline engines rely on ignition of air and fuel compressed together as a mixture , which is ignited at the end of the compression stroke using spark plugs . Therefore , high compressibility of the fuel matters mainly for gasoline engines . Use of gasoline with lower octane numbers may lead to the problem of engine knocking ."},{"query":"harrow on the hill to northwick park station","short_answer":"","abstract":"Northwick Park is a London Underground station in Northwick Park in the London Borough of Brent on the Metropolitan line .

It can also be described as the unit revenue the last item sold has generated for the firm . In a perfectly competitive market , the additional revenue generated by selling an additional unit of a good is equal to the price the firm is able to charge the buyer of the good . This is because a firm in a competitive market will always get the same price for every unit it sells regardless of the number of units the firm sells since the firm 's sales can never impact the industry 's price . However , a monopoly determines the entire industry 's sales . As a result , it will have to lower the price of all units sold to increase sales by 1 unit . Therefore , the marginal revenue generated is always lower than the price the firm is able to charge for the unit sold , since each reduction in price causes unit revenue to decline on every good the firm sells . The marginal revenue ( the increase in total revenue ) is the price the firm gets on the additional unit sold , less the revenue lost by reducing the price on all other units that were sold prior to the decrease in price ."},{"query":"identify and discuss the market structure under which tnt express operates","short_answer":"","abstract":"TNT Express is an international courier delivery services company , now a subsidiary of FedEx but originally with headquarters in Hoofddorp , Netherlands .

A rift valley is formed on a divergent plate boundary , a crustal extension , a spreading apart of the surface , which is subsequently further deepened by the forces of erosion . When the tensional forces were strong enough to cause the plate to split apart , a center block dropped between the two blocks at its flanks , forming a graben . The drop of the center creates the nearly parallel steeply dipping walls of a rift valley when it is new . That feature is the beginning of the rift valley , but as the process continues , the valley widens , until it becomes a large basin that fills with sediment from the rift walls and the surrounding area . One of the best known examples of this process is the East African Rift . On Earth , rifts can occur at all elevations , from the sea floor to plateaus and mountain ranges in continental crust or in oceanic crust . They are often associated with a number of adjoining subsidiary or co-extensive valleys , which are typically considered part of the principal rift valley geologically ."},{"query":"political map of india with states and union territories","short_answer":"","abstract":"India is a federal union comprising twenty - nine states and seven union territories , for a total of 36 states and union territories .

Prison building efforts in the United States came in three major waves . The first began during the Jacksonian Era and led to widespread use of imprisonment and rehabilitative labor as the primary penalty for most crimes in nearly all states by the time of the American Civil War . The second began after the Civil War and gained momentum during the Progressive Era , bringing a number of new mechanisms -- such as parole , probation , and indeterminate sentencing -- into the mainstream of American penal practice . Finally , since the early 1970s , the United States has engaged in a historically unprecedented expansion of its imprisonment systems at both the federal and state level . Since 1973 , the number of incarcerated persons in the United States has increased five-fold , and in a given year 7,000,000 people were under the supervision or control of correctional services in the United States .

The PNS consists of the nerves and ganglia outside the brain and spinal cord . The main function of the PNS is to connect the CNS to the limbs and organs , essentially serving as a relay between the brain and spinal cord and the rest of the body .

The peripheral nervous system is divided into the somatic nervous system and the autonomic nervous system . In the somatic nervous system , the cranial nerves are part of the PNS with the exception of the optic nerve ( cranial nerve II ) , along with the retina . The second cranial nerve is not a true peripheral nerve but a tract of the diencephalon . Cranial nerve ganglia originated in the CNS . However , the remaining ten cranial nerve axons extend beyond the brain and are therefore considered part of the PNS . The autonomic nervous system is an involuntary control of smooth muscle and glands .
