Cilia are slender protuberances that project from the much larger cell body.[2] Cilium can measure up to 20 m and have a diameter around 0.25 m. [3]\\r\\nThere are two types of cilia: motile cilia and nonmotile, or primary cilia, which typically serve as sensory organelles. In eukaryotes, motile cilia and flagella together make up a group of organelles known as undulipodia.[4] Eukaryotic cilia are structurally identical to eukaryotic flagella, although distinctions are sometimes made according to function and/or length.[5] Biologists have various ideas about how the various flagella may have evolved.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCilia can be divided into primary and motile forms.[6]\\r\\nIn animals, primary cilia are found on nearly every cell.[2]\\r\\nIn comparison to motile cilia, non-motile (or primary) cilia usually occur one per cell; nearly all mammalian cells have a single non-motile primary cilium. In addition, examples of specialized primary cilia can be found in human sensory organs such as the eye and the nose:\\r\\nAlthough the primary cilium was discovered in 1898, it was largely ignored for a century. Only recently has great progress been made in understanding the function of the primary cilium. Until the 1990s, the prevailing view of the primary cilium was that it was merely a vestigial organelle without important function.[2] Recent findings regarding its physiological roles in chemical sensation, signal transduction, and control of cell growth, have led scientists to acknowledge its importance in cell function, with the discovery of its role in diseases not previously recognized to involve the dysgenesis and dysfunction of cilia, such as polycystic kidney disease,[8] congenital heart disease,[9] and an emerging group of genetic ciliopathies.[10] The primary cilium is now known to play an important role in the function of many human organs.[2] The current scientific understanding of primary cilia views them as \\"sensory cellular antennae that coordinate a large number of cellular signaling pathways, sometimes coupling the signaling to ciliary motility or alternatively to cell division and differentiation.\\".[11]\\r\\nLarger eukaryotes, such as mammals, have motile cilia as well. Motile cilia are usually present on a cell's surface in large numbers and beat in coordinated waves.[12]\\r\\nThe functioning of motile cilia is strongly dependent on the maintenance of optimal levels of fluid bathing the cilia. Epithelial sodium channels ENaC that are specifically expressed along the entire length of cilia apparently serve as sensors that regulate fluid level surrounding the cilia.[13][15]\\r\\nCiliates are microscopic organisms that possess motile cilia exclusively and use them for either locomotion or to simply move liquid over their surface.\\r\\nInside cilia and flagella is a microtubule-based cytoskeleton called the axoneme. The axoneme of primary cilia typically has a ring of nine outer microtubule doublets (called a 9+0 axoneme), and the axoneme of a motile cilium has two central microtubule singlets in addition to the nine outer doublets (called a 9+2 axoneme). The axonemal cytoskeleton acts as a scaffolding for various protein complexes and provides binding sites for molecular motor proteins such as kinesin II, that help carry proteins up and down the microtubules.[2][16][17]\\r\\nThe dynein in the axoneme forms bridges between neighbouring microtubule doublets. When ATP activates the motor domain of dynein, it attempts to walk along the adjoining microtubule doublet. This would force the adjacent doublets to slide over one another if not for the presence of Nexin between the microtubule doublets. And thus the force generated by dyenin is instead converted into a bending motion.[18]\\r\\nCilia are formed through the process of ciliogenesis. The building blocks of the cilia such as tubulins and other partially assembled axonemal proteins are added to the ciliary tips which point away from the cell body.[19] In most species bi-directional motility called intraflagellar transport (IFT) plays an essential role in moving these building materials from the cell body to the assembly site.[20] IFT also carries the disassembled material to be recycled from the ciliary tip back to the cell body. By regulating the equilibrium between these two IFT processes, the length of cilia can be maintained dynamically. Disassembly of cilia requires the action of the Aurora A kinase .[21]\\r\\nExceptions where IFT is not present include Plasmodium falciparum, which is one of the species of Plasmodium that cause malaria in humans. In this parasite, cilia assemble in the cytoplasm.[22]\\r\\nAt the base of the cilium where it attaches to the cell body is the microtubule organizing center, the basal body. Some basal body proteins as CEP164, ODF2 [23] and CEP170,[24] regulate the formation and the stability of the cilium. A transition zone between the basal body and the axoneme \\"serves as a docking station for intraflagellar transport and motor proteins.\\"[2]\\r\\nIn effect, the cilium is a nanomachine composed of perhaps over 600 proteins in molecular complexes, many of which also function independently as nanomachines.[11]\\r\\nThe ciliary rootlet is a cytoskeleton-like structure that originates from the basal body at the proximal end of a cilium. It extends proximally toward the cell nucleus. Rootlets are typically 80-100?nm in diameter and contain cross striae distributed at regular intervals of approximately 55-70?nm. According to the Gene Ontology, the following proteins localize to the ciliary rootlet: amyloid precursor protein, rootletin, kinesins (KIF5B, KIF5C, KLC2, KLC3), and presenilins (PSEN1, PSEN2).[25]\\r\\nSome primary cilia on epithelial cells in eukaryotes act as cellular antennae, providing chemosensation, thermosensation and mechanosensation of the extracellular environment.[26] These cilia then play a role in mediating specific signalling cues, including soluble factors in the external cell environment, a secretory role in which a soluble protein is released to have an effect downstream of the fluid flow, and mediation of fluid flow if the cilia are motile.[26] Some epithelial cells are ciliated, and they commonly exist as a sheet of polarized cells forming a tube or tubule with cilia projecting into the lumen. This sensory and signalling role puts cilia in a central role for maintaining the local cellular environment and may be why ciliary defects cause such a wide range of human diseases.[27]\\r\\nCiliary defects can lead to a number of human diseases. Genetic mutations compromising the proper functioning of cilia, ciliopathies, can cause chronic disorders such as primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), nephronophthisis or Senior-Loken syndrome. In addition, a defect of the primary cilium in the renal tube cells can lead to polycystic kidney disease (PKD). In another genetic disorder called Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS), the mutant gene products are the components in the basal body and cilia.[10]\\r\\nLack of functional cilia in female Fallopian tubes can cause ectopic pregnancy. A fertilized ovum may not reach the uterus if the cilia are unable to move it there. In such a case, the ovum will implant in the Fallopian tubes, causing a tubal pregnancy, the most common form of ectopic pregnancy.[28]\\r\\nAs noted above, epithelial sodium channels ENaC that are expressed along the length of cilia regulate fluid level surrounding the cilia. Mutations that decrease the activity of ENaC result in multisystem pseudohypoaldosteronism, that is associated with fertility problems.[13] In cystic fibrosis that results from mutations in the chloride channel CFTR, ENaC activity is enhanced leading to a severe reduction of the fluid level that causes complications and infections in the respiratory airways.[15]\\r\\nSince the flagellum of human sperm is actually a modified cilium, ciliary dysfunction can also be responsible for male infertility.[29]\\r\\nOf interest, there is an association of primary ciliary dyskinesia with left-right anatomic abnormalities such as situs inversus (a combination of findings known as Kartagener's syndrome) and other heterotaxic defects. These left-right anatomic abnormalities can also result in congenital heart disease.[30] It has been shown that proper cilial function is responsible for the normal left-right asymmetry in mammals.[31]\\r\\nRecent findings in genetic research have suggested that a large number of genetic disorders, both genetic syndromes and genetic diseases, that were not previously related in the medical literature, may be, in fact, highly related in the root cause of the widely varying set of medical symptoms that are clinically visible in the disorder. These have been grouped as an emerging class of diseases called ciliopathies. The underlying cause may be a dysfunctional molecular mechanism in the primary/immotile cilia, organelles which are present in many diverse cellular types throughout the human body. Cilia defects adversely affect numerous critical developmental signaling pathways essential to cellular development and thus offer a plausible hypothesis for the often multi-symptom nature of a large set of syndromes and diseases.[10] Known ciliopathies include primary ciliary dyskinesia, Bardet-Biedl syndrome, polycystic kidney and liver disease, nephronophthisis, Alstrom syndrome, Meckel-Gruber syndrome, Sensenbrenner syndrome and some forms of retinal degeneration.[10][26]","context":"What type of cells have cilia and flagella?"},{"output":"Gulf of Mexico","context":"Corpus Christi (/?k??rp?s ?kr?sti/), colloquially Corpus (Latin: Body of Christ), is a coastal city in the South Texas region of the U.S. state of Texas. The county seat of Nueces County,[6] it also extends into Aransas, Kleberg, and San Patricio Counties. It is 130 miles southeast of San Antonio. Its political boundaries encompass Nueces Bay and Corpus Christi Bay. Its zoned boundaries include small land parcels or water inlets of three neighboring counties.\\r\\nThe city's population was estimated to be 320,434 in 2014, making it the eighth-most populous city in Texas. The Corpus Christi metropolitan area had an estimated population of 442,600.[1] It is also the hub of the six-county Corpus Christi-Kingsville-Alice Combined Statistical Area, with a 2013 estimated population of 516,793. The Port of Corpus Christi is the fifth-largest in the United States. The region is served by the Corpus Christi International Airport.\\r\\nThe city's name means Body of Christ in Latin. The name was given to the settlement and surrounding bay by Spanish explorer Alonso lvarez de Pineda in 1519, as he discovered the lush semitropical bay on the Catholic feast day of Corpus Christi. The city's nickname is \\"Sparkling City by the Sea\\", particularly featured in tourist literature.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCorpus Christi was founded in 1839 by Colonel Henry Lawrence Kinney and William P. Aubrey as Kinney's Trading Post, or Kinney's Ranch. It was a small trading post that sold supplies to a Mexican revolutionary army camped about 25?mi (40?km) west.[8] In July 1845, U.S. troops commanded by General Zachary Taylor set up camp there in preparation for war with Mexico, where they remained until March 1846. About a year later, the settlement was named Corpus Christi and was incorporated on 9 September 1852.[9]\\r\\nThe Battle of Corpus Christi was fought between August 12 and August 18, 1862, during the American Civil War. United States Navy forces blockading Texas fought a small land and sea engagement with Confederate forces in and around Corpus Christi Bay and bombarded the city. Union forces defeated Confederate States Navy ships operating in the area, but were repulsed when they landed on the coast.[10]\\r\\nThe Port of Corpus Christi was opened in 1926, and the Corpus Christi Naval Air Station was commissioned in 1941.[8]\\r\\nThe 1919 Storm devastated the city, killing hundreds on September 14. Only three structures survived the storm on North Beach.[11] To protect the city, the seawall was built. The city also suffered damage from Hurricane Celia in 1970 and Hurricane Allen in 1980, but little damage from Hurricane Ike in 2008. The city was impacted in 2017 by Hurricane Harvey.\\r\\nCorpus Christi is situated on fluvial deposits that are of Holocene ÿ Pleistocene age. Although no solidified rock occurs naturally,[14] the Deweyville Formation of sand, silt, clay, and gravel, is locally indurated with calcium carbonate (caliche) deposits. The large, shallow bay makes Corpus Christi an Ideal feeding place for birds and this is one reason why Corpus Christi is known as the \\"Bird Capital\\" of North America. Consequently, the San Diego Audubon Society has designated Corpus Christi as \\"America's birdiest place.\\"[15]\\r\\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, Corpus Christi has a total area of 460.2 square miles (1,192.0?km2), of which 154.6?mi2 (400.5?km2, 33.60%) is land and 305.6?mi2 (791.5?km2, 66.40%) is covered by water. Drinking water for the city is supplied by three reservoirs, Lake Corpus Christi, the Choke Canyon Reservoir, and Lake Texana. Through an effective regional partnership with the Nueces River Authority and the Port of Corpus Christi Authority, a 101?mi (163?km) pipeline was built which transports water from Lake Texana to the city's O.N. Stevens Water Treatment Plant. It was named the Mary Rhodes Pipeline, after the late mayor. A phase 2 of the pipeline is underway to draw water from the Colorado River.[16] All reservoirs are outside the city limits, but Lake Corpus Christi and Choke Canyon Reservoir are managed directly by the public utility of the City of Corpus Christi. To support future water needs, plans are being completed to build a desalinization plant.[17]\\r\\nSince its founding, the city has annexed nearby lands and waters for growth and development purposes. The original area encompassed several city blocks in present-day downtown Corpus Christi with the majority of city expansion occurring in the 20th century.[18]\\r\\nThe city has a humid subtropical climate, with hot summers and very short, mild winters. In November through February, the weather is the coolest. A noticeable warming trend occurs in March through April. The warmest part of the year is June through September with August being the peak of summer. October in the city is very warm, but not as hot as the summer. Corpus Christi is very windy, with wind speeds often reaching to 25 miles per hour (40?km/h; 11?m/s) with gusts reaching more than 35 miles per hour (56?km/h; 16?m/s). The citys record high temperature is 109?F (42.8?C), on September 5, 2000, and the hottest month August 2012 with an average of 88.3?F or 31.3?C. Average night-time winter lows in January, the coldest month, are a little less than 50?F or 10?C and its record low is 11?F or ?11.7?C on February 12, 1899, and the coldest maximum 26?F or ?3.3?C on five occasions, the most recent being on January 30, 1951.[nb 1] Winter and early spring is generally dry, and average monthly precipitation is highest in September, when the threat from hurricanes and other tropical weather systems is greatest. The coolest month on record has been February 1905, with a mean of 45.6?F or 7.6?C. In December 2004, the city experienced snowfall on Christmas Eve, the citys largest recorded snowstorm at 4.4 inches (0.11?m). The snow melted the day after Christmas. Because of the uniqueness of the event, three separate books document the event, Snow, More Snow, and More Snow for Kids, all with the theme of the South Texas Christmas miracle.[19]\\r\\nBetween 1981 and 2010, Corpus Christi averaged 31.73 inches or 805.9 millimetres of rainfall; however, long periods with very little rainfall are normal, and hurricanes can frequently produce daily falls of over 4 inches or 101.6 millimetres. The wettest day on record is July 2, 2007, with 9.86 inches or 250.4 millimetres, while the wettest month on record is September 1967, with 20.33 inches or 516.4 millimetres, including four days with over 3 inches or 76.2 millimetres. Eight months with not even a trace of rainfall have happened, of which the most recent was May 1998, and 21 with merely a trace. The longest spell without measurable rainfall in Corpus Christi has been 55 days from June 23 to August 17 (inclusive) of 1895, and from June 1 to July 25 of 1915, while easily the driest calendar year has been 1917, with a mere 5.38 inches or 136.7 millimetres. The two wettest calendar years have been 1888 with 48.16 inches or 1,223.3 millimetres and 1991 with 48.07 inches or 1,221.0 millimetres, although from August 1967 to July 1968, 59.09 inches or 1,500.9 millimetres fell, and for the 12 months ending January 1918, only 5.22 inches or 132.6 millimetres.\\r\\nHurricanes rarely hit the city, and have been destructive, like the 1919 Florida Keys hurricane, and Hurricane Harvey in 2017.[20]\\r\\nAt the 2010 Census, 305,215 people resided in Corpus Christi, a 10.0% increase since 2000.[25]\\r\\nIn 2012, Corpus Christi was ranked as the second least literate city in the U.S. in a study by Central Connecticut State University. [26] However, this study has been heavily criticized for its methodology and bias in favor of the Northeastern states in the US.\\r\\nAccording to the 2010 Census, 80.9% of Corpus Christi's population was White; 4.3% was African American; 1.8% Asian; 0.1% Pacific Islander; 10.4% of some other race; and 2.5% of two or more races. About 62.23% of Corpus Christi's population was of Hispanic or Latino origin, of any race.[25]\\r\\nAt the census[4] of 2000, 277,454 people, 98,791 households, and 70,437 families resided in the city. The population density was 1,794.2 people per square mile (692.7/km2). The 107,831 housing units averaged 697.3 per square mile (269.2/km2). The racial makeup of the city was 71.62% White, 4.67% African American, 0.64% Native American, 1.28% Asian, 0.08% Pacific Islander, 18.58% from other races, and 3.13% from two or more races. Hispanics of any race were 54.33% of the population.\\r\\nOf the 98,791 households, 36.1% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 50.9% were married couples living together, 15.4% had a female householder with no husband present, and 28.7% were not families. About 23.2% of all households were made up of individuals, and 7.9% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.75 and the average family size was 3.27.\\r\\nIn the city, the population was distributed as 28.1% under the age of 18, 10.6% from 18 to 24, 29.2% from 25 to 44, 21.0% from 45 to 64, and 11.1% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 33 years. For every 100 females, there were 95.6 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 92.2 males.\\r\\nThe median income for a family was $41,672. Males had a median income of $31,863 versus $22,616 for females. The per capita income for the city was $17,419. About 14.1% of families and 17.6% of the population were below the poverty line, including 22.9% of those under age 18 and 15.5% of those ages 65 or over.\\r\\nThe majority of the population is employed in the services, wholesale and retail trades, and government sectors. Corpus Christi has an unemployment rate of 5.6% as of November 2016.[27]\\r\\nThe Port of Corpus Christi, which is the fifth-largest U.S. port[28] and deepest inshore port on the Gulf of Mexico, handles mostly oil and agricultural products. Much of the local economy is driven by tourism and the oil and petrochemicals industry. In 2005, the port was ranked as the 47th-largest in the world by cargo tonnage.\\r\\nCorpus Christi is home to Naval Air Station Corpus Christi providing 6,200 civilian jobs to the local economy, making it the single largest employer in the city. Corpus Christi Army Depot, located on NAS Corpus Christi, is the largest helicopter repair facility in the world.[9] Additionally located on NAS Corpus Christi is the United States Coast Guard Sector/Air Station Corpus Christi.\\r\\nCorpus Christi is the original home of the headquarters of Whataburger, a fast-food restaurant operator and franchiser with 650 stores in 10 states and Mexico; however, the company relocated its headquarters to San Antonio in 2009. Other large employers include CHRISTUS Spohn Health System at 5,400 local employees, the Corpus Christi Independent School District with 5,178, H-E-B at 5,000, and Bay Ltd. at 2,100.[29] Other companies based in Corpus Christi include Stripes Convenience Stores and AEP Texas.[30][31]\\r\\nCorpus Christi became the first major city to offer citywide free wi-fi in April 2005 [32] to allow remote meter reading after a meter reader was attacked by a dog. In 2007, the network was purchased by Earthlink for $5.5 million, and stopped being a free service on May 31, 2007.[33]\\r\\nVarious sections of Corpus Christi maintain distinct senses of identity and community from the city proper, especially the Calallen and Flour Bluff areas. Clarkwood and Annaville have less prominent senses of identity, but the distinction remains. These areas are sometimes mistakenly believed to be separate municipalities.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe city has many demographic groups, ethnicities, and subcultures, each giving it a distinct flavor: the defense bases and the people who work there, the large Hispanic community, the oil-related professionals and workers, the cowboy culture, and the surfers.\\r\\nIn 2015, Men's Health magazine ranked Corpus Christi as the fattest city in the United States, renaming it \\"Corpulent Christi\\".[34] Obesity and diabetes rank second and third in the nation, which is culturally related to the Hispanic population. [35]\\r\\nThe city is home to a number of popular destinations for both tourists and residents. The official visitor and tourism information organization is the Corpus Christi Convention and Visitors Bureau. Some of the most visited attractions are located on North Beach, where the Texas State Aquarium and the USS Lexington Museum on the Bay are located.[36]\\r\\nThe USS Lexington was also part of the set for the 2000 film Pearl Harbor. Corpus Christi's museum district is located near the USS Lexington. Some attractions located in the museum district are the Museum of Asian Cultures, the Corpus Christi Museum of Science and History, the South Texas Institute for the Arts, and the Harbor Playhouse Theatre, one of the oldest continually operating community theatres in Texas. Heritage Park is also in the museum district, where a number of older restored houses can be found. The downtown area, of which the museum district is a part, is home to skyscrapers such as One Shoreline Plaza, company offices, various shops, a popular center of marinas, and Mirador de la Flor. Downtown also is home of the Texas Surf Museum, which explores the history of surfing and focuses on surf culture along Texas' 367-mile (591?km) coast, as well as K Space Contemporary, a nonprofit art organization promoting and presenting local, regional, and national contemporary art.\\r\\nThe Corpus Christi Botanical Gardens and Nature Center, also located in the city, hosts gardening programs from time to time. On Oso Bay near the Pharaoh Valley subdivision is the Hans and Pat Suter Wildlife Refuge, known for seabird-watching. The nearby Pharaohs golf course also serves as a haven for coastal and migratory birds.\\r\\nDirectly east of Corpus Christi are Padre Island and Mustang Island, home to various municipal, state, and national parks, most notably the Padre Island National Seashore. The city is also near King Ranch, one of the world's largest ranches, upon which the movie Giant was based.\\r\\nThe city also celebrates the annual Buccaneer Days Carnival, which is typically held downtown.\\r\\nSouth Padre Island Drive (locally abbreviated as \\"S.P.I.D.\\", with the letters pronounced individually), is the city's main retail corridor, with two shopping malls, La Palmera (formerly Padre Staples Mall), and Sunrise Mall. Also, a number of other large shopping centers, small strip centers, and restaurants can be found throughout the city.\\r\\nCorpus Christi also is the home of Midget Ocean Racing Fleet, also known as MORF, which promotes sailing in the Coastal Bend. The Wednesday night races held by MORF are the longest-running weekly races in the United States.\\r\\nCorpus Christi has professional sports to offer residents and visitors. The city is home to the Corpus Christi IceRays of the North American Hockey League and the Corpus Christi Hooks are the AA minor league baseball club for the Houston Astros which plays in the Texas League.\\r\\nYear round NCAA Division I collegiate athletics may be found at Texas A&M-Corpus Christi as the Islanders compete in 14 mens and womens sports as a member of the Southland Conference.\\r\\nSailing races are held weekly off downtown's T-heads every Wednesday, where spectators watch vessels competing during sunset. Additionally, Corpus Christi is also home to the Corpus Christi Rugby Football Club, which is a member of the Texas Rugby Union, an affiliate of the Western Rugby Union and of the United States Rugby Football Union.\\r\\nThe city's location beside Corpus Christi Bay, the Gulf of Mexico, and Laguna Madre provides opportunities for water sports and nature tourism. Waterfowl hunting is available in the region for duck, geese, coot, and teal. White-winged dove and mourning dove are also hunted on private leases. The brushland inland from Corpus Christi is also ideal for hunting feral hogs and white-tailed deer.\\r\\nFishing is a popular recreational activity in Corpus Christi. Popular fishing activities include fishing from various piers around Corpus Christi Bay, wade fishing in Oso Bay, and fishing from the Gulf of Mexico at Packery Channel or at Bob Hall Pier.\\r\\nThe city has one of the highest average wind speeds of coastal cities in North America.[37] Combined with the Bay Front area along Ocean Drive, making the city an important destination for wind sports such as kite boarding, wind surfing, kite flying, and sailing. In 1990, Corpus Christi hosted the Windsurfing World Championships.\\r\\nThe Corpus Christi Skate Park opened on February 17, 2007. It is located in Cole Park on the shoreline of the Corpus Christi Bay near downtown. The 12,000-square-foot (1,100?m2) concrete park includes a skating bowl and a street course with stairs, railings, and flat surfaces.\\r\\nBeing a coastal city, Corpus Christi is a good spot for seabird watching. Popular spots include Blucher Park in downtown, the Hans and Pat Suter Wildlife Refuge along Oso Bay, Hazel Bazemore County Park along the Nueces River in Calallen, and the South Texas Botanic Garden and Nature Center along the Oso Creek.[38]\\r\\nIn 1852, the City of Corpus Christi was incorporated. Texas' 31st Legislature chartered the city as a political and corporate municipal entity in 1909. By ordinance, the city possesses power to \\"fix, alter and extend its boundaries.\\"[39]\\r\\nCorpus Christi is under a council-manager municipal government. The elected city council is the primary authority in municipal matters such as enacting local legislation, determining policies, and appointing the city manager. Together, the city council and city manager execute laws and administer the municipal government.[39] Organized by governmental sectors of city council, city management, city secretary, and several city departments, Corpus Christi is seated in Nueces County. The city council currently consists of these elected members:\\r\\nCorpus Christi City Manager Margie C. Rose was appointed in 2016, and works alongside Assistant City Manager Mark Van Vleck (public works and utilities) and Jay Ellington (Interim ÿ safety, health, and neighborhoods).The city's Intergovernmental Relations department is under the direction of Tom Tagliabue. Appointed by the city council, Rebecca L. Huerta serves as the city secretary.[41]\\r\\nThe Corpus Christi City Charter was adopted by public referendum in 1987, with amendments to the entire charter conducted January 19, 1991, and April 3, 1993. Further revisions to the charter were conducted on November 2, 2004, November 7, 2006, and November 8, 2016.[42] The charter consists of 10 articles and 41 sections regarding stipulations of home rule government, city council and city manager procedures, administration, planning, boards and commissions, etc. The Code of Ordinances of Corpus Christi was codified through Ordinance No. 028493, and adopted Feb. 23, 2010.[43]\\r\\nFrom 2012 to 2016, Nelda Martinez was mayor of Corpus Christi, the first Hispanic woman to the hold the office.[44]\\r\\nOn January 19, 2017, Corpus Christi Mayor Dan McQueen resigned from office after 37 days, an outgrowth of a comment by McQueen claiming that the city council members were only high school graduates and he was an engineer.[2] He does not have an engineering degree and there are college graduates on the city council.[2]\\r\\nThe Texas 13th Court of Appeals is located in the Nueces County Courthouse in Corpus Christi.[45]\\r\\nThe Texas Department of Criminal Justice operates the Corpus Christi Parole Office in Corpus Christi.[46]\\r\\nThe United States Postal Service operates the Corpus Christi Post Office, the city's main post office,[47] and several station post offices.\\r\\nCorpus Christi is home to several institutions of higher learning: Texas A&M University-Corpus Christi, Del Mar College, Saint Leo University-Corpus Christi and numerous vocational schools, including Southern Careers Institute, South Texas Vo-Tech, Career Centers of Texas-Corpus Christi, and Vogue Cosmetology School. The city is also home to the South Texas School of Christian Studies located on Ward Island alongside Texas A&M-Corpus Christi. The school serves as an extension campus on the undergraduate level for Hardin Simmons University and on the graduate level for Logsdon Seminary of Hardin-Simmons.\\r\\nTexas A&M University-Corpus Christi is a component of the Texas A&M University System. It was formerly known as Corpus Christi State University, Texas A&I University at Corpus Christi, and the University of Corpus Christi.\\r\\nSaint Leo University-Corpus Christi Education Center is located at Corpus Christi's Naval Air Station.\\r\\nDel Mar College is a local community college begun in the 1940s at a location behind Wynn Seale Jr. High School. The main campus began with the administration building, which was constructed after World War II on Del Mar. The college grew to encompass a good portion of a residential addition called Southmoreland built from the Bohemian farm lands in the late 1930s. Del Mar now includes a west campus located in the area of Corpus Christi that once was Cliff Maus Airport.\\r\\nSouthern Careers Institute offers career training at two Corpus Christi locations, primarily in the medical, business, and cosmetology fields.\\r\\nIn 2015, WalletHub ranked Corpus Christi near the bottom, 138 out of 150 cities in America, for its low educational level and low income opportunities.[48] In order to improve literacy levels in the city, there has been a multi-year effort to promote reading through annual literacy festivals. Started by First Lady Laura Bush and the Texas Book Festival, a series of book festivals are held each spring. This year's festival features award-winning author Rosemary Wells [49] and revolves around the concept that \\"literacy is the foundation to a child's academic success.\\"\\r\\nSix school districts provide primary and secondary education for area residents: Corpus Christi Independent School District, Calallen ISD, Flour Bluff ISD, Tuloso-Midway ISD, West Oso ISD, and London ISD. The Roman Catholic Diocese of Corpus Christi provides the primary and secondary education for Catholic schools. Several Open Enrollment Charter Schools are in Corpus Christi. These public schools are: Accelerated Learning Center, Cesar E Chavez Academy, Corpus Christi College Preparatory HS, Corpus Christi Montessori School, Dr ML Garza-Gonzalez Charter School, GCCLR Institute of Technology, Premier HS of Corpus Christi, Richard Milburn Academy, School of Science and Technology, Seashore Learning Center, and Seashore Middle Academy.\\r\\nHigh Schools\\r\\nMiddle Schools\\r\\nElementary Schools\\r\\nAlternative\\r\\nLibraries in the city include:[50]\\r\\nTexShare card holders also have limited borrowing privileges at these area libraries:[51]\\r\\nCorpus Christi is served by Corpus Christi International Airport and Interstate 37. Interstate 69E/U.S. Highway 77 connects the city to Brownsville and Victoria. Texas State Highway 44 is a main thoroughfare that connects Corpus Christi to Laredo and the western part of South Texas by way of Interstate 69W/U.S. Highway 59, Interstate 35, and U.S. Highway 83. The inner-city public transportation is provided by Corpus Christi Regional Transportation Authority with its 28 bus routes. Corpus Christi once had a streetcar system functioning from 1910 to 1931 and a railway station (passenger service ended in 1965). Despite the convenience of a large harbor, the city does not have a passenger port. Plans to bring a cruise service are pending.\\r\\nThe city is accessed by two major bridges, the Harbor Bridge (US 181) and the John F. Kennedy Causeway (PR 22). Both bridges are maintained by the Texas Department of Transportation.\\r\\nFreight service from San Antonio to Corpus Christi is provided by the Union Pacific Railroad, but the original line, both freight and passenger, was the San Antonio, Uvalde and Gulf Railroad, which operated to Corpus Christi from 1913 to 1956.[52] Then the SAU&G, or \\"The Sausage\\", as it was commonly called, was merged into the Missouri Pacific Railroad. It was subsequently procured by the Union Pacific.[53]\\r\\nCorpus Christi keeps a thriving and active relationship with these sister cities:[54]","input":"What large body of water is off the texas coast?"},{"output":"the events leading up to the Norman conquest of England concerning William, Duke of Normandy, and Harold, Earl of Wessex, later King of England, and culminating in the Battle of Hastings.","context":"The Bayeux Tapestry or Bayeux Embroidery[1][2][3] (English: /ba??j??r/ or US: /b??ju?/,/b??j?/ ,/be??ju?/; French: Tapisserie de Bayeux, IPA:?[tapis?i d? baj?], or La telle du conquest; Latin: Tapete Baiocense) is an embroidered cloth nearly 70 metres (230?ft) long and 50 centimetres (20?in) tall, which depicts the events leading up to the Norman conquest of England concerning William, Duke of Normandy, and Harold, Earl of Wessex, later King of England, and culminating in the Battle of Hastings.\\r\\nAccording to Sylvette Lemagnen, conservator of the tapestry:\\r\\nThe Bayeux tapestry is one of the supreme achievements of the Norman Romanesque?.... Its survival almost intact over nine centuries is little short of miraculous?... Its exceptional length, the harmony and freshness of its colours, its exquisite workmanship, and the genius of its guiding spirit combine to make it endlessly fascinating.[4]\\r\\nThe tapestry consists of some fifty scenes with Latin tituli, embroidered on linen with coloured woollen yarns. It is likely that it was commissioned by Bishop Odo, William's half-brother, and made in Englandnot Bayeuxin the 1070s. In 1729 the hanging was rediscovered by scholars at a time when it was being displayed annually in Bayeux Cathedral. The tapestry is now exhibited at the Muse de la Tapisserie de Bayeux in Bayeux, Normandy, France (491628N 04201W? / ?49.2744N 0.7003W? / 49.2744; -0.7003).\\r\\nThe designs on the Bayeux Tapestry are embroidered rather than woven, so that it is not technically a tapestry.[5] Nevertheless, it has always been called a tapestry until recent years, when the more correct name \\"Bayeux Embroidery\\" has gained ground among art historians. The tapestry can be seen as the final and best known work of Anglo-Saxon art, and though made after the Conquest was both made in England and firmly in an Anglo-Saxon tradition, points now accepted by French art historians.[6] Such tapestries adorned both churches and wealthy houses in England, though at 0.5 by 68.38 metres (1.6 by 224.3?ft, and apparently incomplete) the Bayeux Tapestry is exceptionally large. Only the figures and decoration are embroidered, on a background left plain, which shows the subject very clearly and was necessary to cover large areas.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe earliest known written reference to the tapestry is a 1476 inventory of Bayeux Cathedral,[7] but its origins have been the subject of much speculation and controversy.\\r\\nFrench legend maintained the tapestry was commissioned and created by Queen Matilda, William the Conqueror's wife, and her ladies-in-waiting. Indeed, in France it is occasionally known as \\"La Tapisserie de la Reine Mathilde\\" (Tapestry of Queen Matilda). However, scholarly analysis[8] in the 20th century concluded it was probably commissioned by William's half-brother, Bishop Odo, who, after the Conquest, became Earl of Kent and, when William was absent in Normandy, regent of England.\\r\\nThe reasons for the Odo commission theory include: 1) three of the bishop's followers mentioned in the Domesday Book appear on the tapestry; 2) it was found in Bayeux Cathedral, built by Odo; and 3) it may have been commissioned at the same time as the cathedral's construction in the 1070s, possibly completed by 1077 in time for display on the cathedral's dedication.\\r\\nAssuming Odo commissioned the tapestry, it was probably designed and constructed in England by Anglo-Saxon artists (Odo's main power base being by then in Kent); the Latin text contains hints of Anglo-Saxon; other embroideries originate from England at this time; and the vegetable dyes can be found in cloth traditionally woven there.[9][10][11] Howard B. Clarke has proposed that the designer of the tapestry was Scolland, the abbot of St Augustine's Abbey in Canterbury, because of his previous position as head of the scriptorium at Mont Saint-Michel (famed for its illumination), his travels to Trajan's Column, and his connections to Wadard and Vital, two individuals identified in the tapestry.[12][13] The actual physical work of stitching was most likely undertaken by female needle workers. Anglo-Saxon needlework of the more detailed type known as Opus Anglicanum was famous across Europe. It was perhaps commissioned for display in the hall of his palace and then bequeathed to the cathedral he built, following the pattern of the documented but lost hanging of Byrhtnoth.[14]\\r\\nAlternative theories exist. Carola Hicks has suggested it could possibly have been commissioned by Edith of Wessex.[15] Wolfgang Grape has challenged the consensus that the embroidery is Anglo-Saxon, distinguishing between Anglo-Saxon and other Northern European techniques;[16] Medieval material authority Elizabeth Coatsworth[17] contradicted this: \\"The attempt to distinguish Anglo-Saxon from other Northern European embroideries before 1100 on the grounds of technique cannot be upheld on the basis of present knowledge.\\"[18] George Beech suggests the tapestry was executed at the Abbey of St. Florent in the Loire Valley, and says the detailed depiction of the Breton campaign argues for additional sources in France.[19] Andrew Bridgeford has suggested that the tapestry was actually of English design and encoded with secret messages meant to undermine Norman rule.[20]\\r\\nIn common with other embroidered hangings of the early medieval period, this piece is conventionally referred to as a \\"tapestry\\", although it is not a true tapestry in which the design is woven into the cloth; it is in fact an embroidery.\\r\\nThe Bayeux tapestry is embroidered in crewel (wool yarn) on a tabby-woven linen ground 68.38 metres long and 0.5 metres wide (224.3?ft G?1.6?ft) and using two methods of stitching: outline or stem stitch for lettering and the outlines of figures, and couching or laid work for filling in figures.[10][11] Nine linen panels, between fourteen and three metres in length, were sewn together after each was embroidered and the joins were disguised with subsequent embroidery.[21] At the first join (start of scene 14) the borders do not line up properly but the technique was improved so that the later joins are practically invisible.[21] The design involved a broad central zone with narrow decorative borders top and bottom.[21] By inspecting the woollen threads behind the linen it is apparent all these aspects were embroidered together at a session and the awkward placing of the tituli is not due to them being added later.[21] Later generations have patched the hanging in numerous places and some of the embroidery (especially in the final scene) has been reworked.[21] The tapestry may well have maintained much of its original appearanceit now compares closely with a careful drawing made in 1730.[21]\\r\\nThe main yarn colours are terracotta or russet, blue-green, dull gold, olive green, and blue, with small amounts of dark blue or black and sage green. Later repairs are worked in light yellow, orange, and light greens.[10] Laid yarns are couched in place with yarn of the same or contrasting colour.\\r\\nThe tapestry's central zone contains most of the action, which sometimes overflows into the borders either for dramatic effect or because depictions would otherwise be very cramped (for example at Edward's death scene). Events take place in a long series of scenes which are generally separated by highly stylised trees. However, the trees are not placed consistently and the greatest scene shift, between Harold's audience with Edward after his return to England and Edward's burial scene, is not marked in any way at all.[22]\\r\\nThe tituli are normally in the central zone but occasionally use the top border. The borders are otherwise mostly purely decorative and only sometimes does the decoration complement the action in the central zone. The decoration consists of birds, beasts, fish and scenes from fables, agriculture and hunting. There are frequent oblique bands separating the vignettes. There are nude figures, some of corpses from battle, others of a ribald nature.[22] A harrow, a newly invented implement, is depicted (scene 10) and this is the earliest known depiction. The picture of Halley's Comet, which appears in the upper border (scene 32), is the first known picture of this comet.[22]\\r\\nThe end of the tapestry has been missing from time immemorial and the final titulus \\"Et fuga verterunt Angli\\" (\\"and the English left fleeing\\") is said to be \\"entirely spurious\\", added shortly before 1814 at a time of anti-English sentiment.[22] Musset speculates the hanging was originally about 1.5 metres longer.[22] At the last section still remaining the embroidery has been almost completely restored but this seems to have been done with at least some regard to the original stitching.[22] The stylised tree is quite unlike any other tree in the tapestry.[22] The start of the tapestry has also been restored but to a much lesser extent.[22]\\r\\nIn 1724 a linen backing cloth was sewn on comparatively crudely and, in around the year 1800, large ink numerals were written on the backing which broadly enumerate each scene and which are still commonly used for reference.[22]\\r\\nIn a series of pictures supported by a written commentary the tapestry tells the story of the events of 1064ÿ1066 culminating in the Battle of Hastings. The two main protagonists are Harold Godwinson, recently crowned King of England, leading the Anglo-Saxon English, and William, Duke of Normandy, leading a mainly Norman army, sometimes called the companions of William the Conqueror.[22]\\r\\nWilliam was the illegitimate son of Robert the Magnificent, Duke of Normandy, and Herleva (or Arlette), a tanner's daughter. William became Duke of Normandy at the age of seven and was in control of Normandy by the age of nineteen. His half brother was Bishop Odo of Bayeux.\\r\\nKing Edward the Confessor, king of England and about sixty years old at the time the tapestry starts its narration, had no children or any clear successor. Edward's mother, Emma of Normandy, was William's great aunt. At that time succession to the English throne was not by primogeniture but was decided jointly by the king and by an assembly of nobility, the Witenagemot.\\r\\nHarold Godwinson, earl of Wessex and the most powerful noble in England, was Edward's brother-in-law. The Norman chronicler William of Poitiers[23] reported that Edward had previously determined that William would succeed him on the throne, and Harold had sworn to honour this, and yet later that Harold had claimed Edward, on his deathbed, had made him heir over William. However, other sources dispute this claim.\\r\\nThe tapestry begins with a panel of Edward the Confessor sending Harold to Normandy.(scene 1) Later Norman sources say that the mission was for Harold to pledge loyalty to William but the tapestry does not suggest any specific purpose.[21] By mischance, Harold arrives at the wrong location in France and is taken prisoner by Guy, Count of Ponthieu.(scene 7) After exchanges of messages borne by mounted messengers, Harold is released to William who then invites Harold to come on a campaign against Conan II, Duke of Brittany. On the way, just outside the monastery of Mont Saint-Michel, the army become mired in quicksand and Harold saves two Norman soldiers.(scene 17) William's army chases Conan from Dol de Bretagne to Rennes, and Conan finally surrenders at Dinan.(scene 20) William gives Harold arms and armour (possibly knighting him) and Harold takes an oath on saintly relics.(scene 23) Although the writing on the tapestry explicitly states an oath is taken there is no clue as to what is being promised.[21]\\r\\nHarold leaves for home and meets again with the old king Edward, who appears to be remonstrating with him.(scene 25) Harold is in a somewhat submissive posture and seems to be in disgrace.[21] However, possibly deliberately, the king's intentions are not made clear.[21] The scene then shifts by about one year to when Edward has become mortally ill and the tapestry strongly suggests that, on his deathbed, he bequeaths the crown to Harold.[note 1][22] What is probably the coronation ceremony[note 2] is attended by Stigand, whose position as Archbishop of Canterbury was controversial.[22](scene 31) Stigand is performing a liturgical function, possibly not the crowning itself.[22] The tapestry labels the celebrant as \\"Stigant Archieps\\" (Stigand the archbishop) although by that time he had been excommunicated by the papacy who considered his appointment unlawful.[21]\\r\\nA star with a streaming tail then appears: Halley's Comet.[note 3] Comets, in the beliefs of the Middle Ages, were a bad omen. At this point the lower border of the tapestry shows a fleet of ghost-like ships thus hinting at a future invasion.[21](scene 33) The news of Harold's coronation is taken to Normandy, whereupon we are told that William is ordering a fleet of ships to be built although it is Bishop Odo shown issuing the instructions.(scene 35) The invaders reach England, and land unopposed. William orders his men to find food, and a meal is cooked.(scene 43) A house is burnt, which may indicate some ravaging of the local countryside on the part of the invaders.(scene 47) News is brought to William.[note 4] The Normans build a motte and bailey at Hastings to defend their position. Messengers are sent between the two armies, and William makes a speech to prepare his army for battle.(scene 51)\\r\\nThe Battle of Hastings was fought on 14 October 1066 less than three weeks after the Battle of Stamford Bridge but the tapestry does not provide this context. The English fight on foot behind a shield wall, whilst the Normans are on horses.[note 5] Two fallen knights are named as Leofwine and Gyrth, Harold's brothers, but both armies are shown fighting bravely.[21] Bishop Odo brandishes his baton or mace and rallies the Norman troops in battle.(scene 54)[note 6][21] To reassure his knights that he is still alive and well, William raises his helmet to show his face.[22] The battle becomes very bloody with troops being slaughtered and dismembered corpses littering the ground. King Harold is killed.(scene 57) This scene can be interpreted in different ways, as the name \\"Harold\\" appears above a number of knights, making it difficult to identify which character is Harold. The final remaining scene shows unarmoured English troops fleeing the battlefield. The last part of the tapestry is missing but it is thought that the story contained only one additional scene.[21]\\r\\nTituli are included in many scenes to point out names of people and places or to explain briefly the event being depicted.[22] The text is in Latin but at times the style of words and spelling shows an English influence.[22] A dark blue wool, almost black, is mostly used but towards the end of the tapestry other colours are used, sometimes for each word and other times for each letter.[22] The complete text and English translation are displayed beside images of each scene at Bayeux Tapestry tituli.\\r\\nThe first reference to the tapestry is from 1476 when it was listed in an inventory of the treasures of Bayeux Cathedral. It survived the sack of Bayeux by the Huguenots in 1562; and the next certain reference is from 1724.[22] Antoine Lancelot sent a report to the Acadmie Royale des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres concerning a sketch he had received about a work concerning William the Conqueror. He had no idea whether the original was a sculpture or painting though he mooted it could be a tapestry.[24] Despite his further enquiries he discovered no more.\\r\\nHowever, the Benedictine scholar Bernard de Montfaucon made more successful investigations and found that the sketch was of a small portion of a tapestry preserved at Bayeux Cathedral. In 1729 and 1730 he published drawings and a detailed description of the complete work in the first two volumes of his Les Monuments de la Monarchie fran?aise. The drawings were by Antoine Beno?t, one of the ablest draughtsmen of that time.[24]\\r\\nThe tapestry was first briefly noted in English in 1743 by William Stukeley, in his Palaeographia Britannica.[25] The first detailed account in English was written by Smart Lethieullier, who was living in Paris in 1732ÿ3, and was acquainted with Lancelot and de Montfaucon: it was not published, however, until 1767, as an appendix to Andrew Ducarel's Anglo-Norman Antiquities.[26]\\r\\nDuring the French Revolution, in 1792, the tapestry was confiscated as public property to be used for covering military wagons.[22] It was rescued from a wagon by a local lawyer who stored it in his house until the troubles were over, when he sent it to the city administrators for safekeeping.[24] After the Terror the Fine Arts Commission, set up to safeguard national treasures, in 1803 required it to be removed to Paris for display at the Muse Napolon.[24] When Napoleon abandoned his planned invasion of Britain its propaganda value was lost and it was returned to Bayeux where the council displayed it on a winding apparatus of two cylinders.[24] Despite scholars' concern that the tapestry was becoming damaged the council refused to return it to the Cathedral.[24]\\r\\nIn 1816 the Society of Antiquaries of London commissioned its historical draughtsman, Charles Stothard, to visit Bayeux to make an accurate hand-coloured facsimile of the tapestry. His drawings were subsequently engraved by James Basire jr., and published by the Society in 1819ÿ23.[27] Stothard's images are still of value as a record of the tapestry as it was before 19th-century restoration.\\r\\nBy 1842 the tapestry was displayed in a special-purpose room in the Bibliothque Publique. It required special storage in 1870 with the threatened invasion of Normandy in the Franco-Prussian War and again in 1939ÿ1944 by the Ahnenerbe during the German Occupation of France and the Normandy landings. On 27 June 1944 the Gestapo took the tapestry to the Louvre and on 18 August, three days before the Wehrmacht withdrew from Paris, Himmler sent a message (intercepted by Bletchley Park) ordering it to be taken to \\"a place of safety\\", thought to be Berlin.[21] It was only on 22 August that the SS attempted to take possession of the tapestry by which time the Louvre was again in French hands.[21] After the liberation of Paris, on 25 August, the tapestry was again put on public display in the Louvre, and in 1945 it was returned to Bayeux[24] where it is exhibited at the Muse de la Tapisserie de Bayeux.\\r\\nThe inventory listing of 1476 shows that the tapestry was being hung annually in Bayeux Cathedral for the week of the Feast of St. John the Baptist; and this was still the case in 1728, although by that time the purpose was merely to air the hanging, which was otherwise stored in a chest.[21] Clearly, the work was being well cared for. In the eighteenth century the artistry was regarded as crude or even barbarousred and yellow multi-coloured horses upset some critics. It was thought to be unfinished because the linen was not covered with embroidery.[21] However, its exhibition in the Louvre in 1797 caused a sensation, with Le Moniteur, which normally dealt with foreign affairs, reporting on it on its first two pages.[21] It inspired a popular musical, La Tapisserie de la Reine Mathilde. It was because the tapestry was regarded as an antiquity rather than a work of art that in 1804 it was returned to Bayeux, where in 1823 one commentator, A. L. Lchaud d'Anisy, reported that \\"there is a sort of purity in its primitive forms, especially considering the state of the arts in the eleventh century\\".[21]\\r\\nThe tapestry was becoming a tourist attraction, with Robert Southey complaining of the need to queue to see the work.[note 7] In the 1843 Hand-book for Travellers in France by John Murray III, a visit was included on \\"Recommended Route 26 (Caen to Cherbourg via Bayeux)\\", and this guidebook led John Ruskin to go there; he would describe the tapestry as \\"the most interesting thing in its way conceivable\\". Charles Dickens, however, was not impressed: \\"It is certainly the work of amateurs; very feeble amateurs at the beginning and very heedless some of them too.\\"[21]\\r\\nDuring the Second World War Heinrich Himmler coveted the work, regarding it as \\"important for our glorious and cultured Germanic history\\".[21]\\r\\nThe tapestry contains several mysteries:\\r\\nThe Bayeux Tapestry was probably commissioned by the House of Normandy and essentially depicts a Norman viewpoint. However, Harold is shown as brave and his soldiers are not belittled. Throughout, William is described as \\"dux\\" (duke) whereas Harold, also called dux up to his coronation, is subsequently called \\"rex\\" (king).[21] The fact that the narrative extensively covers Harold's activities in Normandy (in 1064) indicates that the intention was to show a strong relationship between that expedition and the Norman Conquest starting two years later. It is for this reason that the tapestry is generally seen by modern scholars as an apologia for the Norman Conquest.\\r\\nThe tapestry's narration seems to place stress on Harold's oath to William although its rationale is not made clear.[22] Norman sources claimed that the English succession was being pledged to William but English sources gave varied accounts.[22] Today it is thought the Norman sources are to be preferred.[30] Both the tapestry and Norman sources[31] named Stigand, the excommunicated Archbishop of Canterbury, as the man who crowned Harold, possibly to discredit Harold's kingship; English sources[32] suggested that he was crowned by Ealdred, Archbishop of York and favoured by the papacy, making Harold's position as legitimate king more secure. Contemporary scholarship has not decided the matter although it is generally thought Ealdred performed the coronation.[33][34]\\r\\nWhile political propaganda or personal emphasis may have somewhat distorted the historical accuracy of the story, the Bayeux tapestry presents a unique visual document of medieval arms, apparel, and other objects unlike any other artifact surviving from this period. There is no attempt at continuity between scenes either for individuals' appearance or clothing. The knights carry shields, but show no system of hereditary coats of armsthe beginnings of modern heraldic structure were in place, but would not become standard until the middle of the 12th century.[22] It has been noted that the warriors are depicted fighting with bare hands, while other sources indicate the general use of gloves in battle and hunt.\\r\\nTapestry fragments have been found in Scandinavia dating from the ninth century and it is thought that Norman and Anglo-Saxon embroidery developed from this sort of work. Examples are to be found in the grave goods of the Oseberg ship and the ?verhogdal tapestries.[22]\\r\\nA monastic text from Ely, the Liber Eliensis, mentions a woven narrative wall-hanging commemorating the deeds of Byrhtnoth, killed in 991. Wall-hangings were common by the tenth century with English and Norman texts particularly commending the skill of Anglo-Saxon seamstresses. Mural paintings imitating draperies still exist in France and Italy and there are twelfth century mentions of other wall-hangings in Normandy and France. A poem by Baldric of Dol might even be describing the Bayeux Tapestry itself.[22] The Bayeux Tapestry was therefore not unique at the time it was created: rather it is remarkable for being the sole surviving example of medieval narrative needlework.[35]\\r\\nThere are a number of replicas of the Bayeux Tapestry in existence. Through the collaboration of William Morris with textile manufacturer Thomas Wardle, Wardle's wife Elizabeth, who was an accomplished seamstress, embarked on creating a reproduction in 1885.[21] She organised some 37 women in her Leek School of Art Embroidery[note 8] to collaborate working from a full-scale water-colour facsimile drawing provided by the South Kensington Museum. The full-size replica was finished in 1886 and is now exhibited in the Museum of Reading in Reading, Berkshire, England.[36] The naked figure in the original tapestry (in the border below the ?lfgyva figure) is depicted wearing a brief garment because the drawing which was worked from was similarly bowdlerised.[21]\\r\\nRay Dugan of University of Waterloo, Ontario, Canada, completed a stitched replica in 1996.[37] Since its completion, it has been displayed in various museums and galleries in Canada and the United States.[38]\\r\\nIn 2000, the Danish-based Bayeux Group, part of the Viking Group Lindholm H?je, began making an accurate replica of the Bayeux Tapestry, using the original sewing techniques.[39] The replica was completed in June 2014 and went on permanent exhibition at B?rglum Abbey in May 2015.[40]\\r\\nDr. E. D. Wheeler, former judge and former dean at Oglethorpe University, commissioned a hand-painted, full-size replica of the Bayeux Tapestry and donated it to the University of West Georgia in Carrollton in 1994. In 2014, the replica was acquired by the University of North Georgia in Dahlonega.\\r\\nAn approximately half scale mosaic version of the Bayeux Tapestry was formerly on display at Geraldine, New Zealand.[41] It was made up of 1.5 million 7?mm2 pieces of spring steel ÿ off-cuts from patterning disks of knitting machines ÿ and was created by Michael Linton over a period of twenty years from 1979. The work was in 32 sections, and included a hypothetical reconstruction of the missing final section leading up to William the Conqueror's coronation at Westminster Abbey on Christmas Day, 1066.[42]\\r\\nJason Welch, a woodcarver from North Creake, Norfolk, England, created a replica of the Tapestry between 2011 and 2014 in carved and painted wooden relief on 25 five-foot planks. He undertook the project to help cope with the grief of losing his 16-year-old son.[43]\\r\\nOther modern artists have attempted to complete the work by creating panels depicting subsequent events up to William's coronation, though the actual content of the missing panels is unknown. In 1997, the embroidery artist Jan Messent completed a reconstruction showing William accepting the surrender of English nobles at Berkhamsted (Beorcham), Hertfordshire, and his coronation.[44][45][46] In early 2013, 416 residents of Alderney in the Channel Islands finished a continuation including William's coronation and the building of the Tower of London.[47]\\r\\nBecause it resembles a modern comic strip or movie storyboard, is widely recognised, and is so distinctive in its artistic style, the Bayeux Tapestry has frequently been used or reimagined in a variety of different popular culture contexts. George Wingfield Digby wrote in 1957:\\r\\nIt was designed to tell a story to a largely illiterate public; it is like a strip cartoon, racy, emphatic, colourful, with a good deal of blood and thunder and some ribaldry.[48]\\r\\nIt has been cited by Scott McCloud in Understanding Comics as an example of early narrative art;[49] and Bryan Talbot, a British comic book artist, has called it \\"the first known British comic strip\\".[50]\\r\\nIt has inspired many modern political and other cartoons, including:\\r\\nThe tapestry has also inspired modern embroideries, notably:\\r\\nA number of films have used sections of the tapestry in their opening credits or closing titles, including Disney's Bedknobs and Broomsticks, Anthony Mann's El Cid, Zeffirelli's Hamlet, Frank Cassenti's La Chanson de Roland, Kevin Reynolds' Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves, and Richard Fleischer's The Vikings.[54]\\r\\nThe design and embroidery of the tapestry form one of the narrative strands of Marta Morazzoni's 1988 novella The Invention of Truth.\\r\\nThe tapestry is referenced in Tony Kushner's play Angels in America. The apocryphal account of Queen Matilda's creation of the tapestry is used, perhaps in order to demonstrate that Louis, one of the main characters, holds himself to mythological standards.[55]","input":"What is the story told by the bayeux tapestry?"},{"output":"18 September 1973","context":"The relationship of Germany and the United Nations first began during World War II. The United Nations then was synonymous with the Allies of World War II and Germany then being the Greater German Reich, a member of the Axis powers. With the war ending in the defeat of Germany, the country's territory was divided amongst the victors and what was to remain Germany was under Allied administration. In 1949, two new countries were created in these occupied territories: the Federal Republic of Germany (West Germany) in May and the German Democratic Republic (East Germany) in October.\\r\\nBoth Germanys were admitted as full members of the United Nations (UN) on 18 September 1973. The two countries eventually merged on 3 October 1990, signifying an end of the Cold war era.\\r\\nToday, Germany is the third largest contributor to the UN budget, after the United States and Japan, with 190 million US dollars, or roughly 8% of the UN budget for the 2010-11 biennial budget.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Federal Republic of Germany (West Germany) was admitted to the UN as an observer in 1955. The German Democratic Republic (East Germany) was admitted as an observer in 1972.[2] On 18 September 1973 both were admitted as full members by the United Nations General Assembly, following the recommendation of the Security Council by Resolution 335 on 22 June 1973. Through the accession of the German Democratic Republic to the Federal Republic of Germany, it was effective on 3 October 1990. The territory of the German Democratic Republic became part of the Federal Republic of Germany, today simply known as Germany [3]. Consequently, the Federal Republic of Germany continued being a member of the UN while the German Democratic Republic ceased to exist.[4]\\r\\nFor the years of 2011 to 2012 Germany has been elected as a non-permanent member of the United Nations Security Council (UNSC). However, Germany received criticism from its European and US allies for abstaining on the Libyan no-fly zone resolution that they were voting for. Former German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer argued that \\"Germany has lost its credibility in the United Nations and in the Middle East. German hopes for a permanent seat on the Security Council have been permanently dashed and one is now fearful of Europe's future.\\"[5][6]\\r\\nFrance and the United Kingdom have explicitly called for a permanent seat on the UN Security Council for their close EU partner.[7][8] French president Jacques Chirac said in a speech in Berlin in 2000 that \\"Germany's engagement, its ranking as a great power, its international influenceFrance would like to see them recognized with a permanent seat on the Security Council\\".[9] The former German Chancellor, Gerhard Schr?der, also identified Russia, among other countries, as a country that backed Germany's bid.[10] Italy and the Netherlands on the contrary, suggest a common European Union (EU) seat in the Council instead of Germany becoming the third European member next to France and the UK. The former German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer said that Germany would also accept a common European seat; however, as long as France and the UK are not willing to give up their own seats, Germany should also have a seat.[10] Thus, the German campaign for a permanent seat was intensified in 2004. Schr?der made himself perfectly clear in August 2004: \\"Germany has the right to a seat.\\"[11] Its bid is supported by Japan, India, Brazil, France, the United Kingdom and Russia, among other countries. Current German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who had initially been quiet on the issue, re-stated Germany's bid in her address to the UN General Assembly in September 2007. In July 2011, Merkel's trip to Kenya, Angola, and Nigeria was thought to be motivated, in part, by the goal of seeking support from African countries for Germany's bid for a permanent seat on the Security Council.[12]","input":"When did germany become a member of the un?"},{"output":"Luc Besson","context":"Luc Besson (French:?[lyk b?s??]; born 18 March 1959) is a French film director, screenwriter, and producer. He directed or produced the films Subway (1985), The Big Blue (1988), and Nikita (1990). Besson is known for his distinctive filmmaking style and is associated with the movement critics call Cinma du look. He has been nominated for a Csar Award for Best Director and Best Picture for his films Lon: The Professional and The Messenger: The Story of Joan of Arc. He won Best Director and Best French Director for his sci-fi action film The Fifth Element (1997). He wrote and directed the 2014 sci-fi thriller film Lucy.\\r\\nIn 1980, he founded his own production company, called Les Films du Loup, and later Les Films du Dauphin?(fr). This was superseded in 2000 by his co-founding EuropaCorp film company with his longtime collaborator, Pierre-Ange Le Pogam?(fr). As writer, director, or producer, Besson has so far been involved in the creation of more than 50 films.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBesson was born in Paris, to parents who both worked as Club Med scuba-diving instructors.[1] Influenced by this milieu, as a child Besson planned to become a marine biologist. He spent much of his youth traveling with his parents to tourist resorts in Italy, SFR Yugoslavia, and Greece.[2] The family returned to France when Besson was 10. His parents promptly divorced and each remarried.\\r\\n\\"Here there is two families, and I am the only bad souvenir of something that doesn't work,\\" he said in the International Herald Tribune. \\"And if I disappear, then everything is perfect. The rage to exist comes from here. I have to do something! Otherwise I am going to die.\\"[3]\\r\\nAt the age of 17, Besson had a diving accident that left him unable to dive.[4]\\r\\n\\"I was 17 and I wondered what I was going to do. ... So I took a piece of paper and on the left I put everything I could do, or had skills for, and all the things I couldn't do. The first line was shorter and I could see that I loved writing, I loved images, I was taking a lot of pictures. So I thought maybe movies would be good. But I thought that to really know I should go to a set. And a friend of mine knew a guy whose brother was a third assistant on a short film. It's true,\\" he said in a 2000 interview with The Guardian.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\"So, I said: 'OK, let's go on the set.' So I went on the set...The day after I went back to see my mum and told her that I was going to make films and stop school and 'bye. And I did it! Very soon after I made a short film and it was very, very bad. I wanted to prove that I could do something, so I made a short film. That was in fact my main concern, to be able to show that I could do one.\\"[5]\\r\\nHe reportedly worked on the first drafts of Le Grand Bleu while still in his teens. Out of boredom, Besson started writing stories, including the background to what he later developed as The Fifth Element (1997), one of his most popular movies.[6] The film is inspired by the French comic books which Besson read as a teenager. Besson directed and co-wrote the screenplay of this science fiction thriller with the screenwriter Robert Mark Kamen.[7]\\r\\nAt 18, Besson returned to his birthplace of Paris. There he took odd jobs in film to get a feel for the industry. He worked as an assistant to directors including Claude Faraldo and Patrick Grandperret. Besson directed three short films, a commissioned documentary, and several commercials.[8]\\r\\nAfter this, he moved to the United States for three years, but returned to Paris, where he formed his own production company. He first named it Les Films du Loup, but changed it to Les Films du Dauphin. In the early 1980s, Besson met ric Serra and asked him to compose the score for his first short film, L'Avant dernier. He later used Serra as a composer for other films of his.\\r\\nSince the late 20th century, Besson has written and produced numerous action movies, including the Taxi (1998ÿ2007) and The Transporter (2002ÿ2008) series, and the Jet Li films Kiss of the Dragon and Unleashed/Danny the Dog. His English-language films Taken, Taken 2 and Taken 3, all starring Liam Neeson, have been major successes, with Taken 2 becoming the largest-grossing export French film. Besson produced the promotional movie for the Paris bid for the 2012 Summer Olympics.\\r\\nBesson won Best Director and Best French Director for his film The Fifth Element (1997). He was nominated for Best Director and Best Picture Csar Awards for his films Lon: The Professional (1994) and The Messenger: The Story of Joan of Arc (1999).\\r\\nFrench actor Jean Reno has appeared in several films by Besson, including Le dernier combat (1985), Subway, The Big Blue (1988), Nikita (1990), and Lon: The Professional (1994).\\r\\nCritics[who?] cite Besson as a pivotal figure in the Cinma du look movement, a specific, highly visual style produced from the 1980s into the early 1990s. Subway (1985), The Big Blue (1988) and Nikita (1990) are all considered to be of this stylistic school. The term was coined by critic Rapha?l Bassan in a 1989 essay in La Revue du Cinema n 449.[9] A partisan of the experimental cinema and friend of the New Wave (\\"nouvelle vague\\") directors, Bassan grouped Besson with Jean-Jacques Beineix and Leos Carax as three directors who shared the style of \\"le look.\\" These directors were later described critically as favoring style over substance, and spectacle over narrative.[10]\\r\\nBesson, along with most of the filmmakers so categorized, was uncomfortable with the label, particularly in light of the achievements of their forebears: France's New Wave. \\"Jean-Luc Godard and Fran?ois Truffaut were rebelling against existing cultural values and used cinema as a means of expression simply because it was the most avant-garde medium at the time,\\" said Besson in a 1985 interview in The New York Times. \\"Today, the revolution is occurring entirely within the industry and is led by people who want to change the look of movies by making them better, more convincing and pleasurable to watch.\\r\\n\\"Because it's becoming increasingly difficult to break into this field, we have developed a psychological armor and are ready to do anything in order to work\\", he added in this same interview. \\"I think our ardor alone is going to shake the pillars of the moviemaking establishment.\\"[11]\\r\\nBesson directed a biopic of Aung San Suu Kyi called The Lady (original title Dans la Lumiere), which was released in the fall of 2011. He also worked on Lockout, which was released in April 2012.[12]\\r\\nMany of Besson's films have achieved popular, if not critical, success. One such release was Le Grand Bleu.\\r\\n\\"When the film had its premiere on opening night at the 1988 Cannes Film Festival, it was mercilessly drubbed, but no matter; it was a smash,\\" observed the International Herald Tribune in a 2007 profile of Besson. \\"Embraced by young people who kept returning to see it again, the movie sold 10?million tickets and quickly became what the French call a 'film gnrationnel,' a defining moment in the culture.\\"[13]\\r\\nBesson created the Arthur series, which comprises Arthur and the Minimoys, Arthur and the Forbidden City, Arthur and the Vengeance of Maltazard and Arthur and the War of the Two Worlds. He directed Arthur and the Invisibles, an adaptation of the first two books of the collection. A film with live action and animation, it was released in the UK and the US and starred Freddie Highmore, Madonna, Snoop Dogg, Mia Farrow, Robert De Niro and David Bowie.\\r\\nBesson has been described as \\"the most Hollywood of French filmmakers.\\"[14] Scott Tobias wrote that his \\"slick, commercial\\" action movies were \\"so interchangeabledrugs, sleaze, chuckling supervillainy, and Hong Kong-style effectsthat each new project probably starts with white-out on the title page.\\"[15]\\r\\nAmerican film critic Armond White has praised Besson, whom he ranks as one of the best film producers, for refining and revolutionizing action film. He wrote that Besson dramatizes the struggle of his characters \\"as a conscientious resistance to human degradation\\".[16]\\r\\nBesson has been married four times; first, in 1986, to actress Anne Parillaud who starred in Besson's Nikita (1990).[citation needed] Besson and Parillaud had a daughter, Juliette, born in 1987. The couple divorced in 1991.\\r\\nBesson's second wife was actress Ma?wenn Le Besco, who was 15 when they began dating in 1991.[17] They were married in late 1992 when Le Besco was pregnant with their daughter Shanna, who was born on 3 January 1993.[18] Le Besco later claimed that their relationship inspired Besson's film Lon (1994), where the plot involved the emotional relationship between an adult man and a 12-year-old girl.[17] Their marriage ended in 1997, when Besson became involved with actress Milla Jovovich during the filming of The Fifth Element (1997). He married the 22-year-old on 14 December 1997, at the age of 38, but they divorced in 1999.[19]\\r\\nOn 28 August 2004, at the age of 45, Besson married film producer Virginie Silla. The couple has three children: Thalia, Sateen, and Mao Besson.[20]\\r\\nAmong Besson's awards are the Brussels International Festival of Fantasy Film Critics Prize, Fantasporto Audience Jury Award-Special Mention, Best Director, and Best Film, for Le Dernier Combat in 1983; the Italian National Syndicate of Film Journalists Silver Ribbon-Best Director-Foreign Film, for La Femme Nikita, 1990; the Alexander Korda Award for Best British Film, Nil by Mouth, 1997; and the Best Director Cesar Award, for The Fifth Element, 1997.[7]\\r\\nIn 2000, Besson superseded his production company by co-founding EuropaCorp with Pierre-Ange Le Pogam, with whom he had frequently worked since 1985. Le Pogam had then been Distribution Director with Gaumont. EuropaCorp has had strong growth based on several English-language films, with international distribution. It has production facilities in Paris, Normandy, and Hollywood, and is establishing distribution partnerships in Japan and China.","input":"Who is the director of the fifth element?"},{"output":"Paul Warfield Tibbets Jr.","context":"World War II:\\r\\nPaul Warfield Tibbets Jr. (23 February 1915 ÿ 1 November 2007) was a brigadier general in the United States Air Force. He is best known as the pilot who flew the Enola Gay (named after his mother) when it dropped Little Boy, the first of two atomic bombs used in warfare, on the Japanese city of Hiroshima.\\r\\nTibbets enlisted in the United States Army in 1937 and qualified as a pilot in 1938. After the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, he flew anti-submarine patrols over the Atlantic. In February 1942, he became the commanding officer of the 340th Bombardment Squadron of the 97th Bombardment Group, which was equipped with the Boeing B-17. In July 1942 the 97th became the first heavy bombardment group to be deployed as part of the Eighth Air Force, and Tibbets became deputy group commander. He flew the lead plane in the first American daylight heavy bomber mission against Occupied Europe on 17 August 1942, and the first American raid of more than 100 bombers in Europe on 9 October 1942. Tibbets was chosen to fly Major General Mark W. Clark and Lieutenant General Dwight D. Eisenhower to Gibraltar. After flying 43 combat missions, he became the assistant for bomber operations on the staff of the Twelfth Air Force.\\r\\nTibbets returned to the United States in February 1943 to help with the development of the Boeing B-29 Superfortress. In September 1944, he was appointed the commander of the 509th Composite Group, which would conduct the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. After the war, he participated in the Operation Crossroads nuclear weapon tests at Bikini Atoll in mid-1946, and was involved in the development of the Boeing B-47 Stratojet in the early 1950s. He commanded the 308th Bombardment Wing and 6th Air Division in the late 1950s, and was military attach in India from 1964 to 1966. After leaving the Air Force in 1966, he worked for Executive Jet Aviation, serving on the founding board and as its president from 1976 until his retirement in 1987.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPaul Warfield Tibbets Jr. was born in Quincy, Illinois, on 23 February 1915, the son of Paul Warfield Tibbets Sr. and his wife, Enola Gay Tibbets. When he was five years old the family moved to Davenport, Iowa, and then to Iowa's capital, Des Moines, where he was raised, and where his father became a confections wholesaler. When he was eight, his family moved to Hialeah, Florida, to escape from harsh midwestern winters. As a boy he was very interested in flying. One day his mother agreed to pay one dollar to get him into an airplane at the local carnival. In 1927, when he was 12 years old, he flew in a plane piloted by barnstormer Doug Davis, dropping candy bars with tiny parachutes to the crowd of people attending the races at the Hialeah Park Race Track.[1][2]\\r\\nIn the late 1920s, business issues forced Tibbets's family to return to Alton, Illinois, where he graduated from Western Military Academy in 1933. He then attended the University of Florida in Gainesville,[1] and became an initiated member of the Epsilon Zeta Chapter of Sigma Nu fraternity in 1934.[3] During that time, Tibbets took private flying lessons at Miami's Opa-locka Airport with Rusty Heard, who later became a captain at Eastern Airlines.[3] After his undergraduate work, Tibbets had planned on becoming an abdominal surgeon. He transferred to the University of Cincinnati after his second year to complete his pre-med studies there, because the University of Florida had no medical school at the time. However, he attended for only a year and a half as he changed his mind about wanting to become a doctor. Instead, he decided to enlist in the United States Army and become a pilot in the United States Army Air Corps.[1]\\r\\nBecause he went to a military school, attended some college, and had some flight experience, Tibbets qualified for the Aviation Cadet Training Program.[4] On 25 February 1937, he enlisted in the army at Fort Thomas, Kentucky, and was sent to Randolph Field in San Antonio, Texas, for primary and basic flight instruction. During his training, he showed himself to be an above-average pilot. He was commissioned as a second lieutenant and received his pilot rating in 1938 at Kelly Field in San Antonio.[1]\\r\\nAfter graduation, Tibbets was assigned to the 16th Observation Squadron, which was based at Lawson Field, Georgia, with a flight supporting the Infantry School at nearby Fort Benning.[1] It was at Fort Benning that Tibbets met Lucy Frances Wingate, then a clerk at a department store in Columbus, Georgia. The two quietly married in a Roman Catholic seminary in Holy Trinity, Alabama on June 19, 1938. Tibbets did not inform his family or his commanding officer, and the couple arranged for the notice to be kept out of the local newspaper.[5] They had two sons. Paul III was born in 1940, in Columbus, Georgia, and graduated from Huntingdon College and Auburn University. He was a colonel in the United States Army Reserves and worked as a hospital pharmacist. He died in West Monroe, Louisiana, in 2016.[6] The younger son, Gene Wingate Tibbets, was born in 1944, and was at the time of his death in 2012 residing in Georgiana in Butler County in southern Alabama.[7][8]\\r\\nWhile Tibbets was stationed at Fort Benning, he was promoted to first lieutenant[9] and served as a personal pilot for Brigadier General George S. Patton, Jr., in 1940 and 1941.[1] In June 1941, Tibbets transferred to the 9th Bombardment Squadron of the 3d Bombardment Group at Hunter Field, Savannah, Georgia, as the engineering officer, and flew the A-20 Havoc.[10] While there he was promoted to captain. In December 1941, he received orders to join the 29th Bombardment Group at MacDill Field, Florida, for training on the Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress. On 7 December 1941, Tibbets heard about the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor while listening to the radio during a routine flight.[9] Due to fears that German U-Boats might enter Tampa Bay and bombard MacDill Field, the 29th Bombardment Group moved to Savannah.[11] Tibbets remained on temporary duty with the 3d Bombardment Group, forming an anti-submarine patrol at Pope Army Airfield, North Carolina, with 21 B-18 Bolo medium bombers.[1] The B-18s were used as an intermediate trainer, which pilots flew after basic flight training in a Cessna UC-78 and before qualifying in the B-17.[12]\\r\\nIn February 1942, Tibbets reported for duty with the 29th Bombardment Group as its engineering officer. Three weeks later he was named the commanding officer of the 340th Bombardment Squadron of the 97th Bombardment Group, equipped with the B-17D.[13] It was initially based at MacDill, and then Sarasota Army Airfield, Florida, before moving to Godfrey Army Airfield in Bangor, Maine.[14]\\r\\nIn July 1942 the 97th became the first heavy bombardment group of the Eighth Air Force to be deployed to England, where it was based at RAF Polebrook.[15] It had been hastily assembled to meet demands for an early deployment, and arrived without any training in the basics of high altitude daylight bombing. In the first weeks of August 1942, under the tutelage of Royal Air Force veterans, the group received intensive training for its first mission. The group commander, Lieutenant Colonel Cornelius W. Cousland,[16] was replaced by Colonel Frank A. Armstrong Jr., who appointed Tibbets as his deputy.[17]\\r\\nTibbets flew the lead bomber Butcher Shop[18] for the first American daylight heavy bomber mission on 17 August 1942, a shallow penetration raid against a marshalling yard in Rouen in Occupied France, with Armstrong as his co-pilot. This was not Tibbets's regular aircraft, Red Gremlin, nor his regular crew, which included bombardier Thomas Ferebee and navigator Theodore Van Kirk, who later flew with him in Enola Gay.[19] On 9 October 1942, Tibbets led the first American raid of more than 100 bombers in Europe, attacking industrial targets in the French city of Lille. Poor bombing accuracy resulted in numerous civilian casualties and less damage to the rail installations than hoped, but the mission was hailed an overall success because it reached its target against heavy and constant fighter attack. Of the 108 aircraft in the raid, 33 were shot down or had to turn back due to mechanical problems.[20][21]\\r\\nOn that first mission, Tibbets saw in real-time that his bombs were falling on innocent civilians. At the time, he thought to himself, \\"People are getting killed down there that don't have any business getting killed. Those are not soldiers.\\" But then he thought back to a lesson he had learned during his time at medical school from his roommate who was a doctor. This doctor explained to him about his former classmates who failed the program and ended up in drug sales. The reason why they had failed the program was because \\"they had too much sympathy for their patients\\", which \\"destroyed their ability to render the medical necessities\\". It dawned on Tibbets that:\\r\\nI am just like that if I get to thinking about some innocent person getting hit on the ground. I am supposed to be a bomber pilot and destroy a target. I wont be worth anything if I do that... I made up my mind then that the morality of dropping that bomb was not my business. I was instructed to perform a military mission to drop the bomb. That was the thing that I was going to do the best of my ability. Morality, there is no such thing in warfare. I dont care whether you are dropping atom bombs, or 100-pound bombs, or shooting a rifle. You have got to leave the moral issue out of it.[22]\\r\\nIn the leadup to Operation Torch, the Allied invasion of North Africa, the commander of the Eighth Air Force, Major General Carl Spaatz was ordered to provide his best two pilots for a secret mission. He chose Tibbets and Major Wayne Connors. Tibbets flew Major General Mark W. Clark from Polebrook to Gibraltar while Connors flew Clark's chief of staff, Brigadier General Lyman Lemnitzer.[23] A few weeks later Tibbets flew the Supreme Allied Commander, Lieutenant General Dwight D. Eisenhower, there.[24] \\"By reputation\\", historian Stephen Ambrose wrote, Tibbets was \\"the best flier in the Army Air Force [sic].\\"[25]\\r\\nTibbets had flown 25 combat missions against targets in France[13] when the 97th Bomb Group was transferred to North Africa as part of Major General Jimmy Doolittle's Twelfth Air Force. For Tibbets, the war in North Africa introduced him to the realities of aerial warfare. He claimed that he saw the real effects of bombing civilians and the trauma of losing his brothers in arms. In January 1943, Tibbets, who had now flown 43 combat missions,[26] was assigned as the assistant for bomber operations to Colonel Lauris Norstad, Assistant Chief of Staff of Operations (A-3) of the Twelfth Air Force.[13] Tibbets had recently been given a battlefield promotion to colonel, but did not receive it, as such promotions had to be confirmed by a panel of officers. He was told that Norstad had vetoed the promotion, saying \\"there's only going to be one colonel in operations.\\"[27]\\r\\nTibbets did not get along well with Norstad, or with Doolittle's chief of staff, Brigadier General Hoyt Vandenberg. In one planning meeting, Norstad wanted an all-out raid on Bizerte to be flown at 6,000 feet (1,800?m). Tibbets protested that flak would be most effective at that altitude. When challenged by Norstad, Tibbets said he would lead the mission himself at 6,000 feet if Norstad would fly as his co-pilot. Norstad backed down, and the mission was successfully flown at 20,000 feet (6,100?m).[28]\\r\\nWhen General Henry H. \\"Hap\\" Arnold, the Chief of United States Army Air Forces, requested an experienced bombardment pilot to help with the development of the Boeing B-29 Superfortress bomber, Doolittle recommended Tibbets.[29] Tibbets returned to the United States in February 1943. At the time, the B-29 program was beset by a host of technical problems, and the chief test pilot, Edmund T. Allen, had been killed in a crash of the prototype aircraft.[30]\\r\\nWorking with the Boeing plant in Wichita, Kansas, Tibbets test-flew the B-29 and soon accumulated more flight time in it than any other pilot. He found that without defensive armament and armor plating, the aircraft was 7,000 pounds (3,200?kg) lighter, and its performance was much improved. In simulated combat engagements against a P-47 fighter at the B-29's cruising altitude of 30,000 feet (9,100?m), he discovered that the B-29 had a smaller turning radius than the P-47, and could avoid it by turning away.[31][32]\\r\\nAfter a year of developmental testing of the B-29, Tibbets was assigned in March 1944 as director of operations of the 17th Bombardment Operational Training Wing (Very Heavy), a B-29 training unit based at Grand Island Army Air Field, Nebraska, and commanded by Armstrong. Its role was to transition pilots to the B-29.[13] Tibbets taught two Women Airforce Service Pilots, Dora Dougherty and Dorothea (Didi) Moorman, to fly the B-29 as demonstration pilots.[33]\\r\\nOn 1 September 1944, Tibbets reported to Colorado Springs Army Airfield, the headquarters of the Second Air Force, where he met with its commander, Major General Uzal Ent, and three representatives of the Manhattan Project, Lieutenant Colonel John Lansdale Jr., Captain William S. Parsons, and Norman F. Ramsey Jr., who briefed him on the project.[34] Tibbets was told that he would be in charge of the 509th Composite Group, a fully self-contained organization of about 1,800 men, which would have 15 B-29s and a high priority for all kinds of military stores. Ent gave Tibbets a choice of three possible bases: Great Bend Army Airfield, Kansas; Mountain Home Army Airfield, Idaho; or Wendover Army Air Field, Utah.[35] Tibbets selected Wendover for its remoteness.[36]\\r\\nWhen the operation was still in its development stages, Armstrong and Colonel Roscoe C. Wilson were the leading candidates to command the group who was designated to drop the atomic bomb. Wilson was the Army Air Force project officer who provided liaison support to the Manhattan Project. Armstrong was an experienced combat veteran against German targets, but he was in his forties and had been severely injured in a fire in the summer of 1943. Wilson had no combat experience and was qualified primarily because of his engineering background and association with the project. Tibbets was considerably younger than both men and had experience in both staff and command duties in heavy bomber combat operations. He was already an experienced B-29 pilot, which made him an ideal candidate for the top-secret project.[37]\\r\\nTibbets was promoted to colonel in January 1945[38] and brought his wife and family along with him to Wendover. He felt that allowing married men in the group to bring their families would improve morale, although it put a strain on his own marriage. In order to disguise all the civilian engineers on base who were working on the Manhattan Project, Tibbets was forced to lie to his wife; he told her that the engineers were \\"sanitary workers.\\" At one point, Tibbets found that Lucy had co-opted a scientist to unplug a drain.[39]\\r\\nOn 6 March 1945 (concurrent with the activation of Project Alberta), the 1st Ordnance Squadron, Special (Aviation) was activated at Wendover, again using Army Air Forces personnel on hand or already at Los Alamos. Its purpose was to provide \\"skilled machinists, welders and munitions workers\\"[40] and special equipment to the group to enable it to assemble atomic weapons at its operating base, thereby allowing the weapons to be transported more safely in their component parts. A rigorous candidate selection process was used to recruit personnel, reportedly with an 80% rejection rate. The 509th Composite Group reached full strength in May 1945.[41]\\r\\nWith the addition of the 1st Ordnance Squadron to its roster in March 1945, the 509th Composite Group had an authorized strength of 225 officers and 1,542 enlisted men, almost all of whom deployed to Tinian, an island in the northern Marianas within striking distance of Japan, in May and June 1945. The 320th Troop Carrier Squadron kept its base of operations at Wendover. In addition to its authorized strength, the 509th had attached to it on Tinian all 51 civilian and military personnel of Project Alberta. Furthermore, two representatives from Washington, D.C. were present on the island:[42] the deputy director of the Manhattan Project, Brigadier General Thomas Farrell, and Rear Admiral William R. Purnell of the Military Policy Committee.[43]\\r\\nThe ground support echelon of the 509th Composite Group received movement orders and moved by rail on 26 April 1945, to its port of embarkation at Seattle, Washington. On May 6 the support elements sailed on the SS Cape Victory for the Marianas, while the group's materiel was shipped on the SS Emile Berliner.[44] An advance party of the air echelon flew by C-54 to North Field, Tinian, between May 15 and 22,[45] where it was joined by the ground echelon on 29 May 1945.[46] Project Alberta's \\"Destination Team\\" also sent most of its members to Tinian to supervise the assembly, loading, and dropping of the bombs under the administrative title of 1st Technical Services Detachment, Miscellaneous War Department Group.[47][48]\\r\\nOn 5 August 1945, Tibbets formally named his B-29 Enola Gay after his mother.[49] Enola Gay had been personally selected by him while it was still on the assembly line at the Glenn L. Martin Company plant in Bellevue, Nebraska.[50] The regularly assigned aircraft commander, Robert A. Lewis, was unhappy to be displaced by Tibbets for this important mission, and became furious when he arrived at the aircraft on the morning of August 6 to see the aircraft he considered his painted with the now-famous nose art. Lewis would fly the mission as Tibbets's co-pilot.[49][51]\\r\\nAt 02:45 the next dayin accordance with the terms of Operations Order No. 35the Enola Gay departed North Field for Hiroshima, Japan, with Tibbets at the controls. Tinian was approximately 2,000 miles (3,200?km) away from Japan, so it took six hours to reach Hiroshima. The atomic bomb, code-named \\"Little Boy\\", was dropped over Hiroshima at 08:15 local time. Tibbets recalled that the city was covered with a tall mushroom cloud after the bomb was dropped.[52]\\r\\nTibbets was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross by Spaatz immediately after landing on Tinian.[53] He became a celebrity, with pictures and interviews of his wife and children in the major American newspapers. He was seen as a national hero who had ended the war with Japan. Tibbets later received an invitation from President Harry S. Truman to visit the White House.[54] The 509th Composite Group was awarded an Air Force Outstanding Unit Award in 1999.[55]\\r\\nTibbets was interviewed extensively by Mike Harden of the Columbus Dispatch, and profiles appeared in the newspaper on anniversaries of the first dropping of an atomic bomb. In a 1975 interview he said: \\"I'm proud that I was able to start with nothing, plan it and have it work as perfectly as it did?... I sleep clearly every night.\\"[56][57] \\"I knew when I got the assignment,\\" he told a reporter in 2005, \\"it was going to be an emotional thing. We had feelings, but we had to put them in the background. We knew it was going to kill people right and left. But my one driving interest was to do the best job I could so that we could end the killing as quickly as possible.\\"[58]\\r\\nThe 509th Composite Group returned to the United States on 6 November 1945, and was stationed at Roswell Army Airfield, New Mexico.[59] Colonel William H. Blanchard replaced Tibbets as group commander on 22 January 1946, and also became the first commander of the 509th Bombardment Wing, the successor to the 509th Composite Group.[60] Tibbets was a technical advisor to the 1946 Operation Crossroads nuclear tests at Bikini Atoll in the Pacific, but he and his Enola Gay crew were not chosen to drop another atomic bomb.[61]\\r\\nTibbets then attended the Air Command and Staff School at Maxwell Air Force Base, Alabama. On graduating in 1947 he was posted to the Directorate of Requirements at Air Force Headquarters at the Pentagon.[13] When the head of the directorate, Brigadier General Thomas S. Power, was posted to London as air attach, he was replaced by Brigadier General Carl Brandt. Brandt appointed Tibbets as director of Directorate of Requirements's Strategic Air Division, which was responsible for drawing up requirements for future bombers. Tibbets was convinced that the bombers of the future would be jet aircraft and thus became involved in the Boeing B-47 Stratojet program.[62] He subsequently served as B-47 project officer at Boeing in Wichita from July 1950 until February 1952. He then became commander of the Proof Test Division at Eglin Air Force Base in Valparaiso, Florida, where flight testing of the B-47 was conducted.[13]\\r\\nTibbets returned to Maxwell Air Force Base, where he attended the Air War College. After he graduated in June 1955, he became Director of War Plans at the Allied Air Forces in Central Europe Headquarters at Fontainebleau, France.[13] He left Lucy and his sons behind in Alabama,[63] and he and Lucy divorced that year.[64] During his posting to France, he met a French divorcee named Andrea Quattrehomme, who became his second wife. He returned to the United States in February 1956 to command the 308th Bombardment Wing at Hunter Air Force Base, Georgia, and married her in the base chapel on 4 May 1956.[65] They had a son, James Tibbets.[66]\\r\\nIn January 1958, Tibbets became commander of the 6th Air Division at MacDill Air Force Base, Florida.[13] and was promoted to brigadier general in 1959.[67] This was followed by another tour of duty at the Pentagon as director of Management Analysis. In July 1962, he was assigned to the Joint Chiefs of Staff as deputy director for operations, and then, in June 1963, as deputy director for the National Military Command System.[13] In 1964, Tibbets was named military attach in India. He spent 22 months there on this posting, which ended in June 1966.[67] He retired from the United States Air Force (USAF) on 31 August 1966.[68]\\r\\nAfter his retirement from the Air Force, Tibbets worked for Executive Jet Aviation (EJA), an air taxi company based in Columbus, Ohio, and now called NetJets. He was one of the founding board members and attempted to extend the company's operations to Europe, but was unsuccessful. He retired from the company in 1968, and returned to Miami, Florida, where he had spent part of his childhood. The banks foreclosed on EJA in 1970, and Bruce Sundlun became president. Sundlun lured Tibbets back to EJA that year. Tibbets succeeded Sundlun as president on 21 April 1976, and remained in the role until 1986. He served for a year as a consultant before his second and final retirement from EJA in 1987.[8][57][69]\\r\\nBarry Nelson played Tibbets in the film The Beginning or the End (1947).[70] Above and Beyond (1952) depicted the World War II events that involved Tibbets; Robert Taylor starred as Tibbets and Eleanor Parker played the role of his first wife Lucy.[71] Tibbets was also the model for screenwriter Sy Bartlett's fictional character \\"Major Joe Cobb\\" in the film Twelve O'Clock High (1949), and for a brief period in February 1949 was slated to be the film's technical advisor until his replacement at the last minute by Colonel John H. deRussy.[72] Enola Gay: The Men, the Mission, the Atomic Bomb, a 1980 made-for-television movie, somewhat fictionalized, told the story of Tibbets crew. Patrick Duffy played Tibbets and Kim Darby played Lucy.[73]\\r\\nIn other fictional portrayals, Nicholas Kilbertus was Tibbets in the film Day One (1989),[74] David Gow played him in the TV movie Hiroshima (1995),[75] and Ian Shaw played the part in the BBC's TV docudrama Hiroshima (2005), for which Tibbets was also interviewed on camera.[76] An interview with Tibbets also appeared in the movie Atomic Cafe (1982),[77] as well as was in the 1970s British documentary series The World at War,[78] and the \\"Men Who Brought the Dawn\\" episode of the Smithsonian Networks' War Stories (1995).[79] Tibbets figured largely in the 2000 book Duty: A Father, His Son and the Man Who Won the War by Bob Greene of the Chicago Tribune.[80]\\r\\nIn 1976, the United States government apologized to Japan after Tibbets re-enacted the bombingcomplete with a mushroom cloudin a restored B-29 at an air show in Texas. He said that he had not intended for the re-enactment to insult the Japanese people.[56][81] In 1995, he denounced the 50th anniversary exhibition of the Enola Gay at the Smithsonian Institution, which attempted to present the bombing in context with the destruction it caused, as a \\"damn big insult\\",[56] due to its focus on the Japanese casualties rather than the brutality of the Japanese government.[56] He was inducted into the National Aviation Hall of Fame in 1996.[68]\\r\\nTibbets's grandson Paul W. Tibbets IV graduated from the United States Air Force Academy in 1989, and in April 2006 became commander of the 393d Bomb Squadron, flying the B-2 Spirit at Whiteman AFB, Missouri. The squadron was one of the two operational squadrons that had formed part of the 509th Composite Group when Tibbets commanded it. Paul Tibbets IV was promoted to brigadier general in 2014, and became Deputy Director for Nuclear Operations at the Global Operations Directorate of the United States Strategic Command at Offutt Air Force Base in Nebraska. As such, he was responsible for America's strategic nuclear forces.[82] On 5 June 2015, he assumed command of the 509th Bomb Wing.[83]\\r\\nTibbets died in his Columbus, Ohio, home on 1 November 2007, at the age of 92.[56][84] He had suffered small strokes and heart failure during his final years and had been in hospice care.[8][85] He was survived by his French-born wife, Andrea,[81] and two sons from his first marriage, Paul III and Gene as well as his son, James, from his second marriage.[8][85] Tibbets had asked for no funeral or headstone, because he feared that opponents of the bombing might use it as a place of protest or destruction. In accordance with his wishes, his body was cremated,[86] and his ashes were scattered over the English Channel;[87] he had flown over the Channel many times during the war.[85]\\r\\nSource: Ohio History Central.[88]","input":"Who was the pilot that dropped the atomic bomb on hiroshima?"},{"output":"Android 9 Pie","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe version history of the Android mobile operating system began with the public release of the Android beta on November 5, 2007.

Other changes include improvements to the notifications, which can be accessed from the lockscreen and displayed within applications as top-of-the-screen banners. Furthermore, Google made internal changes to the platform, with the Android Runtime (ART) officially replacing Dalvik for improved application performance, and with changes intended to improve and optimize battery usage, known internally as Project Volta.[175][176][177][178]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe main hardware platform for Android is the ARM architecture (ARMv7 and ARMv8-A architectures; formerly also ARMv5), with x86[c] and MIPS[d] architectures also officially supported in later versions of Android, but MIPS support has since been deprecated and support was removed in NDK r17.[242]\\r\\n\\r\\nUnofficial Android-x86 project used to provide support for the x86 and MIPS architectures ahead of the official support.[243][244]\\r\\nIn 2012, Android devices with Intel processors began to appear, including phones[245] and tablets. While gaining support for 64-bit platforms, Android was first made to run on 64-bit x86 and then on ARM64.[246][247] Since Android?5.0 Lollipop, 64-bit variants of all platforms are supported in addition to the 32-bit variants.\\r\\n\\r\\nRequirements for the minimum amount of RAM for devices running Android?7.1 depend on screen size and density and type of CPU, ranging from 816?MBÿ1.8?GB for 64-bit and 512?MBÿ1.3?GB for 32-bit meaning in practice 1?GB for the most common type of display (while minimum for Android watch is 416?MB).[248] The recommendation for Android?4.4 is to have at least 512?MB of RAM,[249] while for \\"low RAM\\" devices 340?MB is the required minimum amount that does not include memory dedicated to various hardware components such as the baseband processor.[147]  Android 4.4 requires a 32-bit ARMv7, MIPS or x86 architecture processor (latter two through unofficial ports),[243][244] together with an OpenGL ES 2.0 compatible graphics processing unit (GPU).[250] Android supports OpenGL ES 1.1, 2.0, 3.0, 3.2 and since Android 7.0 Vulkan (and version 1.1 available for some devices[251]). Some applications may explicitly require a certain version of the OpenGL ES, and suitable GPU hardware is required to run such applications.[250]\\r\\n\\r\\nAndroid used to require an autofocus camera, which was relaxed to a fixed-focus camera.[252]","input":"What is the latest operating system for android?"},{"output":"1928 to 1932","context":"Vitamin C, also known as ascorbic acid and L-ascorbic acid, is a vitamin found in food and used as a dietary supplement.[1] The disease scurvy is prevented and treated with vitamin C-containing foods or dietary supplements.[1] Evidence does not support use in the general population for the prevention of the common cold.[2][3] There is, however, some evidence that regular use may shorten the length of colds.[4] It is unclear if supplementation affects the risk of cancer, cardiovascular disease, or dementia.[5][6] It may be taken by mouth or by injection.[1]\\r\\nVitamin C is generally well tolerated.[1] Large doses may cause gastrointestinal discomfort, headache, trouble sleeping, and flushing of the skin.[1][3] Normal doses are safe during pregnancy.[7] The United States Institute of Medicine recommends against taking large doses.[8]\\r\\nVitamin C is an essential nutrient involved in the repair of tissue and the enzymatic production of certain neurotransmitters.[1][8] It is required for the functioning of several enzymes and is important for immune system function.[8][9] It also functions as an antioxidant.[2] Foods containing vitamin C include citrus fruits, broccoli, Brussels sprouts, raw bell peppers, and strawberries.[2] Prolonged storage or cooking may reduce vitamin C content in foods.[2]\\r\\nVitamin C was discovered in 1912, isolated in 1928, and in 1933 was the first vitamin to be chemically produced.[10] It is on the World Health Organization Model List of Essential Medicines, the most effective and safe medicines needed in a health system.[11] Vitamin C is available as a generic medication and over-the-counter drug.[1] In 2015, the wholesale cost in the developing world was less than US$0.01 per tablet.[12] Partly for its discovery, Albert Szent-Gy?rgyi and Walter Norman Haworth were awarded 1937 Nobel Prizes in Physiology and Medicine and Chemistry, respectively.[13][14]\\r\\nVitamin C is an essential nutrient for certain animals including humans. The term vitamin C encompasses several vitamers that have vitamin C activity in animals. Ascorbate salts such as sodium ascorbate and calcium ascorbate are used in some dietary supplements. These release ascorbate upon digestion. Ascorbate and ascorbic acid are both naturally present in the body, since the forms interconvert according to pH. Oxidized forms of the molecule such as dehydroascorbic acid are converted back to ascorbic acid by reducing agents.[8]\\r\\nVitamin C is a cofactor in at least eight enzymatic reactions in animals (and humans) important in many essential functions, including wound healing. In humans, vitamin C deficiency compromises collagen synthesis, contributing to the more severe symptoms of scurvy.[8] More generally, the biochemical role of vitamin C is to act as an antioxidant, a reducing agent, donating electrons to various enzymatic and non-enzymatic reactions.[8] Doing so converts vitamin C to an oxidized state - either as semidehydroascorbic acid or dehydroascorbic acid. These compounds can be restored to a reduced state by glutathione and NADPH-dependent enzymatic mechanisms.[15][16][17]\\r\\nIn plants, vitamin C is a substrate for ascorbate peroxidase. This enzyme utilizes ascorbate to neutralize toxic hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) by converting it to water (H2O).[9][18]\\r\\nScurvy is an avitaminosis resulting from lack of vitamin C, since without this vitamin, collagen made by the body is too unstable to perform its function.[9]\\r\\nScurvy leads to the formation of brown spots on the skin, spongy gums, and bleeding from all mucous membranes. The spots are most abundant on the thighs and legs, and a person with the ailment looks pale, feels depressed, and is partially immobilized. In advanced scurvy there are open, suppurating wounds and loss of teeth and, eventually, death. The human body can store only a certain amount of vitamin C,[19] and so the body stores are depleted if fresh supplies are not consumed. The time frame for onset of symptoms of scurvy in unstressed adults on a completely vitamin C free diet, however, may range from one month to more than six months, depending on previous loading of vitamin C.[20][21]\\r\\nNotable human dietary studies of experimentally induced scurvy have been conducted on conscientious objectors during World War II in Britain and on Iowa state prisoners in the late 1960s to the 1980s. These studies both found that all obvious symptoms of scurvy previously induced by an experimental scorbutic diet with extremely low vitamin C content could be completely reversed by additional vitamin C supplementation of only 10?mg a day. In these experiments, there was no clinical difference noted between men given 70?mg vitamin C per day (which produced blood level of vitamin C of about 0.55?mg/dl, about 1/3 of tissue saturation levels) and those given 10?mg per day. Men in the prison study developed the first signs of scurvy about four weeks after starting the vitamin C-free diet, whereas in the British study, six to eight months were required, possibly due to the pre-loading of this group with a 70?mg/day supplement for six weeks before the scorbutic diet was fed.[20][21]\\r\\nMen in both studies on a diet devoid, or nearly devoid, of vitamin C had blood levels of vitamin C too low to be accurately measured when they developed signs of scurvy, and in the Iowa study, at this time were estimated (by labeled vitamin C dilution) to have a body pool of less than 300?mg, with daily turnover of only 2.5?mg/day, implying an instantaneous half-life of 83 days by this time (elimination constant of 4 months).[20]\\r\\nVitamin C has a definitive role in treating scurvy, which is a disease caused by vitamin C deficiency. Beyond that, a role for vitamin C as prevention or treatment for various diseases is disputed, with reviews reporting conflicting results. A 2012 Cochrane review reported no effect of vitamin C supplementation on overall mortality.[22] It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines as one of the most effective and safe medicines needed in a health system.[11]\\r\\nThe disease scurvy is caused by vitamin C deficiency and can be prevented and treated with vitamin C containing foods or dietary supplements.[1][8] It takes at least a month of little to no vitamin C before symptoms occur.[20] Early symptoms are malaise and lethargy, progressing to shortness of breath, bone pain, bleeding gums, susceptibility to bruising, poor wound healing, and finally fever, convulsions and eventual death.[1] Until quite late in the disease the damage is reversible, as with vitamin C repletion, healthy collagen replaces the defective collagen. Treatment can be orally or by intramuscular or intravenous injection.[1] Scurvy was known to Hippocrates in the classical era. The disease was shown to be prevented by citrus fruit in an early controlled trial by a Royal Navy surgeon, James Lind, in 1747, and from 1796 lemon juice was issued to all Royal Navy crewmen.[23][24]\\r\\nThe effect of vitamin C on the common cold has been extensively researched. The earliest publication of a controlled clinical trial appears to be from 1945.[25] Researchers continued to work on this question, but research interest and public interest spiked after Linus Pauling, two-time awardee of the Nobel Prize (Chemistry Prize, 1954, Peace Prize 1962), started publishing research on the topic and also published a book \\"Vitamin C and the Common Cold\\" in 1970.[26] A revised and expanded edition \\"Vitamin C, the Common Cold and the Flu\\" was published in 1976.[27]\\r\\nThe most recent meta-analysis, a Cochrane Review published in 2013, with inclusion criteria limited to trials that called for at least 200?mg/day, concluded that vitamin C taken on a regular basis was not effective in prevention of the common cold. Limiting inclusion to trials that called for at least 1000?mg/day made no difference. However, taking vitamin C on a regular basis did reduce average duration by 8% in adults and 14% in children, and also reduced severity of colds.[4] A subset of trials reported that supplementation reduced the incidence of colds by half in marathon runners, skiers, or soldiers in subarctic conditions.[4] Another subset of trials looked at therapeutic use, meaning that vitamin C was not started unless the people started to feel the beginnings of a cold. In these, vitamin C did not impact duration or severity.[4] An earlier review stated that vitamin C did not prevent colds, did reduce duration, did not reduce severity.[28] The authors of the Cochrane review concluded that \\"...given the consistent effect of vitamin C on the duration and severity of colds in the regular supplementation studies, and the low cost and safety, it may be worthwhile for common cold patients to test on an individual basis whether therapeutic vitamin C is beneficial for them.\\"[4]\\r\\nVitamin C distributes readily in high concentrations into immune cells, has antimicrobial and natural killer cell activities, promotes lymphocyte proliferation, and is consumed quickly during infections, effects indicating a prominent role in immune system regulation.[29] The European Food Safety Authority found a cause and effect relationship exists between the dietary intake of vitamin C and functioning of a normal immune system in adults and in children under three years of age.[30][31]\\r\\nThere are two approaches to the question of whether vitamin C has an impact on cancer. First, within the normal range of dietary intake without additional dietary supplementation, are people who consume more vitamin C at lower risk for developing cancer, and if so, does an orally consumed supplement have the same benefit? Second, for people diagnosed with cancer, will large amounts of ascorbic acid administered intravenously treat the cancer, reduce the adverse effects of other treatments, and so prolong survival and improve quality of life? A 2013 Cochrane review found no evidence that vitamin C supplementation reduces the risk of lung cancer in healthy or high risk (smokers and asbestos-exposed) people.[32] A 2014 meta-analysis found that vitamin C intake might protect against lung cancer risk.[33] A second meta-analysis found no effect on the risk of prostate cancer.[34] Two meta-analyses evaluated the effect of vitamin C supplementation on the risk of colorectal cancer. One found a weak association between vitamin C consumption and reduced risk, and the other found no effect of supplementation.[35][36] A 2011 meta-analysis failed to find support for the prevention of breast cancer with vitamin C supplementation,[37] but a second study concluded that vitamin C may be associated with increased survival in those already diagnosed.[38]\\r\\nUnder the rubric of orthomolecular medicine, \\"Intravenous vitamin C is a contentious adjunctive cancer therapy, widely used in naturopathic and integrative oncology settings.\\" [39] With oral administration absorption efficiency decreases as amounts increase. Intravenous administration bypasses this.[40] Doing so makes it possible to achieve plasma concentrations of 5 to 10 millimoles/liter (mmol/L), which far exceed the approximately 0.2?mmol/L limit from oral consumption.[41] The theories of mechanism are contradictory. At high tissue concentrations, ascorbic acid is described as acting as a pro-oxidant, generating hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) to kill tumor cells. The same literature claims that ascorbic acid acts as an antioxidant, thereby reducing the adverse effects of chemotherapy and radiation therapy.[39][40] Research continues in this field, but a 2014 review concluded: \\"Currently, the use of high-dose intravenous vitamin C [as an anticancer agent] cannot be recommended outside of a clinical trial.\\"[42] A 2015 review added: \\"There is no high-quality evidence to suggest that ascorbate supplementation in cancer patients either enhances the antitumor effects of chemotherapy or reduces its toxicity. Evidence for ascorbate's anti-tumor effects was limited to case reports and observational and uncontrolled studies.\\"[43]\\r\\nA 2013 meta-analysis found no evidence that vitamin C supplementation reduces the risk of myocardial infarction, stroke, cardiovascular mortality, or all-cause mortality.[5] However, a second analysis found an inverse relationship between circulating vitamin C levels or dietary vitamin C and the risk of stroke.[44]\\r\\nA meta-analysis of 44 clinical trials has shown a significant positive effect of vitamin C on endothelial function when taken at doses greater than 500?mg per day. The endothelium is a layer of cells that line the interior surface of blood vessels. Endothelial dysfunction is implicated in many aspects of vascular diseases. The researchers noted that the effect of vitamin C supplementation appeared to be dependent on health status, with stronger effects in those at higher cardiovascular disease risk.[45]\\r\\nStudies examining the effects of vitamin C intake on the risk of Alzheimer's disease have reached conflicting conclusions.[46][47] Maintaining a healthy dietary intake is probably more important than supplementation for achieving any potential benefit.[48] A 2010 review found no role for vitamin C supplementation in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis.[49] Vitamin C supplementation does not prevent or slow the progression of age-related cataract.[50]\\r\\nMore than two to three grams may cause indigestion, particularly when taken on an empty stomach. However, taking vitamin C in the form of sodium ascorbate and calcium ascorbate may minimize this effect.[27] Other symptoms reported for large dose include nausea, abdominal cramps and diarrhea. These effects are attributed to the osmotic effect of unabsorbed vitamin C passing through the intestine.[8] In theory, high vitamin C intake may cause excessive absorption of iron. A summary of reviews of supplementation in healthy subjects did not report this problem, but left as untested the possibility that individuals with hereditary hemochromatosis might be adversely affected.[8] There is a longstanding belief among the mainstream medical community that vitamin C increases risk of kidney stones.[51] \\"Reports of kidney stone formation associated with excess ascorbic acid intake are limited to individuals with renal disease\\".[8] Reviews state that \\"data from epidemiological studies do not support an association between excess ascorbic acid intake and kidney stone formation in apparently healthy individuals\\",[8][52] although one large, multi-year trial did report a nearly two-fold increase in kidney stones in men who regularly consumed a vitamin C supplement.[53] Vitamin C is a water-soluble vitamin,[19] with dietary excesses not absorbed, and excesses in the blood rapidly excreted in the urine, so it exhibits remarkably low acute toxicity.[9]\\r\\nRecommendations for vitamin C intake by adults have been set by various national agencies:\\r\\nIn 2000 the North American Dietary Reference Intake chapter on vitamin C updated the Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) to 90 milligrams per day for adult men and 75?mg/day for adult women, and set a Tolerable upper intake level (UL) for adults of 2,000?mg/day.[8] The table shows RDAs for the United States and Canada for children, and for pregnant and lactating women.[8] For the European Union, the EFSA set higher recommendations for adults, and also for children: 20?mg/day for ages 1ÿ3, 30?mg/day for ages 4ÿ6, 45?mg/day for ages 7ÿ10, 70?mg/day for ages 11ÿ14, 100?mg/day for males ages 15ÿ17, 90?mg/day for females ages 15ÿ17. For pregnancy 100?mg/day; for lactation 155?mg/day.[59] India, on the other hand, has set recommendations much lower: 40?mg/day for ages 1 through adult, 60?mg/day for pregnancy, and 80?mg/day for lactation.[54] Clearly, there is not consensus among countries.\\r\\nCigarette smokers and people exposed to secondhand smoke have lower plasma vitamin C levels than nonsmokers. The thinking is that inhalation of smoke causes oxidative damage, depleting this antioxidant vitamin.[8][58]. The U.S. Institute of Medicine estimated that smokers need 35 mg more vitamin C per day than nonsmokers, but did not formally establish a higher RDA for smokers.[8] One meta-analysis showed an inverse relationship between vitamin C intake and lung cancer, although it concluded that more research is needed to confirm this observation.[60]\\r\\nThe U.S. National Center for Health Statistics conducts biannual National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) to assess the health and nutritional status of adults and children in the United States. Some results are reported as What We Eat In America. The 2013-2014 survey reported that for adults ages 20 years and older, men consumed on average 83.3?mg/d and women 75.1?mg/d. This means that half the women and more than half the men are not consuming the RDA for vitamin C.[61] The same survey stated that about 30% of adults reported they consumed a vitamin C dietary supplement or a multi-vitamin/mineral supplement that included vitamin C, and that for these people total consumption was between 300 and 400?mg/d.[62]\\r\\nIn 2000 the Institute of Medicine of the U.S. National Academy of Sciences set a Tolerable upper intake level (UL) for adults of 2,000?mg/day. The amount was chosen because human trials had reported diarrhea and other gastrointestinal disturbances at intakes of greater than 3,000?mg/day. This was the Lowest-Observed-Adverse-Effect Level (LOAEL), meaning that other adverse effects were observed at higher intakes.[8] The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) reviewed the safety question in 2006 and reached the conclusion that there was not sufficient evidence to set a UL for vitamin C.[63] The Japan National Institute of Health and Nutrition reviewed the same question in 2010 and also reached the conclusion that there was not sufficient evidence to set a UL.[58]\\r\\nFor U.S. food and dietary supplement labeling purposes the amount in a serving is expressed as a percent of Daily Value (%DV). For vitamin C labeling purposes 100% of the Daily Value was 60?mg, but as of May 27, 2016 it was revised to 90?mg to bring it into agreement with the RDA.[64] A table of the old and new adult Daily Values is provided at Reference Daily Intake. Food and supplement companies have until January 1, 2020 to comply with the change.[65] European Union regulations require that labels declare energy, protein, fat, saturated fat, carbohydrates, sugars, and salt. Voluntary nutrients may be shown if present in significant amounts. Instead of Daily Values, amounts are shown as percent of Reference Intakes (RIs). For vitamin C, 100% RI was set at 80?mg in 2011.[66]\\r\\nThe richest natural sources are fruits and vegetables.[9] Vitamin C is the most widely taken nutritional supplement and is available in a variety of forms,[9] including tablets, drink mixes, and in capsules.\\r\\nVitamin C is absorbed by the intestines using a sodium-ion dependent channel. It is transported through the intestine via both glucose-sensitive and glucose-insensitive mechanisms. The presence of large quantities of sugar either in the intestines or in the blood can slow absorption.[67]\\r\\nWhile plants are generally a good source of vitamin C, the amount in foods of plant origin depends on the precise variety of the plant, soil condition, climate where it grew, length of time since it was picked, storage conditions, and method of preparation.[68]\\r\\nThe following table is approximate and shows the relative abundance in different raw plant sources.[69][70] As some plants were analyzed fresh while others were dried (thus, artifactually increasing concentration of individual constituents like vitamin C), the data are subject to potential variation and difficulties for comparison. The amount is given in milligrams per 100?grams of fruit or vegetable:\\r\\nAnimal-sourced foods do not provide much vitamin C, and what there is, is destroyed by the heat of cooking. For example, raw chicken liver contains 17.9?mg/100 g, but fried, the content is reduced to 2.7?mg/100 g. Chicken eggs contain no vitamin C, raw or cooked.[79] Vitamin C is present in human breast milk at 5.0?mg/100 g and 6.1?mg/100 g in one tested sample of infant formula, but cow's milk contains only 1.0?mg/ 100 g.[80]\\r\\nVitamin C chemically decomposes under certain conditions, many of which may occur during the cooking of food. Vitamin C concentrations in various food substances decrease with time in proportion to the temperature at which they are stored[81] and cooking can reduce the vitamin C content of vegetables by around 60% possibly partly due to increased enzymatic destruction as it may be more significant at sub-boiling temperatures.[82] Longer cooking times also add to this effect, as will copper food vessels, which catalyse the decomposition.[83]\\r\\nAnother cause of vitamin C being lost from food is leaching, where the water-soluble vitamin dissolves into the cooking water, which is later poured away and not consumed. However, vitamin C does not leach in all vegetables at the same rate; research shows broccoli seems to retain more than any other.[84] Research has also shown that freshly cut fruits do not lose significant nutrients when stored in the refrigerator for a few days.[85]\\r\\nVitamin C dietary supplements are available as tablets, capsules, drink mix packets, in multi-vitamin/mineral formulations, in antioxidant formulations, and as crystalline powder.[1] Vitamin C is also added to some fruit juices and juice drinks. Tablet and capsule content ranges from 25?mg to 1500?mg per serving. The most commonly used supplement compounds are ascorbic acid, sodium ascorbate and calcium ascorbate.[1] Vitamin C molecules can also be bound to the fatty acid palmitate, creating ascorbyl palmitate, or else incorporated into liposomes.[86]\\r\\nIn 2014, the Canadian Food Inspection Agency evaluated the effect of fortification of foods with ascorbate in the guidance document, Foods to Which Vitamins, Mineral Nutrients and Amino Acids May or Must be Added.[87] Voluntary and mandatory fortification was described for various classes of foods. Among foods classified for mandatory fortification with vitamin C were fruit-flavored drinks, mixes, and concentrates, foods for a low-energy diet, meal replacement products, and evaporated milk.[87]\\r\\nFrom the U.S. National Institutes of Health: [In humans] \\"Approximately 70%ÿ90% of vitamin C is absorbed at moderate intakes of 30ÿ180 mg/day. However, at doses above 1,000 mg/day, absorption falls to less than 50%.\\"[2]\\r\\nAscorbic acid is absorbed in the body by both active transport and simple diffusion. Sodium-Dependent Active TransportSodium-Ascorbate Co-Transporters (SVCTs) and Hexose transporters (GLUTs)are the two transporter proteins required for active absorption. SVCT1 and SVCT2 import the reduced form of ascorbate across plasma membranes.[88] GLUT1 and GLUT3 are glucose transporters, and transfer only the dehydroascorbic acid (DHA) form of vitamin C.[89] Although dehydroascorbic acid is absorbed in higher rate than ascorbate, the amount of dehydroascorbic acid found in plasma and tissues under normal conditions is low, as cells rapidly reduce dehydroascorbic acid to ascorbate.[90]\\r\\nSVCTs appear to be the predominant system for vitamin C transport in the body,[88] the notable exception being red blood cells, which lose SVCT proteins during maturation.[91] In both vitamin C synthesizers (example: rat) and non-synthesizers (example: human) cells with few exceptions maintain ascorbic acid concentrations much higher than the approximately 50 micromoles/liter (mol/L) found in plasma. For example, the ascorbic acid content of pituitary and adrenal glands can exceed 2,000 mol/L, and muscle is at 200-300 mol/L.[92] The known coenzymatic functions of ascorbic acid do not require such high concentrations, so there may be other, as yet unknown functions. Consequences of all this organ content is that plasma vitamin C is not a good indicator of whole-body status, and people may vary in the amount of time needed to show symptoms of deficiency when consuming a diet very low in vitamin C.[92]\\r\\nExcretion, can be as ascorbic acid, via urine. In humans, during times of low dietary intake, vitamin C is reabsorbed by the kidneys rather than excreted. Only when plasma concentrations are 1.4?mg/dL or higher does re-absorption decline and the excess amounts pass freely into the urine. This salvage process delays onset of deficiency.[93] Ascorbic acid also converts (reversibly) to dehydroascorbate (DHA) and from that compound non-reversibly to 2,3-diketogluonate and then oxalate. These three compounds are also excreted via urine. Humans are better than guinea pigs at converting DHA back to ascorbate, and thus take much longer to become vitamin C deficient.[94]\\r\\nAscorbic acid performs numerous physiological functions in the human body. These functions include the synthesis of collagen, carnitine, and neurotransmitters; the synthesis and catabolism of tyrosine; and the metabolism of microsome.[17] During biosynthesis ascorbate acts as a reducing agent, donating electrons and preventing oxidation to keep iron and copper atoms in their reduced states.\\r\\nVitamin C acts as an electron donor for eight enzymes:[95]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe name \\"vitamin C\\" always refers to the L-enantiomer of ascorbic acid and its oxidized forms, such as dehydroascorbate (DHA). Therefore, unless written otherwise, \\"ascorbate\\" and \\"ascorbic acid\\" refer in the nutritional literature to L-ascorbate and L-ascorbic acid respectively. Ascorbic acid is a weak sugar acid structurally related to glucose. In biological systems, ascorbic acid can be found only at low pH, but in solutions above pH 5 is predominantly found in the ionized form, ascorbate. All of these molecules have vitamin C activity and thus are used synonymously with vitamin C, unless otherwise specified.\\r\\nNumerous analytical methods have been developed for ascorbic acid detection. For example, vitamin C content of a food sample such as fruit juice can be calculated by measuring the volume of the sample required to decolorize a solution of dichlorophenolindophenol (DCPIP) and then calibrating the results by comparison with a known concentration of vitamin C.[107][108]\\r\\nSimple tests are available to measure the levels of vitamin C in the urine and in serum or blood plasma. However these reflect recent dietary intake rather than total body content.[8] It has been observed that while serum or blood plasma concentrations follow a circadian rhythm or reflect short-term dietary impact, content within tissues is more stable and can give a better view of the availability of ascorbate within the entire organism. However, very few hospital laboratories are adequately equipped and trained to carry out such detailed analyses.[109][110]\\r\\nThe vast majority of animals and plants are able to synthesize vitamin C, through a sequence of enzyme-driven steps, which convert monosaccharides to vitamin C. In plants, this is accomplished through the conversion of mannose or galactose to ascorbic acid.[111] In some animals, glucose needed to produce ascorbate in the liver (in mammals and perching birds) is extracted from glycogen; ascorbate synthesis is a glycogenolysis-dependent process.[112]\\r\\nAmong the mammals that have lost the ability to synthesize vitamin C are simians and tarsiers, which together make up one of two major primate suborders, Haplorrhini. This group includes humans. The other more primitive primates (Strepsirrhini) have the ability to make vitamin C. Synthesis does not occur in a number of species (perhaps all species) in the small rodent family Caviidae that includes guinea pigs and capybaras, but occurs in other rodents (rats and mice do not need vitamin C in their diet, for example).[113]\\r\\nIn reptiles and birds the biosynthesis is carried out in the kidneys. A number of species of passerine birds also do not synthesize, but not all of them, and those that do not are not clearly related; there is a theory that the ability was lost separately a number of times in birds.[114] In particular, the ability to synthesize vitamin C is presumed to have been lost and then later re-acquired in at least two cases.[115] The ability to synthesize vitamin C has also been lost in about 96% of fish (the teleosts).[114]\\r\\nMost tested families of bats (order Chiroptera), including major insect and fruit-eating bat families, cannot synthesize vitamin C. A trace of gulonolactone oxidase (GULO) was detected in only 1 of 34 bat species tested, across the range of 6 families of bats tested.[116] There are at least two species of bats, frugivorous bat (Rousettus leschenaultii) and insectivorous bat (Hipposideros armiger), that retain (or regained) their ability of vitamin C production.[117][118]\\r\\nThese animals all lack the L-gulonolactone oxidase (GULO) enzyme, which is required in the last step of vitamin C synthesis. The genomes of these species contain GULO as pseudogenes, which serve as insight into the evolutionary past of the species.[119][120][121]\\r\\nSome of these species (including humans) are able to make do with the lower levels available from their diets by recycling oxidised vitamin C.[122]\\r\\nMost simians consume the vitamin in amounts 10 to 20 times higher than that recommended by governments for humans.[123] This discrepancy constitutes much of the basis of the controversy on current recommended dietary allowances. It is countered by arguments that humans are very good at conserving dietary vitamin C, and are able to maintain blood levels of vitamin C comparable with simians on a far smaller dietary intake, perhaps by recycling oxidized vitamin C.[122]\\r\\nIn vertebrates that can synthesize ascorbic acid, the biosynthesis pathway starts with glucose, either taking place in the liver for mammals and some birds, or the kidneys for amphibians, reptiles and some birds.[124] The pathway is the same. Several enzymes catalyze steps from D-glucose to D-glucuronate. Next, the enzyme glucuronate reductase converts D-glucuronate to L-gluconate. Then the enzyme gulonolactonase converts L-gluconate to L-gulonolactone. The final enzymatic conversion is by the enzyme L-gulonolactone oxidase (GLO), to 2-keto-gulonolactone. From this compound, the last step is a spontaneous, i.e., non-enzymatic conversion to ascorbic acid (vitamin C). GLO is the enzyme that is absent in animal species unable to synthesize vitamin C.[94]\\r\\nAll plants synthesize ascorbic acid. Ascorbic acid functions as a cofactor for enzymes involved in photosynthesis, synthesis of plant hormones, as an antioxidant and also regenerator of other antioxidants.[125] Plants use multiple pathways to synthesize vitamin C. The major pathway starts with glucose, fructose or mannose (all simple sugars) and proceeds to L-galactose, L-galaconolactone and ascorbic acid.[125][126] There is feedback regulation in place, in that the presence of ascorbic acid suppresses enzymes in the synthesis pathway.[127] This process follows a diurnal rhythm, so that enzyme expression peaks in the morning to support biosynthesis later on when mid-day sunlight intensity demands high ascorbic acid concentrations.[126] Minor pathways may be specific to certain parts of plants; these can be either identical to the vertebrate pathway (including the GLO enzyme), or start with inositol and get to ascorbic acid via L-galactonic acid to L-galactonolactone.[125]\\r\\nAscorbic acid is a common enzymatic cofactor in mammals used in the synthesis of collagen, as well as a powerful reducing agent capable of rapidly scavenging a number of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Given that ascorbate has these important functions, it is surprising that the ability to synthesize this molecule has not always been conserved. In fact, anthropoid primates, Cavia porcellus (guinea pigs), teleost fishes, most bats, and some Passeriform birds have all independently lost the ability to internally synthesize Vitamin C in either the kidney or the liver.[128] In all of the cases where genomic analysis was done on an ascorbic acid auxotroph, the origin of the change was found to be a result of loss-of-function mutations in the gene that codes for L-Gulono--lactone oxidase, the enzyme that catalyzes the last step of the ascorbic acid pathway outlined above.[129]\\r\\nIn the case of the simians, it is thought that the loss of the ability to make vitamin C may have occurred much farther back in evolutionary history than the emergence of humans or even apes, since it evidently occurred soon after the appearance of the first primates, yet sometime after the split of early primates into the two major suborders Haplorrhini (which cannot make vitamin C) and its sister suborder of non-tarsier prosimians, the Strepsirrhini (\\"wet-nosed\\" primates), which retained the ability to make vitamin C.[130] According to molecular clock dating, these two suborder primate branches parted ways about 63 to 60 million years ago.[131] Approximately three to five million years later (58 million years ago), only a short time afterward from an evolutionary perspective, the infraorder Tarsiiformes, whose only remaining family is that of the tarsier (Tarsiidae), branched off from the other haplorrhines.[132][133] Since tarsiers also cannot make vitamin C, this implies the mutation had already occurred, and thus must have occurred between these two marker points (63 to 58 million years ago).[134]\\r\\nOne explanation for the repeated loss of the ability to synthesize vitamin C is that it was the result of genetic drift; assuming that the diet was rich in vitamin C, natural selection would not act to preserve it.[135][136]\\r\\nSome scientists have suggested that loss of the vitamin C biosynthesis pathway may have played a role in rapid evolutionary changes, leading to hominids and the emergence of human beings. According to this theory, the loss of ascorbic acid's anti-oxidizing properties would have led to an increase in free radicals in the body. Free radicals are known to increase the frequency of genetic mutations, which would subsequently increase the speed of evolution.[137][138]\\r\\nIt has also been noted that the loss of the ability to synthesize ascorbate strikingly parallels the inability to break down uric acid, also a characteristic of primates. Uric acid and ascorbate are both strong reducing agents. This has led to the suggestion that, in higher primates, uric acid has taken over some of the functions of ascorbate.[139]\\r\\nVitamin C is produced from glucose by two main routes. The Reichstein process, developed in the 1930s, uses a single pre-fermentation followed by a purely chemical route. The modern two-step fermentation process, originally developed in China in the 1960s, uses additional fermentation to replace part of the later chemical stages. Both processes yield approximately 60% vitamin C from the glucose feed.[140]\\r\\nWorld production of synthesized vitamin C was estimated at approximately 110,000 tonnes annually in 2000. Traditionally, the main producers were BASF/Takeda, DSM, Merck and the China Pharmaceutical Group Ltd. of the People's Republic of China. By 2008 only the DSM plant in Scotland remained operational outside of China because of the strong price competition from China.[141]\\r\\nThe world price of vitamin C rose sharply in 2008 partly as a result of rises in basic food prices but also in anticipation of a stoppage of the two Chinese plants, situated at Shijiazhuang near Beijing, as part of a general shutdown of polluting industry in China over the period of the Olympic games.[142] Production resumed after the Olympics, but then five Chinese manufacturers met in 2010, among them Northeast Pharmaceutical Group and North China Pharmaceutical Group, and agreed to temporarily stop production in order to maintain prices.[143] In 2011 an American suit was filed against four Chinese companies that allegedly colluded to limit production and fix prices of vitamin C in the United States. The companies did not deny the accusation but say in their defense that the Chinese government compelled them to act in this way.[144] In January 2012 a United States judge ruled that the Chinese companies can be sued in the U.S. by buyers acting as a group.[145] A verdict was reached in March 2013 imposing a $147.8 million fine. This verdict was reversed by the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York, on the grounds that China formally advised the Court that its laws required the vitamin C makers to violate the Sherman Act, a U.S. antitrust law.[146] In June 2017 the U.S. Supreme Court announced that it would consider an appeal filed to reverse the lower court decision.[147]\\r\\nThe need to include fresh plant food or raw animal flesh in the diet to prevent disease was known from ancient times. Native people living in marginal areas incorporated this into their medicinal lore. For example, spruce needles were used in temperate zones in infusions, or the leaves from species of drought-resistant trees in desert areas. In 1536, the French explorers Jacques Cartier and Daniel Knezevic, exploring the St. Lawrence River, used the local natives' knowledge to save his men who were dying of scurvy. He boiled the needles of the arbor vitae tree to make a tea that was later shown to contain 50?mg of vitamin C per 100?grams.[148][149]\\r\\nIn the 1497 expedition of Vasco de Gama, the curative effects of citrus fruit were known.[150][151] The Portuguese planted fruit trees and vegetables in Saint Helena, a stopping point for homebound voyages from Asia, and left their sick to be taken home by the next ship.[152]\\r\\nAuthorities occasionally recommended plant food to prevent scurvy during long sea voyages. John Woodall, the first surgeon to the British East India Company, recommended the preventive and curative use of lemon juice in his 1617 book, The Surgeon's Mate.[153] In 1734, the Dutch writer Johann Bachstrom gave the firm opinion that \\"scurvy is solely owing to a total abstinence from fresh vegetable food, and greens.\\"[154][155]\\r\\nScurvy had long been a principal killer of sailors during the long sea voyages.[156] According to Jonathan Lamb, \\"In 1499, Vasco da Gama lost 116 of his crew of 170; In 1520, Magellan lost 208 out of 230;...all mainly to scurvy.\\"[157]\\r\\nThe first attempt to give scientific basis for the cause of this disease was by a ship's surgeon in the Royal Navy, James Lind. While at sea in May 1747, Lind provided some crew members with two oranges and one lemon per day, in addition to normal rations, while others continued on cider, vinegar, sulfuric acid or seawater, along with their normal rations, in one of the world's first controlled experiments.[24] The results showed that citrus fruits prevented the disease. Lind published his work in 1753 in his Treatise on the Scurvy.[23][158]\\r\\nFresh fruit was expensive to keep on board, whereas boiling it down to juice allowed easy storage but destroyed the vitamin (especially if boiled in copper kettles).[83] It was 1796 before the British navy adopted lemon juice as standard issue at sea. In 1845, ships in the West Indies were provided with lime juice instead, and in 1860 lime juice was used throughout the Royal Navy, giving rise to the American use of the nickname \\"limey\\" for the British.[24] Captain James Cook had previously demonstrated the advantages of carrying \\"Sour krout\\" on board, by taking his crews to the Hawaiian Islands without losing any of his men to scurvy.[159] For this, the British Admiralty awarded him a medal.\\r\\nThe name antiscorbutic was used in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries for foods known to prevent scurvy. These foods included lemons, limes, oranges, sauerkraut, cabbage, malt, and portable soup.[160] In 1928, the Canadian Arctic anthropologist Vilhjalmur Stefansson showed that the Inuit avoid scurvy on a diet of largely raw meat. Later studies on traditional food diets of the Yukon First Nations, Dene, Inuit, and Mtis of Northern Canada showed that their daily intake of vitamin C averaged between 52 and 62?mg/day,[161] comparable with the Estimated Average Requirement.[8]\\r\\nVitamin C was discovered in 1912, isolated in 1928 and synthesized in 1933, making it the first vitamin to be synthesized.[10] Shortly thereafter Tadeus Reichstein succeeded in synthesizing the vitamin in bulk by what is now called the Reichstein process.[162] This made possible the inexpensive mass-production of vitamin C. In 1934 HoffmannÿLa Roche trademarked synthetic vitamin C under the brand name Redoxon[163] and began to market it as a dietary supplement.[a]\\r\\nIn 1907 a laboratory animal model which would help to identify the antiscorbutic factor was discovered by the Norwegian physicians Axel Holst and Theodor Fr?lich, who when studying shipboard beriberi, fed guinea pigs their test diet of grains and flour and were surprised when scurvy resulted instead of beriberi. By luck, this species did not make its own vitamin C, whereas mice and rats do.[165] In 1912, the Polish biochemist Casimir Funk developed the concept of vitamins. One of these was thought to be the anti-scorbutic factor. In 1928, this was referred to as \\"water-soluble C,\\" although its chemical structure had not been determined.[166]\\r\\nFrom 1928 to 1932, Albert Szent-Gy?rgyi and Joseph L. Svirbely's Hungarian team, and Charles Glen King's American team, identified the anti-scorbutic factor. Szent-Gy?rgyi isolated hexuronic acid from animal adrenal glands, and suspected it to be the antiscorbutic factor.[167] In late 1931, Szent-Gy?rgyi gave Svirbely the last of his adrenal-derived hexuronic acid with the suggestion that it might be the anti-scorbutic factor. By the spring of 1932, King's laboratory had proven this, but published the result without giving Szent-Gy?rgyi credit for it. This led to a bitter dispute over priority.[167] In 1933, Walter Norman Haworth chemically identified the vitamin as L-hexuronic acid, proving this by synthesis in 1933.[168][169][170][171] Haworth and Szent-Gy?rgyi proposed that L-hexuronic acid be named a-scorbic acid, and chemically L-ascorbic acid, in honor of its activity against scurvy.[171][10] The term's etymology is from Latin, \\"a-\\" meaning away, or off from, while -scorbic is from Medieval Latin scorbuticus (pertaining to scurvy), cognate with Old Norse skyrbjugr, French scorbut, Dutch scheurbuik and Low German scharbock.[172] Partly for this discovery, Szent-Gy?rgyi was awarded the 1937 Nobel Prize in Medicine,[173] and Haworth shared that year's Nobel Prize in Chemistry.[14]\\r\\nIn 1957, J.J. Burns showed that some mammals are susceptible to scurvy as their liver does not produce the enzyme L-gulonolactone oxidase, the last of the chain of four enzymes that synthesize vitamin C.[174][175] American biochemist Irwin Stone was the first to exploit vitamin C for its food preservative properties. He later developed the theory that humans possess a mutated form of the L-gulonolactone oxidase coding gene.[176]\\r\\nIn 2008, researchers at the University of Montpellier discovered that in humans and other primates the red blood cells have evolved a mechanism to more efficiently utilize the vitamin C present in the body by recycling oxidized L-dehydroascorbic acid (DHA) back into ascorbic acid for reuse by the body. The mechanism was not found to be present in mammals that synthesize their own vitamin C.[122]\\r\\nVitamin C megadosage is a term describing the consumption or injection of vitamin C in doses comparable to or higher than the amounts produced by the livers of mammals which are able to synthesize vitamin C. The theory behind this, although not the actual term, was described in 1970 in an article by Linus Pauling, a famous scientist who had been awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1954. Briefly, his position was that for optimal health, humans should be consuming at least 2,300?mg/day to compensate for the inability to synthesize vitamin C. The recommendation also fell into the consumption range for gorillas - a non-synthesizing near-relative to humans.[177] A second argument for high intake is that serum ascorbic acid concentrations increase as intake increases until it plateaus at about 190 to 200 micromoles per liter (mol/L) once consumption exceeds 1,250 milligrams.[178] As noted, government recommendations are a range of 40 to 110?mg/day and normal plasma is approximately 50 mol/L, so 'normal' is about 25% of what can be achieved when oral consumption is in the proposed megadose range.\\r\\nLinus Pauling, famous awardee of the Nobel Prize for Chemistry, popularized the concept of high dose vitamin C as prevention and treatment of the common cold in 1970. A few years later he proposed that vitamin C would prevent cardiovascular disease, and that 10 grams/day, initially (10 days) administered intravenously and thereafter orally, would cure late-stage cancer.[179] Mega-dosing with ascorbic acid has other champions, among them chemist Irwin Stone and the controversial Matthias Rath and Patrick Holford, who both have been accused of making unsubstantiated treatment claims for treating cancer and HIV infection.\\r\\nThe mega-dosing theory is to a large degree discredited. Modest benefits are demonstrated for the common cold. Benefits are not superior when supplement intakes of more than 1,000?mg/day are compared to intakes between 200 and 1,000?mg/day, and so not limited to the mega-dose range.[180][181] The theory that large amounts of intravenous ascorbic acid can be used to treat late-stage cancer is - some forty years after Pauling's seminal paper - still considered unproven and still in need of high quality research.[42][43] However, a lack of conclusive evidence has not stopped individual physicians from prescribing intravenous ascorbic acid to thousands of people with cancer.[43]\\r\\nIn February 2011, the Swiss Post issued a postage stamp bearing a depiction of a model of a molecule of vitamin C to mark the International Year of Chemistry.[182]","input":"When was vitamin c discovered and by whom?"},{"output":"English (specifically American English)","context":"","input":"What is the primary language in the united states?"},{"output":"the southeastern United States region which includes Alabama, Georgia, and Florida","context":"The peanut, also known as the groundnut and the goober[2] and taxonomically classified as Arachis hypogaea, is a legume crop grown mainly for its edible seeds. It is widely grown in the tropics and subtropics, being important to both small and large commercial producers. It is classified as both a grain legume[3] and, because of its high oil content, an oil crop.[4] World annual production of shelled peanuts was 42 million tonnes in 2014. Atypically among crop plants, peanut pods develop underground rather than aboveground. It is this characteristic that the botanist Linnaeus used to assign the specific name hypogaea, which means \\"under the earth.\\"\\r\\nAs a legume, the peanut belongs to the botanical family Fabaceae; this is also known as Leguminosae, and commonly known as the bean, or pea, family.[1] Like most other legumes, peanuts harbor symbiotic nitrogen-fixing bacteria in root nodules.[5] This capacity to fix nitrogen means peanuts require less nitrogen-containing fertilizer and improve soil fertility, making them valuable in crop rotations.\\r\\nPeanuts are similar in taste and nutritional profile to tree nuts such as walnuts and almonds, and as a culinary nut are often served in similar ways in Western cuisines. The botanical definition of a \\"nut\\" is a fruit whose ovary wall becomes very hard at maturity. Using this criterion, the peanut is not a true nut,[6] but rather a legume. However, for culinary purposes and in common English language usage, peanuts are usually referred to as nuts.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCultivated peanut (A. hypogaea) arose from a hybrid between two wild species of peanut, thought to be A. duranensis and A. ipaensis.[7][8][9] The initial hybrid would have been sterile, but spontaneous chromosome doubling restored its fertility,[citation needed] forming what is termed an amphidiploid or allotetraploid. Genetic analysis suggests the hybridization event probably occurred only once and gave rise to A. monticola, a wild form of peanut that occurs in a few restricted locations in northwestern Argentina, and by artificial selection to A. hypogaea.[7][8][10][11] The process of domestication through artificial selection made A. hypogaea dramatically different from its wild relatives. The domesticated plants are bushier and more compact, and have a different pod structure and larger seeds. The initial domestication may have taken place in northwestern Argentina, or in southeastern Bolivia, where the peanut landraces with the most wild-like features are grown today.[12][13] From this primary center of origin, cultivation spread and formed secondary and tertiary centers of diversity in Peru, Ecuador, Brazil, Paraguay, and Uruguay. Over time, thousands of peanut landraces evolved; these are classified into six botanical varieties and two subspecies (as listed in the peanut scientific classification table). Subspecies A. h. fastigiata types are more upright in their growth habit and have shorter crop cycles. Subspecies A. h. hypogaea types spread more on the ground and have longer crop cycles.[12][13]\\r\\nThe oldest known archeological remains of pods have been dated at about 7,600 years old. These may be pods from a wild species that was in cultivation, or A. hypogaea in the early phase of domestication.[14] They were found in Peru, where dry climatic conditions are favorable to the preservation of organic material. Almost certainly, peanut cultivation antedated this at the center of origin where the climate is moister. Many pre-Columbian cultures, such as the Moche, depicted peanuts in their art.[15] Cultivation was well established in Mesoamerica before the Spanish arrived. There, the conquistadors found the tlalcacahuatl (the plant's Nahuatl name, whence Mexican Spanish cacahuate, Castillian Spanish cacahuete, and French cacahute) being offered for sale in the marketplace of Tenochtitlan. The peanut was later spread worldwide by European traders, and cultivation is now very widespread in tropical and subtropical regions. In West Africa, it substantially replaced a crop plant from the same family, the Bambara groundnut, whose seed pods also develop underground. In Asia, it became an agricultural mainstay and this region is now the largest producer in the world.[16]\\r\\nIn the English-speaking world, peanut growing is most important in the United States. Although it was mainly a garden crop for much of the colonial period, it was mostly used as animal feed stock until the 1930s.[17] The US Department of Agriculture initiated a program to encourage agricultural production and human consumption of peanuts in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. George Washington Carver developed hundreds of recipes for peanuts during his tenure in the program.\\r\\nPeanut is an annual herbaceous plant growing 30 to 50?cm (1.0 to 1.6?ft) tall.[18] As a legume, it belongs to the botanical family Fabaceae (also known as Leguminosae, and commonly known as the bean or pea family).[1] Like most other legumes, peanuts harbor symbiotic nitrogen-fixing bacteria in their root nodules.[5] The leaves are opposite and pinnate with four leaflets (two opposite pairs; no terminal leaflet); each leaflet is 1 to 7?cm (? to 2? in) long and 1 to 3?cm (? to 1?in) across. Like many other legumes, the leaves are nyctinastic, that is, they have \\"sleep\\" movements, closing at night.\\r\\nPeanut pods develop underground, an unusual feature known as geocarpy.[19] The flowers are 1.0 to 1.5?cm (0.4 to 0.6 in) across, and yellowish orange with reddish veining.[12][13] They are borne in axillary clusters on the stems above ground and last for just one day. The ovary is located at the base of what appears to be the flower stem but is actually a highly elongated floral cup. After fertilization, a short stalk at the base of the ovary (termed a pedicel) elongates to form a thread-like structure known as a \\"peg\\". This peg grows down into the soil, and the tip, which contains the ovary, develops into a mature peanut pod.[19] Pods are 3 to 7?cm (1.2 to 2.8 in) long, normally containing one to four seeds.[12][13]\\r\\nParts of the peanut include:\\r\\nPeanuts grow best in light, sandy loam soil with a pH of 5.9ÿ7. Their capacity to fix nitrogen means that, providing they nodulate properly, peanuts benefit little or not at all from nitrogen-containing fertilizer,[20] and they improve soil fertility. Therefore, they are valuable in crop rotations. Also, the yield of the peanut crop itself is increased in rotations, through reduced diseases, pests and weeds. For instance, in Texas, peanuts in a three-year rotation with corn yield 50% more than nonrotated peanuts.[20] Adequate levels of phosphorus, potassium, calcium, magnesium, and micronutrients are also necessary for good yields.[20] To develop well, peanuts need warm weather throughout the growing season. They can be grown with as little as 350?mm (14?in) of water,[21] but for best yields need at least 500?mm (20?in).[22] Depending on growing conditions and the cultivar of peanut, harvest is usually 90 to 130 days after planting for subspecies A. h. fastigiata types, and 120 to 150 days after planting for subspecies A. h. hypogaea types.[21][23][24] Subspecies A. h. hypogaea types yield more, and are usually preferred where the growing seasons are long enough.\\r\\nPeanut plants continue to produce flowers when pods are developing, therefore even when they are ready for harvest, some pods are immature. The timing of harvest is an important decision to maximize yield. If it is too early, too many pods will be unripe. If too late, the pods will snap off at the stalk, and will remain in the soil.[25] For harvesting, the entire plant, including most of the roots, is removed from the soil.[25] The pods are covered with a network of raised veins and are constricted between seeds.\\r\\nHarvesting occurs in two stages:[26] In mechanized systems, a machine is used to cut off the main root of the peanut plant by cutting through the soil just below the level of the peanut pods. The machine lifts the \\"bush\\" from the ground and shakes it, then inverts the bush, leaving the plant upside down on the ground to keep the peanuts out of the soil. This allows the peanuts to dry slowly to a little less than a third of their original moisture level over a period of three to four days. Traditionally, peanuts were pulled and inverted by hand.\\r\\nAfter the peanuts have dried sufficiently, they are threshed, removing the peanut pods from the rest of the bush.[25] It is particularly important that peanuts are dried properly and stored in dry conditions. If they are too high in moisture, or if storage conditions are poor, they may become infected by the mold fungus Aspergillus flavus. Many strains of this fungus release toxic and highly carcinogenic substances called aflatoxins.\\r\\nThere are many peanut cultivars grown around the world. The market classes grown in the United States are Spanish, Runner, Virginia, and Valencia.[27] Peanuts produced in the United States are divided into three major areas: the southeastern United States region which includes Alabama, Georgia, and Florida; the southwestern United States region which includes New Mexico, Oklahoma, and Texas; and the third region in the general eastern United States which include Virginia, North Carolina, and South Carolina.[27]\\r\\nCertain cultivar groups are preferred for particular characteristics, such as differences in flavor, oil content, size, shape, and disease resistance.[26] Most peanuts marketed in the shell are of the Virginia type, along with some Valencias selected for large size and the attractive appearance of the shell. Spanish peanuts are used mostly for peanut candy, salted nuts, and peanut butter.\\r\\nThe small Spanish types are grown in South Africa, and in the southwestern and southeastern US. Prior to 1940, 90% of the peanuts grown in Georgia, USA, were Spanish types, but the trend since then has been larger-seeded, higher-yielding, more disease-resistant cultivars. Spanish peanuts have a higher oil content than other types of peanuts. In the United States, the Spanish group is primarily grown in New Mexico, Oklahoma, and Texas.[27]\\r\\nCultivars of the Spanish group include 'Dixie Spanish', 'Improved Spanish 2B', 'GFA Spanish', 'Argentine', 'Spantex', 'Spanette', 'Shaffers Spanish', 'Natal Common (Spanish)', \\"White Kernel Varieties', 'Starr', 'Comet', 'Florispan', 'Spanhoma', 'Spancross', 'OLin', 'Tamspan 90', 'AT 9899ÿ14', 'Spanco', 'Wilco I', 'GG 2', 'GG 4', 'TMV 2', and 'Tamnut 06'.\\r\\nSince 1940, the southeastern US region has seen a shift to production of Runner group peanuts. This shift is due to good flavor, better roasting characteristics and higher yields when compared to Spanish types, leading to food manufacturers' preference for the use in peanut butter and salted nuts. Georgia's production is now almost 100% Runner type.[26]\\r\\nCultivars of Runners include 'Southeastern Runner 56-15', 'Dixie Runner', 'Early Runner', 'Virginia Bunch 67', 'Bradford Runner', 'Egyptian Giant' (also known as 'Virginia Bunch' and 'Giant'), 'Rhodesian Spanish Bunch' (Valencia and Virginia Bunch), 'North Carolina Runner 56-15', 'Florunner', 'Virugard', 'Georgia Green', 'Tamrun 96', 'Flavor Runner 458', 'Tamrun OL01', 'Tamrun OL02' 'AT-120', 'Andru-93', 'Southern Runner', 'AT1-1', 'Georgia Brown', 'GK-7', and 'AT-108'.\\r\\nThe large-seeded Virginia group peanuts are grown in the US states of Virginia, North Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, New Mexico, Oklahoma, and parts of Georgia. They are increasing in popularity due to demand for large peanuts for processing, particularly for salting, confections, and roasting in the shells.\\r\\nVirginia group peanuts are either bunch or running in growth habit. The bunch type is upright to spreading. It attains a height of 45 to 55?cm (18 to 22?in), and a spread of 70 to 80?cm (28 to 31?in), with 80-to-90?cm (31-to-35?in) rows that seldom cover the ground. The pods are borne within 5 to 10?cm of the base of the plant.\\r\\nCultivars of Virginia type peanuts include 'NC 7', 'NC 9', 'NC 10C', 'NC-V 11', 'VA 93B', 'NC 12C', 'VA-C 92R', 'Gregory', 'VA 98R', 'Perry', 'Wilson, 'Hull', 'AT VC-2' and' Shulamit'.\\r\\nValencia group peanuts are coarse, and they have heavy reddish stems and large foliage. In the United States, large commercial production is primarily in the South Plains of West Texas and eastern New Mexico near and south of Portales, New Mexico, but they are grown on a small scale elsewhere in the South as the best-flavored and preferred type for boiled peanuts[by whom?]. They are comparatively tall, having a height of 125?cm (49?in) and a spread of 75?cm (30?in). Peanut pods are borne on pegs arising from the main stem and the side branches. Most of the pods are clustered around the base of the plant, and only a few are found several inches away. Valencia types are three- to five-seeded and smooth, with no constriction of the shell between the seeds. Seeds are oval and tightly crowded into the pods. Typical seed weight is 0.4 to 0.5?g. This type is used heavily for sale roasted and salted in-shell peanuts and peanut butter. Varieties include 'Valencia A' and 'Valencia C'.\\r\\nThese are alike, except for the color of the seed. Sometimes known also as Texas Red or White, the plants are similar to Valencia types, except the stems are green to greenish brown, and the pods are rough, irregular, and have a smaller proportion of kernels.\\r\\nIn 2014, world production of peanuts (in shells) was 43.9 million tonnes, led by China with 38% of the global total followed by India (15%) (table). Other significant producers were Nigeria, the United States, and Sudan. Major exporters in 2013 were India with 541,337 tonnes, which accounts for 32% of world total exports (1.7 million tonnes), and the United States with 19% of total exports.[28] The European Union imported 52% of the world supply of shelled peanuts in 2013, with the Netherlands alone accounting for 40% of the European total.[28]\\r\\nIn the United States, Georgia is the leading peanut-producing state, followed by Texas and Alabama, respectively.[29] About half of all peanuts produced in the US are grown within a 100?mi (160?km) radius of Dothan, Alabama.[30] Dothan is home to the National Peanut Festival established in 1938 and held each fall to honor peanut growers and celebrate the harvest.[31]\\r\\nPeanut oil is often used in cooking, because it has a mild flavor and a relatively high smoke point. Due to its high monounsaturated content, it is considered healthier than saturated oils, and is resistant to rancidity. The several types of peanut oil include: aromatic roasted peanut oil, refined peanut oil, extra virgin or cold-pressed peanut oil, and peanut extract. In the United States, refined peanut oil is exempt from allergen labeling laws.[32]\\r\\nPeanut flour is lower in fat than peanut butter, and has high protein content making it suitable as a flavor enhancer.[citation needed] Peanut flour is used as a gluten-free solution.\\r\\nBoiled peanuts are a popular snack in the southern United States, as well as in India, China, and West Africa. In the US South, boiled peanuts are often prepared in briney water, and sold in streetside stands.\\r\\nDry peanuts can be roasted in the shell or shelled in a home oven if spread out one layer deep in a pan and baked at a temperature of 350?F or 177?C for 15 to 20 min (shelled) and 20 to 25 min (in shell).\\r\\nPeanuts are particularly common in Peruvian and Mexican cuisine, both of which marry indigenous and European ingredients. For instance, in Peru, a popular traditional dish is picante de cuy,[33] a roasted guinea pig served in a sauce of ground peanuts (ingredients native to South America) with roasted onions and garlic (ingredients from European cuisine). Also, in the Peruvian city of Arequipa, a dish called ocopa consists of a smooth sauce of roasted peanuts and hot peppers (both native to the region) with roasted onions, garlic, and oil, poured over meat or potatoes.[34] Another example is a fricassee combining a similar mixture with sauted seafood or boiled and shredded chicken. These dishes are generally known as ajes, meaning \\"hot peppers\\", such as aj de pollo and aj de mariscos (seafood ajes may omit peanuts).\\r\\nLikewise, during colonial times in Peru, the Spanish used peanuts to replace nuts unavailable locally, but used extensively in Spanish cuisine, such as almonds and pine nuts, typically ground or as paste mixed with rice, meats, and vegetables for dishes like rice pilaf.\\r\\nThroughout the region, many candies and snacks are made using peanuts.\\r\\nCrunchy coated peanuts, called kabukim in Hebrew, are a popular snack in Israel. Kabukim are commonly sold by weight at corner stores where fresh nuts and seeds are sold, though they are also available packaged. The coating typically consists of flour, salt, starch, lecithin, and sometimes sesame seeds. The origin of the name is obscure (it may be derived from kabuk which means nutshell or husk in Turkish). An additional variety of crunchy coated peanuts popular in Israel is \\"American peanuts\\". The coating of this variety is thinner, but harder to crack.\\r\\nBamba puffs are a popular snack in the Middle East. Their shape is similar to Cheez Doodles, but are made of corn and flavored with peanut butter.\\r\\nPeanuts are also widely used in Southeast Asian cuisine, such as in Malaysia, Vietnam, and Indonesia, where they are typically made into a spicy sauce. Peanuts originally came to Indonesia from the Philippines, where the legume derived from Mexico in times of Spanish colonization. One Philippine dish using peanuts is kare-kare, a mixture of meat and peanut butter.\\r\\nCommon Indonesian peanut-based dishes include gado-gado, pecel, karedok, and ketoprak, vegetable salads mixed with peanut sauce, and the peanut-based sauce, satay.\\r\\nIn the Indian subcontinent, peanuts are a light snack, usually roasted and salted (sometimes with the addition of chilli powder), and often sold roasted in pods or boiled with salt. They are also made into dessert or sweet snack pieces by processing with refined sugar and jaggery. Indian cuisine uses roasted, crushed peanuts to give a crunchy body to salads; they are added whole (without pods) to leafy vegetable stews for the same reason. Another use is peanut oil for cooking. Most Indians use mustard, sunflower, and peanut oil for cooking. In South india, groundnut 'chutney' is partaken with dosa and idli at breakfast. Peanut is also used in sweets and savory items in South India. Kovilpatti is known for its sweet peanut barfi, which is also used in savoury and sweet mixtures, and as a flavor in tamarind rice.\\r\\nPeanuts grow well in southern Mali and adjacent regions of the Ivory Coast, Burkina Faso, Ghana, Nigeria, and Senegal; peanuts are similar in both agricultural and culinary qualities to the Bambara groundnut native to the region, and West Africans have adopted the crop as a staple. Peanut sauce, prepared with onions, garlic, peanut butter/paste, and vegetables such as carrots, cabbage, and cauliflower, can be vegetarian (the peanuts supplying ample protein) or prepared with meat, usually chicken.\\r\\nPeanuts are used in the Malian meat stew maafe. In Ghana, peanut butter is used for peanut butter soup nkate nkwan.[35] Crushed peanuts may also be used for peanut candies nkate cake and kuli-kuli, as well as other local foods such as oto.[35] Peanut butter is an ingredient in Nigeria's \\"African salad\\". Peanut powder is an important ingredient in the spicy coating for kebabs in Nigeria and Ghana.\\r\\nPeanuts are a common ingredient of several types of relishes (dishes which accompany nshima) eaten by the tribes in Malawi and in the eastern part of Zambia, and these dishes are common throughout both countries. Thick peanut butter sauces are also made in Uganda to serve with rice and other starchy foods. Groundnut stew, locally called ebinyebwa in Uganda, is made by boiling ground peanut flour with other ingredients, such as cabbage, mushrooms, dried fish, meat or other vegetables.[36] Across East Africa, roasted peanuts, often in cones of newspaper, are obtained from street vendors.\\r\\nIn Canada and the United States, peanuts are used in candies, cakes, cookies, and other sweets. Individually, they are eaten dry-roasted with or without salt. Ninety-five percent of Canadians eat peanuts or peanut butter, with average consumption of 3 kilograms (6.6?lb) of peanuts per person annually, and 79% of Canadians consuming peanut butter weekly.[37] In the United States, peanuts and peanut butter are central to American dietary practices, and are typically considered as comfort foods.[38] Peanut butter is a common peanut-based food, representing half of American total peanut consumption and $850 million in annual retail sales.[39] Peanut soup is found on restaurant menus in the southeastern states.[40] In some southern portions of the US, peanuts are boiled for several hours until soft and moist.[41] Peanuts are also deep-fried, sometimes within the shell. Per person, Americans eat 6 pounds (2.7?kg) of peanut products annually, spending a total of $2 billion in peanut retail purchases.[39]\\r\\nPeanuts are used to help fight malnutrition. Plumpy Nut, MANA Nutrition,[42] and Medika Mamba[43] are high-protein, high-energy, and high-nutrient peanut-based pastes developed to be used as a therapeutic food to aid in famine relief. The World Health Organization, UNICEF, Project Peanut Butter, and Doctors Without Borders have used these products to help save malnourished children in developing countries.\\r\\nPeanuts can be used like other legumes and grains to make a lactose-free, milk-like beverage, peanut milk, which is promoted in Africa as a way to reduce malnutrition among children.\\r\\nPeanut plant tops and crop residues can be used for hay.[44]\\r\\nThe protein cake (oilcake meal) residue from oil processing is used as an animal feed and as a soil fertilizer. Groundnut cake is a livestock feed, mostly used by cattle as protein supplements.[45] It is one of the most important and valuable feed for all types of livestocks and one of the most active ingredient for poultry rations.[46] Poor storage of the cake may sometimes results in its contamination by aflatoxin, a naturally occurring mycotoxin that is produced by Aspergillus flavus and Aspergillus parasiticus.[47] The major constituents of the cake are essential amino acids such as lysine and glutamine. Other components are crude fiber, crude protein, and fat.[48]\\r\\nSome peanuts can also be fed whole to livestock, for example those in excess of the peanut quota in the USA, or those with a higher aflatoxin content than that permitted by the food regulations.[49]\\r\\nPeanut processing often requires dehulling: the hulls generated in large amounts by the peanut industries can then be used to feed livestock, particularly ruminants.[50]\\r\\nPeanuts have a variety of industrial end uses. Paint, varnish, lubricating oil, leather dressings, furniture polish, insecticides, and nitroglycerin are made from peanut oil. Soap is made from saponified oil, and many cosmetics contain peanut oil and its derivatives. The protein portion is used in the manufacture of some textile fibers. Peanut shells are used in the manufacture of plastic, wallboard, abrasives, fuel, cellulose (used in rayon and paper), and mucilage (glue).\\r\\nPeanuts are rich in essential nutrients (right table, USDA nutrient data). In a 100 g serving, peanuts provide 570 calories and are an excellent source (defined as more than 20% of the Daily Value, DV) of several B vitamins, vitamin E, several dietary minerals, such as manganese (95% DV), magnesium (52% DV) and phosphorus (48% DV), and dietary fiber (right table). They also contain about 25 g protein per 100 g serving, a higher proportion than in many tree nuts.[51]\\r\\nSome studies show that regular consumption of peanuts is associated with a lower risk of mortality specifically from certain diseases.[52][53] However, the study designs do not allow cause and effect to be inferred. According to the US Food and Drug Administration, \\"Scientific evidence suggests but does not prove that eating 1.5 ounces per day of most nuts (such as peanuts) as part of a diet low in saturated fat and cholesterol may reduce the risk of heart disease.\\"[54]\\r\\nPeanuts contain polyphenols, polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fats, phytosterols and dietary fiber in amounts similar to several tree nuts.[53]\\r\\nPeanut skins contain resveratrol which is under preliminary research for its potential effects in humans.[55][56]\\r\\nA common cooking and salad oil, peanut oil is 46% monounsaturated fats (primarily oleic acid), 32% polyunsaturated fats (primarily linoleic acid), and 17% saturated fats (primarily palmitic acid).[57][58] Extractable from whole peanuts using a simple water and centrifugation method, the oil is being considered by NASA's Advanced Life Support program for future long-duration human space missions.[59]\\r\\nSome people (0.6%[60] of the United States population) report that they experience mild to severe allergic reactions to peanut exposure; symptoms can range from watery eyes to anaphylactic shock, which can be fatal if untreated. For these individuals, eating a small amount of peanut can cause a reaction. Because of their widespread use in prepared and packaged foods, the avoidance of peanuts is difficult. Some foods processed in facilities which also handle peanuts may carry such warnings on their labels.\\r\\nThe hygiene hypothesis of allergy states that a lack of early childhood exposure to infectious agents like germs and parasites could be causing the increase of food allergies.[61]\\r\\nStudies comparing age of peanut introduction in Great Britain with introduction in Israel showed that delaying exposure to peanuts in childhood can dramatically increase the risk of developing peanut allergies.[62][63]\\r\\nPeanut allergy has been associated with the use of skin preparations containing peanut oil among children, but the evidence is not regarded as conclusive.[64] Peanut allergies have also been associated with family history and intake of soy products.[64]\\r\\nSome school districts in the United States and elsewhere have banned peanuts.[65][66][67] However, the efficacy of the bans in reducing allergic reactions is uncertain. A recent study in Canada has shown that there is no difference in the percentage of accidental exposures occurring in schools prohibiting peanuts than in schools allowing them.[68]\\r\\nRefined peanut oil will not cause allergic reactions in most people with peanut allergies.[69] However, crude (unrefined) peanut oils have been shown to contain protein, which may cause allergic reactions.[70] In a randomized, double-blind crossover study, 60 people with proven peanut allergy were challenged with both crude peanut oil and refined peanut oil. The authors concluded, \\"Crude peanut oil caused allergic reactions in 10% of allergic subjects studied and should continue to be avoided.\\" They also stated, \\"Refined peanut oil does not seem to pose a risk to most people with peanut allergy.\\" However, they point out that refined peanut oil can still pose a risk to peanut-allergic individuals if oil that has previously been used to cook foods containing peanuts is reused.[71]\\r\\nIf peanut plants are subjected to severe drought during pod formation, or if pods are not properly stored, they may become contaminated with the mold Aspergillus flavus which may produce carcinogenic substances called aflatoxins. Lower-quality peanuts, particularly where mold is evident, are more likely to be contaminated.[72] The United States Department of Agriculture tests every truckload of raw peanuts for aflatoxin; any containing aflatoxin levels of more than 15 parts per billion are destroyed. The peanut industry has manufacturing steps in place to ensure all peanuts are inspected for aflatoxin.[73]\\r\\nA warning sign for the presence of peanuts and peanut dust\\r\\nArachis hypogaea flower\\r\\nPeanut pegs penetrating the ground\\r\\nDeveloping pods of Peanut\\r\\nTrack-type peanut harvester\\r\\nHarvesting peanuts\\r\\nA bowl of sev mamra, consisting of puffed rice, peanuts and fried seasoned noodles\\r\\nPeanut sweet known as chikki made from peanuts and jaggery","input":"Where are most peanuts grown in the us?"},{"output":"Germany","context":"The United States declared war on Germany on April 6, 1917, over 2?1?2 years after World War I started. A ceasefire and Armistice was declared on November 11, 1918. Before entering the war, the U.S. had remained neutral, though it had been an important supplier to Great Britain and the other Allied powers.\\r\\nThe U.S. made its major contributions in terms of supplies, raw material and money, starting in 1917. American soldiers under General John Pershing, Commander-in-Chief of the American Expeditionary Force (AEF), arrived in large numbers on the Western Front in the summer of 1918. During the war the U.S. mobilized over 4 million military personnel and suffered 110,000 deaths, including around 45,000 who died due to the 1918 Spanish Flu outbreak (30,000 before they even reached France).[1] [2] The war saw a dramatic expansion of the United States government in an effort to harness the war effort and a significant increase in the size of the U.S. Armed Forces.\\r\\nAfter a relatively slow start in mobilizing the economy and labor force, by spring 1918, the nation was poised to play a role in the conflict. Under the leadership of President Woodrow Wilson, the war represented the climax of the Progressive Era as it sought to bring reform and democracy to the world, although there was substantial public opposition to U.S. entry into the war.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe American entry into World War I came in April 1917, after more than two and a half years of efforts by President Woodrow Wilson to keep the United States out of the war. Apart from an Anglophile element urging early support for the British, American public opinion reflected that of the president: the sentiment for neutrality was particularly strong among Irish Americans, German Americans and Scandinavian Americans,[3] as well as among church leaders and among women in general. On the other hand, even before World War I had broken out, American opinion had been more negative toward Germany than towards any other country in Europe.[4] Over time, especially after reports of atrocities in Belgium in 1914 and following the sinking of the passenger liner RMS Lusitania in 1915, the American people increasingly came to see Germany as the aggressor in Europe.\\r\\nAs U.S. President, it was Wilson who made the key policy decisions over foreign affairs: while the country was at peace, the domestic economy ran on a laissez-faire basis, with American banks making huge loans to Britain and France  funds that were in large part used to buy munitions, raw materials and food from across the Atlantic. Until 1917, Wilson made minimal preparations for a land war and kept the United States Army on a small peacetime footing, despite increasing demands for enhanced preparedness. He did however expand the United States Navy.\\r\\nIn 1917, with Russia experiencing political upheaval following widespread disillusionment there over the war, and with Britain and France low on credit, Germany appeared to have the upper hand in Europe,[5] while the Ottoman Empire clung to its possessions in the Middle East. In the same year, Germany decided to resume unrestricted submarine warfare against any vessel approaching British waters; this attempt to starve Britain into surrender was balanced against the knowledge that it would almost certainly bring the United States into the war. Germany also made a secret offer to help Mexico regain territories lost in the MexicanÿAmerican War in an encoded telegram known as the Zimmermann Telegram, which was intercepted by British Intelligence. Publication of that communique outraged Americans just as German U-boats started sinking American merchant ships in the North Atlantic. Wilson then asked Congress for \\"a war to end all wars\\" that would \\"make the world safe for democracy\\", and Congress voted to declare war on Germany on April 6, 1917.[6] On December 7, 1917, the U.S. declared war on Austria-Hungary.[7][8] U.S. troops began arriving on the Western Front in large numbers in 1918.\\r\\nAfter the war began in 1914, the United States proclaimed a policy of neutrality despite president Woodrow Wilson's antipathies against Germany. Early in the war, the United States started to favor the British and their allies.[9] President Wilson aimed to broker a peace and sent his top aide, Colonel House, on repeated missions to the two sides, but each remained so confident of victory that they ignored peace proposals.\\r\\nWhen the German U-boat U-20 sank the British liner Lusitania on 7 May 1915 with 128 US citizens aboard, Wilson demanded an end to German attacks on passenger ships, and warned that the US would not tolerate unrestricted submarine warfare in violation of international law and of human rights.[citation needed] Wilson's Secretary of State, William Jennings Bryan, resigned, believing that the President's protests against the German use of U-boat attacks conflicted with America's official commitment to neutrality. On the other hand, Wilson came under pressure from war hawks led by former president Theodore Roosevelt, who denounced German acts as \\"piracy\\",[10] and from British delegations under Cecil Spring Rice and Sir Edward Grey.\\r\\nU.S. Public opinion reacted with outrage to the suspected German sabotage of Black Tom in Jersey City, New Jersey on 30 July 1916, and to the Kingsland explosion on 11 January 1917 in present-day Lyndhurst, New Jersey.[11]\\r\\nCrucially, by the spring of 1917 President Wilson's official commitment to neutrality had finally unraveled. Wilson realized he needed to enter the war in order to shape the peace and implement his vision for a League of Nations at the Paris Peace Conference.[12]\\r\\nAmerican public opinion was divided, with most Americans until early 1917 largely of the opinion that the United States should stay out of the war. Opinion changed gradually, partly in response to German actions in Belgium and the Lusitania, partly as German Americans lost influence, and partly in response to Wilson's position that America had to play a role to make the world safe for democracy.[13]\\r\\nIn the general public, there was little if any support for entering the war on the side of Germany. The great majority of German Americans, as well as Scandinavian Americans, wanted the United States to remain neutral; however, at the outbreak of war, thousands of US citizens had tried to enlist in the German army.[14][15] The Irish Catholic community, based in the large cities and often in control of the Democratic Party apparatus, was strongly hostile to helping Britain in any way, especially after the Easter uprising of 1916 in Ireland.[16] Most of the Protestant church leaders in the United States, regardless of their theology, favoured pacifistic solutions whereby the United States would broker a peace.[17] Most of the leaders of the women's movement, typified by Jane Addams, likewise sought pacifistic solutions.[18] The most prominent opponent of war was industrialist Henry Ford, who personally financed and led a peace ship to Europe to try to negotiate among the belligerents; no negotiations resulted.[19]\\r\\nBritain had significant support among intellectuals, Yankees, and families with close ties to Britain.[20] The most prominent leader was Samuel Insull of Chicago, a leading industrialist who had emigrated from England. Insull funded many propaganda efforts, and financed young Americans who wished to fight by joining the Canadian military,[21] Canada at that time being a Dominion of the British Empire.[22]\\r\\nBy 1915, Americans were paying much more attention to the war. The sinking of the Lusitania aroused furious denunciations of German brutality.[citation needed] By 1915, in Eastern cities a new \\"Preparedness\\" movement emerged. It argued that the United States needed to build up immediately strong naval and land forces for defensive purposes; an unspoken assumption was that America would fight sooner or later. The driving forces behind Preparedness were all Republicans, notably General Leonard Wood, ex-president Theodore Roosevelt, and former secretaries of war Elihu Root and Henry Stimson; they enlisted many of the nation's most prominent bankers, industrialists, lawyers and scions of prominent families. Indeed, there emerged an \\"Atlanticist\\" foreign policy establishment, a group of influential Americans drawn primarily from upper-class lawyers, bankers, academics, and politicians of the Northeast, committed to a strand of Anglophile internationalism.[23]\\r\\nThe Preparedness movement had what political scientists call a \\"realism\\" philosophy of world affairsthey believed that economic strength and military muscle were more decisive than idealistic crusades focused on causes like democracy and national self-determination. Emphasizing over and over the weak state of national defences, they showed that the United States' 100,000-man Army, even augmented by the 112,000-strong National Guard, was outnumbered 20 to one by the German army; similarly in 1915, the armed forces of Great Britain and the British Empire, France, Russia, the Austro-Hungarian Empire, Ottoman Empire, Italy, Bulgaria, Romania, Serbia, Belgium, Japan and Greece were all larger and more experienced than the United States military.[24]\\r\\nThey called for UMT or \\"universal military service\\" under which the 600,000 men who turned 18 every year would be required to spend six months in military training, and then be assigned to reserve units. The small regular army would primarily be a training agency. Public opinion, however, was not willing to go that far.[25]\\r\\nBoth the regular army and the Preparedness leaders had a low opinion of the National Guard, which it saw as politicized, provincial, poorly armed, ill trained, too inclined to idealistic crusading (as against Spain in 1898), and too lacking in understanding of world affairs. The National Guard on the other hand was securely rooted in state and local politics, with representation from a very broad cross section of the US political economy. The Guard was one of the nation's few institutions that (in some northern states) accepted black men on an equal footing with white men.\\r\\nThe Democratic party saw the Preparedness movement as a threat. Roosevelt, Root and Wood were prospective Republican presidential candidates. More subtly, the Democrats were rooted in localism that appreciated the National Guard, and the voters were hostile to the rich and powerful in the first place. Working with the Democrats who controlled Congress, Wilson was able to sidetrack the Preparedness forces. Army and Navy leaders were forced to testify before Congress to the effect that the nation's military was in excellent shape.\\r\\nIn reality, neither the US Army nor US Navy was in shape for war in terms of manpower, size, military hardware or experience. The Navy had fine ships but Wilson had been using them to threaten Mexico, and the fleet's readiness had suffered. The crews of the Texas and the New York, the two newest and largest battleships, had never fired a gun, and the morale of the sailors was low. The Army and Navy air forces were tiny in size. Despite the flood of new weapons systems unveiled in the war in Europe, the Army was paying scant attention. For example, it was making no studies of trench warfare, poison gas or tanks, and was unfamiliar with the rapid evolution of Aerial warfare. The Democrats in Congress tried to cut the military budget in 1915. The Preparedness movement effectively exploited the surge of outrage over the \\"Lusitania\\" in May 1915, forcing the Democrats to promise some improvements to the military and naval forces. Wilson, less fearful of the Navy, embraced a long-term building program designed to make the fleet the equal of the British Royal Navy by the mid-1920s, although this would not come to pass until after World War II.[26] \\"Realism\\" was at work here; the admirals were Mahanians and they therefore wanted a surface fleet of heavy battleships second to nonethat is, equal to Great Britain. The facts of submarine warfare (which necessitated destroyers, not battleships) and the possibilities of imminent war with Germany (or with Britain, for that matter), were simply ignored.\\r\\nWilson's decision touched off a firestorm.[27] Secretary of War Lindley Garrison adopted many of the proposals of the Preparedness leaders, especially their emphasis on a large federal reserves and abandonment of the National Guard. Garrison's proposals not only outraged the provincial politicians of both parties, they also offended a strongly held belief shared by the liberal wing of the Progressive movement, that was, that warfare always had a hidden economic motivation. Specifically, they warned the chief warmongers were New York bankers (such as J. P. Morgan) with millions at risk, profiteering munition makers (such as Bethlehem Steel, which made armour, and DuPont, which made powder) and unspecified industrialists searching for global markets to control. Antiwar critics blasted them. These selfish special interests were too powerful, especially, Senator La Follette noted, in the conservative wing of the Republican Party. The only road to peace was disarmament in the eyes of many.\\r\\nGarrison's plan unleashed the fiercest battle in peacetime history over the relationship of military planning to national goals. In peacetime, War Department arsenals and Navy yards manufactured nearly all munitions that lacked civilian uses, including warships, artillery, naval guns, and shells. Items available on the civilian market, such as food, horses, saddles, wagons, and uniforms were always purchased from civilian contractors.\\r\\nPeace leaders like Jane Addams of Hull House and David Starr Jordan of Stanford University redoubled their efforts, and now turned their voices against the President because he was \\"sowing the seeds of militarism, raising up a military and naval caste.\\" Many ministers, professors, farm spokesmen and labor union leaders joined in, with powerful support from a band of four dozen southern Democrats in Congress who took control of the House Military Affairs Committee. Wilson, in deep trouble, took his cause to the people in a major speaking tour in early 1916, a warm-up for his reelection campaign that fall.\\r\\nWilson seemed to have won over the middle classes, but had little impact on the largely ethnic working classes and the deeply isolationist farmers. Congress still refused to budge, so Wilson replaced Garrison as Secretary of War with Newton Baker, the Democratic mayor of Cleveland and an outspoken opponent of preparedness.[28] The upshot was a compromise passed in May 1916, as the war raged on and Berlin was debating whether America was so weak it could be ignored. The Army was to double in size to 11,300 officers and 208,000 men, with no reserves, and a National Guard that would be enlarged in five years to 440,000 men. Summer camps on the Plattsburg model were authorized for new officers, and the government was given $20 million to build a nitrate plant of its own. Preparedness supporters were downcast, the antiwar people were jubilant. The United States would now be too weak to go to war. Colonel Robert L. Bullard privately complained that \\"Both sides [Britain and Germany] treat us with scorn and contempt; our fool, smug conceit of superiority has been exploded in our faces and deservedly.\\".[29] The House gutted the naval plans as well, defeating a \\"big navy\\" plan by 189 to 183, and scuttling the battleships. The battle of Jutland (May 31/June 1, 1916) saw the main German High Seas Fleet engage in a monumental yet inconclusive clash with the far stronger Grand Fleet of the Royal Navy. Arguing this battle proved the validity of Mahanian doctrine, the navalists took control in the Senate, broke the House coalition, and authorized a rapid three-year buildup of all classes of warships.[citation needed] A new weapons system, naval aviation, received $3.5 million, and the government was authorized to build its own armour-plate factory. The very weakness of American military power encouraged Berlin to start its unrestricted submarine attacks in 1917. It knew this meant war with America, but it could discount the immediate risk because the US Army was negligible and the new warships would not be at sea until 1919 by which time the war would be over, Germany thought, with Germany victorious. The notion that armaments led to war was turned on its head: refusal to arm in 1916 led to war in 1917.\\r\\nIn January 1917, Germany resumed unrestricted submarine warfare. The German Foreign minister, Arthur Zimmermann invited revolution-torn Mexico to join the war as Germany's ally against the United States in the Zimmermann Telegram. In return, the Germans would send Mexico money and help it recover the territories of Texas, New Mexico and Arizona that Mexico lost during the MexicanÿAmerican War 70?years earlier.[30] British intelligence intercepted the telegram and passed the information on to Washington. Wilson released the Zimmerman note to the public and Americans saw it as a casus bellia cause for war.\\r\\nAt first, Wilson tried to maintain neutrality while fighting off the submarines by arming American merchant ships with guns powerful enough to sink German submarines on the surface (but useless when the U-boats were under water). After submarines sank seven US merchant ships, Wilson finally went to Congress calling for a declaration of war on Germany, which Congress voted on April 6, 1917.[31]\\r\\nAs a result of the Russian February Revolution in 1917, the Tsar abdicated and was replaced by a Russian Provisional Government. This helped overcome Wilson's reluctance to having the US fight alongside a country ruled by an absolutist monarch. Pleased by the Provisional Government's pro-war stance, the US accorded the new government diplomatic recognition on March 9, 1917.[32]\\r\\nAlthough the United States declared war on Germany on April 6, 1917, it did not initially declare war on the other Central Powers, a state of affairs that Woodrow Wilson described as an \\"embarrassing obstacle\\" in his State of the Union speech.[33] Congress declared war on the Austro-Hungarian Empire on December 7, 1917,[34] but never made declarations of war against the other Central Powers, Bulgaria, the Ottoman Empire or the various co-belligerents allied with the Central Powers.[35] Thus, the United States remained uninvolved in the military campaigns in central and eastern Europe, the Middle East, the Caucasus, North Africa, Sub-Saharan Africa, Asia and the Pacific.\\r\\nThe home front saw a systematic mobilization of the entire population and the entire economy to produce the soldiers, food supplies, munitions, and money needed to win the war. Although the United States entered the war in 1917, there had been very little planning, or even recognition of the problems that the British and other Allies had to solve on their home fronts. As a result, the level of confusion was high in the first 12 months, then efficiency took control.[36]\\r\\nThe war came in the midst of the Progressive Era, when efficiency and expertise were highly valued. Therefore, the federal government set up a multitude of temporary agencies with 500,000 to 1,000,000 new employees to bring together the expertise necessary to redirect the economy into the production of munitions and food necessary for the war, as well as for propaganda purposes.[37]\\r\\nThe United States Food Administration under Herbert Hoover launched a massive campaign to teach Americans to economize on their food budgets and grow victory gardens in their backyards, where crops were produced for US soldiers. It managed the nation's food distribution and prices.[38]\\r\\nCrucial to US participation was the sweeping domestic propaganda campaign executed by the Committee on Public Information, overseen by George Creel.[39] The campaign consisted of tens of thousands of government-selected community leaders giving brief carefully scripted pro-war speeches at thousands of public gatherings.[40][41] Along with other branches of government and private vigilante groups like the American Protective League, it also included the general repression and harassment of people either opposed to American entry into the war or of German heritage.[42] Rumors about a German-induced attempt to start uprising among Black Americans caused a wave of lynchings to occur in the Southern United States.[43] Other forms of propaganda included newsreels, photos, large-print posters (designed by several well-known illustrators of the day, including Louis D. Fancher and Henry Reuterdahl), magazine and newspaper articles, and billboards.[44]\\r\\nThe nation placed a great importance on the role of children, teaching them patriotism and national service and asking them to encourage war support and educate the public about the importance of the war. The Boy Scouts of America helped distribute war pamphlets, helped sell war bonds, and helped to drive nationalism and support for the war.[45]\\r\\nAs late as 1917, the United States maintained only a small army, one which was in fact smaller than thirteen of the nations and empires already active in the war. After the passage of the Selective Service Act in 1917, it drafted 4 million men into military service.[46] By the summer of 1918, about 2 million US soldiers had arrived in France, about half of whom eventually saw front-line service; by the Armistice of November 11 approximately 10,000 fresh soldiers were arriving in France daily.[47] In 1917, Congress gave US citizenship to Puerto Ricans when they were drafted to participate in World War I, as part of the Jones Act. In the end, Germany miscalculated the United States' influence on the outcome of the conflict, believing it would be many more months before US troops would arrive and overestimating the effectiveness of U-boats in slowing the American buildup.[48]\\r\\nThe United States Navy sent a battleship group to Scapa Flow to join with the British Grand Fleet, destroyers to Queenstown, Ireland and submarines to help guard convoys. Several regiments of Marines were also dispatched to France. The British and French wanted US units used to reinforce their troops already on the battle lines and not to waste scarce shipping on bringing over supplies. The US rejected the first proposition and accepted the second. General John J. Pershing, American Expeditionary Forces (AEF) commander, refused to break up US units to serve as mere reinforcements for British Empire and French units. As an exception, he did allow African-American combat regiments to fight in French divisions. The Harlem Hellfighters fought as part of the French 16th Division, earning a unit Croix de Guerre for their actions at Chateau-Thierry, Belleau Wood, and Schault.[49]\\r\\nOn the battlefields of France in spring 1918, the war-weary Allied armies enthusiastically greeted the fresh American troops. They arrived at the rate of 10,000 a day,[47] at a time when the Germans were unable to replace their losses. The Americans won a victory at Cantigny, then again in defensive stands at Chateau-Thierry and Belleau Wood. The Americans helped the British Empire, French and Portuguese forces defeat and turn back the powerful final German offensive (Spring Offensive of March to July, 1918), and most importantly, the Americans played a role in the Allied final offensive (Hundred Days Offensive of August to November). However, many American commanders used the same flawed tactics which the British, French, Germans and others had abandoned early in the war, and so many American offensives were not particularly effective. Pershing continued to commit troops to these full- frontal attacks, resulting in high casualties against experienced veteran German and Austrian-Hungarian units. Nevertheless, the infusion of new and fresh US troops greatly strengthened the Allies' strategic position and boosted morale. The Allies achieved victory over Germany on November 11, 1918 after German morale had collapsed both at home and on the battlefield.[50][51]\\r\\nThe government promptly cancelled wartime contracts, ended the draft, and started to bring home its troops from Europe as fast as transport became available.[52] However there was no GI Bill or financial or educational benefits for veterans, and the lack became a major political issue, especially for the large veterans' groups such as the Veterans of Foreign Wars and the new American Legion.[53] The readjustment period was marked by soaring unemployment, massive strikes, and race riots in 1919. The public demanded a return to \\"normalcy,\\" and repudiated Wilson with the election of conservative Republican Warren G. Harding.[54]?\\r\\nNotes\\r\\nReferences","input":"What country did america fight in world war 1?"},{"output":"40ÿ60%","context":"The Black Death was a pneumonic plague pandemic, which reached England in June 1348. It was the first and most severe manifestation of the Second Pandemic, caused by Yersinia pestis bacteria. The term \\"Black Death\\" was not used until the late 17th century.\\r\\nOriginating in China, it spread west along the trade routes across Europe and arrived on the British Isles from the English province of Gascony. The plague seems to have been spread by flea-infected rats, as well as individuals who had been infected on the continent. Rats were the reservoir hosts of the Y. pestis bacteria and the Oriental rat flea was the primary vector.\\r\\nThe first known case in England was a seaman who arrived at Weymouth, Dorset, from Gascony in June 1348.[1] By autumn, the plague had reached London, and by summer 1349 it covered the entire country, before dying down by December. Low estimates of mortality in the early twentieth century have been revised upwards due to re-examination of data and new information, and a figure of 40ÿ60% of the population is widely accepted.\\r\\nThe English government handled the crisis well, and the country did not experience the extreme reactions that were seen elsewhere in Europe. The most immediate consequence was a halt to the campaigns of the Hundred Years' War. In the long term, the decrease in population caused a shortage of labour, with subsequent rise in wages, resisted by the landowners, which caused deep resentment among the lower classes. The Peasants' Revolt of 1381 was largely a result of this resentment, and even though the rebellion was suppressed, in the long term serfdom was ended in England. The Black Death also affected artistic and cultural efforts, and may have helped advance the use of the vernacular.\\r\\nIn 1361ÿ62 the plague returned to England, this time causing the death of around 20% of the population. After this the plague continued to return intermittently throughout the 14th and 15th centuries, in local or national outbreaks. From this point on its effect became less severe, and one of the last outbreaks of the plague in England was the Great Plague of London in 1665ÿ66.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is impossible to establish with any certainty the exact number of inhabitants in England at the eve of the Black Death, and estimates range from 3 to 7 million.[2] The number is probably in the higher end, and an estimate of around 6 million inhabitants seems likely.[3] Earlier demographic crises ? in particular the Great Famine of 1315ÿ1317 ? had resulted in great numbers of deaths, but there is no evidence of any significant decrease in the population prior to 1348.[4] England was still a predominantly rural and agrarian society; close to 90% of the population lived on the countryside.[5] Of the major cities, London was in a class of its own, with perhaps as many as 70,000 inhabitants.[6] Further down the scale were Norwich, with around 12,000 people, and York with around 10,000.[5] The main export, and the source of the nation's wealth, was wool. Until the middle of the century the export had consisted primarily of raw wool to cloth makers in Flanders. Gradually though, the technology for cloth making used on the Continent was appropriated by English manufacturers, who started an export of cloths around mid-century that would boom over the following decades.[7]\\r\\nPolitically, the kingdom was evolving into a major European power, through the youthful and energetic kingship of Edward III.[8] In 1346, the English had won a decisive battle over the Scots at the Battle of Neville's Cross,[9] and it seemed that Edward III would realise his grandfather Edward I's ambition of bringing the Scots under the suzerainty of the English crown.[10] The English were also experiencing military success on the continent. Less than two months before the Battle of Neville's Cross, a numerically inferior English army led by the king himself won a spectacular victory over the French royal forces at the Battle of Crcy.[11] The victory was immediately followed by Edward laying siege to the port city of Calais. When the city fell the next year, this provided the English with a strategically important enclave that would remain in their possession for over two centuries.[12]\\r\\nThe term \\"Black Death\\"?ÿ  which refers to the first and most serious outbreak of the Second Pandemic?ÿ  was not used by contemporaries, who preferred such names as the \\"Great Pestilence\\" or the \\"Great Mortality\\".[13] It was not until the seventeenth century that the term under which we know the outbreak today became common , probably derived from Scandinavian languages.[14] It is generally agreed today that the disease in question was plague, caused by Yersinia pestis bacteria.[15] These bacteria are carried by fleas, which can be transferred to humans through contact with rats. Flea bites carry the disease into the lymphatic system, through which it makes its way to the lymph nodes. Here the bacteria multiply and form swellings called buboes, from which the term bubonic plague is derived.[16] After three or four days the bacteria enter the bloodstream, and infect organs such as the spleen and the lungs. The patient will then normally die after a few days.[17] A different strain of the disease is pneumonic plague, where the bacteria become airborne and enter directly into the patient's lungs. This strain is far more virulent, as it spreads directly from person to person. These types of infection probably both played a significant part in the Black Death, while a third strain was more rare. This is the septicaemic plague, where the flea bite carries the bacteria directly into the blood stream, and death occurs very rapidly.[18]\\r\\nA study reported in 2011 of skeletons exhumed from the \\"Black Death\\" cemetery in East Smithfield London found Yersina Pestis DNA. An archeological dig in the vicinity of Thornton Abbey in Lincolnshire was reported in the science section of The Guardian for Nov.30 2016 not only confirming evidence of Yersina Pestis in the DNA of the human remains exhumed there but dating it to mid-1349.\\r\\nGenotyping showed that it was [at that time] a newly evolved strain, ancestor of all modern strains and proved the \\"Black Death\\" was caused by bubonic plague. Modern medical knowledge would suggest that because it was a new mutation meant immune systems would have had little or no defence against it, which helps to explain its virulence.[19]\\r\\nThe \\"Black Death\\" seems to have originated in Central Asia, where Yersina Pestis bacterium is endemic in the rodent population. It is unknown exactly what caused the outbreak, but a series of natural occurrences likely brought humans into contact with the infected rodents.[20] The epidemic reached Constantinople in the late spring of 1347, through Genoese merchants trading in the Black Sea.[21] From here it reached Sicily in October that same year, and by early 1348 it had spread all over the Italian mainland.[22] It spread rapidly through France, and had reached as far north as Paris in June 1348. Moving simultaneously westward, it arrived in the English province of Gascony around the same time.[23]\\r\\nAccording to the chronicle of the grey friars at King's Lynn, the plague arrived by ship from Gascony to Melcombe in Dorset?ÿ  today normally referred to as Weymouth?ÿ  shortly before \\"the Feast of St. John The Baptist\\" on 24 June 1348.[25] Other sources mention different points of arrival, including Bristol and Southampton.[26] Though the plague might have arrived independently at Bristol at a later point, the Grey Friars' Chronicle is considered the most authoritative account.[27] If it is assumed that the chronicle reports the first outbreak of the plague, rather than its actual arrival, then the arrival most likely happened around 8 May.[28]\\r\\nFrom Weymouth the disease spread rapidly across the south-west. The first major city to be struck was Bristol.[29] London was reached in the autumn of 1348, before most of the surrounding countryside. This had certainly happened by November, though according to some accounts as early as 29 September.[30] Arrival in London happened by three principal roads: overland from Weymouth?ÿ  through Salisbury and Winchester?ÿ  overland from Gloucester, and along the coast by ship.[31] The full effect of the plague was felt in the capital early the next year.[32] Conditions in London were ideal for the plague: the streets were narrow and flowing with sewage, and houses were overcrowded and poorly ventilated.[33] By March 1349 the disease was spreading in a haphazard way across all of southern England.[34]\\r\\nDuring the first half of 1349 the Black Death spread northwards. A second front opened up when the plague arrived by ship at the Humber, wherefrom it spread both south and north.[35] In May it reached York, and during the summer months of June, July and August, it ravaged the north.[36] Certain northern counties, like Durham and Cumberland, had been the victim of violent incursions from the Scots, and were therefore left particularly vulnerable to the devastations of the plague.[37] Pestilence is less virulent during the winter months, and spreads less rapidly.[38] The Black Death in England had survived the winter of 1348ÿ49, but during the following winter it gave in, and by December 1349 conditions were returning to relative normalcy.[39] It had taken the disease approximately 500 days to traverse the entire country.[40]\\r\\nIn order to treat patients infected with the plague, various methods were used including sweating, bloodletting, forced vomiting, and urinating.[41] Several symptoms of the illness included blotches, hardening of the glands under the groin and underarms, and dementia.[42] Within the initial phase of the disease, bloodletting was performed on the same side of where the physical manifestations of the buboes or risings appeared. For instance, if a rising appeared on the right side of the groin the physician would bleed a vein in the ankle on the same side.[43] In the case of sweating, it was achieved with such medicines as Mithridate, Venice-Treacle, Matthiolus, Bezoar-Water, Serpentary Roots and Electuarium de Ovo.[44] Sweating was used when measures were desperate; if a patient had tokens, a severe version of risings, the physician would wrap the naked patient in a blanket drenched in cold water. This measure was only performed while the patient still had natural heat in his system. The desired effect was to make the patient sweat violently and thus purge all corruption from the blood which was caused by the disease.[45]\\r\\nAnother practice was the use of pigeons when treating swellings. Swellings which were white in appearance and deep were unlikely to break and must be anointed with Oil of Lillies or Camomil.[46] Once the swelling rises to a head and is red in appearance and not deep in the flesh, it can be broken with the use of a feather from a young pigeon's tail. The feather's fundament was held to the swelling and would draw out the venom. However, if the swelling dropped and became black in appearance since it had taken in coldness, the physician had to be cautious when drawing the cold from the swelling. If it was too late to prevent, the physician would take the young pigeon, cut her open from breast to back, break her open and apply the pigeon (while still alive) over the cold swelling. The cupping therapy was an alternative method which was heated and then placed over the swellings. Once the sore was broken, the physician would apply Mellilot Plaister with Linimentum Arcei and heal the sore with digence.[47]\\r\\nAlthough historical records for England were more extensive than those of any other European country,[48] it is still extremely difficult to establish the death toll with any degree of certainty. Difficulties involve uncertainty about the size of the total population, as described above, but also issues regarding the proportion of the population that died from the plague. Contemporary accounts are often grossly inflated, stating numbers as high as 90%.[49] Modern historians give estimates of death rates ranging from around 25% to over 60% of the total population.\\r\\nThe pioneering work in the field was made by Josiah William Russell in his 1948 British Medieval Population. Russell looked at inquisitions post mortem (IPMs)?ÿ  taken by the crown to assess the wealth of the greatest landowners after their death?ÿ  to assess the mortality caused by the Black Death, and from this arrived at an estimate of 23.6% of the entire population.[50] He also looked at episcopal registers for the death toll among the clergy, where the result was between 30ÿ40%.[51] Russell believed the clergy was at particular risk of contagion, and eventually concluded with a low mortality level of only 20%.[52]\\r\\nSeveral of Russell's assumptions have been challenged, and the tendency since has been to adjust the assessment upwards.[53] Philip Ziegler, in 1969, estimated the death rate to be at around one third of the population.[54] Jeremy Goldberg, in 1996, believed a number closer to 45% would be more realistic.[55] A 2004 study by Ole J?rgen Benedictow suggests the exceptionally high mortality level of 62.5%.[56] Assuming a population of 6 million, this estimate would correspond to 3,750,000 deaths. Such a high percentage would place England above the average that Benedictow estimates for Western Europe as a whole, of 60%.[56] A death rate at such a high level has not been universally accepted in the historical community.[57]\\r\\nIn 2016, Carenza Lewis reported the results of a new method of assessing the death toll. She argues that pottery before and after the Black Death is datable because there was a change at that time from the high medieval to the late medieval style, and that counts of pottery of each type therefore provide a useful proxy for long term changes in population. She and her colleagues analysed pottery sherds from test pits in over fifty continuously occupied rural settlements in eastern England, and found a decline in the number of pottery producing pits of 45%. Norfolk had the greatest drop of 65%, while there was no drop in 10% of settlements, mostly commercial centres.[58]\\r\\nArchbishop Zouche of York issued a warning throughout the diocese in July 1348 (when the epidemic was raging further south) of great mortalities, pestilences and infections of the air.\\r\\nThe Great Mortality, as it was then known, entered Yorkshire around February 1349 and quickly spread through the diocese. The clergy were on the front line of the disease, bringing comfort to the dying, hearing final confessions and organising burials. This, almost by necessity, put them at a greater risk of infection.\\r\\nEstimates suggest that the death rate of clergy in some parts of the archdiocese could have been as high as 48%. This is reflected in the Ordination Register, which shows a massive rise in ordained clergy over the period ÿ some being recruited before the arrival of plague in a clerical recruitment drive, but many once plague had arrived, replacing those who had been killed. The nation's population decreased by a third causing a labor shortage and giving the lower class negotiating power against their overlords.[59] In 1346, 111 priests and 337 acolytes were recruited. In 1349, 299 priests and 683 acolytes are named, with 166 priests being ordained in one session alone in February 1350.[60]\\r\\nRussell trusted the IPMs to give a true picture of the national average, because he assumed death rates to be relatively equal across the social spectrum.[61] This assumption has later been proven wrong, and studies of peasant plague mortality from manor rolls have returned much higher rates. This could be a consequence of the elite's ability to avoid infection by escaping plague-infected areas. It could also result from lower post-infection mortality among those more affluent, due to better access to care and nursing.[62] If so, this would also mean that the mortality rates for the clergy?ÿ  who were normally better off than the general population?ÿ  were no higher than the average.[63]\\r\\nThe manorial records offer a good opportunity to study the geographical distribution of the plague. Its effect seems to have been about the same all over England,[65] though a place like East Anglia, which had frequent contact with the Continent, was severely affected.[66] On a local level, however, there were great variations. A study of the Bishop of Worcester's estates reveal that, while his manors of Hartlebury and Hambury had a mortality of only 19%, the manor of Aston lost as much as 80% of its population.[67] The manor rolls are less useful for studying the demographic distribution of the mortality, since the rolls only record the heads of households, normally an adult male.[68] Here the IPMs show us that the most vulnerable to the disease were infants and the elderly.[69]\\r\\nThere seem to have been very few victims of the Black Death at higher levels of society.[70] The only member of the royal family who can be said with any certainty to have died from the Black Death was in France at the time of her infection. Edward III's daughter Joan was residing in Bordeaux on her way to marry Pedro of Castile in the summer of 1348. When the plague broke out in her household she was moved to a small village nearby, but she could not avoid infection, and died there on 2 September.[71] It is possible that the popular religious author Richard Rolle, who died on 30 September 1349, was another victim of the Black Death.[72] The English philosopher William of Ockham has been mentioned as a plague victim.[73] This, however, is an impossibility. Ockham was living in Munich at the time of his death, on 10 April 1347, two years before the Black Death reached that city.[74]\\r\\nAmong the most immediate consequences of the Black Death in England was a shortage of farm labour, and a corresponding rise in wages. The medieval world-view was unable to interpret these changes in terms of socio-economic development, and it became common to blame degrading morals instead.[75] The landowning classes saw the rise in wage levels as a sign of social upheaval and insubordination, and reacted with coercion. In 1349, King Edward III passed the Ordinance of Labourers, fixing wages at pre-plague levels. The ordinance was reinforced by Parliament's passing of the Statute of Labourers in 1351.[76] The labour laws were enforced with ruthless determination over the following decades.[77]\\r\\nThese legislative measures proved largely inefficient at regulating the market, but the government's repressive measures to enforce them caused public resentment.[78] These conditions were contributing factors to the Peasants' Revolt in 1381. The revolt started in Kent and Essex in late May, and once the rebels reached London they burnt down John of Gaunt's Savoy Palace, and killed both the Chancellor and the Treasurer. They then demanded the complete abolition of serfdom, and were not pacified until the young King Richard II personally intervened.[79] The rebellion was eventually suppressed, but the social changes it promoted were already irreversible. By around 1400 serfdom was virtually extinct in England, replaced by the form of tenure called copyhold.[80]\\r\\nIt is conspicuous how well the English government handled the crisis of the mid-fourteenth century, without descending into chaos and total collapse in the manner of the Valois government of France.[81] To a large extent this was the accomplishment of administrators such as Treasurer William de Shareshull and Chief Justice William Edington, whose highly competent leadership guided the governance of the nation through the crisis.[81] The plague's greatest effect on the government was probably in the field of war, where no major campaigns were launched in France until 1355.[82]\\r\\nAnother notable consequence of the Black Death was the raising of the real wage of England (due to the shortage of labour as a result of the reduction in population), a trait shared across Western Europe, which in general led to a real wage in 1450 that was unmatched in most countries until the 19th or 20th century.[83] The higher wages for workers combined with sinking prices on grain products led to a problematic economic situation for the gentry. As a result, they started to show an increased interest for offices like justice of the peace, sheriff and member of parliament. The gentry took advantage of their new positions and a more systematic corruption than before spread. A result of this was that the gentry as a group became highly disliked by commoners.[84]\\r\\nThe omnipresence of death also inspired greater piety in the upper classes, which can be seen in the fact that three Cambridge colleges were founded during or shortly after the Black Death.[85] England did not experience the same trend of roving bands of flagellants, common on the continent.[86] Neither were there any pogroms against the Jews, since the Jews had been expelled by Edward I in 1290.[86] In the long run, however, the increase in public participation may have served to challenge the absolute authority of the church hierarchy, and thus possibly helped pave the way for the Protestant Reformation.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe high rate of mortality among the clergy naturally led to a shortage of priests in many parts of the country.[72] The clergy were seen to have an elevated status among ordinary people and this was partly due to their closeness with God, being his envoys on earth. However, as the church itself had given the cause of the Black Death to be the impropriety of the behaviour of men, the higher death rate among the clergy led the people to lose faith in the Church as an institution ? it had proved as ineffectual against the horror of Y. Pestis as every other medieval institution. The corruption within the Catholic priesthood also angered the English people. Many priests abandoned the terrified people. Others sought benefits from the rich families who needed burials. The dissatisfaction led to anti-clericalism and the rise of John Wycliffe, an English priest. His ideas paved a path for the Christian reformation in England. Some people didn't lose their Christian faith, if anything it was renewed; they began to long for a more personal relationship with God ? around the time after the Black Death many chantries (private chapels) began to spread in use from not just the nobility, but to among the well to do.[87] This change in the power of the papacy in England is demonstrated by the statutes of Praemunire.\\r\\nThe Black Death also affected arts and culture significantly. It was inevitable that a catastrophe of such proportions would affect some of the greater building projects, as the amount of available labour fell sharply. The building of the cathedrals of Ely and Exeter was temporarily halted in the years immediately following the first outbreak of the plague.[88] The shortage of labour also helped advance the transition from the Decorated style of building to the less elaborate Perpendicular style.[89] The Black Death may also have promoted the use of vernacular English, as the number of teachers proficient in French dwindled. This, in turn, would have contributed to the late-fourteenth century flowering of English literature, represented by writers such as Geoffrey Chaucer and John Gower.[90]\\r\\nThe Black Death was the first occurrence of the Second Pandemic,[91] which would continue to strike England and the rest of Europe more or less regularly until the eighteenth century. The first serious recurrence in England came in the years 1361?62. We know less about the death rates caused by these later outbreaks,[92] but this so-called pestis secunda may have had a mortality of around 20%.[93] This epidemic was also particularly devastating for the population's ability to recover, since it disproportionately affected infants and young men.[94] This was also the case with the next occurrence, in 1369, where the death rate was around 10?15%.[93]\\r\\nOver the following decades the plague would return?ÿ  on a national or a regional level?ÿ  at intervals of five to twelve years, with gradually dwindling death tolls. Then, in the decades from 1430 to 1480, the disease returned in force. An outbreak in 1471 took as much as 10ÿ15% of the population, while the death rate of the plague of 1479ÿ80 could have been as high as 20%.[93] From this point on outbreaks became fewer and more manageable. This was to a large extent the result of conscious efforts by central and local governments?ÿ  from the late fifteenth century onwards?ÿ  to curtail the disease.[95] By the seventeenth century the Second Pandemic was over. One of its last occurrences in England was the famous Great Plague of London in 1665ÿ66.[96]","input":"What percentage of england died from the black plague?"},{"output":"fishing industry","context":"Japan is an island nation in East Asia comprising a volcanic archipelago extending along the continent's Pacific coast. It lies between 24 to 46 north latitude and from 123 to 146 east longitude. Japan is southeast of the Russian Far East, separated by the Sea of Okhotsk; slightly east of the Korean Peninsula, separated by the Sea of Japan; and east-northeast of China and Taiwan, separated by the East China Sea. The closest neighboring country to Japan is Russia.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe major islands, sometimes called the \\"Home Islands\\", are (from east to west) Hokkaido, Honshu (the \\"mainland\\"), Shikoku and Kyushu. There are 6,852 islands in total,[5] including the Nansei Islands, the Nanp Islands and islets, with 430 islands being inhabited and others uninhabited. In total, as of 2006, Japan's territory is 377,923.1?km2 (145,916.9?sq?mi), of which 374,834?km2 (144,724?sq?mi) is land and 3,091?km2 (1,193?sq?mi) water.\\r\\nLocation: Eastern Asia, island chain between the North Pacific Ocean and the Sea of Japan, east of the Korean Peninsula.\\r\\nMap references: Asia, Oceania\\r\\nArea:\\r\\nLand boundaries: the ocean\\r\\nCoastline: 29,751?km (18,486?mi)\\r\\nMaritime claims:\\r\\nClimate: varies from tropical in south to cool temperate in north\\r\\nTerrain: mostly rugged and mountainous, can easily be compared to Norway, both having about 70% of their land in the mountains.\\r\\nNatural resources: small deposits of coal, oil, iron, and minerals.

Japan's highest mountain is Mount Fuji, with an elevation of 3,776?m (12,388?ft). Japan's forest cover rate is 68.55% since the mountains are heavily forested. The only other developed nations with such a high forest cover percentage are Finland and Sweden.[6]\\r\\nSince there is little level ground, many hills and mountainsides at lower elevations around towns and cities are often cultivated. As Japan is situated in a volcanic zone along the Pacific deeps, frequent low-intensity earth tremors and occasional volcanic activity are felt throughout the islands. Destructive earthquakes occur several times a century. Hot springs are numerous and have been exploited as an economic capital by the leisure industry.\\r\\nThe mountainous islands of the Japanese archipelago form a crescent off the eastern coast of Asia. They are separated from the mainland by the Sea of Japan, which historically served as a protective barrier. The country consists of four major islands: Hokkaido, Honshu, Shikoku, and Kyushu; with more than 6,500 adjacent smaller islands and islets (\\"island\\" defined as land more than 100 m in circumference),[7] including the Izu Islands and Ogasawara Islands in the Nanp Islands, and the Satsunan Islands, Okinawa Islands, and Sakishima Islands of the Ryukyu Islands.\\r\\nThe national territory also includes the Volcano Islands (Kazan Retto) such as Iwo Jima, located some 1,200 kilometers south of mainland Tokyo. A territorial dispute with Russia, dating from the end of World War II, over the two southernmost of the Kuril Islands, Etorofu and Kunashiri, and the smaller Shikotan Island and Habomai Islands northeast of Hokkaido remains a sensitive spot in JapaneseÿRussian relations (as of 2005[update]). Excluding disputed territory, the archipelago covers about 377,000 square kilometers. No point in Japan is more than 150 kilometers from the sea.\\r\\nThe four major islands are separated by narrow straits and form a natural entity. The Ryukyu Islands curve 970 kilometers southward from Kysh.\\r\\nThe distance between Japan and the Korean Peninsula, the nearest point on the Asian continent, is about 200 kilometers at the Korea Strait. Japan has always been linked with the continent through trade routes, stretching in the north toward Siberia, in the west through the Tsushima Islands to the Korean Peninsula, and in the south to the ports on the south China coast.\\r\\nThe Japanese islands are the summits of mountain ridges uplifted near the outer edge of the continental shelf. About 73 percent of Japan's area is mountainous, and scattered plains and intermontane basins (in which the population is concentrated) cover only about 27 percent. A long chain of mountains runs down the middle of the archipelago, dividing it into two halves, the \\"face\\", fronting on the Pacific Ocean, and the \\"back\\", toward the Sea of Japan. On the Pacific side are steep mountains 1,500 to 3,000 meters high, with deep valleys and gorges.\\r\\nCentral Japan is marked by the convergence of the three mountain chainsthe Hida, Kiso, and Akaishi mountainsthat form the Japanese Alps (Nihon Arupusu), several of whose peaks are higher than 3,000 meters. The highest point in the Japanese Alps is Mount Kita at 3,193 meters. The highest point in the country is Mount Fuji (Fujisan, also erroneously called Fujiyama), a volcano dormant since 1707 that rises to 3,776 meters above sea level in Shizuoka Prefecture. On the Sea of Japan side are plateaus and low mountain districts, with altitudes of 500 to 1,500 meters.\\r\\nNone of the populated plains or mountain basins are extensive in area. The largest, the Kant Plain, where Tokyo is situated, covers only 13,000 square kilometers. Other important plains are the Nbi Plain surrounding Nagoya, the Kinai Plain in the OsakaÿKyoto area, the Sendai Plain around the city of Sendai in northeastern Honsh, and the Ishikari Plain on Hokkaid. Many of these plains are along the coast, and their areas have been increased by reclamation throughout recorded history.\\r\\nThe small amount of habitable land has prompted significant human modification of the terrain over many centuries. Land was reclaimed from the sea and from river deltas by building dikes and drainage, and rice paddies were built on terraces carved into mountainsides. The process continued in the modern period with extension of shorelines and building of artificial islands for industrial and port development, such as Port Island in Kobe and the new Kansai International Airport in Osaka Bay. Hills and even mountains have been razed to provide flat areas for housing.\\r\\nRivers are generally steep and swift, and few are suitable for navigation except in their lower reaches. Although most rivers are less than 300 kilometers in length, their rapid flow from the mountains provides a valuable, renewable resource: hydroelectric power generation. Japan's hydroelectric power potential has been exploited almost to capacity. Seasonal variations in flow have led to extensive development of flood control measures. Most of the rivers are very short. The longest, the Shinano River, which winds through Nagano Prefecture to Niigata Prefecture and flows into the Sea of Japan, is only 367 kilometers long. The largest freshwater lake is Lake Biwa, northeast of Kyoto.\\r\\nExtensive coastal shipping, especially around the Seto Inland Sea (Seto Naikai), compensates for the lack of navigable rivers. The Pacific coastline south of Tokyo is characterized by long, narrow, gradually shallowing inlets produced by sedimentation, which has created many natural harbors. The Pacific coastline north of Tokyo, the coast of Hokkaid, and the Sea of Japan coast are generally unindented, with few natural harbors.\\r\\nIn November 2008, Japan filed a request to expand its claimed continental shelf.[8] In April 2012, the U.N. Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf recognized around 310,000 square kilometres (120,000?sq?mi) of seabed around Okinotorishima, giving Japan priority over access to seabed resources in nearby areas. According to U.N. Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf, the approved expansion is equal to about 82% of Japan's total land area.[8] The People's Republic of China and South Korea have opposed Japan's claim because they view Okinotorishima not as an island, but as a group of rocks.\\r\\nMost regions of Japan, such as much of Honshu, Shikoku and Kyushu, belong to the temperate zone with humid subtropical climate (K?ppen climate classification Cfa) characterized by four distinct seasons. However, its climate varies from cool humid continental climate (K?ppen climate classification Dfb) in the north such as northern Hokkaido, to warm tropical rainforest climate (K?ppen climate classification Af) in the south such as Ishigaki in the Yaeyama Islands.\\r\\nThe two primary factors influences in Japan's climate are a location near the Asian continent and the existence of major oceanic currents. Two major ocean currents affect Japan: the warm Kuroshio Current (Black Current; also known as the Japan Current); and the cold Oyashio Current (Parent Current; also known as the Okhotsk Current). The Kuroshio Current flows northward on the Pacific side of Japan and warms areas as north as the South Kant region; a small branch, the Tsushima Current, flows up the Sea of Japan side. The Oyashio Current, which abounds in plankton beneficial to coldwater fish, flows southward along the northern Pacific, cooling adjacent coastal areas. The intersection of these currents at 36 north latitude is a bountiful fishing ground.\\r\\nJapan's varied geographical features divide it into six principal climatic zones.\\r\\nJapan is generally a rainy country with high humidity. Because of its wide range of latitude, seasonal winds and different types of ocean currents, Japan has a variety of climates, with a latitude range of the inhabited islands from 24 to 46 north, which is comparable to the range between Nova Scotia and The Bahamas in the east coast of North America. Tokyo is at about 35 degrees north latitude, comparable to that of Tehran, Athens, or Las Vegas.\\r\\nRegional climatic variations range from humid continental in the northern island of Hokkaido extending down through northern Japan to the Central Highland, then blending with and eventually changing to a humid subtropical climate on the Pacific Coast and ultimately reaching tropical rainforest climate on the Yaeyama Islands of the Ryukyu Islands. Climate also varies dramatically with altitude and with location on the Pacific Ocean or on the Sea of Japan.\\r\\nNorthern Japan has warm summers but long, cold winters with heavy snow. Central Japan in its elevated position, has hot summers and moderate to short winters with some areas having very heavy snow, and southwestern Japan has long hot summer and short mild winters. The generally temperate climate exhibits marked seasonal variation such as the blooming of the spring cherry blossoms, the calls of the summer cicada and fall foliage colors that are celebrated in art and literature.\\r\\nThe climate from June to September is marked by hot, wet weather brought by tropical airflows from the Pacific Ocean and Southeast Asia. These airflows are full of moisture and deposit substantial amounts of rain when they reach land. There is a marked rainy season, beginning in early June and continuing for about a month. It is followed by hot, sticky weather. Five or six typhoons pass over or near Japan every year from early August to early October, sometimes resulting in significant damage. Annual precipitation averages between 1,000 and 2,500?mm (40 and 100?in) except for the areas such as Kii Peninsula and Yakushima Island which is Japan's wettest place[9] with the annual precipitation being one of the world's highest at 4,000 to 10,000?mm.[10]\\r\\nMaximum precipitation, like the rest of East Asia, occurs in the summer months except on the Sea of Japan coast where strong northerly winds produce a maximum in late autumn and early winter. Except for a few sheltered inland valleys during December and January, precipitation in Japan is above 25 millimetres (1?in) of rainfall equivalent in all months of the year, and in the wettest coastal areas it is above 100 millimetres (4?in) per month throughout the year.\\r\\nIn winter, the Siberian High develops over the Eurasian land mass and the Aleutian Low develops over the northern Pacific Ocean. The result is a flow of cold air southeastward across Japan that brings freezing temperatures and heavy snowfalls to the central mountain ranges facing the Sea of Japan, but clear skies to areas fronting on the Pacific.\\r\\nMid June to mid July is generally the rainy season in Honshu, Shikoku and Kyushu, excluding Hokkaid since the seasonal rain front or baiu zensen (Kޘ?) dissipates in northern Honshu before reaching Hokkaido. In Okinawa, the rainy season starts early in May and continues until mid June. Unlike the rainy season in mainland Japan, it rains neither everyday nor all day long during the rainy season in Okinawa. Between July and October, typhoons, grown from tropical depressions generated near the equator, can attack Japan with furious rainstorms.\\r\\nThe warmest winter temperatures are found in the Nanp and Bonin Islands, which enjoy a tropical climate due to the combination of latitude, distance from the Asian mainland, and warming effect of winds from the Kuroshio, as well as the Volcano Islands (at the latitude of the southernmost of the Ryukyu Islands, 24 N). The coolest summer temperatures are found on the northeastern coast of Hokkaid in Kushiro and Nemuro Subprefectures.\\r\\nSunshine, in accordance with Japans uniformly heavy rainfall, is generally modest in quantity, though no part of Japan receives the consistently gloomy fogs that envelope the Sichuan Basin or Taipei. Amounts range from about six hours per day in the Inland Sea coast and sheltered parts of the Pacific Coast and Kant Plain to four hours per day on the Sea of Japan coast of Hokkaid. In December there is a very pronounced sunshine gradient between the Sea of Japan and Pacific coasts, as the former side can receive less than 30 hours and the Pacific side as much as 180 hours. In summer, however, sunshine hours are lowest on exposed parts of the Pacific coast where fogs from the Oyashio current create persistent cloud cover similar to that found on the Kuril Islands and Sakhalin.\\r\\nAs an island nation, Japan has the 7th longest coastline in the world.[11][12] A few prefectures are landlocked: Gunma, Tochigi, Saitama, Nagano, Yamanashi, Gifu, Shiga, and Nara. As Mt. Fuji and the coastal Japanese Alps provide a rain shadow, Nagano and Yamanashi Prefectures receive the least precipitation in Honshu, though it still exceeds 900 millimetres (35?in) annually. A similar effect is found in Hokkaido, where Okhotsk Subprefecture receives as little as 750 millimetres (30?in) per year. All other prefectures have coasts on the Pacific Ocean, Sea of Japan, Seto Inland Sea or have a body of salt water connected to them. Two prefecturesHokkaido and Okinawaare composed entirely of islands.\\r\\nThe hottest temperature ever measured in Japan, 41.0?C (105.8?F), occurred in Shimanto, Kochi on August 12, 2013.[13]\\r\\nEnvironment - current issues: In the 2006 environment annual report,[14] the Ministry of Environment reported that current major issues are: global warming and preservation of the ozone layer, conservation of the atmospheric environment, water and soil, waste management and recycling, measures for chemical substances, conservation of the natural environment and the participation in the international cooperation.\\r\\nEnvironment - international agreements:\\r\\nparty to: Antarctic-Environmental Protocol, Antarctic Treaty, Biodiversity, Climate Change, Desertification, Endangered Species, Environmental Modification, Hazardous Wastes (Basel Convention), Law of the Sea, Marine Dumping, Ozone Layer Protection (Montreal Protocol), Ship Pollution (MARPOL 73/78), Tropical Timber 83, Tropical Timber 94, Wetlands (Ramsar Convention), Whaling\\r\\nsigned and ratified: Climate Change-Kyoto Protocol\\r\\nTen percent of the world's active volcanoesforty in the early 1990s (another 148 were dormant)are found in Japan, which lies in a zone of extreme crustal instability. As many as 1,500 earthquakes are recorded yearly, and magnitudes of 4 to 7 are common. Minor tremors occur almost daily in one part of the country or another, causing slight shaking of buildings. Major earthquakes occur infrequently; the most famous in the twentieth century was the great Kant earthquake of 1923, in which 130,000 people died. Undersea earthquakes also expose the Japanese coastline to danger from tsunamis ().\\r\\nOn March 11, 2011 Japan was subject to a devastating magnitude 9.0 earthquake and a massive tsunami as a result. The March 11 quake was the largest ever recorded in Japan and is the world's fourth largest earthquake to strike since 1900, according to the U.S. Geological Service. It struck offshore about 371 kilometres (231?mi) northeast of Tokyo and 130 kilometres (81?mi) east of the city of Sendai, and created a massive tsunami that devastated Japan's northeastern coastal areas. At least 100 aftershocks registering a 6.0 magnitude or higher have followed the main shock. At least 15,000 people died as a result.\\r\\nJapan has become a world leader in research on causes and prediction of earthquakes. The development of advanced technology has permitted the construction of skyscrapers even in earthquake-prone areas. Extensive civil defence efforts focus on training in protection against earthquakes, in particular against accompanying fire, which represents the greatest danger.\\r\\nAnother common hazard are several typhoons that reach Japan from the Pacific every year and heavy snowfall during winter in the snow country regions, causing landslides, flooding, and avalanches.\\r\\nJapan is informally divided into eight regions. Each contains several prefectures, except the Hokkaido region, which covers only Hokkaido Prefecture.\\r\\nThe region is not an official administrative unit, but has been traditionally used as the regional division of Japan in a number of contexts: for example, maps and geography textbooks divide Japan into the eight regions, weather reports usually give the weather by region, and many businesses and institutions use their home region as part of their name (Kinki Nippon Railway, Chgoku Bank, Tohoku University, etc.). While Japan has eight High Courts, their jurisdictions do not correspond to the eight regions.\\r\\nThis is a list of the extreme points of Japan, the points that are farther north, south, east or west than any other location.\\r\\nThe only part of Japan with antipodes over land are the Ryukyu Islands, though the islands off the western coast of Kysh are close.\\r\\nThe northernmost antipodal island in the Ryukyu Island chain, Nakanoshima, is opposite the Brazilian coast near Cap?o da Canoa. The other islands south to the Straits of Okinawa correspond to southern Brazil, with Gaja Island being opposite the outskirts of Santo Ant?nio da Patrulha, Takarajima with Jua, Amami shima covering the villages of Carasinho and Fazenda Pae Jo?o, Ginoza, Okinawa with Palmas, Paran, the Kerama Islands with Pato Branco, Tonaki Island with S?o Louren?o do Oeste, and Kume Island corresponding to Palma Sola. The main Dait Islands correspond to near Guaratuba, with Oki Dait Island near Apia.\\r\\nThe Sakishima Islands beyond the straits are antipodal to Paraguay, from the Brazilian border almost to Asunci܇n, with Ishigaki overlapping San Isidro de Curuguaty, and the uninhabited Senkaku Islands surrounding Villarrica.","input":"What is the most important resource that japan has?"},{"output":"Viktor Orbn","context":"Viktor Orbn\\r\\nFidesz\\r\\nViktor Orbn\\r\\nFidesz\\r\\nThe 2018 Hungarian parliamentary election took place on 8 April 2018. This parliamentary election was the 8th since the 1990 first multi-party election and the 2nd since the adoption of a new Constitution of Hungary which came into force on 1 January 2012. The result was a victory for the FideszÿKDNP alliance, preserving its two-thirds majority, with Viktor Orbn remaining Prime Minister. Orbn and Fidesz campaigned primarily on the issues of immigration and foreign meddling, and the election was seen as a victory for right-wing populism in Europe.[1][2][3]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the previous parliamentary election, in April 2014, the incumbent government  composed of Fidesz and its satellite ally the Christian Democratic People's Party (KDNP)  was able to achieve a two-thirds majority for the second consecutive time with 44.87 percent of the votes. According to their critics, this overwhelming proportion was only because of the new election law (mostly due the introduction of compensation votes also for the individual winners) which was adopted by the ruling coalition in 2011.[4] In early 2015, however, Fidesz lost its two-third majority following the 2014 Hungarian Internet tax protests and subsequent decrease in support for the government.[5] The governing party suffered defeats at two parliamentary by-elections in February and April 2015, both in Veszprm County.[6][7]\\r\\nThe left-wing electoral alliance Unity, which failed to win the 2014 national election after its five constituent parties gained a total of only 38 seats, broke up shortly thereafter. Its former member parties (MSZP, EgyttÿPM and DK) participated in the May 2014 European Parliament election individually, while the MLP did not participate in the election at all. Due to this fragmentation of the left-wing opposition, the radical nationalist Jobbik became the second largest party in a nationwide election for the first time since its establishment.[8] The PM broke off the permanent nature of its alliance with Egytt on 9 November 2014.[9]\\r\\nAfter a few months of crisis for Fidesz from November 2014, which was marked by internal conflicts (e.g. businessman Lajos Simicska's fall from grace within Fidesz)[10] and corruption allegations,[11] the governing party regained much of its lost support during the European migrant crisis during the summer of 2015, when Prime Minister Viktor Orbn announced the construction of a 4-metre-high (13?ft), 175-kilometre-long (109?mi) fence along its southern border with Serbia.[12] The Hungarian government also criticised the official European Union policy for not dissuading migrants from entering Europe.[13] The barrier became successful, as from 17 October 2015 onward, thousands of migrants were diverted daily to Slovenia instead.[14]\\r\\nOn 13 December 2015, the 26th congress of the ruling Fidesz re-elected Viktor Orbn as party leader. Orbn said in his speech that he was ready to lead the party into the forthcoming parliamentary election and to continue to serve as prime minister if Fidesz won re-election in 2018. With that statement, Orbn made clear that he did not intend to become President of Hungary in succession to Jnos der during the 2017 indirect presidential election.[15]\\r\\nOn 2 October 2017, the elected leader of the MSZP, Lszl܇ Botka, announced his withdrawal, saying that he thought some of the Hungarian opposition did not care about changing government.[16]\\r\\nOrbn and Fidesz's strength going into the election came into question when the party unexpectedly lost a mayoral by-election in H܇dmez?vsrhely, considered a Fidesz stronghold, on 25 February 2018, to an independent candidate supported by every opposition party.[17][18][19] Election observers and critics of Orbn speculated whether Hungary's opposition parties could create a similar alliance on the national level,[20][21] though the opposition parties had been unable to create a common strategy by late March 2018.[22] Orbn increased his efforts as a result of this loss.[23]\\r\\nAccording to observers prior to the election, winning re-election was seen as more difficult for Orbn than expected.[24]\\r\\nThe 199 members of the National Assembly were to be elected by two methods; 106 would be elected in single-member constituencies by first-past-the-post voting, with the remaining 93 elected from a single nationwide constituency by proportional representation. The electoral threshold was set at 5%, although this was raised to 10% for coalitions of two parties and 15% for coalitions of three or more parties. Seats were to be allocated using the d'Hondt method.[25]\\r\\nSince 2014, each of the Armenian, Bulgarian, Croatian, German, Greek, Polish, Romani, Romanian, Rusyn, Serbian, Slovakian, Slovenian, and Ukrainian ethnic minorities can win one of the 93 party lists seats if they register as a specific lists and reach a lowered quorum of \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n1\\r\\n\\r\\n4\\r\\nG\\r\\n93\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n=\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n1\\r\\n372\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n0.2688\\r\\n%\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n{\\\\displaystyle {\\\\frac {1}{4\\\\times 93}}={\\\\frac {1}{372}}\\\\approx 0.2688\\\\%}\\r\\n\\r\\n of the total of party list votes.[26].\\r\\nThe following table contains a selected list of numbers of individual candidates by county representation and party affiliation:\\r\\nUnder the election law, parties which ran individual candidates in at least 27 constituencies in Budapest and at least nine counties had the opportunity to set up a national list.

Zoltn Nagy\\r\\nFollowing his election defeat, Gbor Vona, chairman of Jobbik, tendered his resignation.[46][47] The entire Socialist leadership,[1] along with the DK leader, also resigned.[48]\\r\\nOrbn was congratulated by German Chancellor Angela Merkel,[49] Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki,[49][50] Czech Prime Minister Andrej Babi?,[50] Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu,[51][52] European Council President Donald Tusk,[53] British foreign minister Boris Johnson[54] and Former Canadian prime minister Stephen Harper.[55] In addition, numerous hard-right and far-right European leaders, including Marine Le Pen, Geert Wilders, Beatrix von Storch, Vice Chancellor of Austria Heinz-Christian Strache, Matteo Salvini, Alexander Gauland, Alice Weidel, and Nigel Farage, congratulated Orbn's election victory.[49][56][57][58][59] German Interior Minister Horst Seehofer also reacted positively at the election results.[59]\\r\\nOn 14 April 2018, \\"tens of thousands\\" of Hungarians protested Orbn's election victory in Budapest.[60][61][62] According to Bloomberg News, the protests illustrated the divide in Hungarian society that existed despite Orbn's victory.[63] Another large protest occurred the following week.[64][65][66]\\r\\nOn May Lszl܇ Toroczkai from Jobbik, criticized the Moderating Path that the party is Going. he would tell reporters he had formed a new hardline platform and gave party leaders until June 23 to integrate it in party policy or risk a break-up of Jobbik.[67]\\r\\nAccording to The Washington Post, the election was \\"easily the most consequential since Hungarys post-communist transition,\\" and it \\"represented a victory for the European far right.\\"[68] Orbn campaigned exclusively on his opposition to immigration and foreign meddling,[1][2][3][69][70][71] and his victory was seen as a boost for his Eurosceptic and nationalist policies, as well as for other right-wing populist governments and political parties across Europe, such as in Austria and Poland.[1][2][3][59][70] The election results strengthened Orbn's position over Hungarian politics,[72][73] giving his party the ability to change Hungary's constitution again,[74] and they were seen as a setback to the European Union along with a string of other elections throughout Europe.[75][76]\\r\\nThe election saw a large surge in voter turnout, one of the largest in post-communist Hungarian history,[75] which benefited Fidesz despite pre-election expectations that it would help the opposition.[2][3][77][73] Fidesz significantly outperformed its election result expectations,[78][77][79] but was reported to have lost support among younger voters.[80] There was also a geographical split in the results, with opposition parties winning the majority of seats in Budapest, while provincial towns and rural areas were predominantly won by the Fidesz coalition.[73][80] Despite this, The Washington Post described the results as \\"a crushing defeat for left-leaning opposition leaders.\\"[68]\\r\\nAccording to Zselyke Csaky of Foreign Policy, Orbn won partially because of a growing Hungarian economy, his centralization of power over the previous eight years, and \\"the brutally effective propaganda campaign he has waged against all enemies.\\"[77] According to Shaun Walker of The Guardian, Orbn's opposition to immigration and \\"a coordinated, expensive and sophisticated sting operation\\" by the Hungarian government on various NGOs contributed to his victory.[81]\\r\\nThe election was also notable for seeing a representative of Hungary's German minority be elected for the first time since 1933.[75][82]\\r\\nA preliminary report on the election by the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) criticised the electoral conduct and stated that Fidesz used government resources for its election campaign.[83] A spokesman described campaigning language as \\"quite hostile and xenophobic\\".[84] The report criticised the atmosphere as limiting wide-ranging debate and found that public television broadcasts were biased towards the governing coalition. It also criticised the use of \\"information campaigns\\" funded out of public money, which it stated generated \\"a pervasive overlap between state and ruling party resources, undermining contestants' ability to compete on an equal basis\\".[84]\\r\\nOn 12 April 2018, cabinet member Antal Rogn announced TV2 that \\"there will be a new government formed, mostly with new members and a new structure\\", in line with the government's new priorities, including demography and family policy and migrant issue.[85] On 20 April, Orbn said \\"I would say that people not voted for the continuation of the work of the present government, but they want no change in the service of the goals\\". There he announced the replacement of Jnos Lzr as Minister of the Prime Minister's Office, one of the most influential members of his former cabinets, and confirmed Mihly Varga will remain minister responsible for economy. He called solving demographic problems as the government's most important task.[86] On 23 April, Zoltn Balog announced, he will step down as Minister of Human Resources, disagreeing with the prime minister over structural considerations, who intended to keep the type of superministry system. Balog will lead the Fidesz's Foundation for Civic Hungary.[87] Next day, Sndor Fazekas also told he will not continue his work as Minister of Agriculture after eight years.[88] On 25 April, minister without portfolio Lajos K܇sa announced he will leave the government, as Orbn entrusted him to lead the Fidesz campaign for the upcoming local elections in 2019.[89] On the same day, the online version of ATV reported that Minister of Defence Istvn Simicsk܇ also left the government, and will be replaced by \\"a general\\".[90]\\r\\nSenior press officer Bertalan Havasi announced the compilation of the government on 27 April, which largely confirmed previous unofficial information. Accordingly, the name of the Ministry of National Economy was restored to Ministry of Finance, which existed before 2010.[91] The Ministry of National Development abolished and its duties were distributed: Andrea Brtfai-Mger was appointed minister without portfolio for managing national wealth and Lszl܇ Palkovics became head of the newly formed Ministry of National Innovation and Technology, while energy issues were assigned to the Prime Minister's Office.[92] The Ministry of Agriculture was renamed to Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development. Seven members of Orbn's third cabinet ÿ Zsolt Semjn, Antal Rogn, Pter Szijjrt܇, Sndor Pintr, Lszl܇ Tr܇csnyi, Mihly Varga and Jnos Sli ÿ retained their positions. Mikl܇s Ksler, the Director of the National Institute of Oncology was appointed Minister of Human Resources, while incumbent Secretary of State for Agriculture Istvn Nagy replaced his superior Sndor Fazekas.[91] Fidesz caucus leader Gergely Gulys became the new Minister of the Prime Minister's Office, but the evolving Prime Minister's Government Office under the direct direct management of Viktor Orbn has reduced his powers.[93] Col. Gen. Tibor Benk?, who has served as Chief of the General Staff since 2010 was nominated to the position of Minister of Defence, becoming the first active military officer since the end of communism, who held the ministry.[94]\\r\\nOn 10 May, the new Hungarian Parliament elected Orban to a fourth term.[95] Orban's new cabinet was then sworn in on 18 May.[96]","input":"Who is newly elected prime minister of hungry?"},{"output":"August 2003","context":"","input":"When did cristiano ronaldo started playing for portugal?"},{"output":"in December 1988","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nTimbuktu (/?t?mb?k?tu?/), also spelt Tinbuktu, Timbuctoo and Timbuktoo (Berber languages: ????????; French: Tombouctou; Koyra Chiini: Tumbutu), is an ancient city in Mali, situated 20?km (12?mi) north of the Niger River. The town is the capital of the Timbuktu Region, one of the eight administrative regions of Mali. It had a population of 54,453 in the 2009 census.\\r\\n\\r\\nStarting out as a seasonal settlement, Timbuktu became a permanent settlement early in the 10th century. After a shift in trading routes, Timbuktu flourished from the trade in salt, gold, ivory and slaves. It became part of the Mali Empire early in the 14th century. In the first half of the 15th century, the Tuareg tribes took control of the city for a short period until the expanding Songhai Empire absorbed the city in 1468. A Moroccan army defeated the Songhai in 1591 and made Timbuktu, rather than Gao, their capital. The invaders established a new ruling class, the Arma, who after 1612 became virtually independent of Morocco. However, the golden age of the city, during which it was a major learning and cultural centre of the Mali Empire, was over, and it entered a long period of decline. Different tribes governed until the French took over in 1893, a situation that lasted until it became part of the current Republic of Mali in 1960. Presently, Timbuktu is impoverished and suffers from desertification.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn its Golden Age, the town's numerous Islamic scholars and extensive trading network made possible an important book trade: together with the campuses of the Sankore Madrasah, an Islamic university, this established Timbuktu as a scholarly centre in Africa. Several notable historic writers, such as Shabeni and Leo Africanus, have described Timbuktu. These stories fuelled speculation in Europe, where the city's reputation shifted from being extremely rich to being mysterious.\\r\\n\\r\\nOver the centuries, the spelling of Timbuktu has varied a great deal: from Tenbuch on the Catalan Atlas (1375), to traveller Antonio Malfante's Thambet, used in a letter he wrote in 1447 and also adopted by Alvise Cadamosto in his Voyages of Cadamosto, to Heinrich Barth's Timb~ktu and Timbu'ktu. French spelling often appears in international reference as \\"Tombouctou\\". As well as its spelling, Timbuktu's toponymy is still open to discussion.[2] At least four possible origins of the name of Timbuktu have been described:\\r\\n\\r\\nThe validity of these theories depends on the identity of the original founders of the city: as recently as 2000, archaeological research has not found remains dating from the 11th/12th century within the limits of the modern city given the difficulty of excavating through metres of sand that have buried the remains over the past centuries.[8][9] Without consensus, the etymology of Timbuktu remains unclear.\\r\\n\\r\\nLike other important Medieval West African towns such as Djenn (Jenn-Jeno), Gao, and Dia, Iron Age settlements have been discovered near Timbuktu that predate the traditional foundation date of the town. Although the accumulation of thick layers of sand has thwarted archaeological excavations in the town itself,[10][9] some of the surrounding landscape is deflating and exposing pottery shards on the surface. A survey of the area by Susan and Roderick McIntosh in 1984 identified several Iron Age sites along the el-Ahmar, an ancient wadi system that passes a few kilometres to the east of the modern town.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nAn Iron Age tell complex located 9 kilometres (6 miles) southeast of the Timbuktu near the Wadi el-Ahmar was excavated between 2008 and 2010 by archaeologists from Yale University and the Mission Culturelle de Tombouctou. The results suggest that the site was first occupied during the 5th century BC, thrived throughout the second half of the 1st millennium AD and eventually collapsed sometime during the late 10th or early 11th century AD.[12][13]\\r\\n\\r\\nTimbuktu was a regional trade centre in medieval times, where caravans met to exchange salt from the Sahara Desert for gold, ivory, and slaves from the Sahel, which could be reached via the nearby Niger River. The population swelled from 10,000 in the 13th century to about 50,000 in the 16th century after the establishment of a major Islamic university, which attracted scholars from throughout the Muslim world. In the 1600s, a combination of a purge by a monarch who accused the scholars of \\"disloyalty\\" and a decline in trade caused by increased competition from newly available trans-Atlantic sailing routes caused the city to decline. The first European to reach Timbuktu, Alexander Gordon Laing, did not arrive until 1826, and it was not until the 1890s that Timbuktu was formally incorporated into the French colony of Mali. Today, the city is still inhabited, but it plays little role on the world stage.\\r\\n\\r\\nTimbuktu is located on the southern edge of the Sahara 15?km (9?mi) north of the main channel of the River Niger. The town is surrounded by sand dunes and the streets are covered in sand. The port of Kabara is 8?km (5?mi) to the south of the town and is connected to an arm of the river by a 3?km (2?mi) canal. The canal had become heavily silted but in 2007 it was dredged as part of a Libyan financed project.[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe annual flood of the Niger River is a result of the heavy rainfall in the headwaters of the Niger and Bani rivers in Guinea and northern Ivory Coast. The rainfall in these areas peaks in August but the flood water takes time to pass down the river system and through the Inner Niger Delta. At Koulikoro, 60?km (37?mi) downstream from Bamako, the flood peaks in September,[15] while in Timbuktu the flood lasts longer and usually reaches a maximum at the end of December.[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the past, the area flooded by the river was more extensive and in years with high rainfall, floodwater would reach the western outskirts of Timbuktu itself.[17] A small navigable creek to the west of the town is shown on the maps published by Heinrich Barth in 1857[18] and Flix Dubois in 1896.[19] Between 1917 and 1921, during the colonial period, the French used slave labour to dig a narrow canal linking Timbuktu with Kabara.[20] Over the following decades this became silted and filled with sand, but in 2007 as part of the dredging project, the canal was re-excavated so that now when the River Niger floods, Timbuktu is again connected to Kabara.[14][21] The Malian government has promised to address problems with the design of the canal as it currently lacks footbridges and the steep, unstable banks make access to the water difficult.[22]\\r\\n\\r\\nKabara can only function as a port in December to January when the river is in full flood. When the water levels are lower, boats dock at Korioum which is linked to Timbuktu by 18?km (11?mi) of paved road.\\r\\n\\r\\nTimbuktu features a hot desert climate according to the K?ppen Climate Classification. The weather is hot and dry throughout much of the year. Average daily maximum temperatures in the hottest months of the year ÿ April, May and June ÿ exceed 40?C (104?F). Lowest temperatures occur during the Northern hemisphere winter ÿ December, January and February. However, average maximum temperatures do not drop below 30?C (86?F). These winter months are characterized by a dry, dusty trade wind blowing from the Saharan Tibesti Region southward to the Gulf of Guinea: picking up dust particles on their way, these winds limit visibility in what has been dubbed the 'Harmattan Haze'.[23] Additionally, when the dust settles in the city, sand builds up and desertification looms.[24]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe wealth and very existence of Timbuktu depended on its position as the southern terminus of an important trans-Saharan trade route; nowadays, the only goods that are routinely transported across the desert are slabs of rock salt brought from the Taoudenni mining centre in the central Sahara 664?km (413?mi) north of Timbuktu. Until the second half of the 20th century most of the slabs were transported by large salt caravans or azalai, one leaving Timbuktu in early November and the other in late March.[28]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe caravans of several thousand camels took three weeks each way, transporting food to the miners and returning with each camel loaded with four or five 30?kg (66?lb) slabs of salt. The salt transport was largely controlled by the desert nomads of the Arabic-speaking Berabich (or Barabish) tribe.[29] Although there are no roads, the slabs of salt are now usually transported from Taoudenni by truck.[30] From Timbuktu the salt is transported by boat to other towns in Mali.\\r\\n\\r\\nBetween the 12th and 14th centuries, Timbuktu's population grew immensely due to an influx of Tuaregs, Fulanis, and Songhais seeking trade, security, or to study. By 1300, the population increased to 10,000 and kept increasing until it reached about 50,000 in the 1500s.[31]\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is insufficient rainfall in the Timbuktu region for purely rain-fed agriculture and crops are therefore irrigated using water from the River Niger. The main agricultural crop is rice. African floating rice (Oryza glaberrima) has traditionally been grown in regions near the river that are inundated during the annual flood. Seed is sown at the beginning of the rainy season (JuneÿJuly) so that when the flood water arrives plants are already 30 to 40?cm (12 to 16?in) in height.[32]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe plants grow up to three metres (9.8 feet) in height as the water level rises. The rice is harvested by canoe in December. The procedure is very precarious and the yields are low but the method has the advantage that little capital investment is required. A successful crop depends critically on the amount and timing of the rain in the wet season and the height of the flood. To a limited extent the arrival of the flood water can be controlled by the construction of small mud dikes that become submerged as the water rises.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough floating rice is still cultivated in the Timbuktu Cercle, most of the rice is now grown in three relatively large irrigated areas that lie to the south of the town: Daye (392?ha), Koriom (550?ha) and Hamadja (623?ha).[33] Water is pumped from the river using ten large Archimedes' screws which were first installed in the 1990s. The irrigated areas are run as cooperatives with approximately 2,100 families cultivating small plots.[34] Nearly all the rice produced is consumed by the families themselves. The yields are still relatively low and the farmers are being encouraged to change their agricultural practices.[35]\\r\\n\\r\\nMost tourists visit Timbuktu between November and February when the air temperature is lower. In the 1980s, accommodation for the small number of tourists was provided by two small hotels: Hotel Bouctou and Hotel Azala?.[36] Over the following decades the tourist numbers increased so that by 2006 there were seven small hotels and guest houses.[33] The town benefited by the revenue from the CFA?5000 tourist tax,[33] by the sale of handicrafts and by the employment for the guides.\\r\\n\\r\\nStarting in 2008 the Al-Qaeda Organization in the Islamic Maghreb began kidnapping groups of tourists in the Sahel region.[37] In January 2009, four tourists were kidnapped near the MaliÿNiger border after attending a cultural festival at Anderamboukan.[38] One of these tourists was subsequently murdered.[39] As a result of this and various other incidents a number of states including France,[40] Britain[41] and the US,[42] began advising their citizens to avoid travelling far from Bamako. The number of tourists visiting Timbuktu dropped precipitously from around 6000 in 2009 to only 492 in the first four months of 2011.[36]\\r\\n\\r\\nBecause of the security concerns, the Malian government moved the 2010 Festival in the Desert from Essakane to the outskirts of Timbuktu.[43][44]  In November 2011, gunmen attacked tourists staying at a hotel in Timbuktu, killing one of them and kidnapping three others.[45][46] This was the first terrorist incident in Timbuktu itself.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 1 April 2012, one day after the capture of Gao, Timbuktu was captured from the Malian military by the Tuareg rebels of the MNLA and Ansar Dine.[47] Five days later, the MNLA declared the region independent of Mali as the nation of Azawad.[48] The declared political entity was not recognized by any regional nations or the international community and it collapsed three months later on 12 July.[49]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 28 January 2013, French and Malian government troops began retaking Timbuktu from the Islamist rebels.[50] The force of 1,000 French troops with 200 Malian soldiers retook Timbuktu without a fight. The Islamist groups had already fled north a few days earlier, having set fire to the Ahmed Baba Institute, which housed many important manuscripts. The building housing the Ahmed Baba Institute was funded by South Africa, and held 30,000 manuscripts. BBC World Service radio news reported on 29 January 2013 that approximately 28,000 of the manuscripts in the Institute had been removed to safety from the premises before the attack by the Islamist groups, and that the whereabouts of about 2,000 manuscripts remained unknown.[51] It was intended to be a resource for Islamic research.[52]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 30 March 2013, jihadist rebels infiltrated into Timbuktu nine days before a suicide bombing on a Malian army checkpoint at the international airport killing a soldier. Fighting lasted until 1 April, when French warplanes helped Malian ground forces chase the remaining rebels out of the city center.\\r\\n\\r\\nTales of Timbuktu's fabulous wealth helped prompt European exploration of the west coast of Africa. Among the most famous descriptions of Timbuktu are those of Leo Africanus and Shabeni.\\r\\n\\r\\nLeo Africanus, Descrittione dell' Africa[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nLeo Africanus, Descrittione dell' Africa in Paul Brians' Reading About the World, Volume 2[53]\\r\\n\\r\\nPerhaps most famous among the accounts written about Timbuktu is that by Leo Africanus. Born El Hasan ben Muhammed el- Wazzan-ez-Zayyati in Granada in 1485, his family was among the thousands of Muslims expelled by King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella after their reconquest of Spain in 1492. They settled in Morocco, where he studied in Fes and accompanied his uncle on diplomatic missions throughout North Africa. During these travels, he visited Timbuktu. As a young man he was captured by pirates and presented as an exceptionally learned slave to Pope Leo X, who freed him, baptized him under the name \\"Johannis Leo de Medici\\", and commissioned him to write, in Italian, a detailed survey of Africa. His accounts provided most of what Europeans knew about the continent for the next several centuries.[54] Describing Timbuktu when the Songhai empire was at its height, the English edition of his book includes the description:\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to Leo Africanus, there were abundant supplies of locally produced corn, cattle, milk and butter, though there were neither gardens nor orchards surrounding the city.[53] In another passage dedicated to describing the wealth of both the environment and the king, Africanus touches upon the rarity of some of Timbuktu's trade commodities: salt.\\r\\nThese descriptions and passages alike caught the attention of European explorers. Africanus, though, also described the more mundane aspects of the city, such as the \\"cottages built of chalk, and covered with thatch\\" ÿ although these went largely unheeded.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nÿ Shabeni in James Grey Jackson's An Account of Timbuctoo and Hausa, 1820[55]\\r\\n\\r\\nRoughly 250 years after Leo Africanus' visit to Timbuktu, the city had seen many rulers. The end of the 18th century saw the grip of the Moroccan rulers on the city wane, resulting in a period of unstable government by quickly changing tribes. During the rule of one of those tribes, the Hausa, a 14-year-old child from Ttouan accompanied his father on a visit to Timbuktu. Growing up a merchant, he was captured and eventually brought to England.[56]\\r\\n\\r\\nShabeni, or Asseed El Hage Abd Salam Shabeeny stayed in Timbuktu for three years before moving to Housa. Two years later, he returned to Timbuktu to live there for another seven years ÿ one of a population that was even centuries after its peak and excluding slaves, double the size of the 21st-century town.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy the time Shabeni was 27, he was an established merchant in his hometown. Returning from a trade mission to Hamburg, his English ship was captured and brought to Ostend by a ship under Russian colours in December 1789. He was subsequently set free by the British consulate, but his ship set him ashore in Dover for fear of being captured again. Here, his story was recorded. Shabeeni gave an indication of the size of the city in the second half of the 18th century. In an earlier passage, he described an environment that was characterized by forest, as opposed to nowadays' arid surroundings.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe most well-known cultural event is the Festival au Dsert.[57] When the Tuareg rebellion ended in 1996 under the Konar administration, 3,000 weapons were burned in a ceremony dubbed the Flame of Peace on 29 March 2007 ÿ to commemorate the ceremony, a monument was built.[58] The Festival au Dsert, to celebrate the peace treaty, is held near the city in January.[57]\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring its twelfth session, in December 1988, the World Heritage Committee (WHC) selected parts of Timbuktu's historic centre for inscription on its World Heritage list.[59] The selection was based on three criteria:[60]\\r\\n\\r\\nAn earlier nomination in 1979 failed the following year as it lacked proper demarcation:[60] the Malian government included the town of Timbuktu as a whole in the wish for inclusion.[61] Close to a decade later, three mosques and 16 mausoleums or cemeteries were selected from the Old Town for World Heritage status: with this conclusion came the call for protection of the buildings' conditions, an exclusion of new construction works near the sites and measures against the encroaching sand.\\r\\n\\r\\nShortly afterwards, the monuments were placed on the List of World Heritage in Danger by the Malian government, as  by the selection committee at the time of nomination.[59] The first period on the Danger List lasted from 1990 until 2005, when a range of measures including restoration work and the compilation of an inventory warranted \\"its removal from the Danger List\\".[62] In 2008 the WHC placed the protected area under increased scrutiny dubbed \\"reinforced monitoring\\", a measure made possible in 2007, as the impact of planned construction work was unclear. Special attention was given to the build of a cultural centre.[63]\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring a session in June 2009, UNESCO decided to cease its increased monitoring program as it felt sufficient progress had been made to address the initial concerns.[64] Following the takeover of Timbuktu by MNLA and the Islamist group Ansar Dine, it was returned to the List of World Heritage in Danger in 2012.[65]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn May 2012, Ansar Dine destroyed a shrine in the city[66] and in June 2012, in the aftermath of the Battle of Gao and Timbuktu, other shrines, including the mausoleum of Sidi Mahmoud, were destroyed when attacked with shovels and pickaxes by members of the same group.[65] An Ansar Dine spokesman said that all shrines in the city, including the 13 remaining World Heritage sites, would be destroyed because they consider them to be examples of idolatry, a sin in Islam.[65][67]  These acts have been described as crimes against humanity and war crimes.[68]\\r\\nAfter the destruction of the tombs, UNESCO created a special fund to safeguard Mali's World Heritage Sites, vowing to carry out reconstruction and rehabilitation projects once the security situation allows.[69]\\r\\n\\r\\nÿ Kwame Nkrumah at the University of Ghana inauguration, 1961[58]\\r\\n\\r\\nTimbuktu was a world centre of Islamic learning from the 13th to the 17th century, especially under the Mali Empire and Askia Mohammad I's rule. The Malian government and NGOs have been working to catalog and restore the remnants of this scholarly legacy: Timbuktu's manuscripts.[70]\\r\\n\\r\\nTimbuktu's rapid economic growth in the 13th and 14th centuries drew many scholars from nearby Walata (today in Mauretania),[71] leading up to the city's golden age in the 15th and 16th centuries that proved fertile ground for scholarship of religions, arts and sciences. To the people of Timbuktu, literacy and books were symbols of wealth, power, and blessings and the acquisition of books became a primary concern for scholars.[72] An active trade in books between Timbuktu and other parts of the Islamic world and emperor Askia Mohammed's strong support led to the writing of thousands of manuscripts.[73]\\r\\n\\r\\nKnowledge was gathered in a manner similar to the early, informal European Medieval university model.[71] Lecturing was presented through a range of informal institutions called madrasahs.[74] Nowadays known as the University of Timbuktu, three madrasahs facilitated 25,000 students: Djinguereber, Sidi Yahya and Sankore.[75]\\r\\n\\r\\nThese institutions were explicitly religious, as opposed to the more secular curricula of modern European universities and more similar to the medieval Europe model. However, where universities in the European sense started as associations of students and teachers, West-African education was patronized by families or lineages, with the Aqit and Bunu al-Qadi al-Hajj families being two of the most prominent in Timbuktu ÿ these families also facilitated students is set-aside rooms in their housings.[76]  Although the basis of Islamic law and its teaching were brought to Timbuktu from North Africa with the spread of Islam, Western African scholarship developed: Ahmad Baba al Massufi is regarded as the city's greatest scholar.[77]\\r\\n\\r\\nTimbuktu served in this process as a distribution centre of scholars and scholarship. Its reliance on trade meant intensive movement of scholars between the city and its extensive network of trade partners. In 1468ÿ1469 though, many scholars left for Walata when Sunni Ali's Songhay Empire absorbed Timbuktu and again in 1591 with the Moroccan occupation.[71]\\r\\n\\r\\nThis system of education survived until the late 19th century, while the 18th century saw the institution of itinerant Quranic school as a form of universal education, where scholars would travel throughout the region with their students, begging for food part of the day.[70]\\r\\nIslamic education came under pressure after the French occupation, droughts in the 70s and 80s and by Mali's civil war in the early 90s.[70]\\r\\n\\r\\nHundreds of thousands of manuscripts were collected in Timbuktu over the course of centuries: some were written in the town itself, others ÿ including exclusive copies of the Qur'an for wealthy families ÿ imported through the lively booktrade.\\r\\n\\r\\nHidden in cellars or buried, hid between the mosque's mud walls and safeguarded by their patrons, many of these manuscripts survived the city's decline. They now form the collection of several libraries in Timbuktu, holding up to 700,000 manuscripts:[78]  In late January 2013 it was reported that rebel forces destroyed many of the manuscripts before leaving the city.[79][80] However, there was no malicious destruction of any library or collection as most of the manuscripts were safely hidden away.[81][82][83][84] One librarian in particular, Abdel Kader Haidara, organized to have 350,000 medieval manuscripts smuggled out of Timbuktu for safekeeping.[85][86]\\r\\n\\r\\nThese libraries are the largest among up to 60 private or public libraries that are estimated to exist in Timbuktu today, although some comprise little more than a row of books on a shelf or a bookchest.[87] Under these circumstances, the manuscripts are vulnerable to damage and theft, as well as long term climate damage, despite Timbuktu's arid climate. Two Timbuktu Manuscripts Projects funded by independent universities have aimed to preserve them.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the occupation by Islamic extremists the citizens of the city embarked on a drive to save the best written accounts of African History.  Interviewed by the Times the local residents claimed  to have safeguarded the three hundred thousand manuscripts for generations. Many of these documents are still in the safe keeping of the local residents who are reluctant to give them overs to the government-run Ahmed Baba Institute housed  in a modern digitalization building built by the South African government in 2009. The institute houses only 10% of the manuscripts[88]  It was later confirmed by Jean-Michel Djian to the New Yorker that \\"the great majority of the manuscripts, about fifty thousand, are actually housed in the thirty-two family libraries of the 'City of 333 Saints'\\".?He added, \\"Those are to this day protected.\\" He also added that due to the massive efforts of one individual two hundred thousand other manuscripts were successfully transported to safety[89]\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough French is Mali's official language, today the large majority of Timbuktu's inhabitants speaks Koyra Chiini, a Songhay language that also functions as the lingua franca. Before the 1990ÿ1994 Tuareg rebellion, both Hassaniya Arabic and Tamashek were represented by 10% each to an 80% dominance of the Koyra Chiini language. With Tamashek spoken by both Ikelan and ethnic Tuaregs, its use declined with the expulsion of many Tuaregs following the rebellion, increasing the dominance of Koyra Chiini.[90]\\r\\n\\r\\nArabic, introduced together with Islam during the 11th century, has mainly been the language of scholars and religion, comparable to Latin in Western Christianity.[91] Although Bambara is spoken by the most numerous ethnic group in Mali, the Bambara people, it is mainly confined to the south of the country. With an improving infrastructure granting Timbuktu access to larger cities in Mali's South, use of Bambara was increasing in the city at least until Azawad independence.[90]\\r\\n\\r\\nWith no railroads in Mali except for the Dakar-Niger Railway up to Koulikoro, access to Timbuktu is by road, boat or, since 1961, aircraft.[92] With high water levels in the Niger from August to December, Compagnie Malienne de Navigation (COMANAV) passenger ferries operate a leg between Koulikoro and downstream Gao on a roughly weekly basis. Also requiring high water are pinasses (large motorized pirogues), either chartered or public, that travel up and down the river.[93]\\r\\n\\r\\nBoth ferries and pinasses arrive at Korioum, Timbuktu's port, which is linked to the city centre by an 18?km (11?mi) paved road running through Kabara. In 2007, access to Timbuktu's traditional port, Kabara, was restored by a Libyan funded project that dredged the 3?km (2?mi) silted canal connecting Kabara to an arm of the Niger River. COMANAV ferries and pinassses are now able to reach the port when the river is in full flood.[14][94]\\r\\n\\r\\nTimbuktu is poorly connected to the Malian road network with only dirt roads to the neighbouring towns. Although the Niger River can be crossed by ferry at Korioum, the roads south of the river are no better. However, a new paved road is under construction between Niono and Timbuktu running to the north of the Inland Niger Delta. The 565?km (351?mi) road will pass through Nampala, Lr, Niafunk, Tonka, Dir and Goundam.[95][96] The completed 81?km (50?mi) section between Niono and the small village of Goma Coura was financed by the Millennium Challenge Corporation.[97] This new section will service the Alatona irrigation system development of the Office du Niger.[98] The 484?km (301?mi) section between Goma Coura and Timbuktu is being financed by the European Development Fund.[95]\\r\\n\\r\\nTimbuktu Airport is served by both Air Mali and Mali Air Express, hosting flights to and from Bamako, Gao and Mopti.[93] Its 6,923?ft (2,110 m) runway in a 07/25 runway orientation is both lighted and paved.[99]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the imagination of Europeans and North Americans, Timbuktu is a place that bears with it a sense of mystery: a 2006 survey of 150 young Britons found 34% did not believe the town existed, while the other 66% considered it \\"a mythical place\\".[100] This sense has been acknowledged in literature describing African history and African-European relations. Timbuktu is also often considered a far away place, in popular western culture.[2][101][102]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe origin of this mystification lies in the excitement brought to Europe by the legendary tales, especially those by Leo Africanus: Arabic sources focused mainly on more affluent cities in the Timbuktu region, such as Gao and Walata.[9] In West Africa the city holds an image that has been compared to Europe's view on Athens.[101] As such, the picture of the city as the epitome of distance and mystery is a European one.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nDown-to-earth-aspects in Africanus' descriptions were largely ignored and stories of great riches served as a catalyst for travellers to visit the inaccessible city ÿ with prominent French explorer Ren Cailli characterising Timbuktu as \\"a mass of ill-looking houses built of earth\\".[103] Now opened up, many travellers acknowledged the unfitting description of an \\"African El Dorado\\".[24] This development shifted the city's reputation ÿ from being fabled because of its gold to fabled because of its location and mystery: Being used in this sense since at least 1863, English dictionaries now cite Timbuktu as a metaphor for any faraway place.[104]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the original 1932 recording of the popular seaside song \\"The Sun Has Got His Hat On\\", the second verse contains the lines: \\"[The Sun's] been tanning niggers out in Timbuktu / Now he's coming back to do the same to you!\\"[105] Due to the controversial nature of the racial epithet \\"nigger\\", controversy has arisen when this song has been played[106] and various replacements, including \\"negroes\\"[107] and \\"roasting peanuts\\"[108] have been offered.\\r\\n\\r\\nSimilar uses of the city are found in movies, where it is used to indicate a place a person or good cannot be traced ÿ in a Dutch Donald Duck comic subseries situated in Timbuktu, Donald Duck uses the city as a safe haven,[109] and in the 1970 Disney animated feature The Aristocats, Edgar, the villain of the story, threatens the cats with being sent to Timbuktu only for their friends to rescue them and send Edgar there instead. It is mistakenly noted to be in French Equatorial Africa, instead of French West Africa.[110]\\r\\n\\r\\nAli Farka Tour inverted the stereotype: \\"For some people, when you say 'Timbuktu' it is like the end of the world, but that is not true. I am from Timbuktu, and I can tell you that we are right at the heart of the world.\\"[111]\\r\\n\\r\\nTimbuktu is a sister city to the following cities:[112]","input":"When did timbuktu become a world heritage site?"},{"output":"studs","context":"Cleats or studs are protrusions on the sole of a shoe, or on an external attachment to a shoe, that provide additional traction on a soft or slippery surface. They can be conical or blade-like in shape, and made of plastic, rubber or metal. In American English the term cleats is used synecdochically to refer to shoes featuring such protrusions. Similarly, in British English the term 'studs' can be used to refer to 'football boots' or 'rugby boots', for instance, in a similar manner to the way 'spikes' is often used to refer to athletics shoes. The type of studs worn depends on the environment of play, whether it be grass, ice, artificial turf, or other grounds requiring versatility.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAthletes have worn cleats since at least the 1500s. Although there are no images or surviving examples of cleats from that time period, the first written documentation of cleats comes from 1526, when \\"football boots\\" were listed in King Henry VIII's Great Wardrobe.[1] According to researchers, the English monarch ordered the royal cordwainer (shoemaker), Cornelius Johnson, to make him a pair of hand-stitched boots \\"to play football\\". The shoes cost four shillings (about $200 today) and were probably made of especially strong leather.\\r\\nFootball remained a popular sport in England throughout the ensuing centuries, but it wasnt until the emergence of The Football Association in 1863 that the sport of football emerged as an actual organized game in England.[2] With this, the sport took off in popularity, and understandably a demand for equipment began to emerge to ensure player safety and comfort. More importantly, technological innovations during this time period played a key role in new methods and materials used for production of cleats. In the 1840s, a method of hardening rubber and stopping it from decaying, called vulcanization, was developed in both England and the United States.[3] Vulcanized rubber is used in the production of all types of shoes, but is especially beneficial in the production of cleats, in that one of the primary purposes of football cleats is to protect the player's feet. Technology continued to improve in the coming decades, and by the 1890s studs are first used to make football cleats. The concept of spiked and studded shoes for other sports began to emerge as well in the late 19th century. In the 1890s, a British Company (now known as Reebok), developed the earliest known spiked leather running shoes.[3]\\r\\nCleats began to be used in the United States in the 1860s when metal spikes were first used on baseball shoes.[4] A baseball shoe, as defined by the Dickson Baseball Dictionary (3rd Ed), is \\"a special type of shoe designed and worn by baseball players that features cleats for traction and a full set of laces for support.\\"[5] The first official baseball shoe was invented and produced by Waldo M. Claflin, of Philadelphia in 1882.[5] The use of cleats gained further notoriety in the United States with the birth of American football in the early 20th century. The original football shoes were actually baseball shoes, but innovations quickly emerged. In the 1920s, detachable cleats were first introduced. As the game continued to grow, cleats had to adapt to technological advances in playing surfaces, most notably artificial turf. By the 1970s, players were wearing footwear with short, rubber cleats for use on artificial turf.[6]\\r\\nInnovations in cleat technology continued to take place throughout the mid to late 20th century. In 1954, the first modern football boots were made by Adidas. They were lighter, had a non-leather sole, an upper portion made from kangaroo skin, and included replaceable rubber or plastic studs, which could be screwed in at different lengths. Later, in the 1990s, Adidas introduced another innovation in the form of rubber blades instead of studs, which faced different directions and allowed for better grip. Today, different types of cleats exist for different surfaces: replaceable aluminum cleats which are worn in wet dirt, firm plastic cleats which are for regular surfaces, and short, plastic or rubber cleats for very hard surfaces.[7]\\r\\nFirm Ground cleats are defined as cleats that are made typically for use on natural surfaces such as dirt and grass. These cleats are equipped with large studs on the bottom of the shoe to assist in gripping the surface and preventing sliding and assisting in rapid directional changes. These studs are permanently attached to the cleats (i.e. they are not removable). The stud itself is often called a cleat.[8] There are three main types of soccer cleats: round, hard ground, and bladed. Active outdoorsman and philanthropist Erik Van Till is credited as a creator of the round cleat. While the studs are sometimes made out of metal, this is less common, as they are illegal in some sports for safety reasons.\\r\\nIn association football, where the shoes themselves are known as football boots, there are three different cleat types. There are soft ground cleats which are made for wet weather. The soft ground cleats are always replaceable, and are almost always metal, so when they wear down they are easy to replace. There are firm ground cleats which are made for firm natural surfaces. In the UK, 'cleats' are universally known as studs. The term \\"sliding tackle\\" is considered a dangerous tackle made with the feet raised and the potentially damaging metal studs impacting on the legs or feet of the opponent.\\r\\nIn the United States of America, college football coach Joseph Pipal has been credited as one of the creators of \\"mud cleats\\" for football shoes.[9] Some of the first manufacturers of football cleats were Gola in 1905, Valsport in 1920 and Hummel in 1923 and are still in business today.[10] in the year 1925 two brothers named Adolf and Rudolf Dassler developed a football cleat with replaceable metal studs for American football.[10] The two brothers that created the first replaceable metal cleats had a falling out after WWII and they both went on to create two major football cleat manufacturers in Puma and Adidas.[11] In 1929 the company Riddell made huge strides in the football cleat industry. They modeled the cleats differently featuring an \\"action last\\", meaning its sole had a steeper angle for \\"snug fit, proper support and maximum traction.\\"[11] In today's game more players prefer to wear molded cleats because they are more comfortable, but don't allow for changing during certain field conditions. Depending on the type of field, grass or artificial turf, players may opt to wear molded or removable stud cleats, since studs can vary in length and give more traction on grass than molded cleats do. There are different Protective equipment in gridiron football, cleats being a major aspect. Some of the major brands that players wear today are Nike, Adidas, and Under Armor.\\r\\nIn Australia, the studs on Australian rules football boots are traditionally referred to as \\"stops\\".[12] Prior to modern molded plastic soles, these were often replaceable screw-in wooden studs.\\r\\nUpdate 2018: There is a photo of the Carlton Football Club team taken in 1884 and three or four stops/studs can be clearly seen on the soles of the boots. See http://www.blueseum.org/1884\\r\\nIn 1889 there were at least two types of stops used. One had a screw in the centre of stop/stud which was made up of conical shaped and layered leather strips. It was screwed into the boot sole. The other was the same as the other type, but fixed on to the boot sole by two nails.\\r\\nPS: The correct name of the code is Australian Football.\\r\\nIn baseball, in laymen's terms, they are referred to as \\"cleats\\" or \\"spikes\\". The spikes are rectangular in shape, and can be made of rubber, plastic, or metal. Rubber cleats may feature grooves and smaller protrusions in the middle of the sole, while soft rubber spikes would be around the edges of the sole and at the heel. Plastic cleats are similar to rubber spikes. However, they have feature a hard bottom and thick hard plastic spikes, with few to no grooves at all, and instead of as the edge of the sole, the spikes compose the outsole of the shoe where the toes and ball of the foot would hit the ground during running, similar to track spikes and football cleats. Metal spikes are similar to plastic spikes, but instead of being thick pieces of plastic as spikes, they are thin pieces of metal to make it easier to dig into grass and sand, and thereby increase traction.[13]\\r\\nRubber and plastic cleats are used in youth baseball, with metal cleats typically prohibited.[13] Metal spikes are almost exclusively used in the upper levels of the sport, including high school, college, and professional baseball.[13] The use of metal spikes in American high school baseball was banned by the National Federation of State High School Associations in 1984 due to the risk of spike wounds, although some states received waivers nullifying the ban.[14][15][16] The ban was lifted in 1989.[14] There has also been increasing use of plastic spikes among professional players including those in Major League Baseball (MLB), due to the lighter weight of cleats and improved weight distribution leading to less wear and tear during the season.[17]\\r\\nLacrosse cleats are characterized by having a high support for the ankle, and appear most similar to American Football cleats. A raised platform material surrounding the ankles is specific to the motions of players in the game. These motions include stopping and starting, and quick changes of direction as the game of play can rapidly change directions to either end of the field, necessitating ankle stability for such direction change. Lacrosse cleats contain a typical, standard toe cleat in the front and beneath the toes, for gaining traction off the toe. This is utilized for forward running, as well as potential pivot movement from the toe. Lacrosse cleats again differ from American Football cleats in that their cleats are placed to the edges of the foot sole whereas for Football the cleat spikes are found beneath the sole of the foot.[18]\\r\\nDetachable cleats are defined as those in which the studs are removable, typically through attaching or detaching a metal or plastic piece to the bottom of the shoe.\\r\\nA specially shaped metal or plastic piece that attaches to the bottom of a cycling shoe to positively and securely attach it to a clipless pedal system is called a cleat. The cleat engages with the pedal such that the cyclist's shoe remains mechanically attached to the pedal during pedalling. Typically the cleat and shoe are engaged with the pedal by pressing down against a spring loaded retention mechanism, and released by twisting the shoe and cleat sideways.\\r\\nIce cleats or crampons are a type of spikes that usually are attachable under the soles of shoes (in such cases also called \\"shoe chains\\") to prevent slipping, especially on ice. There are several variations on the way they are mounted, sometimes with rubber bands or a fixed mount in front of the heel, making them easy to remove when not in use.\\r\\nOn soft (wet, muddy) ground, players often opt for removable studs. These are usual metal cones that vary in length, but are generally longer than traditional soccer studs. Added to the rubber or plastic studs already on the boot, these create more opportunities for the player to get a good foothold. The increased length and more aggressive shape help players gain traction in slippery conditions.\\r\\nArtificial Ground cleats are cleats that are made primarily for use on man-made surfaces, such as artificial turf or running tracks.\\r\\nAlthough conventional cleats can be used on turf surfaces, specialized baseball and softball turf shoes are also manufactured. These shoes typically have numerous rubber studs along the soles as opposed to spikes.[13]\\r\\nWhile many cleats manufactured today for football can be used on artificial turf or natural surfaces, many molded cleats are designed and better served for use on artificial turf. The molded cleats tend to provide better traction on artificial surfaces, whereas detachable studs on cleats tend to be too thick for artificial turf and do not provide adequate grip on such a surface.\\r\\nTurf shoes have identical uppers to traditional soccer boots, but the outsoles differ in that they make up the \\"cleat\\" portion. Small rubber studs or patterns are like raised bumps that provide just enough of a difference in height to aid in traction on flat artificial turf. They are extremely durable, as they are more of an extension of the rubber outsole than a completely new addition to the shoe.\\r\\nTrack spikes are placed at the bottom of shoes in order to increase traction and speed. While removable spikes are available, most runners opt for fixed spikes. These spikes come in a variety of different materials. Originally, spikes were made out of metal due to their strength and hardness. However, German engineers began experimenting with canvas and rubber spikes during the World War, in part to help find a more lightweight material. Finally, in the modern era, the most common type of track spike is made of plastic, due being both cheap and easily molded. This second aspect of plastic is especially important, as spikes need to be made in a variety of different shapes in order to accommodate runners on all different types of surfaces. Needle spikes (3/16\\") are used on all-weather tracks, Christmas tree spikes (1/4\\") are especially common on any surface, pyramid spikes are used for cross country runners, and tartan spikes (1/4\\") are used mostly on rubber tracks.[19]","input":"What is the bottom of a cleat called?"},{"output":"Jeanne Calment","context":"This is a list of tables of the oldest people in the world in ordinal ranks.

LUCA should not be assumed to be the first living organism on Earth. The LUCA is estimated to have lived some 3.5 to 3.8 billion years ago (sometime in the Paleoarchean era).[2][3] The composition of the LUCA is not directly accessible as a fossil, but can be studied by comparing the genomes of its descendents, organisms living today. By this means, a 2016 study identified a set of 355 genes inferred to have been present in the LUCA.[4]\\r\\nThe earliest evidence of life on Earth is biogenic graphite found in 3.7 billion-year-old metamorphized sedimentary rocks discovered in Western Greenland[5][6] and microbial mat fossils found in 3.48 billion-year-old sandstone discovered in Western Australia.[7][8] A 2015 study found potentially biogenic carbon from 4.1 billion years ago in ancient rocks in Western Australia, but such findings would indicate the existence of different conditions on Earth during that period from those generally assumed today, and point to an earlier origin of life.[9][10] In 2017, there was published a description of putative fossilized microorganisms that are at least 3.77 billion, and possibly 4.28 billion years old, in ferruginous sedimentary rocks in Quebec, Canada.[11]\\r\\nCharles Darwin proposed the theory of universal common descent through an evolutionary process in his book On the Origin of Species in 1859, saying, \\"Therefore I should infer from analogy that probably all the organic beings which have ever lived on this earth have descended from some one primordial form, into which life was first breathed.\\"[12]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBy analysis of the presumed LUCA's offspring groups, the LUCA appears to have been a small, single-celled organism. It likely had a ring-shaped coil of DNA floating freely within the cell, like modern bacteria. Morphologically, it would likely not have been exceptionally distinctive among a collection of generalized, small-size, modern-day bacteria. However, Carl Woese et al., who first proposed the currently-used three domain system based on an analysis of rRNA sequences of bacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes, stated that the LUCA would have been a \\"...simpler, more rudimentary entity than the individual ancestors that spawned the three [domains] (and their descendants)\\" regarding its genetic machinery.[13]\\r\\nWhile the gross anatomy of the LUCA can only be reconstructed with much uncertainty, its internal mechanisms can be described in some detail, based on the properties currently shared by all independently living organisms on Earth.[14][15][16][17]\\r\\nThe genetic code was most likely based on DNA.[18] Some studies suggest that the LUCA may have lacked DNA and been defined wholly through RNA.[19] If DNA was present, it was composed of four nucleotides (deoxyadenosine, deoxycytidine, deoxythymidine, and deoxyguanosine), to the exclusion of other possible deoxynucleotides. The DNA was kept double-stranded by a template-dependent enzyme, DNA polymerase. The integrity of the DNA was maintained by a group of maintenance enzymes, including DNA topoisomerase, DNA ligase and other DNA repair enzymes. The DNA was also protected by DNA-binding proteins such as histones. The genetic code was composed of three-nucleotide codons, thus producing 64 different codons. Since only 20 amino acids were used, multiple codons code for the same amino acids.[14][15][16][17] If the code was DNA-based, it operated as follows. The genetic code was expressed via RNA intermediates, which were single-stranded. The RNA was produced by a DNA-dependent RNA polymerase using nucleotides similar to those of DNA, with the exception that the nucleotide thymidine in DNA was replaced by uridine in RNA.[14][15][16][17]\\r\\nThe genetic code was expressed into proteins. These were assembled from free amino acids by translation of a messenger RNA by a mechanism composed of ribosomes, transfer RNAs, and a group of related proteins. The ribosomes were composed of two subunits, one big 50S and one small 30S. Each ribosomal subunit was composed of a core of ribosomal RNA surrounded by ribosomal proteins. Both types of RNA molecules (ribosomal and transfer RNAs) played an important role in the catalytic activity of the ribosomes. Only 20 amino acids were used, to the exclusion of countless other amino acids. Only the L-isomers of the amino acids were used. ATP was used as an energy intermediate. Several hundred enzymes made of protein catalyzed chemical reactions that extract energy from fats, sugars, and amino acids, and that synthesize fats, sugars, amino acids, and nucleic acid bases using arbitrary chemical pathways.[14][15][16][17]\\r\\nThe cell contained a water-based cytoplasm that was surrounded and effectively enclosed by a lipid bilayer membrane. Inside the cell, the concentration of sodium was lower, and potassium was higher, than outside. This gradient was maintained by specific ion transporters (also referred to as ion pumps). The cell multiplied by duplicating all its contents followed by cellular division.[14][15][16][17] The cell used chemiosmosis to produce energy. It also reduced CO2 and oxidized H2 (methanogenesis or acetogenesis) via acetyl-thioesters.[20][21]\\r\\nThe cell probably lived in conditions found in deep sea vents caused by ocean water interacting with magma beneath the ocean floor.[22][23]\\r\\nIn 1859, Charles Darwin published On the Origin of Species in which he twice stated the hypothesis that there was only one progenitor for all life forms. In the summation he states, \\"Therefore I should infer from analogy that probably all the organic beings which have ever lived on this earth have descended from some one primordial form, into which life was first breathed.\\"[25] The very last sentence begins with a restatement of the hypothesis: \\"There is grandeur in this view of life, with its several powers, having been originally breathed into a few forms or into one...\\"[25]\\r\\nWhen the LUCA was hypothesized, cladograms based on genetic distance between living cells indicated that Archaea split early from the rest of life. This was inferred from the fact that the archaeans known at that time were highly resistant to environmental extremes such as high salinity, temperature or acidity, leading some scientists to suggest that the LUCA evolved in areas like the deep ocean vents, where such extremes prevail today. Archaea, however, were later discovered in less hostile environments, and are now believed to be more closely related to eukaryotes than bacteria, although many details are still unknown.[26][27]\\r\\nIn 2010, based on \\"the vast array of molecular sequences now available from all domains of life,\\"[28] a formal test of universal common ancestry was published.[1] The formal test favored the existence of a universal common ancestor over a wide class of alternative hypotheses that included horizontal gene transfer. While the formal test overwhelmingly favored the existence of a single LUCA, this does not imply that the LUCA was ever alone. Instead, it was one of several early microbes.[1] However, given that many other nucleotides are possible besides those that are actually used in DNA and RNA today, it is almost certain that all organisms do have a single common ancestor. This is because it is extremely unlikely that organisms which descended from separate incidents where organic molecules initially came together to form cell-like structures would be able to complete a horizontal gene transfer without garbling each other's genes, converting them into noncoding segments. Further, many more amino acids are chemically possible than the twenty found in modern protein molecules. These lines of chemical evidence, taken into account for the formal statistical test by Theobald (2010), point to a single cell having been the LUCA in that, although other early microbes probably existed, only the LUCA's descendents survived beyond the Paleoarchean Era.[29] With a common framework in the AT/GC rule and the standard twenty amino acids, horizontal gene transfer would have been feasible and could have been very common later on among the progeny of that single cell.\\r\\nIn 1998, Carl Woese proposed (1) that no individual organism can be considered a LUCA, and (2) that the genetic heritage of all modern organisms derived through horizontal gene transfer among an ancient community of organisms.[30] While the results described by the later papers Theobald (2010) and Saey (2010) demonstrate the existence of a single LUCA, the argument in Woese (1998) can still be applied to Ur-organisms. At the beginnings of life, ancestry was not as linear as it is today because the genetic code took time to evolve.[31] Before high fidelity replication, organisms could not be easily mapped on a phylogenetic tree. Not to be confused with the Ur-organism, however, the LUCA lived after the genetic code and at least some rudimentary early form of molecular proofreading had already evolved. It was not the very first cell, but rather, the one whose descendants survived beyond the very early stages of microbial evolution.\\r\\nThe most commonly accepted location of the root of the tree of life is between a monophyletic domain Bacteria and a clade formed by Archaea and Eukaryota of what is referred to as the \\"traditional tree of life\\" based on several molecular studies.[32][33][34][35][36][37] A very small minority of studies have concluded differently, namely that the root is in the domain Bacteria, either in the phylum Firmicutes[38] or that the phylum Chloroflexi is basal to a clade with Archaea and Eukaryotes and the rest of Bacteria as proposed by Thomas Cavalier-Smith.[39]\\r\\nResearch published in 2016, by William F. Martin, by genetically analyzing 6.1 million protein coding genes from sequenced prokaryotic genomes of various phylogenetic trees, identified 355 protein clusters from amongst 286,514 protein clusters that were probably common to the LUCA. The results \\"depict LUCA as anaerobic, CO2-fixing, H2-dependent with a WoodÿLjungdahl pathway (the reductive acetyl-coenzyme A pathway), N2-fixing and thermophilic. LUCA's biochemistry was replete with FeS clusters and radical reaction mechanisms. Its cofactors reveal dependence upon transition metals, ?avins, S-adenosyl methionine, coenzyme A, ferredoxin, molybdopterin, corrins and selenium. Its genetic code required nucleoside modifications and S-adenosylmethionine-dependent methylations.\\" The results depict methanogenic clostria as a basal clade in the 355 lineages examined, and suggest that the LUCA inhabited an anaerobic hydrothermal vent setting in a geochemically active environment rich in H2, CO2, and iron.[23][40][41][42] However, the identification of these genes as being present in LUCA was criticized, suggesting that many of the proteins assumed to be present in LUCA represent later horizontal gene transfers between archaea and bacteria.[43]","input":"Approximately when did the ancestor of all life on earth live?"},{"output":"John Harington","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nThomas Crapper (baptised 28 September 1836; died 27 January 1910) was a plumber who founded Thomas Crapper & Co in London. He was noted for the quality of his products and received several royal warrants.\\r\\n\\r\\nManhole covers with Crapper's company's name on them in Westminster Abbey are now one of London's minor tourist attractions.[2][3] Thomas Crapper & Co owned the world's first bath, toilet and sink showroom, in King's Road until 1966. The firm's lavatorial equipment was manufactured at premises in nearby Marlborough Road (now Draycott Avenue).\\r\\n\\r\\nCrapper was born in Thorne, South Yorkshire, in 1836; the exact date is unknown, but he was baptised on 28?September 1836. His father, Charles, was a sailor. In 1853 he was apprenticed to his brother George, who was a master plumber in Chelsea. After his apprenticeship and three years as a journeyman plumber, in 1861 Crapper set himself up as a sanitary engineer, with his own brass foundry and workshops in nearby Marlborough Road.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe flushing toilet was invented by John Harington in 1596. Joseph Bramah of Yorkshire patented the first practical water closet in England in 1778. George Jennings in 1852 also took out a patent for the flush-out toilet.[4][5] In a time when bathroom fixtures were barely spoken of, Crapper heavily promoted sanitary plumbing and pioneered the concept of the bathroom fittings showroom.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the 1880s, Prince Edward (later Edward VII) purchased his country seat of Sandringham House in Norfolk and asked Thomas Crapper & Co. to supply the plumbing, including thirty lavatories with cedarwood seats and enclosures, thus giving Crapper his first Royal Warrant. The firm received further warrants from Edward as king and from George V both as Prince of Wales and as king.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1904, Crapper retired, passing the firm to his nephew George and his business partner Robert Marr Wharam. Crapper lived at 12 Thornsett Road, Anerley, for the last six years of his life and died on 27 January 1910. He was buried in the nearby Elmers End Cemetery.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1966 the company was sold  by then owner Robert G. Wharam (son of Robert Marr Wharam) on his retirement, to their rivals John Bolding & Sons. Bolding went into liquidation in 1969. The company fell out of use until it was acquired by Simon Kirby, a historian and collector of antique bathroom fittings, who relaunched the company in Stratford-upon-Avon, producing authentic reproductions of Crapper's original Victorian bathroom fittings.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the first man to set up public showrooms for displaying sanitary ware, he became known as an advocate of sanitary plumbing, popularising the notion of installation inside peoples homes. He also helped refine and develop improvements to existing plumbing and sanitary fittings. As a part of his business he maintained a foundry and metal shop which enabled him to try out new designs and develop more efficient plumbing solutions.[7] He won a patent as the original inventor for using a \\"floating ball cock\\" as a part of a water closet arrangement. He invented improvements on existing water closets, and he owned the patent for the siphonic flush toilet. He invented the manhole cover enabling easy maintenance access. As well as various improvements to plumbing fittings, not least improvements to the developing the plumbing trap (U-bend). While it's true that Alexander Cummings invented an S-shaped trap (the S-bend) in 1775, it had reliability problems. Once invented (despite its simplicity and reliability) widespread use of it in sewage systems was slow to catch on; coming, only when the Great Stink of the Thames in 1858, forced  Parliament to pass laws in the 1860s for closed sewers to be installed. It would eventually be replaced by Crapper's improved bend trap in 1880. The new U-bend was a significant improvement on the \\"S\\" as it could not jam, and unlike the S-bend, it did not have a tendency to dry out, and did not need an overflow.[8] The BBC was to nominate the S-bend as one of the 50 Things That (have) Made the Modern Economy[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nCrapper held nine patents, three of them for water closet improvements such as the floating ballcock, but none was for the flush toilet itself.[10] Thomas Crapper's advertisements implied the siphonic flush was his invention; one having the text \\"Crapper's Valveless Water Waste Preventer (Patent #4,990) One movable part only\\", but patent 4990 (for a minor improvement to the water waste preventer) was not his, but that of Albert Giblin in 1898.[11][12] Crapper's nephew, George, did improve the siphon mechanism by which the water flow is started. A patent for this development was awarded in 1897.[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nIt has often been claimed in popular culture that the slang term for human bodily waste, crap, originated with Thomas Crapper because of his association with lavatories. A common version of this story is that American servicemen stationed in England during World War I saw his name on cisterns and used it as army slang, i.e. \\"I'm going to the crapper\\".[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe word crap is actually of Middle English origin and predates its application to bodily waste. Its most likely etymological origin is a combination of two older words, the Dutch krappen: to pluck off, cut off, or separate; and the Old French crappe: siftings, waste or rejected matter (from the medieval Latin crappa, chaff).[14] In English, it was used to refer to chaff, and also to weeds or other rubbish. Its first application to bodily waste, according to the Oxford English Dictionary, appeared in 1846 under a reference to a crapping ken, or a privy, where ken means a house.[14]","input":"Who invented the first flush toilet in 1500?"},{"output":"Milton High School","context":"Gerry Lester \\"Bubba\\" Watson Jr.[1][2] (born November 5, 1978) is an American professional golfer who plays on the PGA Tour. One of the few left-handed golfers on tour, he is a multiple major champion, with victories at the Masters Tournament in 2012 and 2014.[3] In February 2015, Watson reached a career-high 2nd place in the Official World Golf Ranking.\\r\\nWatson is among the longest drivers on the PGA Tour; in 2007 he had an average drive of 315.2 yards (288.2?m) and can hit a ball over 350 yards (320?m), capable of generating a ball speed up to 194?mph (312?km/h).[4][5] He has finished top of the driving distance statistics five times in his career, during the 2006, 2007, 2008, 2012, and 2014 seasons.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWatson was born and raised in Bagdad, Florida, near Pensacola. He played on the golf team at Milton High School, which had featured future PGA Tour members Heath Slocum and Boo Weekley just before he attended.[6] Watson played golf for Faulkner State Community College in nearby Baldwin County, Alabama, where he was a junior college All-American. He transferred to the University of Georgia, the defending NCAA champions, and played for the Bulldogs in 2000 and 2001. As a junior, Watson helped lead the Bulldogs to the SEC title in 2000.\\r\\nWatson turned professional in 2003 and joined the Nationwide Tour where he played until 2005. He finished 21st on the Nationwide Tour's money list in 2005, making him the last player to qualify for the following year's PGA Tour. As a rookie in 2006, he earned $1,019,264 (90th overall) and led the PGA Tour in driving distance at 319.6 yards (292.2?m). His longest drive in professional competition was 442 yards (404?m) on the PGA Tour at the WGC-Bridgestone Invitational.\\r\\nWatson played well at the 2007 U.S. Open. He was in the final group on Saturday after shooting rounds of 70-71 (+1) at Oakmont Country Club near Pittsburgh. Watson was one stroke off the lead after 36 holes but then slipped, shooting 74 (+4) in both the third and fourth rounds; he finished in a tie for fifth.\\r\\nWatson claimed his first PGA Tour win on June 27, 2010, in Cromwell, Connecticut, at the Travelers Championship on the second hole of a sudden-death playoff with Corey Pavin and Scott Verplank.[7] Watson tearfully dedicated the win to his parents, specifically his father who was battling cancer.\\r\\nWatson was runner-up to Martin Kaymer at the PGA Championship at Whistling Straits, falling in the three-hole aggregate playoff that initially included Dustin Johnson, before he incurred a two-stroke penalty on the 72nd hole. Watson led the playoff after a birdie on the first hole, but Kaymer birdied the par-3 second hole to tie, effectively turning the playoff into sudden-death. Watson's second shot found the water hazard and Kaymer bested him by a stroke to win the major championship.\\r\\nWatson had his own clothing line called \\"Bubba Golf\\" at the former Steve & Barry's. He was invited on The Ellen DeGeneres Show after he sent her a video of a golf trick shot he completed for her birthday.\\r\\nOn January 30, 2011, Watson won his second PGA Tour event, the Farmers Insurance Open, finishing one stroke ahead of runner-up Phil Mickelson.[8] Watson picked up his second win of the 2011 season and third career PGA Tour title on May 1 when he defeated Webb Simpson at the second playoff hole at the Zurich Classic of New Orleans.[9] Both players birdied the first playoff hole, with Watson holing a 12-footer; he birdied the next hole to win the tournament.\\r\\nIn July 2011, Watson provoked controversy by criticizing the Alstom Open de France on the European Tour, in which he was playing under a sponsor's exemption. He indicated after his first round that he would not be playing any further events on the European Tour,[10] and complained after his second round about security and organization at the tournament.[11]\\r\\nWatson took part in the Long Drive Contest for charity at the Hyundai Tournament of Champions alongside Dustin Johnson and Robert Garrigus. He finished in second place, with a longest drive of 370 yards (338?m) behind a drive of over 400 yards (366?m) by Jamie Sadlowski.\\r\\nWatson began the year with three top-5 finishes in seven events, including finishing second at the WGC-Cadillac Championship.[12]\\r\\nWatson's first major championship win came at the Masters. He began the final round at six-under-par, three strokes off the lead, held by Peter Hanson. On the back nine, Watson bogeyed the par-3 12th hole to return to even par for the round. He then recorded four consecutive birdies for a round of 68 (-4) and tied for the 72-hole lead with fourth-round playing partner Louis Oosthuizen at ten-under-par. In the sudden-death playoff, Oosthuizen and Watson both made par on the uphill 18th hole. On the next hole, the downhill 10th, both drove their tee shots towards the woods to the right of the hole. Oosthuizen's landed in the rough 220 yards (200?m) away, while Watson's ball landed deep in the woods on pine straw, 164 yards (150?m) from the pin without a clear shot to the green. Watson executed a miraculous recovery shot with 40 yards of hook on his 52-degree gap wedge and stopped the ball within fifteen feet of the hole. Oosthuizen's approach shot landed short of the green, but he chipped past the hole and narrowly missed his lengthy putt for par. Watson trickled his birdie putt a foot past the hole, took his time on the very short par putt, then made it for the emotional victory.[13][14] The win took him to a world ranking of four, a career-high at the time.[15]\\r\\nFollowing his Masters win, Watson began to struggle. He missed the cut at the Memorial Tournament and the U.S. Open. A week after the U.S. Open, he finished tied for second at the Travelers Championship. A month later, he played Open Championship, the third major of the year. While shooting a first round of ?3 to tie him at third place, he never advanced much after that, finishing tied for 23rd place. In the final major of the year, the PGA Championship, Watson tied for 11th. He finished the year with one win, six top-5 finishes, seven top-10 finishes and three missed cuts.[12]\\r\\nWatson began the season playing the Hyundai Tournament of Champions, where he finished tied for fourth place, and reached the quarterfinals in the WGC-Accenture Match Play Championship. In the subsequent World Golf Championship event, the WGC-Cadillac Championship, he began very strong with rounds of 66 and 69, but finished with rounds of 71 and 75 and tied for 18th place.\\r\\nAfter finishing tied 14th place in the Arnold Palmer Invitational, he returned to the Masters as the defending champion. Never in contention in the tournament, he finished 50th after a final round of 77. Watson tied for 37th at The Players Championship. On the second major of the year, the U.S. Open, he finished with a solid 71 in the first round, just four shots off the lead, but a second round score of 76 left him out of contention, and he tied for 32nd. At the Travelers Championship he took the lead after a second round of 67, but in the final round, leading by one with three to play, he triple-bogeyed the par-3 16th and finished two shots back in 4th place.\\r\\nTying for 30th at the Greenbrier Classic, he then played in the third major of the year, The Open Championship. After two solids rounds of 70 and 73, he shot 77 in the third round, and tied for 32nd.\\r\\nAt the Waste Management Phoenix Open, Watson held the lead for most of the tournament, but he finished runner-up to Kevin Stadler.\\r\\nWatson earned his fifth career PGA Tour victoryand his first since the 2012 Mastersat the 2014 Northern Trust Open at Riviera Country Club. He shot back-to-back 64s over the weekend to defeat runner-up Dustin Johnson by two strokes.[16] The victory raised him to 14 in the Official World Golf Ranking. He followed that win with two more strong finishesa ninth-place tie in the WGC-Accenture Match Play Championship and a second-place tie in the WGC-Cadillac Championship.[17] Those performances elevated him from 14 to 12 in the world ranking.[18]\\r\\nWatson won the Masters by three shots, with a score of 280 (?8).[19] He entered the final round tied for the lead with 20-year-old Masters rookie Jordan Spieth. Playing together in the final pairing, Spieth birdied the seventh hole for a two-stroke lead over Watson. However, the momentum turned on the par-5 eighth hole. Spieth had a birdie putt, but ended up three-putting for bogey while Watson birdied to pull into a first-place tie.[20] Then, on the ninth hole, Watson birdied again while Spieth bogeyed, and the four-shot swing over two holes gave Watson a lead that he never relinquished in a win over Spieth and Jonas Blixt.[21] With the win, Watson became the 17th player to win the Masters two or more times.[22] The win moved him again to number four in the Official World Golf Ranking.[18]\\r\\nWatson won the Travelers Championship to move him to third in the Official World Golf Ranking. He garnered his second victory in 2015 by winning the unofficial Hero World Challenge in the Bahamas, besting fellow American Patrick Reed by three strokes.\\r\\nPrior to the Waste Management Phoenix Open in early February, Watson caused a bit of controversy after publicly admitting his dislike for the course, TPC Scottsdale.[23] As a result, he was jeered by fans for the majority of the tournament, later criticizing the media for \\"turning his words around\\".[24] Two weeks later though, he returned to the winner's circle after winning the Northern Trust Open at Riviera for a second time in three years, seeing off the challenge of Adam Scott and Jason Kokrak to win by one shot on 15-under-par.[25]\\r\\nWatson did not chalk a win during the 2017 season, and missed the cut at three of the year's four majors (his only cut a T27 at The Open Championship). He had five top-10 finishes with more than $1.3 million in tour earnings.[26]\\r\\nThe 2018 season started with a T7 at the QBE Shootout in December 2017 marking the best of his first six starts. Watson returned to the winner's circle with a 12-under finish at the Genesis Open in February, his third victory at this tournament (2014, 2016), all at Riviera. His trifecta at the Genesis (previously known as the Los Angeles Open, Northern Trust Open, and Nissan Open) makes him only the fifth to win this long-standing event at least three times, along with Ben Hogan, Arnold Palmer, Lloyd Mangrum, and Macdonald Smith. On March 25, he gained his eleventh tour win at the WGC-Dell Match Play event in Austin, Texas, with a winner's share of $1.7 million.[26]\\r\\nWatson was nicknamed by his father after the former professional American football player Bubba Smith.[6] Watson is married to Angela \\"Angie\\" Watson (ne Ball), a 6?ft 3?in (1.91?m) Canadian whom he met at Georgia while he was on the golf team and she was on the women's basketball team.[1][27] They were married in September 2004.[28] In 2009, she was diagnosed with an enlarged pituitary gland, which accounts for her height.[29]\\r\\nUnable to have a child naturally, various family issues, including the illness and death of Watson's father in 2010, kept them from attempting to adopt until 2011ÿ12.[14] In March 2012, one week after a potential adoption fell through at the last moment,[14] Watson and his wife adopted a one-month-old baby boy named Caleb.[30] In late 2014 the Watsons adopted a baby girl.\\r\\nWatson's father, Gerry Sr.,[1] died on October 15, 2010 of throat cancer.[31][32] His mother is Molly Marie Watson and he has a sister, Melinda Watson Conner.[2]\\r\\nWatson is also a member of the \\"Golf Boys\\", a boy band consisting of Watson, Ben Crane, Rickie Fowler, and Hunter Mahan. Their single \\"Oh Oh Oh\\" is currently on YouTube. The video was produced by Farmers Insurance Group. Farmers donates $1000 to charity for every 100,000 views the video gets.[33]\\r\\nIn 2011, he made a humorous appearance in the song \\"Michael Jackson\\" by Christian hip hop artist Andy Mineo on the album Formerly Known.[34][35] He was featured in the song \\"Ima Just Do It\\" by KB, another Christian hip hop artist, on the album Tomorrow We Live.[36] His prototype Golf Cart Hovercraft, the BW1, YouTube video has earned more than 8 million views.[37]\\r\\nWatson is a committed Christian who speaks openly about the importance of faith in his life.[38] Watson devotes much of his money and time to charity.[39]\\r\\nWatson purchased the mansion in the Isleworth community of Windermere, Florida, that was previously owned by Tiger Woods.[40] In 2013, he was added to the list of Great Floridians by Governor Rick Scott.[41][42]\\r\\nWatson purchased a General Lee car from the television series The Dukes of Hazzard at auction for $110,000 in 2012.[43] Following the Charleston church shooting in June 2015, display of the Confederate flag - which is featured on the car's roof - became the subject of renewed controversy. Watson responded by saying he would paint over the flag with the American flag.[44]\\r\\nIn 2015, Watson moved to Pensacola, where he has become very involved in the community. Among other ventures, Watson opened an ice cream store, purchased a part ownership in the Pensacola Blue Wahoos Minor League Baseball team.[45][46] and purchased a Chevrolet dealership in nearby Milton, Florida.[47] Watson has made considerable donations to Studer Family Childrens Hospital in Pensacola.[48] He recently announced that he plans to run for mayor of Pensacola at some future date.[49]\\r\\nPGA Tour playoff record (5ÿ1)\\r\\n1 Defeated Louis Oosthuizen in a sudden-death playoff: Watson (4-4) and Oosthuizen (4-5).\\r\\nCUT = missed the half-way cut\\r\\nT = tied\\r\\nResults not in chronological order prior to 2015.\\r\\nQF, R16, R32, R64 = Round in which player lost in match play\\r\\n\\"T\\" = tied\\r\\nProfessional\\r\\nSource:[50]","input":"Where did bubba watson go to high school?"},{"output":"morning of December 7, 1941","context":"Coordinates: 2122N 15757W? / ?21.367N 157.950W? / 21.367; -157.950\\r\\nMajor Japanese tactical victory; precipitated the entrance of the United States into World War II\\r\\nSoutheast Asia\\r\\nBurma\\r\\nSouthwest Pacific\\r\\nNorth America\\r\\nJapan\\r\\nManchuria\\r\\nThe attack on Pearl Harbor was a surprise military strike by the Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service against the United States naval base at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii Territory, on the morning of December 7, 1941. The attack, also known as the Battle of Pearl Harbor,[11] led to the United States' entry into World War II. The Japanese military leadership referred to the attack as the Hawaii Operation and Operation AI,[12][13] and as Operation Z during its planning.[14]\\r\\nJapan intended the attack as a preventive action to keep the U.S. Pacific Fleet from interfering with military actions that were planned in Southeast Asia against overseas territories of the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, and the United States. Over the next seven hours there were coordinated Japanese attacks on the U.S.-held Philippines, Guam and Wake Island and on the British Empire in Malaya, Singapore, and Hong Kong.[15]\\r\\nThe attack commenced at 7:48?a.m. Hawaiian Time (18:18 GMT).[nb 4][16] The base was attacked by 353[17] Imperial Japanese aircraft (including fighters, level and dive bombers, and torpedo bombers) in two waves, launched from six aircraft carriers.[17] All eight U.S. Navy battleships were damaged, with four sunk. All but the USS?Arizona were later raised, and six were returned to service and went on to fight in the war. The Japanese also sank or damaged three cruisers, three destroyers, an anti-aircraft training ship,[nb 5] and one minelayer. One hundred eighty-eight U.S. aircraft were destroyed; 2,403 Americans were killed and 1,178 others were wounded.[19] Important base installations such as the power station, dry dock, shipyard, maintenance, and fuel and torpedo storage facilities, as well as the submarine piers and headquarters building (also home of the intelligence section), were not attacked. Japanese losses were light: 29 aircraft and five midget submarines lost, and 64 servicemen killed. One Japanese sailor, Kazuo Sakamaki, was captured.\\r\\nThe surprise attack came as a profound shock to the American people and led directly to the American entry into World War II in both the Pacific and European theaters. The following day, December 8, the United States declared war on Japan,[20][21] and several days later, on December 11, Germany and Italy declared war on the U.S. The U.S. responded with a declaration of war against Germany and Italy. Domestic support for non-interventionism, which had been fading since the Fall of France in 1940,[22] disappeared.[21]\\r\\nThere were numerous historical precedents for unannounced military action by Japan, but the lack of any formal warning, particularly while negotiations were still apparently ongoing, led President Franklin D. Roosevelt to proclaim December 7, 1941, \\"a date which will live in infamy\\". Because the attack happened without a declaration of war and without explicit warning, the attack on Pearl Harbor was later judged in the Tokyo Trials to be a war crime.[23][24]\\r\\nWar between Japan and the United States had been a possibility that each nation had been aware of (and developed contingency plans for) since the 1920s, though tensions did not begin to grow seriously until Japan's 1931 invasion of Manchuria. Over the next decade, Japan continued to expand into China, leading to all-out war between those countries in 1937. Japan spent considerable effort trying to isolate China and achieve sufficient resource independence to attain victory on the mainland; the \\"Southern Operation\\" was designed to assist these efforts.[25]\\r\\nFrom December 1937, events such as the Japanese attack on USS Panay, the Allison incident, and the Nanking Massacre (the International Military Tribunal of the Far East concluded that more than 200,000 Chinese non-combatants were killed in indiscriminate massacres, though other estimates have ranged from 40,000 to more than 300,000) swung public opinion in the West sharply against Japan. Fearing Japanese expansion,[26] the United States, the United Kingdom, and France provided loan assistance for war supply contracts to China.\\r\\nIn 1940, Japan invaded French Indochina in an effort to control supplies reaching China. The United States halted shipments of airplanes, parts, machine tools, and aviation gasoline to Japan, which was perceived by Japan as an unfriendly act.[nb 6] The U.S. did not stop oil exports to Japan at that time in part because prevailing sentiment in Washington was that such an action would be an extreme step that Japan would likely consider a provocation, given Japanese dependence on U.S. oil.[28][29]\\r\\nEarly in 1941, President Franklin D. Roosevelt moved the Pacific Fleet to Hawaii from its previous base in San Diego and ordered a military buildup in the Philippines in the hope of discouraging Japanese aggression in the Far East. Because the Japanese high command was (mistakenly) certain that any attack on the UK's Southeast Asian colonies, including Singapore,[30] would bring the U.S. into war, a devastating preventive strike appeared to be the only way to avoid U.S. naval interference.[31] An invasion of the Philippines was also considered necessary by Japanese war planners. The U.S. War Plan Orange had envisioned defending the Philippines with a 40,000-man elite force. This was opposed by Douglas MacArthur, who felt that he would need a force ten times that size, and was never implemented.[32][self-published source] By 1941, U.S. planners anticipated abandonment of the Philippines at the outbreak of war and orders to that effect were given in late 1941 to Admiral Thomas Hart, commander of the Asiatic Fleet.[33]\\r\\nThe U.S. ceased oil exports to Japan in July 1941, following Japanese expansion into French Indochina after the Fall of France, in part because of new American restrictions on domestic oil consumption.[34] This in turn caused the Japanese to proceed with plans to take the Dutch East Indies, an oil-rich territory.[nb 7] On August 17, Roosevelt warned Japan that the U.S. was prepared to take steps against Japan if it attacked \\"neighboring countries\\".[36] The Japanese were faced with the option of either withdrawing from China and losing face or seizing and securing new sources of raw materials in the resource-rich, European-controlled colonies of Southeast Asia.\\r\\nJapan and the U.S. engaged in negotiations during the course of 1941 in an effort to improve relations. During these negotiations, Japan offered to withdraw from most of China and Indochina when peace was made with the Nationalist government, adopt an independent interpretation of the Tripartite Pact, and not to discriminate in trade provided all other countries reciprocated. Washington rejected these proposals. Japanese Prime Minister Konoye then offered to meet with Roosevelt, but Roosevelt insisted on coming to an agreement before any meeting.[37] The U.S. ambassador to Japan repeatedly urged Roosevelt to accept the meeting, warning that it was the only way to preserve the conciliatory Konoye government and peace in the Pacific.[38] His recommendation was not acted upon. The Konoye government collapsed the following month when the Japanese military refused to agree to the withdrawal of all troops from China.[39]\\r\\nJapan's final proposal, on November 20, offered to withdraw their forces from southern Indochina and not to launch any attacks in Southeast Asia provided that the U.S., the UK, and the Netherlands ceased aiding China and lifted their sanctions against Japan.[39] The American counter-proposal of November 26 (November 27 in Japan) (the Hull note) required Japan to evacuate all of China without conditions and conclude non-aggression pacts with Pacific powers. However the day before the Hull Note was delivered, on November 26 in Japan, the main Japanese attack fleet left port for Pearl Harbor.\\r\\nPreliminary planning for an attack on Pearl Harbor to protect the move into the \\"Southern Resource Area\\" (the Japanese term for the Dutch East Indies and Southeast Asia generally) had begun very early in 1941 under the auspices of Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto, then commanding Japan's Combined Fleet.[40] He won assent to formal planning and training for an attack from the Imperial Japanese Navy General Staff only after much contention with Naval Headquarters, including a threat to resign his command.[41] Full-scale planning was underway by early spring 1941, primarily by Rear Admiral Rynosuke Kusaka, with assistance from Captain Minoru Genda and Yamamoto's Deputy Chief of Staff, Captain Kameto Kuroshima.[42] The planners studied the 1940 British air attack on the Italian fleet at Taranto intensively.[nb 8][nb 9]\\r\\nOver the next several months, pilots were trained, equipment was adapted, and intelligence was collected. Despite these preparations, Emperor Hirohito did not approve the attack plan until November 5, after the third of four Imperial Conferences called to consider the matter.[45] Final authorization was not given by the emperor until December 1, after a majority of Japanese leaders advised him the \\"Hull Note\\" would \\"destroy the fruits of the China incident, endanger Manchukuo and undermine Japanese control of Korea.\\"[46]\\r\\nBy late 1941, many observers believed that hostilities between the U.S. and Japan were imminent. A Gallup poll just before the attack on Pearl Harbor found that 52% of Americans expected war with Japan, 27% did not, and 21% had no opinion.[47] While U.S. Pacific bases and facilities had been placed on alert on many occasions, U.S. officials doubted Pearl Harbor would be the first target; instead, they expected the Philippines would be attacked first. This presumption was due to the threat that the air bases throughout the country and the naval base at Manila posed to sea lanes, as well as to the shipment of supplies to Japan from territory to the south.[48] They also incorrectly believed that Japan was not capable of mounting more than one major naval operation at a time.[49]\\r\\nThe Japanese attack had several major aims. First, it intended to destroy important American fleet units, thereby preventing the Pacific Fleet from interfering with Japanese conquest of the Dutch East Indies and Malaya and to enable Japan to conquer Southeast Asia without interference. Second, it was hoped to buy time for Japan to consolidate its position and increase its naval strength before shipbuilding authorized by the 1940 Vinson-Walsh Act erased any chance of victory.[50][51] Third, to deliver a blow to America's ability to mobilize its forces in the Pacific, battleships were chosen as the main targets, since they were the prestige ships of any navy at the time.[50] Finally, it was hoped that the attack would undermine American morale such that the U.S. government would drop its demands contrary to Japanese interests, and would seek a compromise peace with Japan.[52][53]\\r\\nStriking the Pacific Fleet at anchor in Pearl Harbor carried two distinct disadvantages: the targeted ships would be in very shallow water, so it would be relatively easy to salvage and possibly repair them; and most of the crews would survive the attack, since many would be on shore leave or would be rescued from the harbor. A further important disadvantagethis of timing, and known to the Japanesewas the absence from Pearl Harbor of all three of the U.S. Pacific Fleet's aircraft carriers (Enterprise, Lexington, and Saratoga). IJN top command was so imbued with Admiral Mahan's \\"decisive battle\\" doctrineespecially that of destroying the maximum number of battleshipsthat, despite these concerns, Yamamoto decided to press ahead.[54][page?needed]\\r\\nJapanese confidence in their ability to achieve a short, victorious war also meant other targets in the harbor, especially the navy yard, oil tank farms, and submarine base, were ignored, sinceby their thinkingthe war would be over before the influence of these facilities would be felt.[55]\\r\\nOn November 26, 1941, a Japanese task force (the Striking Force) of six aircraft carriersAkagi, Kaga, Sry, Hiry, Shkaku, and Zuikakudeparted Hittokapu Bay on Kasatka (now Iterup) Island in the Kurile Islands, en route to a position northwest of Hawaii, intending to launch its 408 aircraft to attack Pearl Harbor: 360 for the two attack waves and 48 on defensive combat air patrol (CAP), including nine fighters from the first wave.\\r\\nThe first wave was to be the primary attack, while the second wave was to attack carriers as its first objective and cruisers as its second, with battleships as the third target.[56] The first wave carried most of the weapons to attack capital ships, mainly specially adapted Type 91 aerial torpedoes which were designed with an anti-roll mechanism and a rudder extension that let them operate in shallow water.[57] The aircrews were ordered to select the highest value targets (battleships and aircraft carriers) or, if these were not present, any other high value ships (cruisers and destroyers). First wave dive bombers were to attack ground targets. Fighters were ordered to strafe and destroy as many parked aircraft as possible to ensure they did not get into the air to intercept the bombers, especially in the first wave. When the fighters' fuel got low they were to refuel at the aircraft carriers and return to combat. Fighters were to serve CAP duties where needed, especially over U.S. airfields.[citation needed]\\r\\nBefore the attack commenced, two reconnaissance aircraft launched from cruisers Chikuma and Tone were sent to scout over Oahu and Maui and report on U.S. fleet composition and location. Reconnaissance aircraft flights risked alerting the U.S.,[58] and were not necessary. U.S. fleet composition and preparedness information in Pearl Harbor was already known due to the reports of the Japanese spy Takeo Yoshikawa. A report of the absence of the U.S. fleet in Lahaina anchorage off Maui was received from the fleet submarine I-72.[59] Another four scout planes patrolled the area between the Japanese carrier force (the Kid Butai) and Niihau, to detect any counterattack.[60]\\r\\nFleet submarines I-16, I-18, I-20, I-22, and I-24 each embarked a Type A midget submarine for transport to the waters off Oahu.[61] The five I-boats left Kure Naval District on November 25, 1941.[62] On December 6, they came to within 10?nmi (19?km; 12?mi) of the mouth of Pearl Harbor[63] and launched their midget subs at about 01:00[clarification needed] on December 7.[64] At 03:42[65] Hawaiian Time, the minesweeper Condor spotted a midget submarine periscope southwest of the Pearl Harbor entrance buoy and alerted the destroyer Ward.[66] The midget may have entered Pearl Harbor. However, Ward sank another midget submarine at 06:37[66][nb 10] in the first American shots in the Pacific Theater. A midget submarine on the north side of Ford Island missed the seaplane tender Curtiss with her first torpedo and missed the attacking destroyer Monaghan with her other one before being sunk by Monaghan at 08:43.[66]\\r\\nA third midget submarine, Ha-19, grounded twice, once outside the harbor entrance and again on the east side of Oahu, where it was captured on December 8.[68] Ensign Kazuo Sakamaki swam ashore and was captured by Hawaii National Guard Corporal David Akui, becoming the first Japanese prisoner of war.[nb 11] A fourth had been damaged by a depth charge attack and was abandoned by its crew before it could fire its torpedoes.[69] Japanese forces received a radio message from a midget submarine at 00:41 on December 8 claiming damage to one or more large warships inside Pearl Harbor.[70]\\r\\nIn 1992, 2000, and 2001, Hawaii Undersea Research Laboratory's submersibles found the wreck of the fifth midget submarine lying in three parts outside Pearl Harbor. The wreck was in the debris field where much surplus U.S. equipment was dumped after the war, including vehicles and landing craft. Both of its torpedoes were missing. This correlates with reports of two torpedoes fired at the light cruiser St. Louis at 10:04 at the entrance of Pearl Harbor, and a possible torpedo fired at destroyer Helm at 08:21.[71]\\r\\nThe attack took place before any formal declaration of war was made by Japan, but this was not Admiral Yamamoto's intention. He originally stipulated that the attack should not commence until thirty minutes after Japan had informed the United States that peace negotiations were at an end.[citation needed] However, the attack began before the notice could be delivered. Tokyo transmitted the 5000-word notification (commonly called the \\"14-Part Message\\") in two blocks to the Japanese Embassy in Washington. Transcribing the message took too long for the Japanese ambassador to deliver it on schedule; in the event, it was not presented until more than an hour after the attack began. (In fact, U.S. code breakers had already deciphered and translated most of the message hours before he was scheduled to deliver it.)[72] The final part is sometimes described as a declaration of war. While it was viewed by a number of senior U.S government and military officials as a very strong indicator negotiations were likely to be terminated[73] and that war might break out at any moment,[74] it neither declared war nor severed diplomatic relations. A declaration of war was printed on the front page of Japan's newspapers in the evening edition of December 8,[75] but not delivered to the U.S. government until the day after the attack.\\r\\nFor decades, conventional wisdom held that Japan attacked without first formally breaking diplomatic relations only because of accidents and bumbling that delayed the delivery of a document hinting at war to Washington. In 1999, however, Takeo Iguchi, a professor of law and international relations at International Christian University in Tokyo, discovered documents that pointed to a vigorous debate inside the government over how, and indeed whether, to notify Washington of Japan's intention to break off negotiations and start a war, including a December 7 entry in the war diary saying, \\"[O]ur deceptive diplomacy is steadily proceeding toward success.\\" Of this, Iguchi said, \\"The diary shows that the army and navy did not want to give any proper declaration of war, or indeed prior notice even of the termination of negotiations?... and they clearly prevailed.\\"[76][77]\\r\\nIn any event, even if the Japanese had decoded and delivered the 14-Part Message before the beginning of the attack, it would not have constituted either a formal break of diplomatic relations or a declaration of war. The final two paragraphs of the message read:\\r\\nThus the earnest hope of the Japanese Government to adjust Japanese-American relations and to preserve and promote the peace of the Pacific through cooperation with the American Government has finally been lost.\\r\\nThe first attack wave of 183 planes was launched north of Oahu, led by Commander Mitsuo Fuchida.[79] Six planes failed to launch due to technical difficulties.[60] It included:[nb 12]\\r\\nAs the first wave approached Oahu, it was detected by the U.S. Army SCR-270 radar at Opana Point near the island's northern tip. This post had been in training mode for months, but was not yet operational.[82] The operators, Privates George Elliot Jr. and Joseph Lockard, reported a target.[83] But Lieutenant Kermit A. Tyler, a newly assigned officer at the thinly manned Intercept Center, presumed it was the scheduled arrival of six B-17 bombers from California. The Japanese planes were approaching from a direction very close (only a few degrees difference) to the bombers,[84] and while the operators had never seen a formation as large on radar, they neglected to tell Tyler of its size.[85] Tyler, for security reasons, could not tell the operators of the six B-17s that were due (even though it was widely known).[85]\\r\\nAs the first wave planes approached Oahu, they encountered and shot down several U.S. aircraft. At least one of these radioed a somewhat incoherent warning. Other warnings from ships off the harbor entrance were still being processed or awaiting confirmation when the attacking planes began bombing and strafing. Nevertheless, it is not clear any warnings would have had much effect even if they had been interpreted correctly and much more promptly. The results the Japanese achieved in the Philippines were essentially the same as at Pearl Harbor, though MacArthur had almost nine hours warning that the Japanese had already attacked Pearl Harbor.\\r\\nThe air portion of the attack began at 7:48?a.m. Hawaiian Time[16] (3:18?a.m. December 8 Japanese Standard Time, as kept by ships of the Kido Butai),[86][nb 4] with the attack on Kaneohe. A total of 353[17] Japanese planes in two waves reached Oahu. Slow, vulnerable torpedo bombers led the first wave, exploiting the first moments of surprise to attack the most important ships present (the battleships), while dive bombers attacked U.S. air bases across Oahu, starting with Hickam Field, the largest, and Wheeler Field, the main U.S. Army Air Forces fighter base. The 171 planes in the second wave attacked the Army Air Forces' Bellows Field near Kaneohe on the windward side of the island, and Ford Island. The only aerial opposition came from a handful of P-36 Hawks, P-40 Warhawks, and some SBD Dauntless dive bombers from the carrier Enterprise.[nb 13]\\r\\nIn the first wave attack, about eight of the forty-nine 800?kg (1760?lb) armor-piercing bombs dropped hit their intended battleship targets. At least two of those bombs broke up on impact, another detonated before penetrating an unarmored deck, and one was a dud. Thirteen of the forty torpedoes hit battleships, and four torpedoes hit other ships.[87] Men aboard U.S. ships awoke to the sounds of alarms, bombs exploding, and gunfire, prompting bleary-eyed men to dress as they ran to General Quarters stations. (The famous message, \\"Air raid Pearl Harbor. This is not drill.\\",[nb 14] was sent from the headquarters of Patrol Wing Two, the first senior Hawaiian command to respond.) The defenders were very unprepared. Ammunition lockers were locked, aircraft parked wingtip to wingtip in the open to prevent sabotage,[88] guns unmanned (none of the Navy's 5\\"/38s, only a quarter of its machine guns, and only four of 31 Army batteries got in action).[88] Despite this low alert status, many American military personnel responded effectively during the attack.[nb 15] Ensign Joe Taussig Jr., aboard Nevada, commanded the ship's antiaircraft guns and was severely wounded, but continued to be on post. Lt. Commander F. J. Thomas commanded Nevada in the captain's absence and got her under way until the ship was grounded at 9:10?a.m.[89] One of the destroyers, Aylwin, got underway with only four officers aboard, all ensigns, none with more than a year's sea duty; she operated at sea for 36 hours before her commanding officer managed to get back aboard.[90] Captain Mervyn Bennion, commanding West Virginia, led his men until he was cut down by fragments from a bomb which hit Tennessee, moored alongside.\\r\\nThe second planned wave consisted of 171 planes: 54 B5Ns, 81 D3As, and 36 A6Ms, commanded by Lieutenant-Commander Shigekazu Shimazaki.[80] Four planes failed to launch because of technical difficulties.[60] This wave and its targets comprised:[80]\\r\\nThe second wave was divided into three groups. One was tasked to attack Kne?ohe, the rest Pearl Harbor proper. The separate sections arrived at the attack point almost simultaneously from several directions.\\r\\nNinety minutes after it began, the attack was over. Two thousand and eight sailors were killed, and 710 others wounded; 218 soldiers and airmen (who were part of the Army until the independent U.S. Air Force was formed in 1947) were killed and 364 wounded; 109 marines were killed and 69 wounded; and 68 civilians were killed and 35 wounded. In total, 2,403 Americans died and 1,178 were wounded.[91][self-published source] Eighteen ships were sunk or run aground, including five battleships.[10][92] All of the Americans killed or wounded during the attack were non-combatants, given the fact there was no state of war when the attack occurred.[23][24][93]\\r\\nOf the American fatalities, nearly half were due to the explosion of Arizona's forward magazine after it was hit by a modified 16-inch (410?mm) shell.[nb 16]\\r\\nAlready damaged by a torpedo and on fire amidships, Nevada attempted to exit the harbor. She was targeted by many Japanese bombers as she got under way and sustained more hits from 250?lb (113?kg) bombs, which started further fires. She was deliberately beached to avoid blocking the harbor entrance.\\r\\nCalifornia was hit by two bombs and two torpedoes. The crew might have kept her afloat, but were ordered to abandon ship just as they were raising power for the pumps. Burning oil from Arizona and West Virginia drifted down on her, and probably made the situation look worse than it was. The disarmed target ship Utah was holed twice by torpedoes. West Virginia was hit by seven torpedoes, the seventh tearing away her rudder. Oklahoma was hit by four torpedoes, the last two above her belt armor, which caused her to capsize. Maryland was hit by two of the converted 16\\" shells, but neither caused serious damage.\\r\\nAlthough the Japanese concentrated on battleships (the largest vessels present), they did not ignore other targets. The light cruiser Helena was torpedoed, and the concussion from the blast capsized the neighboring minelayer Oglala. Two destroyers in dry dock, Cassin and Downes were destroyed when bombs penetrated their fuel bunkers. The leaking fuel caught fire; flooding the dry dock in an effort to fight fire made the burning oil rise, and both were burned out. Cassin slipped from her keel blocks and rolled against Downes. The light cruiser Raleigh was holed by a torpedo. The light cruiser Honolulu was damaged, but remained in service. The repair vessel Vestal, moored alongside Arizona, was heavily damaged and beached. The seaplane tender Curtiss was also damaged. The destroyer Shaw was badly damaged when two bombs penetrated her forward magazine.[94]\\r\\nOf the 402[17] American aircraft in Hawaii, 188 were destroyed and 159 damaged,[17] 155 of them on the ground. Almost none were actually ready to take off to defend the base. Eight Army Air Forces pilots managed to get airborne during the attack[95] and six were credited with downing at least one Japanese aircraft during the attack: 1st Lt. Lewis M. Sanders, 2nd Lt. Philip M. Rasmussen, 2nd Lt. Kenneth M. Taylor, 2nd Lt. George S. Welch, 2nd Lt. Harry W. Brown, and 2nd Lt. Gordon H. Sterling Jr. Sterling was shot down by Lt. Fujita over Kaneohe Bay and is listed as Body Not Recovered (not Missing In Action). Lt. John L. Dains was killed by friendly fire returning from a victory over Kaawa.[96][97] Of 33 PBYs in Hawaii, 24 were destroyed, and six others damaged beyond repair. (The three on patrol returned undamaged.) Friendly fire brought down some U.S. planes on top of that, including five from an inbound flight from Enterprise. Japanese attacks on barracks killed additional personnel.\\r\\nAt the time of the attack, nine civilian aircraft were flying in the vicinity of Pearl Harbor. Of these, three were shot down.[91]\\r\\nFifty-five Japanese airmen and nine submariners were killed in the attack, and one was captured. Of Japan's 414[80] available planes, 29 were lost during the battle (nine in the first attack wave, 20 in the second),[98][nb 17] with another 74 damaged by antiaircraft fire from the ground.\\r\\nSeveral Japanese junior officers including Fuchida and Genda urged Nagumo to carry out a third strike in order to destroy as much of Pearl Harbor's fuel and torpedo[nb 18] storage, maintenance, and dry dock facilities as possible.[99] Genda, who had unsuccessfully advocated for invading Hawaii after the air attack, believed that without an invasion, three strikes were necessary to disable the base as much as possible.[100] The captains of the other five carriers in the task force reported they were willing and ready to carry out a third strike.[101] Military historians have suggested the destruction of these shore facilities would have hampered the U.S. Pacific Fleet far more seriously than the loss of its battleships.[102] If they had been wiped out, \\"serious [American] operations in the Pacific would have been postponed for more than a year\\";[103] according to Admiral Chester W. Nimitz, later Commander in Chief of the Pacific Fleet, \\"it would have prolonged the war another two years.\\"[104] Nagumo, however, decided to withdraw for several reasons:\\r\\nAt a conference aboard his flagship the following morning, Yamamoto supported Nagumo's withdrawal without launching a third wave.[109] In retrospect, sparing the vital dockyards, maintenance shops, and the oil tank farm meant the U.S. could respond relatively quickly to Japanese activities in the Pacific. Yamamoto later regretted Nagumo's decision to withdraw and categorically stated it had been a great mistake not to order a third strike.[111]\\r\\nSeventeen ships were damaged or lost in the attack, of which fourteen were repaired and returned to service.[112]\\r\\nAfter a systematic search for survivors, formal salvage operations began. Captain Homer N. Wallin, Material Officer for Commander, Battle Force, U.S. Pacific Fleet, was immediately ordered to lead salvage operations. \\"Within a short time I was relieved of all other duties and ordered to full time work as Fleet Salvage Officer.\\"[114][nb 19]\\r\\nAround Pearl Harbor, divers from the Navy (shore and tenders), the Naval Shipyard, and civilian contractors (Pacific Bridge and others) began work on the ships that could be refloated. They patched holes, cleared debris, and pumped water out of ships. Navy divers worked inside the damaged ships. Within six months, five battleships and two cruisers were patched or refloated so they could be sent to shipyards in Pearl Harbor and on the mainland for extensive repair.\\r\\nIntensive salvage operations continued for another year, a total of some 20,000 man-hours under water.[116] Oklahoma, while successfully raised, was never repaired, and capsized while under tow to the mainland in 1947. Arizona and the target ship Utah were too heavily damaged for salvage, though much of their armament and equipment was removed and put to use aboard other vessels. Today, the two hulks remain where they were sunk,[117] with Arizona becoming a war memorial.\\r\\nIn the wake of the attack, 15 Medals of Honor, 51 Navy Crosses, 53 Silver Stars, four Navy and Marine Corps Medals, one Distinguished Flying Cross, four Distinguished Service Crosses, one Distinguished Service Medal, and three Bronze Star Medals were awarded to the American servicemen who distinguished themselves in combat at Pearl Harbor.[118] Additionally, a special military award, the Pearl Harbor Commemorative Medal, was later authorized for all military veterans of the attack.\\r\\nThe day after the attack, Roosevelt delivered his famous Infamy Speech to a Joint Session of Congress, calling for a formal declaration of war on the Empire of Japan. Congress obliged his request less than an hour later. On December 11, Germany and Italy declared war on the United States, even though the Tripartite Pact did not require it.[nb 20] Congress issued a declaration of war against Germany and Italy later that same day. The UK actually declared war on Japan nine hours before the U.S. did, partially due to Japanese attacks on Malaya, Singapore and Hong Kong, and partially due to Winston Churchill's promise to declare war \\"within the hour\\" of a Japanese attack on the United States.[119]\\r\\nThe attack was an initial shock to all the Allies in the Pacific Theater. Further losses compounded the alarming setback. Japan attacked the Philippines hours later (because of the time difference, it was December 8 in the Philippines). Only three days after the attack on Pearl Harbor, the battleships Prince of Wales and Repulse were sunk off the coast of Malaya, causing British Prime Minister Winston Churchill later to recollect \\"In all the war I never received a more direct shock. As I turned and twisted in bed the full horror of the news sank in upon me. There were no British or American capital ships in the Indian Ocean or the Pacific except the American survivors of Pearl Harbor who were hastening back to California. Over this vast expanse of waters Japan was supreme and we everywhere were weak and naked\\".[120]\\r\\nThroughout the war, Pearl Harbor was frequently used in American propaganda.[121]\\r\\nOne further consequence of the attack on Pearl Harbor and its aftermath (notably the Niihau incident) was that Japanese American residents and citizens were relocated to nearby Japanese-American internment camps. Within hours of the attack, hundreds of Japanese American leaders were rounded up and brought to high-security camps such as Sand Island at the mouth of Honolulu harbor and Kilauea Military Camp on the island of Hawaii.[122][123] Eventually, more than 110,000 Japanese Americans, nearly all who lived on the West Coast, were forced into interior camps, but in Hawaii, where the 150,000-plus Japanese Americans composed over one-third of the population, only 1,200 to 1,800 were interned.[124][125][126]\\r\\nThe attack also had international consequences. The Canadian province of British Columbia, bordering the Pacific Ocean, had long had a large population of Japanese immigrants and their Japanese Canadian descendants. Pre-war tensions were exacerbated by the Pearl Harbor attack, leading to a reaction from the Government of Canada. On February 24, 1942, Order-in-Council P.C. no. 1486 was passed under the War Measures Act allowing for the forced removal of any and all Canadians of Japanese descent from British Columbia, as well as the prohibiting from them returning to the province. On 4 March, regulations under the Act were adopted to evacuate Japanese-Canadians.[127] As a result, 12,000 were interned in interior camps, 2,000 were sent to road camps and another 2,000 were forced to work in the prairies at sugar beet farms.[128]\\r\\nThe Japanese planners had determined that some means was required for rescuing fliers whose aircraft were too badly damaged to return to the carriers. The island of Niihau, only 30 minutes flying time from Pearl Harbor, was designated as the rescue point.\\r\\nThe Zero flown by Petty Officer Shigenori Nishikaichi of Hiryu was damaged in the attack on Wheeler, so he flew to the rescue point on Niihau. The aircraft was further damaged on landing. Nishikaichi was helped from the wreckage by one of the native Hawaiians, who, aware of the tension between the United States and Japan, took the pilot's maps and other documents. The island's residents had no telephones or radio and were completely unaware of the attack on Pearl Harbor. Nishikaichi enlisted the support of three Japanese-American residents in an attempt to recover the documents. During the ensuing struggles, Nishikaichi was killed and a Hawaiian civilian was wounded; one collaborator committed suicide, and his wife and the third collaborator were sent to prison.\\r\\nThe ease with which the local ethnic Japanese residents had apparently gone to the assistance of Nishikaichi was a source of concern for many, and tended to support those who believed that local Japanese could not be trusted.[129]\\r\\nAdmiral Hara Tadaichi summed up the Japanese result by saying, \\"We won a great tactical victory at Pearl Harbor and thereby lost the war.\\"[130] To a similar effect, see Isoroku Yamamoto's alleged \\"sleeping giant\\" quote.\\r\\nWhile the attack accomplished its intended objective, it turned out to be largely unnecessary. Unbeknownst to Yamamoto, who conceived the original plan, the U.S. Navy had decided as far back as 1935 to abandon 'charging' across the Pacific towards the Philippines in response to an outbreak of war (in keeping with the evolution of Plan Orange).[31] The U.S. instead adopted \\"Plan Dog\\" in 1940, which emphasized keeping the IJN out of the eastern Pacific and away from the shipping lanes to Australia, while the U.S. concentrated on defeating Nazi Germany.[131]\\r\\nFortunately for the United States, the American aircraft carriers were untouched by the Japanese attack; otherwise the Pacific Fleet's ability to conduct offensive operations would have been crippled for a year or more (given no diversions from the Atlantic Fleet). As it was, the elimination of the battleships left the U.S. Navy with no choice but to rely on its aircraft carriers and submarinesthe very weapons with which the U.S. Navy halted and eventually reversed the Japanese advance. While six of the eight battleships were repaired and returned to service, their relatively low speed and high fuel consumption limited their deployment, and they served mainly in shore bombardment roles (their only major action being the Battle of Surigao Strait in October 1944). A major flaw of Japanese strategic thinking was a belief that the ultimate Pacific battle would be fought by battleships, in keeping with the doctrine of Captain Alfred Thayer Mahan. As a result, Yamamoto (and his successors) hoarded battleships for a \\"decisive battle\\" that never happened.[132]\\r\\nThe Japanese confidence in their ability to achieve a short, victorious war meant that they neglected Pearl Harbor's navy repair yards, oil tank farms, submarine base, and old headquarters building.[55] All of these targets were omitted from Genda's list, yet they proved more important than any battleship to the American war efforts in the Pacific. The survival of the repair shops and fuel depots allowed Pearl Harbor to maintain logistical support to the U.S. Navy's operations,[133][134] such as the Battles of Coral Sea and Midway. It was submarines that immobilized the Imperial Japanese Navy's heavy ships and brought Japan's economy to a virtual standstill by crippling the transportation of oil and raw materials: by the end of 1942, import of raw materials was cut to half of what it had been, \\"to a disastrous ten million tons\\", while oil import \\"was almost completely stopped\\".[nb 21] Lastly, the basement of the Old Administration Building was the home of the cryptanalytic unit which contributed significantly to the Midway ambush and the Submarine Force's success.[135]\\r\\nEver since the Japanese attack, there has been debate as to how and why the United States had been caught unaware, and how much and when American officials knew of Japanese plans and related topics. Military officers including Gen. Billy Mitchell had pointed out the vulnerability of Pearl to air attack. At least two naval war games, one in 1932 and another in 1936, proved that Pearl was vulnerable to such an attack. Admiral James Richardson was removed from command shortly after protesting President Roosevelt's decision to move the bulk of the Pacific fleet to Pearl Harbor.[136][137] The decisions of military and political leadership to ignore these warnings has contributed to conspiracy theories. Several writers, including journalist Robert Stinnett and former United States Rear Admiral Robert Alfred Theobald, have argued that various parties high in the U.S. and British governments knew of the attack in advance and may even have let it happen or encouraged it in order to force the U.S. into war via the so-called \\"back door\\". However, this conspiracy theory is rejected by mainstream historians.[138][139][140][141][nb 22]\\r\\nInformational notes\\r\\nCitations\\r\\nBibliography\\r\\nFurther reading\\r\\nAccounts\\r\\nMedia\\r\\nHistorical documents","input":"When did the attack on pearl harbor start?"},{"output":"\\"Smoked\\"","context":"\\"Smoked\\" is the twelfth season finale of the police procedural television series Law & Order: Special Victims Unit and the 272nd overall episode.

Detectives Olivia Benson (Mariska Hargitay) and Elliot Stabler (Christopher Meloni) are called in to investigate the correlation between the murder and rape case and assure Jenna they will catch her mother's killer.\\r\\nRonson, now a haircutting volunteer at a homeless shelter run by Sister Peg (Charlayne Woodard), says the sex was consensual. The detectives search his house and find a gun and black hoodie similar to the one Fox's killer wore. However, owning an unloaded gun without a permit is a misdemeanor, not enough to keep Luke in holding, and the gun does not match the murder weapon, upsetting Jenna.\\r\\nFin and Stabler follow Luke to the shelter and watch him argue with a man, Eddie Skinner, who earlier said he saw Luke with a gun the night of the murder. When Eddie sees the detectives, he bolts and is arrested. Luke says he hired Eddie to scare Annette, not kill her, but Eddie says he and Luke never agreed to that. Benson believes Luke, but with no murder weapon, SVU has no case. ADA West, though, arrests Luke for witness tampering and Eddie for assaulting a police officer. Later, Skinner is taken by the ATF because he is the key to busting a cigarette smuggling ring. Stabler works with Skinner undercover with the exchange, but it gets botched and Eddie escapes during the gunfire.\\r\\nThe detectives track Eddie to Luke's apartment, where he holds Luke at gunpoint demanding money. Stabler convinces Eddie to put the gun down and arrests both men. Eddie admits to killing Annette by himself and in exchange for a lesser murder charge, tells detectives where he got the murder weapon from. ATF agent Greer is arrested as an accessory to murder and put in holding with Luke and Eddie. Sister Peg visits the station to drop off a picture of Jenna and Annette with an address written in Eddie's handwriting.\\r\\nThe detectives call Jenna into the squad room so she could see the three men behind bars. She leaves, but surprises everyone by returning with a handgun and firing wildly into the holding cell, killing Ronson and Greer. As Benson pleads to Jenna, Stabler takes cover behind his desk and reaches for his gun. Jenna fires one shot at them, hitting and killing Sister Peg. Shocked, she stops, but a provoking comment by Skinner infuriates her again. As she aims her gun at him, Stabler is forced to shoot her. As she lies on the floor, Jenna says she bought the gun off the street before dying in Stabler's arms.\\r\\n\\"Smoked\\" was written by Jonathan Grenee and Daniel Truly and was directed by Helen Shaver. It is the last episode produced under the direction of Neal Baer, who had been the showrunner since season two.[1] Baer, who signed a three-year deal with CBS Television Studios in November 2011, was replaced by former Law & Order: Criminal Intent executive producer-showrunner Warren Leight.[2]\\r\\nTen days after the episode's broadcast, Meloni left the show after his contract negotiations failed.[3] B. D. Wong, who was absent from this episode, departed the cast as well to star on the NBC drama Awake.[4] Wong later reprised his role in one episode each for the 13th, 14th, 15th and 17th seasons. A plan to have Hargitay only appear in 13 episodes of the next season was discussed[5] but later retracted, as Hargitay then extended her contract through the 14th season.[6][7][8]\\r\\nNeal Baer told Michael Ausiello about the twelfth season finale, \\"We go out with a bang. It's my last episode for SVU  I'm leaving after 11 years to go to CBS  and it leaves us with a death; it leaves us with one of our beloved characters doing something that will change the way they see being a cop; and since I'm a [doctor], I get to rag on cigarettes, so that's terrific!\\"[9] The month before, Ausiello hinted that there would be a fatality on the show.[10] At the start of 2011 when SVU's future was unknown, Baer said of Hargitay and Meloni's status on returning with the show, \\"They're the longest running drama duo in TV history,\\" Baer continues, \\"and I think [they'll be around] as long as they can keep playing new angles within the parameters of the show.\\" And as the credits showed that Baer did not write \\"Smoked\\", he commented; \\"I don't have plans to write some farewell show, he laughed. \\"It will just be a really good, twisty, turny and hopefully memorable episode.\\"[11]\\r\\nUntil \\"Smoked\\", actress Charlayne Woodard had not portrayed the Sister Peg character on Law & Order: Special Victims Unit since the eighth season episode \\"Underbelly\\".\\r\\nIn its original broadcast on May 18, 2011, \\"Smoked\\" was viewed by 8.98 million viewers and acquired a 2.9 rating/7% share in the 18ÿ49 demographic, meaning that it was seen by 2.9% of all 18- to 49-year-olds and 7% of 18- to 49-year-olds watching television at the time of the broadcast. Law & Order: Special Victims Unit was the highest rated program on NBC that night and the highest rated program in the 10:00?p.m. time slot, beating both Criminal Minds: Suspect Behavior on CBS and Happy Endings on ABC.[12]\\r\\nLucy Tonic of Yahoo said: \\"'Smoked' ends with chaos in the precinct, resulting from a literal smoking gun, yet it's unfortunate that writers tried to introduce the issue of America's gun problem within the last ten minutes of the episode. Sadly, the conclusion of Law & Order: SVU Season 12 was predictable and more dramatized than needed.\\"[13]","input":"What episode did stabler shoot the teenage girl?"},{"output":"The Palatine Hill","context":"The Palatine Hill (/?p?l?ta?n/; Latin: Collis Palatium or Mons Palatinus; Italian: Palatino [pala?ti?no]) is the centremost of the Seven Hills of Rome and is one of the most ancient parts of the city. It stands 40 metres[1] above the Roman Forum, looking down upon it on one side, and upon the Circus Maximus on the other. From the time of Augustus Imperial palaces were built here.\\r\\nThe hill is the etymological origin of the word palace and its cognates in other languages (Italian: palazzo, French: palais, Portuguese: palcio German: Palast, Czech: palc, etc.).[a]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe term palace, from Old French palais or paleis, stems ultimately from the proper name of Palatine Hill.[2]\\r\\nThe Palatine Hill is also the etymological origin (via the Latin adjective palatinus) of \\"palatine\\", a 16th century English adjective that originally signified something pertaining to the Caesar's palace, or someone who is invested with the king's authority. Later its use shifted to a reference to the German Palatinate.[3] The office of the German count palatine (Pfalzgraf) had its origins in the comes palatinus, an earlier office in Merovingian and Carolingian times.[4]\\r\\nAnother modern English word \\"paladin\\", came into usage to refer to any distinguished knight (especially one of the Twelve Peers of Charlemagne) under Charlemagne in late renditions of Matter of France.[b][5]\\r\\nAccording to Livy[6] (59 BC ÿ AD 17) the Palatine hill got its name from the Arcadian settlement of Pallantium. More likely, it is derived from the noun paltum \\"palate\\"; Ennius uses it once for the \\"heaven\\", and it may be connected with the Etruscan word for sky, falad.[7]\\r\\nAccording to Roman mythology, the Palatine Hill was the location of the cave, known as the Lupercal, where Romulus and Remus were found by the she-wolf Lupa that kept them alive.\\r\\nAnother legend occurring on the Palatine is Hercules' defeat of Cacus after the monster had stolen some cattle. Hercules struck Cacus with his characteristic club so hard that it formed a cleft on the southeast corner of the hill, where later a staircase bearing the name of Cacus was constructed.[8]\\r\\nRome has its origins on the Palatine. Excavations show that people have lived in the area since the 10th century BC.[citation needed]\\r\\nAccording to Livy, after the immigration of the Sabines and the Albans to Rome, the original Romans lived on the Palatine.[9] The Palatine Hill was also the site of the ancient festival of the Lupercalia.\\r\\nMany affluent Romans of the Republican period (c.509 BC ÿ 44 BC) had their residences there.\\r\\nFrom the start of the Empire (27 BC) Augustus built his palace there and the hill gradually became the exclusive domain of emperors; the ruins of the palaces of at least Augustus (27 BC ÿ 14 AD), Tiberius (14 ÿ 37 AD) and Domitian (81 ÿ 96 AD) can still be seen.\\r\\nAugustus also built a temple to Apollo here.\\r\\nThe great fire of 64 AD destroyed Nero's palace, but he replaced it by 69 AD with the even larger Domus Aurea over which was built Domitian's Palace [10]\\r\\nThe Palatine Hill is an archaeological site open to the public.\\r\\nThe Palace of Domitian which dominates the site and looks out over the Circus Maximus was rebuilt largely during the reign of Domitian over earlier buildings of Nero.\\r\\nLater emperors particularly the Severans made significant additions to the buildings.\\r\\nThe House of Livia, the wife of Augustus, is conventionally attributed to her based only on the generic name on a clay pipe and circumstantial factors such as proximity to the House of Augustus.[11]\\r\\nThe building is located near the Temple of Magna Mater at the western end of the hill, on a lower terrace from the temple. It is notable for its beautiful frescoes.\\r\\nThe House of Tiberius is located next to the Temple of Cybele, on the platform built by Nero and in the current Farnese Gardens.\\r\\nDuring Augustus' reign, an area of the Palatine Hill was roped off for a sort of archaeological expedition, which found fragments of Bronze Age pots and tools. He declared this site the \\"original town of Rome.\\" Modern archaeology has identified evidence of Bronze Age settlement in the area which predates Rome's founding. There is a museum on the Palatine in which artifacts dating from before the official foundation of the City are displayed. The museum also contains Roman statuary.\\r\\nAn altar to an unknown deity, once thought to be Aius Locutius, was discovered here in 1820.\\r\\nIn July 2006, archaeologists announced the discovery of the Palatine House, which they believe to be the birthplace of Rome's first Emperor, Augustus.[12] Head archaeologist Clementina Panella uncovered a section of corridor and other fragments under Rome's Palatine Hill, which she described on July 20 as \\"a very ancient aristocratic house.\\" The two story house appears to have been built around an atrium, with frescoed walls and mosaic flooring, and is situated on the slope of the Palatine that overlooks the Colosseum and the Arch of Constantine. The Republican-era houses on the Palatine were overbuilt by later palaces after the Great Fire of Rome (64), but apparently this one was not; the tempting early inference is that it was preserved for a specific and important reason. On the ground floor, three shops opened onto the Via Sacra.\\r\\nThe location of the domus is important because of its potential proximity to the Curiae Veteres, the earliest shrine of the curies of Rome.[13]\\r\\nIn January 2007, Italian archeologist Irene Iacopi announced that she had probably found the legendary Lupercal cave beneath the remains of Augustus' residence, the Domus Livia (House of Livia) on the Palatine. Archaeologists came across the 16-metre-deep cavity while working to restore the decaying palace. The first photos of the cave show a richly decorated vault encrusted with mosaics and seashells. The Lupercal was probably converted to a sanctuary by Romans in later centuries.[14]\\r\\nIn November 2007 archaeologists unveiled photographs of the cave. Partially collapsed and decorated with seashells and colored marble, the vaulted sanctuary is buried 16 metres inside the Palatine hill. A white eagle was found atop the sanctuary's vault. Most of the sanctuary is collapsed or filled with earth, but laser scans allowed experts to estimate that the circular structure has a height of 8 metres and a diameter of 7.3 metres. Adriano La Regina (former Romes archaeological superintendent 1976ÿ2004, professor of Etruscology at Romes La Sapienza University),[15] Prof. Fausto Zevi (professor of Roman Archaeology at Rome's La Sapienza University)[16] and Prof. Henner von Hesberg (head of the German Archaeological Institute, Rome)[17] denied the identification of the grotto with Lupercal on topographic and stylistic grounds. They concluded that the grotto is actually a nymphaeum or underground triclinium from Neronian times.\\r\\nCoordinates: 415318N 122913E? / ?41.88833N 12.48694E? / 41.88833; 12.48694","input":"Where did the emperor live in ancient rome?"},{"output":"Beyonc's twin pregnancy announcement","context":"This list of most liked Instagram pictures contains the top 10 posts with the most likes of all time on the social photo-sharing platform Instagram.[1] Like counts are based on the Instagram website.

It is owned and operated by Caesars Entertainment Corporation.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe property includes a 72,300 square-foot casino along with 3,626 hotel rooms. The architectural theme is reminiscent of the Art Deco and Streamline Moderne style of Miami and South Beach. Staying true to its theme, the hotel includes a garden courtyard which serves as a wildlife habitat for flamingos. The hotel was the third resort to open on the Strip and remains the oldest resort on the Strip in operation today. The Flamingo has a Las Vegas Monorail station called the Flamingo & Caesars Palace station at the rear of the property. After opening in 1946, it has undergone a number of ownership changes.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Flamingo site occupies 40 acres originally owned by one of Las Vegas' first settlers, Charles \\"Pops\\" Squires. Squires paid $8.75 an acre for the land. In 1944, Margaret Folsom bought the tract for $7,500 from Squires, and she then later sold it to Billy Wilkerson. Wilkerson was the owner of The Hollywood Reporter as well as some very popular nightclubs in the Sunset Strip: Cafe Trocadero, Ciro's and La Rue's (Hollywood).[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1945, Wilkerson purchased 33 acres on the east side of U.S. Route 91, or about a mile south of the Hotel Last Frontier, in preparation for his vision. Wilkerson then hired George Vernon Russell to design a hotel influenced by European style. Wilkerson also requested that the hotel be different than the \\"sawdust joints\\" on Fremont Street. He planned a hotel with luxurious rooms, a spa, a health club, a showroom, a golf course, a nightclub, an upscale restaurant and a French style casino. Because of high wartime material costs, Wilkerson ran into financial problems almost at once, finding himself $400,000 short and hunting for new financing.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn late 1945, mobster Bugsy Siegel and his \\"partners\\" came to Las Vegas. Vegas reportedly piqued Siegel and his mob's interest because of its legalized gambling and off-track betting. At the time, Siegel held a large interest in Trans America Wire, a racing publication.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nSiegel began by purchasing El Cortez on Fremont Street for $600,000. His expansion plans were hampered by unfriendly city officials aware of his criminal background, so Siegel began looking for a site outside the city limits.[3] Hearing that Wilkerson was seeking extra funding, Siegel and his partners posed as businessmen and directly bought a two-thirds stake in the project.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nSiegel took over the final phases of construction and allegedly convinced more of his underworld associates to invest in the project. Siegel reportedly lost patience with the project's rising costs leading to outbursts which frightened his construction foreman, Del Webb. Reportedly, Siegel told him, \\"Don't worry ÿ we only kill each other.\\"[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nSiegel had also built a secret ladder in the \\"Presidential Suite\\" to escape if necessary. The ladder led down to an underground garage where a chauffeured limo was also waiting.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nSiegel finally opened The Flamingo Hotel & Casino on December 26, 1946 at a total cost of $6 million. Billed as \\"The West's Greatest Resort Hotel,\\" the 105-room property ÿ and first luxury hotel on the Strip[6] ÿ was built 4 miles (6.4?km) from Downtown Las Vegas.  During construction, a large sign announced the hotel as a William R. Wilkerson project. The sign also read Del Webb Construction as the hotel's primary contractor and Richard R. Stadelman (who later made renovations to the El Rancho Vegas) as the building architect.\\r\\n\\r\\nAllegedly, Siegel named the resort after his girlfriend, Virginia Hill, who loved to gamble and was nicknamed \\"Flamingo\\". It is reported that Siegel called her this because of her long, skinny legs.[7] Organized crime king, Lucky Luciano, wrote in his memoir that Siegel once owned an interest in the Hialeah Park Race Track and viewed the flamingos who populated nearby as a good omen. The \\"Flamingo\\" name is reported to have been given to the project at its inception by Wilkerson.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nSiegel's trouble with the Flamingo began when, a year after its official groundbreaking, the resort had produced no revenue and drained the resources of its mob investors. Then Meyer Lansky charged ÿ at a major mob conference in Cuba ÿ that either Siegel or Hill was skimming from the resort's building budget. This charge was amplified at a time when Hill was revealed to have taken $2.5 million and had gone to Switzerland, where the skimmed money was believed to be going.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\"There was no doubt in Meyer's mind,\\" Luciano recalled in his memoir, \\"that Bugsy had skimmed this dough from his building budget, and he was sure that Siegel was preparing to skip as well as skim, in case the roof was gonna fall in on him.\\" Luciano and the other mob leaders in Cuba asked Lansky what to do. Torn because of long ties to Siegel, whom he considered like a brother, Lansky nevertheless agreed that someone stealing from his friends had to die. At first, Lansky persuaded the others to wait for the Flamingo's casino opening: if it was a success, Siegel could be persuaded in other ways to repay. Luciano concurred and persuaded the others to agree.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe splashy opening ÿ stars present included Spanish band leader Xavier Cugat (whose band provided the music), George Jessel, George Raft, Rose Marie, and Jimmy Durante as entertainment, with guests including Clark Gable, Lana Turner, Cesar Romero, Judy Garland, Joan Crawford, and others ÿ was a flop.[citation needed] Lansky managed to persuade the mob chiefs to reprieve Siegel once more and allow the Flamingo more time. But by January 1947 Siegel had to order the resort closed until the hotel could be finished.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Flamingo re-opened in March despite the hotel not being complete, and this time, the results proved different. By May, the resort reported a $250,000 profit, allowing Lansky to point out that Siegel was right about Las Vegas after all. But it wasn't quite enough to save Siegel. On June 20, 1947, relaxing in the Beverly Hills house he shared with Hill, who was away at the time, Siegel was shot to death.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nA memorial plaque exists on the Flamingo site near the outdoor wedding chapel.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nCasino management changed the hotel name to The Fabulous Flamingo on March 1, 1947. After Siegel's death, Moe Sedway and Gus Greenbaum, magnates of the nearby El Cortez Hotel, took possession of it. Under their partnership, it became a non-exclusive facility affordable to almost anyone. They made the enterprise extremely successful. In the year 1948 alone, it turned a $4 million profit.[10] The Fabulous Flamingo presented lavish shows and accommodations for its time, becoming well known for comfortable, air conditioned rooms, gardens, and swimming pools. Often credited for popularizing the \\"complete experience\\" as opposed to merely gambling, its staff became known for wearing tuxedos on the job.[citation needed] Among the many entertainers who performed there between 1947 and 1953 were Martin and Lewis, Sammy Davis Jr., Danny Thomas, Tony Martin, Marge and Gower Champion, Polly Bergen, Lena Horne, The Mills Brothers, Alan King, Betty Hutton, Billy Eckstine, Sophie Tucker, Pearl Bailey, and Spike Jones.[citation needed] Rose Marie, who was one of its first entertainers under Siegel's ownership in 1946, remained loyal to the property for the rest of her life, only performing at other casinos with permission from \\"the boys\\" at the Fabulous Flamingo, according to her last words.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1953, the hotel's management spent $1 million in renovations and remodeling.  The original entrance and signage was destroyed. A new entrance with an upswept roof was built and a pink neon sign was designed by Bill Clark of Ad-Art. A neon-bubbled \\"Champagne Tower\\" sign with pink flamingos rimming the top was also installed in front of the hotel.[11] From 1955 to 1960, the property was operated by Albert Parvin of the Parvin-Dohrmann Corporation.[12] Parvin owned 30% of the stock while businessman Harry Goldman owned 7.5%; other investors included singer Tony Martin and actor George Raft.[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1960, it was sold for $10.5 million to a group including Samuel Cohen, Morris Lansburgh, and Daniel Lifter, Miami residents with reputed ties to organized crime.[12][14]  Lansky allegedly served as middleman for the deal, receiving $200,000.[12][13]\\r\\n\\r\\nKirk Kerkorian acquired the property in 1967,[15] making it part of Kerkorian's International Leisure Company, but the Hilton Corporation bought the resort in 1972, renaming it the Flamingo Hilton in 1974. The last of the original Flamingo Hotel structure was torn down on December 14, 1993 and the hotel's garden was built on-site.[citation needed] The Flamingo's four hotel towers were built (or expanded) in 1977, 1980, 1983, 1986, 1990, and 1993. A 200-unit Hilton Grand Vacations timeshare tower was opened in 1993.[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1998, Hilton's gaming properties, including the Flamingo, were spun off as Park Place Entertainment (later renamed to Caesars Entertainment).  The deal included a two-year license to use the Hilton name. Park Place opted not to renew that agreement when it expired in late 2000, and the property was renamed Flamingo Las Vegas.[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2005, Harrah's Entertainment purchased Caesars Entertainment, Inc. and the property became part of Harrah's Entertainment company. The company changed its name to Caesars Entertainment Corporation in 2010.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn September 9, 2012, Port Adelaide Football Club AFL footballer John McCarthy died after falling 30 feet (9?m) from a rooftop of the hotel. The incident occurred at the start of a post-season holiday for McCarthy and other Port Adelaide players. They had arrived in Las Vegas only a few hours before the incident.[18][19][20] After reviewing evidence, police said that McCarthy had attempted to jump off the roof onto a palm tree, but fell to the ground.[21]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 15-acre site's architectural theme is reminiscent of the Art Deco and Streamline Moderne style of Miami and South Beach, with a garden courtyard housing a wildlife habitat featuring flamingos. It was the third resort to open on the Strip, and it is the oldest resort on the Strip still in operation today. The Flamingo has a Las Vegas Monorail station, the Flamingo/Caesars Palace station, at the rear of the property.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe garden courtyard houses a wildlife habitat featuring Chilean flamingos,  Ringed Teal ducks, and other birds. There are also koi fish and turtles.[22] It was the home of penguins, but they have since been moved to the Dallas Zoo.[23] Extending the hotel's tropical theme, a Jimmy Buffett's Margaritaville restaurant and gift shop was opened in December 2003.[24] An adjacent Margaritaville \\"minicasino\\" opened in October 2011.[25]\\r\\n\\r\\nPrevious headliners include Gladys Knight, Toni Braxton, and comedian Vinnie Favorito. Braxton's show ran from August 2006 to April 2008, when it closed due to Braxton's health problems.[26] X Burlesque also resides at the hotel.[when?]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs of 2016,[27] the headline show at the Flamingo features brother-sister musical duo Donny and Marie Osmond. Their show premiered in September 2008, and was extended through November 2016.[28] The Donny & Marie show uses the \\"old showroom\\" format from the early days of Vegas which features a 750-seat theater with tables and booths.  The old style showroom was remodeled in 2014 and has been since renamed the Donny and Marie Theater.  The show was rated The Best of Las Vegas. Donny and Marie Osmond were voted \\"Best Performers of Las Vegas\\" in 2012, 2013 and 2014.[27] Singer Olivia Newton-John  began  residency at the Flamingo in April 2014 and was extended through 2016. She alternates showroom dates with Donny and Marie.\\r\\n\\r\\nFlamingo in 2008\\r\\n\\r\\nFlamingo in 2009\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 1964 film Viva Las Vegas and the 1960 version of Ocean's 11 were filmed at the hotel, as was a flashback sequence from the 2001 version of the latter film. In the 1960 version, the Flamingo was one of the five Las Vegas casinos robbed by characters played by Dean Martin, Frank Sinatra, Peter Lawford, Sammy Davis Jr.  and others.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 1991 film Bugsy starring Warren Beatty depicted Bugsy Siegel's involvement in the construction of the Flamingo, though many of the details were altered for dramatic effect. For instance, in the film, Siegel originates the idea of the Flamingo, instead of buying ownership from Billy Wilkerson, and is killed after the first opening on December 26, 1946, rather than the second opening of the Flamingo in 1947.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Netflix original series Lilyhammer featuring E-Street Band guitarist and singer Steven Van Zandt features a nightclub in Lillehammer, Norway, named the Flamingo. During its construction, Van Zandt's character, Giovanni Henriksen (aka Frank \\"The Fixer\\" Tagliano), referenced the hotel and casino, as well as Benjamin Siegel, as his inspiration for the nightclub.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe dbut solo album from The Killers' lead singer Brandon Flowers, Flamingo, is named after the casino.\\r\\n\\r\\nHunter S. Thompson and Oscar Zeta Acosta stayed at the Flamingo while attending a seminar by the National Conference of District Attorneys on Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs held at the Dunes Hotel across the street. Several of their experiences in their room are depicted in Thompson's Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas: A Savage Journey to the Heart of the American Dream.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe original Flamingo hotel and casino figures prominently in the Tim Powers novel Last Call.  In the novel, the famed myth of Siegel's creation of the Flamingo was utilized as a basis for the overall supernatural plot of the novel (rather than the true historic account of his acquiring it from the original founder). The Flamingo is supposedly founded on Siegel's mythical/mystical paranoia of being pursued and killed for his Archetypal position as the \\"King of the West,\\" known mythologically as \\"Fisher King.\\" Supposedly the Flamingo itself was meant to be a real-life personification of \\"The Tower\\" card amongst the Major Arcana of the Tarot deck, literally \\"the King's Castle in the Wasteland.\\" In the book, it is believed Siegel kept in the Flamingo hotel's penthouse a deck of the fictional Lombardy Zeroth Tarot deck. Siegel's penthouse and office floor was reported to have, as referenced in the novel, a secret escape-hatch complete with ladder. The hatch allegedly led to a service floor where a car was always readied for his getaway in the event of being attacked in his chambers. All other references to the Flamingo in any supernatural context in the novel are not based on any known or recorded facts/events.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn February 17, 2012, a slot machine game named Flamingo was added to the Slotomania game on Facebook. This game is themed after the casino and mentions at the log-in screen that the Flamingo was the first casino \\"on the strip\\" (their capitalization). According to a post on the Flamingo's Facebook page, Slotomania is their own application.[29][better?source?needed]","input":"When was the flamingo hotel in las vegas built?"},{"output":"inadvertently eating the supernatural Gum-Gum fruit","context":"Straw Hat Pirates (captain) Straw Hat Grand fleet (captain)\\r\\nMonkey D. \\"Straw Hat\\"[n 1] Luffy[n 2] (Japanese: ƹƽ?D?ū, Hepburn: Monkؐ Dؐ Rufi) is a fictional character and the main protagonist of the One Piece manga series, created by Eiichiro Oda. Luffy made his debut in One Piece chapter #1 as a young boy who acquires the properties of rubber after inadvertently eating the supernatural Gum-Gum fruit.\\r\\nHe sails from the East Blue Sea to the Grand Line in search of the legendary treasure, One Piece, to succeed Gol D. Roger as King of the Pirates. Luffy, captain of the Straw Hat Pirates, recruits crew members, fights antagonists, and aids and befriends the inhabitants of several islands during his journey. Usually cheerful, he becomes serious when he fights. Luffy uses his elasticity to concentrate his power, executing a range of attacks. In his signature attack, Gum-Gum Pistol, he slingshots punches at opponents from a distance.\\r\\nLuffy appears in most of the episodes, films, television specials, and OVAs of the manga's anime adaptations and several of the franchise's video games. Due to the series' international popularity, Luffy has become one of the world's most recognizable anime characters. In addition to the One Piece franchise, the character has appeared in a number of manga and anime series and collaborative video games. His critical reception has been largely positive.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Eiichiro Oda created Luffy, he strove for a \\"manliness\\" similar to that of Akira Toriyama's Dragon Ball series.[1] Oda said that he named his main character \\"Luffy\\" because he felt that the name suited him. When he later learned about the sailing term, \\"luffing\\", he was delighted by the coincidence.[2] In his prototype one-shots, \\"Romance Dawn\\", Oda refined the artistic style and story elements before publishing the final product a year later as the first chapter of One Piece. In the second version of \\"Romance Dawn\\", Luffy resembled his design at the beginning of the series.[3] To please his readers, Oda added rubberization to Luffy for comic effect[2] and tries to make the character straightforward.[4]\\r\\nIn the original Japanese version of the One Piece anime series and later spin-offs of the franchise, Luffy was voiced by Mayumi Tanaka.[5] Tanaka said jokingly that she regrets providing Luffy's voice because she is a mother in real life and Luffy is much younger.[6] Asked about her voicing, Tanaka said that she \\"strives for reality\\" in scenes where Luffy speaks when he is eating or touching his nose.[7] In the OVA Defeat the Pirate Ganzack!, Luffy was voiced by Urara Takano.[8] The character was voiced by Colleen Clinkenbeard in Funimation's English-language dub of the One Piece franchise.[9]\\r\\nLuffy is usually recognizable by his straw hat, a gift from \\"Red-Haired\\" Shanks. In his early childhood, he wears a white shirt and blue shorts. The character has a scar under his left eye from stabbing himself to demonstrate his courage to Shanks and his crew.[10] He later wears a red vest, denim shorts and sandals before replacing his vest with a red, unbuttoned sea captain's coat[11] (revealing the X-shaped scar on his chest he received from Akainu),[12] and a yellow sash tied around his waist.[11]\\r\\nLuffy is portrayed as a carefree, happy-go-lucky character with great ambition and a huge appetite, often thinking with his stomach and comically gorging himself. Caring and generally good-hearted, he is not as dimwitted as many believe him to be and often demonstrates more understanding than the other characters expect. Knowing the danger ahead, Luffy is willing to risk his life to become King of the Pirates and protect his crew. A capable and reliable captain, he never puts his crew or himself at risk out of incompetence. During the Loguetown story arc, Smoker (a navy captain at the time) says that Luffy \\"enjoys playing stupid\\"; Luffy responds with a mysterious smile.\\r\\nHe enlists Chopper and Brook for his crew for their personality or appearance, but also because of his instinctive ability to read people. Luffy needs key jobs filled by his crew (cook, navigator, doctor, musician and shipwright, filled by Sanji, Nami, Chopper, Brook and Franky respectively). At the beginning of the series, he said that he wanted at least 10 crew members with abilities he felt necessary for his goal. Despite his carefree personality, each crew member respects him in their own way.[13][14] Luffy is rarely concerned about the consequences of his actions, doing what he feels is best even if it leads to retaliation by a powerful force.[15] He is an extremely loyal captain, who has demonstrated throughout the series that he is willing to risk his life for the well-being of his crew.[16]\\r\\nLuffy's rubberiness is a result of eating the Gum-Gum fruit,[n 3][17] which makes him immune to most blunt forces and electric attacks and gives him the ability to stretch his body at will. He uses his elasticity to accelerate part or all of his body to deliver punches, kicks, head butts and body checks or for propulsion. Like others exposed to Devil Fruit, Luffy cannot swim; when he is submerged in water or contacts the Sea-Prism Stone, he loses his strength and cannot move on his own. In addition to his Devil Fruit powers, he has immense strength and endurance.\\r\\nLuffy's signature attack is the Gum-Gum Pistol, a punch which he learned during years of training. Another technique developed later in the series is Second Gear (ʧ2 (м), Gia Sekando), increasing his strength and speed for a short time but straining his body. Observing CP9's Shave (|, Soru) technique, Luffy adapted the move to his rubber body and matched the assassins' speed. Third Gear (ʧ3 (), Gia Sdo), another technique, uses air in his bones to attack but makes him shrink afterwards.[18] Luffy can use both techniques simultaneously; after two years, he has gained better control of the techniques and is no longer affected by their drawbacks.\\r\\nEventually, Luffy develops his latent ability to use Haki (???, ambition). This ability has two main types: Armament Haki (o???, Busshoku no Haki), an armor-like force which can amplify defense and the force of attacks and negate a Devil Fruit user's defense, allow physical contact and damage, and Observation Haki (?????, Kenbunshoku no Haki), a sixth sense which can read a person's moves and detect their presence. He also has a rare third type, the Conquering King's Haki (?t???, Hashoku no Haki), which can render people or animals near him unconscious.[19] Two years later, Luffy masters the three types of Haki and uses them with his improved attacks. As a result of his encounter with Magellan, he has also developed an immunity to poison (although it is implied that a strong poison may affect him).\\r\\nLuffy develops another technique, Fourth Gear (ʧ4 (ε), Gia Fsu) (similar to Third Gear), inflating his muscles to increase the size of his limbs (except for his legs). He can make destructive moves by compressing and releasing his limbs, and can fly in a similar fashion to CP9's Moon Walk (?i, Gepp) technique.[20]\\r\\nLuffy first appears as a young boy in Windmill Village, who befriends the pirate \\"Red-Haired\\" Shanks and intends to become one himself. Before the series begins, he accidentally eats the Gum-Gum fruit and acquires rubber powers. Luffy is later saved by Shanks from being devoured by a Sea King, a large sea beast, and Shanks loses an arm. Ten years later, Luffy leaves the village in search of the One Piece treasure and to become King of the Pirates. He meets swordsman Roronoa Zoro, ocean navigator and thief Nami, cowardly marksman and liar Usopp, and chivalrous chef Sanji, and invites them to join his crew. Luffy also encounters and defeats the East Blue pirate Buggy the Clown and the fishman Arlong, becoming known to the general populace and the pirate-hating Marines. He later accepts an offer to return Princess Nefertari Vivi of Alabasta to her homeland to stop a rebellion incited by Seven Warlords of the Sea member and Baroque Works crime-syndicate leader Sir Crocodile. After he defeats Crocodile, Luffy accepts Crocodile subordinate Nico Robin as his ally. On Drum Island he finds reindeer doctor Tony Tony Chopper, who also joins his crew.\\r\\nWhile visiting Skypiea, the crew is drawn into a war. Luffy defeats the god Eneru, ending the war. He meets Admiral Aokiji, who easily defeats him. Luffy learns about Robin's background and faces enemies connected to her, such as Franky (a cyborg who becomes Luffy's ally) and the intelligence agency Cipher Pol No. 9. Luffy and his crew save Robin at Enies Lobby. After their fight with CP9, Franky joins the crew. Luffy enters the Florian Triangle and encounters Brook, a skeletal musician. To return Brook's shadow, he defeats warlord Gecko Moria. After releasing the rest of the island's prisoners, Brook becomes a member of Luffy's crew. They go to the Sabaody Archipelago, and have Silvers Rayleigh coat the Thousand Sunny to enter the second half of the Grand Line. After Luffy's encounter with Admiral Kizaru and warlord Bartholomew Kuma, he and his crew are sent to separate parts of the world.\\r\\nStranded on Amazon Lily, an island ruled by the warlord Boa Hancock, Luffy impresses Hancock with his bravery and selflessness. Hancock falls in love with Luffy and brings him to the underground Impel Down prison to save his brother, Portgas D. Ace, from execution. Luffy breaks into the prison and meets previous foes and new allies, such as former warlord Jimbei. He frees the prisoners, they arrive at Marineford and Luffy is drawn into a war between the navy and Whitebeard's pirate crews. Ace gives his life to save Luffy, who is evacuated with Jimbei from Marineford by Trafalgar Law. Returning to Amazon Lily, Luffy remembers first meeting Ace; after Shanks left Windmill Village, Luffy's grandfather left him in the care of bandit Curly Dadan. He befriends Ace and Sabo, who are like brothers to him, but Sabo is apparently killed by a World Noble. After returning to Marineford to send a hidden message to his crew, Luffy trains with Rayleigh on Ruskaina Island to become stronger.\\r\\nTwo years later Luffy rejoins the Straw Hats, but the crew is briefly separated again while sailing to Fishman Island. Luffy and the others meet Jimbei and the island's princess, Shirahoshi, and are drawn into a battle for the island against fishman Hody Jones. He, the crew and Jimbei conceive of a plan to defeat Hody and his henchmen. After Hody's defeat, Luffy retrieves the stolen treasure from the rookie pirate Caribou and begins a feud with Big Mom. The crew enters the New World; Luffy, Zoro, Usopp and Robin disembark on Punk Hazard and are soon captured by Caesar Clown, a jealous rival of the scientist Vegapunk. Luffy and his crew ally with Trafalgar Law, and he defeats Caesar after learning about his history. With Caesar hostage the alliance lands on Dressrosa (the kingdom of Don Quixote Doflamingo), where Luffy enters a tournament to win Ace's Devil Fruit.\\r\\nLuffy has appeared in every One Piece licensed electronic video game to date, including Jump Super Stars and Jump Ultimate Stars, and is featured in the 2006 Dragon Ball Z-One Piece-Naruto crossover game Battle Stadium D.O.N. Luffy, Son Goku and Naruto Uzumaki were avatars in the MMORPG Second Life for a Jump Festa promotion, \\"Jumpland@Second Life\\".[21] Luffy has also been mentioned in songs. He sings about being a wanted pirate in \\"Wanted!\\"[22] and about One Piece in \\"Every-One Peace!\\"[23] Luffy is a major playable character in the crossover game, J-Stars Victory VS.[24]\\r\\nThe character has made guest appearances in Japanese television shows and manga. Luffy and several other characters joined the cast of Dragon Ball in a spinoff entitled Cross Epoch.[25] On April 3, 2011, Luffy and the other One Piece protagonists appeared in the first episode of the Toriko anime series and the crossover manga chapter.[26] Luffy made a cameo appearance in a Weekly Shonen Jump episode of To Love-Ru, and the Gum-Gum was mentioned in the 50th episode of the Gin Tama anime series.[27] He has also appeared in the web comic, VG Cats.[28] In 2008, Toei Animation sponsored the Italian Pallavolo Modena volleyball team; Pietro Rinaldi and Edoardo Ciabattini's black uniforms were decorated with an image of Luffy on the front.[29] Luffy appeared on the cover of the January 2010 issue of the Japanese fashion magazine Men's Non-No, the first manga character to do so. His clothes were designed by Shinichi \\"Miter\\" Mita.[30]\\r\\nLuffy led all three Shnen Jump character popularity polls.[31][32][33] According to Funimation Entertainment's Mike McFarland and Christopher Sabat, Luffy was more likable than Dragon Ball's Son Goku.[34] Joe McCulloch preferred Luffy to Naruto Uzumaki from Naruto because Luffy \\"work[ed] his ass off\\" to achieve his goals after accidentally acquiring his powers.[35] Luffy was nominated in the Best Male Character category for the 2008 Society for the Promotion of Japanese Animation Awards, losing to Ichigo Kurosaki of Bleach.[36][37] He was ranked 22nd on Chris Mackenzie's IGN list of top-25 anime characters of all time.[38] NTT customers chose Luffy as their second-favorite black-haired male anime character.[39] The Gum-Gum Gatling technique topped the male category in a Japanese survey of the most popular moves in manga and anime.[40] In a Japanese TV special from August 2017, Luffy was voted as the 8th \\"strongest hero\\" from the Showa Era as well as the 4th one from the Heisei Era.[41]\\r\\nLuffy has been praised in a number of publications. T.H.E.M. Anime Reviews called Luffy \\"likabl[y] goofy\\" and an idealist with infectious optimism.[42] In a review of One Piece The Movie: Dead End no Bken, the fourth One Piece film, The Star Online described him as \\"an airhead and brilliant fighter\\".[43] Rika Takahashi of EX wrote that Luffy's stretching powers set One Piece apart from \\"the old stereotypical adventure manga\\" and the many other \\"combat-oriented mangas [sic]\\", making the series \\"something new and interesting\\".[44] Anime News Network (ANN) writer Zac Bertschy found Luffy reminiscent of Rurouni Kenshin's character Himura Kenshin in personality and attitude, but still thought him entertaining.[45] Mania Entertainment's Bryce Coulter called Luffy a \\"great shonen hero\\".[46] ANN's Carl Kimlinger wrote, \\"Colleen Clinkenbeard's Luffy continues to grow on you\\".[47] In the final chapter of Naruto, Boruto Uzumaki makes a drawing of Luffy as a legacy of him and the series.[48]\\r\\nIn a Weekly Shonen Jump manga, Tsugihagi Hyouryuu Sakka (a character resembling Luffy) says, \\"Instead of saying what you hate, say what you like!\\" In the One Piece manga, Luffy cited but changed it to \\"Instead of saying what you like, say what you hate!\\" The meme was acknowledged in the crossover fighting game, J-Stars Victory VS[49]","input":"How did monkey d luffy get his powers?"},{"output":"Lena Baker","context":"Lena Baker (June 8, 1900 ÿ March 5, 1945)[1] was an African American maid in Cuthbert, Georgia who was convicted of capital murder of her white employer, Ernest Knight. She was executed by the state of Georgia in 1945.[2] Baker was the only woman in Georgia to be executed by electrocution. [3][2]\\r\\nThe slaying and execution came during a decades-long period of state suppression of civil rights of black citizens in Georgia by the white-dominated society. It had disenfranchised blacks since the turn of the century, and imposed legal racial segregation and second-class status. At the time of the trial, a local newspaper reported that Baker was held as a \\"slave woman\\" by Knight, and that she shot him in self-defense during a struggle.[4]\\r\\nIn 2005, sixty years after her execution, the state of Georgia granted Baker a full and unconditional pardon. A biography was published about Baker in 2001, and it was adapted for the feature film The Lena Baker Story (2008), chronicling the events of her life, trial, and execution.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLena Baker was born June 8, 1900, to a family of sharecroppers and raised near Cuthbert, Georgia. Her family, which included three siblings, moved to the county seat when she was a child. As a youth, she and her siblings all worked as farm laborers; she chopped cotton for a farmer named J.A. Cox.[5]\\r\\nBy the 1940s, Baker was the mother of three children and worked as a maid to support her family. In 1944, Baker started working for Ernest Knight, an older white man who had broken his leg. He owned a gristmill and, after they started a sexual relationship, he would keep her there imprisoned for days at a time in \\"near slavery.\\"[4] Knight's son and townspeople disliked their relationship, and tried to end it through threatening Baker.[2] One night an argument between the two ensued, during which Knight threatened Baker with an iron bar. As she tried to escape, they struggled over his pistol and she shot and killed him. She immediately reported the incident and said she had acted in self-defense.\\r\\nLena Baker was charged with capital murder and stood trial on August 14, 1944. The trial was presided over by Judge William \\"Two Gun\\" Worrill, who kept a pair of pistols in view on his judicial bench.[5] At her trial, Baker testified that Knight forced her to go with him on that Saturday evening of April 29. The town disliked their sexual relationship and the county sheriff had warned her to stay away from Knight, or risk being sent to jail. But she was afraid of Knight's physical abuse; he had forced relations on her. His son had also beat her on another occasion, warning her to stay away from his father.[4] Baker said she got away from Knight that night and slept in the woods. As she returned to Cuthbert the next morning, Knight cornered her, taking her to the gristmill and locking her in. When Knight returned, Baker told him she was leaving. According to Baker, they \\"tussled over the pistol,\\" after he threatened her with an iron bar.[3] She immediately reported it to J.A. Cox, the county coroner who had previously employed her.\\r\\nThe all-white, all-male jury rejected Baker's plea of self-defense and convicted her of capital murder by the end of the first day of the trial.[5] This charge carried an automatic death sentence. In addition to the legal racial segregation imposed by the white-dominated Georgia legislature, it had disenfranchised most blacks since the turn of the century, which disqualified them from jury service. After Baker's court-appointed counsel, W.L. Ferguson, filed an appeal, he dropped Baker as a client.[5]\\r\\nGovernor Ellis Arnall granted Baker a 60-day reprieve so that the Board of Pardons and Parole could review the case, but in January 1945 it denied Baker clemency.[6] She was transferred to Georgia State Prison at Reidsville on February 23, 1945.[6]\\r\\nWhat I done, I did in self-defense, or I would have been killed myself. Where I was I could not overcome it. God has forgiven me. I have nothing against anyone. I picked cotton for Mr. Pritchett, and he has been good to me. I am ready to go. I am one in the number. I am ready to meet my God. I have a very strong conscience.\\r\\nBaker was executed on March 5, 1945.[2] She was buried in an unmarked grave behind Mount Vernon Baptist Church, where she had sung in the choir.\\r\\nIn 1998, members of the congregation arranged for a simple headstone for her grave.[6] That year two articles were published about her case.[7]\\r\\nIn 2003, descendants of Baker's family began to mark the anniversary of her death and Mother's Day at her graveside. That year Baker's grandnephew, Roosevelt Curry, requested an official pardon from the state, aided by the Georgia-based prison advocacy group, Prison and Jail Project.\\r\\nIn 2005, the Parole Board granted Baker a full and unconditional pardon.[2][6][5] Commentators have suggested that in 1945, the Board of Pardons and Parole could have lowered her charge to voluntary manslaughter, which would have carried an average 15-year sentence and saved her life.[2][8]\\r\\nIn 2001 Lena Bond Phillips, a professor at Andrew College, published a biography, The Lena Baker Story.

They are based on the novel The Lord of the Rings by J. R. R. Tolkien. The films are subtitled The Fellowship of the Ring (2001), The Two Towers (2002) and The Return of the King (2003). They are a New Zealand-American venture produced by WingNut Films and The Saul Zaentz Company and distributed by New Line Cinema.\\r\\nConsidered to be one of the biggest and most ambitious film projects ever undertaken, with an overall budget of $281 million (some sources say $310-$330 million),[2] the entire project took eight years, with the filming for all three films done simultaneously and entirely in New Zealand, Jackson's native country.[3] Each film in the series also had special extended editions released on DVD a year after their respective theatrical releases. While the films follow the book's general storyline, they do omit some of the novel's plot elements and include some additions to and deviations from the source material.\\r\\nSet in the fictional world of Middle-earth, the films follow the hobbit Frodo Baggins (Elijah Wood) as he and a Fellowship embark on a quest to destroy the One Ring, and thus ensure the destruction of its maker, the Dark Lord Sauron (Sala Baker). The Fellowship eventually splits up and Frodo continues the quest together with his loyal companion Sam (Sean Astin) and the treacherous Gollum (Andy Serkis). Meanwhile, Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), heir in exile to the throne of Gondor, Legolas, Gimli, Merry, and Pippin, and the wizard Gandalf (Ian McKellen) unite to rally the Free Peoples of Middle-earth in the War of the Ring.\\r\\nThe series was received with overwhelming praise and was a major financial success, with the films collectively being among the highest-grossing film series of all time. The films were critically acclaimed and heavily awarded, winning 17 out of 30 total Academy Award nominations. The final film in the series, The Return of the King, won all 11 of its Academy Award nominations including Best Picture, which also tied it with Ben-Hur and Titanic for most Academy Awards received for a film. The series received wide praise for its innovative special and visual effects.[4][5][6]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nDirector Peter Jackson first came into contact with The Lord of the Rings when he saw Ralph Bakshi's 1978 animated film The Lord of the Rings. Jackson \\"enjoyed the film and wanted to know more.\\"[7] Afterwards, he read a tie-in edition of the book[8] during a twelve-hour train journey from Wellington to Auckland when he was seventeen.[9]\\r\\nIn 1995, Jackson was finishing The Frighteners and considered The Lord of the Rings as a new project, wondering \\"why nobody else seemed to be doing anything about it\\".[9] With the new developments in computer-generated imagery following Jurassic Park, Jackson set about planning a fantasy film that would be relatively serious and feel real. By October, he and his partner Fran Walsh teamed up with Miramax Films boss Harvey Weinstein to negotiate with Saul Zaentz who had held the rights to the book since the early 1970s, pitching an adaptation of The Hobbit and two films based on The Lord of the Rings. Negotiations then stalled when Universal Studios offered Jackson a remake of King Kong.[10] Weinstein was furious, and further problems arose when it turned out Zaentz did not have distribution rights to The Hobbit; United Artists, which was in the market, did. By April 1996, the rights question was still not resolved.[10]\\r\\nJackson decided to move ahead with King Kong before filming The Lord of the Rings, prompting Universal to enter a deal with Miramax to receive foreign earnings from The Lord of the Rings while Miramax received foreign earnings from King Kong.[10] It was also revealed that Jackson originally wanted to finish King Kong before The Lord of the Rings began. But due to location problems, he decided to start with The Lord of the Rings franchise instead.\\r\\nWhen Universal cancelled King Kong in 1997,[11] Jackson and Walsh immediately received support from Weinstein and began a six-week process of sorting out the rights. Jackson and Walsh asked Costa Botes to write a synopsis of the book and they began to re-read the book. Two to three months later, they had written their treatment.[12] The first film would have dealt with what would become The Fellowship of the Ring, The Two Towers, and the beginning of The Return of the King, ending with Saruman's death, and Gandalf and Pippin going to Minas Tirith. In this treatment, Gwaihir and Gandalf visit Edoras after escaping Saruman, Gollum attacks Frodo when the Fellowship is still united, and Farmer Maggot, Glorfindel, Radagast, Elladan and Elrohir are present. Bilbo attends the Council of Elrond, Sam looks into Galadriel's mirror, Saruman is redeemed before he dies and the Nazg?l just make it into Mount Doom before they fall.[12] They presented their treatment to Harvey and Bob Weinstein, the latter of whom they focused on impressing with their screenwriting as he had not read the book. They agreed upon two films and a total budget of $75?million.[12]\\r\\nDuring mid-1997,[13] Jackson and Walsh began writing with Stephen Sinclair.[12] Sinclair's partner, Philippa Boyens, was a major fan of the book and joined the writing team after reading their treatment.[13] It took 13ÿ14 months to write the two film scripts,[13] which were 147 and 144 pages respectively. Sinclair left the project due to theatrical obligations. Amongst their revisions, Sam is caught eavesdropping and forced to go along with Frodo, instead of Sam, Merry, and Pippin figuring out about the One Ring themselves and voluntarily going along after confronting Frodo about it, as occurs in the original novel. Gandalf's account of his time at Orthanc was pulled out of flashback and Lothl܇rien was cut, with Galadriel doing what she does in the story at Rivendell. Denethor attends the Council with his son. Other changes included having Arwen rescue Frodo, and the action sequence involving the cave troll. The writers also considered having Arwen absorb owyn's role entirely by having her kill the Witch-king.[12]\\r\\nTrouble struck when Marty Katz was sent to New Zealand. Spending four months there, he told Miramax that the films were more likely to cost $150?million, and with Miramax unable to finance this, and with $15?million already spent, they decided to merge the two films into one. On 17 June 1998, Bob Weinstein presented a treatment of a single two-hour film version of the book. He suggested cutting Bree and the Battle of Helm's Deep, \\"losing or using\\" Saruman, merging Rohan and Gondor with owyn as Boromir's sister, shortening Rivendell and Moria as well as having Ents prevent the Uruk-hai from kidnapping Merry and Pippin.[12] Upset by the idea of \\"cutting out half the good stuff\\"[13] Jackson balked, and Miramax declared that any script or work completed by Weta Workshop was theirs.[12] Jackson went around Hollywood for four weeks,[13] showing a thirty-five-minute video of their work, before meeting with New Line Cinema's Mark Ordesky.[14] At New Line Cinema, Robert Shaye viewed the video, and then asked why they were making two films when the book was published as three volumes (this was later corrected: New Line only made this choice out of economical reasons);[15] he wanted to make a film trilogy. Now Jackson, Walsh, and Boyens had to write three new scripts.[13]\\r\\nThe expansion to three films allowed much more creative freedom, although Jackson, Walsh, and Boyens had to restructure their script accordingly. The three films do not correspond exactly to the trilogy's three volumes, but rather represent a three-part adaptation. Jackson takes a more chronological approach to the story than did Tolkien. Frodo's quest is the main focus, and Aragorn is the main sub-plot,[16] and many sequences (such as Tom Bombadil) that do not contribute directly to those two plots were left out. Much effort was put into creating satisfactory conclusions and making sure exposition did not bog down the pacing. Amongst new sequences, there are also expansions on elements Tolkien kept ambiguous, such as the battles and the creatures. During shooting, the screenplays continued to evolve, in part due to contributions from cast members looking to further explore their characters.[13] Most notable amongst these rewrites was the character Arwen, who was originally planned as a warrior princess, but reverted to her book counterpart, who remains physically inactive in the story (though she sends moral and military support).[17]\\r\\nTo develop fight and sword choreography for the series, the filmmakers employed Hollywood sword-master Bob Anderson. Anderson worked directly with the talent including Viggo Mortensen and Karl Urban to develop the film's many sword fights and stunts.[18] Bob Anderson's role in The Lord of the Rings series was highlighted in the film Reclaiming the Blade. This documentary on sword martial arts also featured Weta Workshop and Richard Taylor, The Lord of the Rings illustrator John Howe and actors Viggo Mortensen and Karl Urban. All discussed their roles and work on the series as related to the sword.[19]\\r\\nJackson began storyboarding the series with Christian Rivers in August 1997 and assigned his crew to begin designing Middle-earth at the same time.[20] Jackson hired long-time collaborator Richard Taylor to lead Weta Workshop on five major design elements: armour, weapons, prosthetics/make-up, creatures, and miniatures. In November 1997,[13] famed Tolkien illustrators Alan Lee and John Howe joined the project. Most of the imagery in the films is based on their various illustrations.[21] Production designer Grant Major was charged with the task of converting Lee and Howe's designs into architecture, creating models of the sets, while Dan Hennah worked as art director, scouting locations and organising the building of sets.\\r\\nJackson's vision of Middle-earth was described as being \\"Ray Harryhausen meets David Lean\\" by Randy Cook.[22] Jackson wanted a gritty realism and historical regard for the fantasy, and attempted to make the world rational and believable. For example, the New Zealand Army helped build Hobbiton months before filming began so the plants could really grow.[23] Creatures were designed to be biologically believable, such as the enormous wings of the fell beast to help it fly.[24] In total, 48,000 pieces of armour, 500 bows, and 10,000 arrows were created by Weta Workshop.[25] They also created many prosthetics, such as 1,800 pairs of Hobbit feet for the lead actors,[13] as well as many ears, noses, and heads for the cast, and around 19,000 costumes were woven and aged.[13] Every prop was specially designed by the Art Department, taking the different scales into account.[13]\\r\\nPrincipal photography for all three films was conducted concurrently in many locations within New Zealand's conservation areas and national parks between 11 October 1999, and 22 December 2000, a period of 438 days. Pick-up shoots were conducted annually from 2001 to 2004. The series was shot at over 150 different locations,[25] with seven different units shooting, as well as soundstages around Wellington and Queenstown. Along with Jackson directing the whole production, other unit directors included John Mahaffie, Geoff Murphy, Fran Walsh, Barrie Osbourne, Rick Porras, and any other assistant director, producer, or writer available. Jackson monitored these units with live satellite feeds, and with the added pressure of constant script re-writes and the multiple units interpreting his envisioned result, he only got around four hours of sleep a night.[17] Due to the remoteness of some of the locations, the crew would also bring survival kits in case helicopters could not reach the location to bring them home in time.[13] The New Zealand Department of Conservation was criticised for approving the filming within national parks without adequate consideration of the adverse environmental effects and without public notification.[26] The adverse effects of filming battle scenes in Tongariro National Park meant that the park later required restoration work.[27]\\r\\nThe following is a list of cast members who voiced or portrayed characters appearing in the extended version of The Lord of the Rings film series.\\r\\nEach film had the benefit of a full year of post-production time before its respective December release, often finishing in OctoberÿNovember, with the crew immediately going to work on the next film. In this period's later part, Jackson would move to London to supervise the scoring and continue editing, while having a computer feed for discussions to The Dorchester Hotel, and a \\"fat pipe\\" of Internet connections from Pinewood Studios to look at the special effects. He had a video link and 5.1 surround sound to organise meetings, and listen to new music and sound effects generally wherever he was. The extended editions also had a tight schedule at the start of each year to complete special effects and music.[31]\\r\\nTo avoid pressure, Jackson hired a different editor for each film. John Gilbert worked on the first film, Mike Horton and Jabez Olssen on the second and longtime Jackson collaborator Jamie Selkirk and Annie Collins on the third. Daily rushes would often last up to four hours, with scenes being done throughout 1999ÿ2002 for the rough (4? hours) assemblies of the films.[13] In total, 1828?km (six million feet) of film[25] was edited down to the 11 hours and 23?minutes (683?minutes) of Extended running time. This was the final area of shaping of the films, when Jackson realised that sometimes the best scripting could be redundant on screen, as he picked apart scenes every day from multiple takes.\\r\\nThe first film's editing was relatively easygoing, with Jackson coming up with the concept of an Extended Edition later on, although after a screening to New Line they had to re-edit the beginning for a prologue. The Two Towers was always acknowledged by the crew as the most difficult film to make, as \\"it had no beginning or end\\", and had the additional problem of inter-cutting storylines appropriately. Jackson even continued editing the film when that part of the schedule officially ended, resulting in some scenes, including the reforging of And~ril, Gollum's back-story, and Saruman's demise, being moved to The Return of the King. Later, Saruman's demise was cut from the theatrical edition (but included in the Extended edition) when Jackson felt it was not starting the third film effectively enough.[32] As with all parts of the third film's post-production, editing was very chaotic. The first time Jackson actually saw the completed film was at the Wellington premiere.\\r\\nMany filmed scenes remain unused, even in the Extended Editions. Promotional material for The Fellowship of the Ring contained an attack by Orcs from Moria on Lothl܇rien after the Fellowship leaves Moria, replaced with a more suspenseful entrance for the Fellowship. Also cut were scenes from the book, including Frodo seeing more of Middle-earth at Parth Galen and an extended Council of Elrond,[13] and new scenes with an attack upon Frodo and Sam at the river Anduin by an Uruk-hai.[13] The major cut to The Two Towers featured Arwen and Elrond visiting Galadriel at Lothl܇rien, with Arwen then leading the Elven reinforcements to Helm's Deep.[17] This scene, and a flashback to Arwen and Aragorn's first meeting, was cut during a revision of the film's plot; the Elves' appearance was explained with a telepathic communication between Elrond and Galadriel.[17]\\r\\nowyn was to have a greater role in defending the refugees in the Glittering Caves from Uruk-hai intruders,[33] while in Osgiliath, Faramir was to have a vision of Frodo becoming like Gollum,[17] with Frodo and Sam having an extended fight sequence.[34] Filmed for The Return of the King were two scenes present in the book; Sam using the Phial of Galadriel to pass the Watchers at Cirith Ungol, and further epilogue footage, with endings for Legolas and Gimli, owyn and Faramir's wedding and Aragorn's death and funeral.[35] Sauron was to fight Aragorn at the Black Gate, but with Jackson deciding the scene was inappropriate, a computer-generated Troll was used instead.[22] To give context for Wormtongue killing Saruman, and Legolas in turn killing Wormtongue, it was to be revealed Wormtongue poisoned Thodred.[36] The final scene cut was Aragorn having his armour fitted for the Battle of the Black Gate by the trilogy's armourers, which was the final scene filmed during principal photography.[22] Peter Jackson has stated that he would like to include some of these unused scenes in a future \\"Ultimate Edition\\" home video release, also including out-takes.[37]\\r\\nHoward Shore composed, orchestrated, conducted, and produced the trilogy's music. He was hired in August 2000[38] and visited the set, and watched the assembly cuts of The Fellowship of the Ring and The Return of the King. In the music, Shore included many (87 to 117) leitmotifs to represent various characters, cultures, and places. For example, there are leitmotifs for the hobbits as well as the Shire. Although the first film had some of its score recorded in Wellington,[13] virtually all of the trilogy's score was recorded in Watford Town Hall and mixed at Abbey Road Studios. Jackson planned to advise the score for six weeks each year in London, though for The Two Towers he stayed for twelve. As a Beatles fan, Jackson had a photo tribute done there on the zebra crossing.[17]\\r\\nThe score is primarily played by the London Philharmonic Orchestra (ranging from 93 to 110 players throughout the recording) and many artists such as Ben Del Maestro, Enya, Rene Fleming, James Galway, Annie Lennox and Emilana Torrini contributed. Even actors Billy Boyd, Viggo Mortensen, Liv Tyler, Miranda Otto (extended cuts only for the latter two), and Peter Jackson (for a single gong sound in the second film) contributed to the score. Fran Walsh and Philippa Boyens served as Librettists, writing lyrics to various music and songs, which David Salo translated into Tolkien's languages. The third film's end song, \\"Into the West\\", was a tribute to a young filmmaker Jackson and Walsh befriended named Cameron Duncan, who died of cancer in 2003.[22]\\r\\nShore composed a main theme for The Fellowship rather than many different character themes, and its strength and weaknesses in volume are depicted at different points in the series. On top of that, individual themes were composed to represent different cultures. Infamously, the amount of music Shore had to write every day for the third film increased dramatically to around seven minutes.[22] The music for the series turned out to be a success and has been voted best movie soundtrack of all time for the six years running, passing up Schindler's list, Gladiator, Star Wars (1977), and Out of Africa respectively.[39]\\r\\nSound technicians spent the early part of the year trying to find the right sounds. Some, such as animal sounds like those of tigers and walruses, were bought. Human voices were also used. Fran Walsh contributed to the Nazg?l scream and David Farmer the Warg howls. Other sounds were unexpected: the fell beast's screech is taken from that of a donkey, and the m?makil's bellow comes from the beginning and end of a lion's roar. In addition, ADR was used for most of the dialogue.\\r\\nThe technicians worked with New Zealand locals to get many of the sounds. They re-recorded sounds in abandoned tunnels for an echo-like effect in the Moria sequence. 20,000 New Zealand cricket fans provided the sound of the Uruk-hai army in The Two Towers, with Jackson acting as conductor during the innings break of a one-day international cricket match between England and New Zealand at Westpac Stadium.[17] They spent time recording sounds in a graveyard at night, and also had construction workers drop stone blocks for the sounds of boulders firing and landing in The Return of the King. Mixing took place between August and November at \\"The Film Mix\\", before Jackson commissioned the building of a new studio in 2003. The building, however, had not yet been fully completed when they started mixing for The Return of the King.[22]\\r\\nThe first film has around 540 effect shots, the second 799, and the third 1,488 (2,730 in total). The total increases to 3,420 with the extended editions. 260 visual effect artists began work on the series, and the number doubled by The Two Towers. The crew, led by Jim Rygiel and Randy Cook, worked long hours, often overnight, to produce special effects within a short space of time. Jackson's active imagination was a driving force. For example, several major shots of Helm's Deep were produced within the last six weeks of post-production of The Two Towers, and the same happened again within the last six weeks on The Return of the King.\\r\\nThe trilogy's online promotional trailer was first released on 27 April 2000, and set a new record for download hits, registering 1.7?million hits in the first 24 hours of its release.[40] The trailer used a selection from the soundtrack for Braveheart and The Shawshank Redemption among other cuts. In 2001, 24?minutes of footage from the series, primarily the Moria sequence, was shown at the Cannes Film Festival, and was very well received.[41] The showing also included an area designed to look like Middle-earth.[25]\\r\\nThe Fellowship of the Ring was released 19 December 2001. It grossed $47?million in its U.S. opening weekend and made around $871?million worldwide. A preview of The Two Towers was inserted just before the end credits near the end of the film's theatrical run.[42] A promotional trailer was later released, containing music re-scored from the film Requiem for a Dream.[43] The Two Towers was released 18 December 2002. It grossed $62?million in its first U.S. weekend and out-grossed its predecessor with $926?million worldwide. The promotional trailer for The Return of the King was debuted exclusively before the New Line Cinema film Secondhand Lions on 23 September 2003.[44] Released 17 December 2003, its first U.S. weekend gross was $72?million, and became the second film (after Titanic) to gross over $1?billion worldwide.\\r\\nEach film was released on standard two-disc edition DVDs containing previews of the next film. The success of the theatrical cuts brought about four-disc Extended Editions, with new editing, added special effects and music.[45] The extended cuts of the films and the included special features were spread over two discs, and a limited collector's edition was also released. The Fellowship of the Ring was released on 12 November 2002, containing 30?minutes more footage, an Alan Lee painting of the Fellowship entering Moria, and the Moria Gate on the back of the sleeve; an Argonath-styled bookend was included with the Collector's Edition. The Two Towers, released on 18 November 2003, contained 44?minutes extra footage and a Lee painting of Gandalf the White's entrance; the Collector's Edition contained a Smagol statue, with a crueller-looking statue of his Gollum persona available by order for a limited time.\\r\\nThe Return of the King was released on 14 December 2004, having 51?minutes more footage, a Lee painting of the Grey Havens and a model of Minas Tirith for the Collector's Edition, with Minas Morgul available by order for a limited time. The Special Extended DVD Editions also had in-sleeve maps of the Fellowship's travels. They have also played at cinemas, most notably for a 16 December 2003 marathon screening (dubbed \\"Trilogy Tuesday\\") culminating in a late afternoon screening of the third film. Attendees of \\"Trilogy Tuesday\\" were given a limited edition keepsake from Sideshow Collectibles containing one random frame of film from each of the three movies. Both versions were put together in a Limited Edition \\"branching\\" version, plus a new feature-length documentary by Costa Botes. The complete series was released in a six-disc set on 14 November 2006.\\r\\nWarner Bros. released the trilogy's theatrical versions on Blu-ray Disc in a boxed set on 6 April 2010.[46] An extended edition Blu-ray box set was made available for pre-order from Amazon.com in March 2011 and was released on 28 June 2011.[47] Each film's extended Blu-ray version is identical to the extended DVD version; the total running time is longer due to added credit sequence listing the names of \\"Lord of the Rings fan-club members\\" who contributed to the project.[48][49]\\r\\nIn 2014, brand new Blu-ray steelbook editions of the five-disc Extended Editions were released. The first, The Fellowship of the Ring, was released on 24 March 2014.[50] The discs are identical to those found in the previous five-disc Blu-ray set.[51]\\r\\nUnadjusted for inflation, The Lord of the Rings film series is the highest-grossing film trilogy worldwide of all time, higher even than other film franchises such as the original Star Wars trilogy and The Godfather trilogy.[56] The film series grossed a total of $2.91 billion[57] and also tied a record with Ben-Hur and Titanic for the total number of Academy Awards won for a single film, with The Return of the King receiving eleven Oscars.[58]\\r\\nThe majority of critics have also praised the series, with Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times writing that \\"the trilogy will not soon, if ever, find its equal\\".[59] Some were critical of the films' pacing and length: \\"It's a collection of spectacular set pieces without any sense of momentum driving them into one another\\" according to Philadelphia Weekly.[60]\\r\\nOn Rotten Tomatoes, the films received approval ratings of 91%, 96%, and 95% respectively.[61][62][63] Metacritic, based on its ratings for each film (92, 88, and 94 respectively),[64][65][66] features the series within the top ten of the best films of the decade.[67] As of July 2016, every film is placed in the top 200 of Metacritic's 'Best Movies of all Time' list.[68] In CinemaScore polls conducted during the opening weekend, cinema audiences gave the films an average grade of A-, A, and A+ respectively on an A+ to F scale.[69]\\r\\nThe series appears in the Dallas-Fort Worth Film Critics Association's Top 10 Films, Time magazine's All-Time 100 Movies, and James Berardinelli's Top 100.[70] In 2007, USA Today named the series as the most important films of the past 25 years.[71] Entertainment Weekly put it on its end-of-the-decade, \\"best-of\\" list, saying, \\"Bringing a cherished book to the big screen? No sweat. Peter Jackson's trilogy  or, as we like to call it, our preciousssss  exerted its irresistible pull, on advanced Elvish speakers and neophytes alike.\\"[72] Paste Magazine named it one of the 50 Best Movies of the Decade (2000ÿ2009), ranking it at No. 4.[73] In another Time magazine list, the series ranks second in \\"Best Movies of the Decade\\".[74] Empire magazine voted the films at #1 on the '32 Greatest Film Trilogies'.[75] In addition, six characters and their respective actors made the list of 'The 100 Greatest Movie Characters', also compiled by Empire, with Viggo Mortensen's portrayal of Aragorn ranking No. 15, Ian McKellen's portrayal of Gandalf ranking No. 30, Ian Holm's portrayal of Bilbo Baggins (shared with Martin Freeman for his portrayal of the same character in The Hobbit films) ranking No. 61, Andy Serkis' portrayal of Gollum ranking No. 66, Sean Astin's portrayal of Samwise Gamgee ranking No. 77, and Orlando Bloom's portrayal of Legolas ranking No. 94.[76]\\r\\nThe three films together were nominated for a total of 30 Academy Awards, of which they won 17, a record for any movie trilogy (the three nominations for The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey and The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug along with the single nomination for The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies brings the series' total to 37 nominations). The Fellowship of the Ring earned thirteen nominations, the most of any film at the 74th Academy Awards, winning four. The Return of the King won in every category in which it was nominated, setting the current Oscar record for the highest clean sweep, and its 11 Academy Awards wins ties the record held by Ben-Hur and Titanic (though both of those films had additional nominations that they ultimately lost). The Return of the King became only the second sequel to win the Oscar for Best Picture (after The Godfather Part II) and the first and only fantasy film to receive this honor, though this has been widely perceived as an award by proxy for the entire series (the first two films were also nominated for Best Picture).[77] No actors in any of the three films won Oscars, and Ian McKellen was the only actor in the trilogy to receive a nomination, for his work in The Fellowship of the Ring.[77]\\r\\nAs well as Academy Awards, each film in the series won the Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation, the MTV Movie Award for Best Movie, and the Saturn Award for Best Fantasy Film. The first and third films also won the BAFTA Award for Best Film. The soundtrack for The Two Towers did not receive a nomination because of a rule prohibiting a soundtrack including music from a previous soundtrack to be eligible for nomination. This rule was changed in time for The Return of the King to receive the Oscar for Best Music Score. The New York Film Critics Circle awarded The Return of the King its Best Picture Award at the 2003 Awards Ceremony, hosted by Andrew Johnston, chair of the organization at that time, who called it \\"a masterful piece of filmmaking.\\"[78]\\r\\nThe film series provoked both positive and negative reaction from fans and scholars of the novels, and was sometimes seen as changing parts Tolkien felt thematically necessary in terms of characters, themes, events and subtlety. Some fans of the book who disagreed with such changes have released fan edits of the films such as The Lord of the Rings: The Purist Edition,[79][80] which removed many of the changes to bring them closer to the original.\\r\\nVarious changes to characters such as Gandalf, Aragorn, Arwen, Denethor, Faramir, Gimli, and Frodo, when considered together, were seen by some to alter the tone and themes found in the books. Several critics contend that the portrayal of women, especially Arwen, in the films is thematically faithful to (or compatible with) Tolkien's writings despite some differences.[81][82][83][84] Wayne G. Hammond, a Tolkien scholar,[85][86] said of the first two films that he found them to be \\"travesties as adaptations... faithful only on a basic level of plot\\" and that many characters had not been depicted faithfully to their appearance in the novel.[87][88] Other critics have argued that Tolkien's characters were weakened and misinterpreted by their portrayal in the films.[89][90][91]\\r\\nChanges to events (such as the Elves participating at the Battle of Helm's Deep,[92] Faramir taking the hobbits to Osgiliath,[93] and the deletion of the chapter \\"The Scouring of the Shire\\") are also seen as changing Tolkien's themes.[93]\\r\\nJanet Brennan Croft criticized the films using Tolkien's own terms \\"anticipation\\" and \\"flattening\\", which she used in critiquing a proposed film script. She contrasts Tolkien's subtlety with Jackson's tendency to show \\"too much too soon\\".[94]\\r\\nSupporters of the series assert that it is a worthy interpretation of the book and that most of the changes were necessary.[21] Many who worked on the series are fans of the book, including Christopher Lee, who (alone among the cast) had actually met Tolkien in person,[95] and Boyens once noted that no matter what, it is simply their interpretation of the book. Jackson once said that to simply summarize the story on screen would be a mess, and in his own words, \\"Sure, it's not really The Lord of the Rings... but it could still be a pretty damn cool movie.\\"[96][97] Other fans also claim that, despite any changes, the films serve as a tribute to the book, appealing to those who have not yet read it, and even leading some to do so. The Movie Guide for The Encyclopedia of Arda (an online Tolkien encyclopedia) states that Jackson's films were exceptional since filming the whole story of The Lord of the Rings was probably impossible.[98] This notion is partially supported by a review published in 2005 that otherwise criticized a lack of \\"faithfulness to Tolkien's spirit and tone.\\"[99] Douglas Kellner argues that the conservative community spirit of Tolkien's Shire is reflected in Jackson's films as well as the division of the Fellowship into \\"squabbling races\\".[100] In a 2006 review, film theorist Kristin Thompson was critical about the fact that film studies were undertaken by literary researchers and about the frequent denigration of Jackson's work in the collected essays.[101]\\r\\nThe release of the films saw a surge of interest in The Lord of the Rings and Tolkien's other works, vastly increasing his impact on popular culture.[103] It was rumored that the Tolkien family became split on the series, with Christopher Tolkien and his son Simon Tolkien feuding over whether or not it was a good idea to adapt.[104] Christopher has since denied these claims, saying, \\"My own position is that The Lord of the Rings is peculiarly unsuitable to transformation into visual dramatic form. The suggestions that have been made that I 'disapprove' of the films, even to the extent of thinking ill of those with whom I may differ, are wholly without foundation.\\" He added that he had never \\"expressed any such feeling\\".[105] In 2012, however, he described the films as having \\"eviscerated\\" the book, and criticized the resulting \\"commercialisation\\" of his father's work.[102][106]\\r\\nAs a result of the series' success, Peter Jackson has become a major player in the film business (sometimes called a mogul) in the mold of Steven Spielberg and George Lucas, in the process befriending some industry heavyweights like Bryan Singer and Frank Darabont. Jackson has since founded his own film production company, Wingnut Films, as well as Wingnut Interactive, a video game company. He was also finally given a chance to remake King Kong in 2005. The film was a critical and box office success, although not as successful as The Lord of the Rings series. Jackson has been called a \\"favourite son\\" of New Zealand.[107] In 2004, Howard Shore toured with The Lord of the Rings Symphony, playing two hours of the score. Along with the Harry Potter films, the series has renewed interest in the fantasy film genre. Tourism for New Zealand is up, possibly due to its exposure in the series,[108] with the country's tourism industry waking up to an audience's familiarity.[109]\\r\\nIn December 2002, The Lord of the Rings Motion Picture Trilogy: The Exhibition opened at the Te Papa museum in Wellington, New Zealand. As of 2007, the exhibition has traveled to seven other cities around the world. A musical adaptation of the book was launched in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, in 2006, but it closed after mostly poor reviews. A shortened version opened in London, United Kingdom, in the summer of 2007. The success of the films has also spawned numerous video games and many other kinds of merchandise.\\r\\nThe legacy of The Lord of the Rings is also that of court cases over profits from the trilogy. Sixteen cast members (Noel Appleby?(de), Jed Brophy, Mark Ferguson, Ray Henwood, Bruce Hopkins, William Johnson, Nathaniel Lees, Sarah McLeod, Ian Mune, Paul Norell, Craig Parker, Robert Pollock, Martyn Sanderson, Peter Tait and Stephan Ure?(de)) sued over the lack of revenue from merchandise bearing their appearance. The case was resolved out of court in 2008. The settlement came too late for Appleby, who died of cancer in 2007.[110] Saul Zaentz also filed a lawsuit in 2004 claiming he had not been paid all of his royalties. The next year, Jackson himself sued the studio over profits from the first film, slowing development of the prequels until late 2007.[111] The Tolkien Trust filed a lawsuit in February 2008, for violating Tolkien's original deal over the rights that they would earn 7.5% of the gross from any films based on his works.[112] The Trust sought compensation of $150?million.[113] A judge denied them this option, but allowed them to win compensation from the act of the studio ignoring the contract itself.[114] On 8 September 2009, a settlement of this dispute between the Trust and New Line was announced, clearing a potential obstacle to the making of a new film based on The Hobbit.[115]\\r\\nNumerous video games have been released to supplement the film series. The releases include: The Two Towers, Pinball, The Return of the King, The Third Age, The Third Age (GBA), Tactics, The Battle for Middle-earth, The Battle for Middle-earth II, The Battle for Middle-earth II: The Rise of the Witch-king, The Lord of the Rings Online, Conquest, Aragorn's Quest, War in the North, Lego The Lord of the Rings, Guardians of Middle-earth, Lego The Hobbit (video game), and Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor.\\r\\nPeter Jackson also directed three films based on Tolkien's earlier 1937 novel The Hobbit. The first film, The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey, was released on 12 December 2012,[116] the second film, The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug, was released on 13 December 2013, and the third film, The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies, was released on 17 December 2014.[117] Several actors from The Lord of the Rings, including Ian McKellen, Andy Serkis, Hugo Weaving, Elijah Wood, Ian Holm (as older Bilbo), Christopher Lee, Cate Blanchett and Orlando Bloom reprised their roles.","input":"What order is the lord of the rings?"},{"output":"Established in 1998","context":"The National Toy Hall of Fame is an American hall of fame that recognizes the contributions of toys and games that have sustained their popularity for many years.

Nine contestants were selected to compete in the running of becoming \\"America's Next Drag Superstar.\\" The first season was filmed during the summer of 2008. The winner of the first season won $5,000 worth of MAC Cosmetics, was featured in an LA Eyeworks campaign, joined the Logo Drag Race tour, and won a cash prize of $20,000. One of the nine contestants to compete on RuPaul's Drag Race was determined by an audience vote via the show's official website. The results were announced in early September 2008. The theme song playing during the runway every episode was \\"Cover Girl\\" from RuPaul's album Champion.

They are then immediately thrusted into a car wash photo shoot, portraying sex appeal while posing with two men, with Mike Ruiz as their photographer.\\r\\nThe first challenge involved them making an outfit out of thrift store clothes and accessories from a 99 cent store. At the judging session, which included Bob Mackie, Santino Rice, Mike Ruiz, Merle Ginsberg, and Ru herself as judges, the contestants are judged on their outfits and photos.\\r\\nThe eight remaining contestants were given a mini-challenge in which they acted out certain emotions and took pictures of themselves with a digital camera. RuPaul then deemed Akashia and Ongina the winners and made them the group leaders in the next challenge, a girl group battle. The groups were each responsible for their own hair, makeup, costumes, and choreography and they each had to perform to a Destiny's Child song.\\r\\nThis week's challenge was to channel Oprah Winfrey. Each contestant was allowed to pick a costume from a bin supplied for them, choose a costume they brought, or make their own on the spot. The challenge was in three parts, representing three stages of Oprah's career. The first task was a newscaster challenge where they had to read mock news stories from a teleprompter. The next task was to try to sell products, reminiscent of Oprah on her \\"My Favorite Things\\" specials. The third task was to interview Tori Spelling and Dean McDermott.\\r\\nFor the mini-challenge, RuPaul paired everyone up and gave each person 30 minutes to do their partner's makeup, with Jade being declared the winner. The main challenge involved the girls putting together a commercial for Mac's Viva Glam makeup, a cosmetics line which Ru has once modeled for. The winner of the challenge would become the new face of Viva Glam. The girls are told they must use the commercial to explain who they are as queens, to explain why they are beautiful, and to inform people of Viva Glam's help for those living with HIV.\\r\\nFor the episode's mini-challenge, Ru brought in five female fighters to put them through an exercise and endurance challenge.

Rebecca, who won the mini-challenge, got to select her partner and whom the others had to work with. They must also coach the fighters on how to give a lip sync performance, which they would have to do to Beyonc's, \\"Freakum Dress\\".\\r\\nThe contestants met Ru on the runway for a vogue battle mini-challenge, which Nina won. For their main challenge, each contestant has to come up with three looks: Swimsuit, Executive Realness, and Evening Wear.

It was the culmination of the fighting on the Adriatic front in Italy during \\"Bloody December\\". The battle was known to those who fought it as the \\"Italian Stalingrad,\\"[6][7] for the brutality of its close-quarters combat, which was only worsened by the chaotic rubble of the town and the many booby traps used by both sides. The battle took place in the small Adriatic Sea town of Ortona, with a peacetime population of 10,000.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe British Eighth Army's offensive on the Winter Line defences east of the Apennine mountains had commenced on 23 November with the crossing of the river Sangro. By the end of the month, the main Gustav Line defences had been penetrated and the Allied troops were fighting their way forward to the next river, the Moro, 4 miles (6.4?km) north of the mouth of which lay Ortona. For the Moro crossing in early December the exhausted British 78th Infantry Division on the Allied right flank on the Adriatic coast had been relieved by the Canadian 1st Infantry Division, under Major-General Christopher Vokes.[8] By mid-December, after fierce fighting in the cold and mud, the Division's 1st Infantry Brigade had fought its way to within 2?mi (3.2?km) of Ortona and was relieved by the 2nd Infantry Brigade for the advance on the town.\\r\\n\\r\\nOrtona was of high strategic importance, as it was one of Italy's few usable deep water ports on the east coast, and was needed for docking allied ships and to shorten Eighth Army's lines of supply which at the time stretched back to Bari and Taranto. Allied forces were ordered to maintain the offensive, and going through the built-up areas in and around Ortona was the only feasible option. Ortona was part of the Winter Line defence system and the Germans had constructed a series of interlocking defensive positions in the town. Thistogether with the fact that the Germans had been ordered to \\"fight for every last house and tree\\"[9][10] made the town a formidable obstacle to any attacking force.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Canadians faced elements of the renowned German 1st Parachute Division.[Note 1] These soldiers were battle-hardened after many years of war, and defended doggedly.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe initial Canadian attack on the town was made on 20 December by Canadian 2nd Brigade's Loyal Edmonton Regiment with elements of the Seaforth Highlanders of Canada under command.[10] Meanwhile, elements of the division's 3rd Infantry Brigade launched a northerly attack to the west of the town in attempt to outflank and cut off the town's rear communications but made slow progress because of the difficult terrain and the skillful and determined German defence.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Germans also concealed various machine guns and anti-tank emplacements throughout the town, making movement by armour and infantry increasingly difficult.[11] The house-to-house fighting was vicious and the Canadians made use of a new tactic: \\"mouse-holing\\". This tactic involved using weapons such as the PIAT (or even cumbersome anti-tank guns) to breach the walls of a building, as houses within Ortona shared adjoining walls.[11] The soldiers would then throw in grenades and assault through the mouse holes, clearing the top floors and making their way down, where both adversaries struggled in repeated close-quarters combat.[10] Mouse-holing was also used to pierce through walls into adjoining rooms, sometimes catching enemy troops by surprise. The tactic would be used repeatedly as assaulting through the streets caused heavy casualties for both Canadian and German troops.[12] Throughout the battle, engineers on both sides used the brutal but effective tactic of using demolition charges to collapse entire buildings on top of enemy troops.[13]\\r\\nAfter six days of combat, 2nd Brigade's third battalion, Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry, joined the battle together with tanks from 1st Canadian Armoured Brigade's Three Rivers Regiment.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 28 December, after eight days of fighting, the depleted German troops finally withdrew from the town.

Directed by James Frawley and produced by Jim Henson, the film's screenplay was conceived by The Muppet Show writers Jerry Juhl and Jack Burns. An American and British venture produced by Henson Associates and ITC Entertainment between the first half and the second half of The Muppet Show's third season, the film depicts Kermit the Frog as he embarks on a cross-country trip to Hollywood, California. Along the way, he encounters several of the Muppetswho all share the same ambition of finding success in professional show businesswhile being pursued by Doc Hopper, an evil restaurateur with intentions of employing Kermit as a spokesperson for his frog legs business.\\r\\nNotable for its surreal humour, meta-references and prolific use of cameos, The Muppet Movie was released in the United Kingdom on May 31, 1979 and in the United States on June 22, 1979, and received critical praise; including two Academy Award nominations for Paul Williams and Kenneth Ascher's musical score and their song, \\"The Rainbow Connection\\". In 2009, the film was deemed \\"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\\" by the Library of Congress and selected for preservation in the National Film Registry.\\r\\nThe success of The Muppet Movie spawned several sequels, none of which existed in the same continuity: The Great Muppet Caper (1981), The Muppets Take Manhattan (1984), The Muppet Christmas Carol (1992), Muppet Treasure Island (1996) and Muppets from Space (1999). In 2002, the film series was given a prequel with Kermit's Swamp Years. In 2011, the film series was rebooted with The Muppets and followed by Muppets Most Wanted in 2014. However, the latter acknowledges itself as the seventh sequel to The Muppet Movie.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Muppets have gathered in a theatre, in a Hollywood film studio, to screen their new biographical film, The Muppet Movie.\\r\\nIn the film-within-a-film, Kermit the Frog enjoys a relaxing afternoon in a Florida swamp, strumming his banjo and singing \\"The Rainbow Connection\\", when he is approached by Bernie (Dom DeLuise), a Hollywood talent agent who encourages Kermit to pursue a career in show business. Inspired by the idea of \\"making millions of people happy\\", Kermit sets off on a cross-country trip to Los Angeles, but is soon pursued by entrepreneur Doc Hopper (Charles Durning) and his shy assistant Max (Austin Pendleton) in an attempt to convince Kermit to be the new spokesman of Hopper's struggling French-fried frog legs restaurant franchise, to Kermit's horror. As Kermit continuously declines his offers, Hopper resorts to increasingly vicious means of persuasion.\\r\\nMeeting Fozzie Bear, who works as a hapless comedian in the El Sleezo Cafe, Kermit invites Fozzie to accompany him. The two set out in a 1951 Studebaker loaned to Fozzie by his hibernating uncle. The duos journey includes misadventures which introduce them to a variety of eccentric human and Muppet characters, including Dr. Teeth and the Electric Mayhem and their manager Scooter, who receives a copy of the script from the pair (one of a number of self-references) at an old Presbyterian church; Gonzo, who works as a plumber, and his girlfriend Camilla the Chicken; Sweetums, who runs after them after they mistakenly think that he has turned them down at a used car lot; and the immediately love-stricken Miss Piggy at a fair.\\r\\nWhile Kermit and Miss Piggy form a relationship over dinner that night, Doc Hopper and Max kidnap Miss Piggy and use her as bait to lure Kermit into a trap. Using an electronic cerebrectomy device, scientist Professor Krassman (Mel Brooks) decides to brainwash Kermit in an attempt to force Kermit to perform in Docs commercials until an infuriated Miss Piggy knocks out Doc Hopper's henchmen and causes the scientist to be brainwashed by his own device. After receiving a job offer, however, she promptly abandons a devastated Kermit.\\r\\nAfter an incident in the theater where the projector briefly breaks down, with film tangled around the Swedish Chef, who was the projectionist, which causes Animal (a member of the Electric Mayhem) to throw a wild temper tantrum and rip off a chunk of his own seat cushion, the film starts up again. Having been joined by Rowlf the Dog and reunited with Miss Piggy, the Muppets continue their journey to Hollywood. Fozzie's 1946 Ford Woodie station wagon trade-in breaks down in the New Mexico desert. During a campfire that night, the group sadly considers that they may miss the audition the next day, and Kermit wanders off, ashamed of himself for seemingly bringing his friends on a fruitless journey. Upon consulting a more optimistic vision of himself, Kermit remembers that it was not just his friends' belief in the dream that brought them this far, but also his own faith in himself. Reinvigorated, he returns to camp to find that the Electric Mayhem and Scooter have read the script in advance, and arrived to help them the rest of the way.\\r\\nJust as it seems they are finally on their way, the group is warned by Max that Doc Hopper has hired an assassin named Snake Walker to kill Kermit. Kermit decides he will not be hunted down by a bully any longer and proposes a Western-style showdown in a nearby ghost town occupied by Dr. Bunsen Honeydew and his assistant Beaker, who invent materials that have yet to be tested. While confronting Hopper, Kermit explains his motivations, attempting to appeal to Hoppers own hopes and dreams, but Hopper is unmoved and orders his henchmen to kill him and all his friends. They are saved only when one of Dr. Bunsen's inventions, \\"insta-grow\\" pills, temporarily turns Animal into a giant, causing Hopper and his men to flee while Max turns around, laughs gleefully and waves his hat at the Muppets.\\r\\nThe Muppets proceed to Hollywood, and after getting by his secretary, Miss Tracy (Cloris Leachman), via causing her allergic reactions to their dander and fur, are hired by producer and studio executive Lew Lord (Orson Welles). The Muppets attempt to make their first movie involving a surreal pastiche of their experiences. The first take goes awry when Gonzo, holding pastiche versions of the balloons he flew away on earlier, crashes into the rainbow, breaking it in half and sending it falling onto the rest of the set, bringing it down as well, then Crazy Harry pulls two levers in the control room, which overloads the electricity circuits and causes enough of an explosion to blow a hole in the roof of the studio. However, in their stunned silence of the whole chain of events, a rainbow suddenly shines through the hole into the studio right onto the Muppets. The Muppets, joined by the characters from The Muppet Show, Sesame Street, Emmet Otter's Jug-Band Christmas, and the \\"Land of Gorch\\" segment of Saturday Night Live, sing the final verses of \\"The Rainbow Connection\\".\\r\\nAs the screening ends, Sweetums jumps through the theater's screen, having finally caught up with the other Muppets.\\r\\nFrank Oz appears in a cameo as a biker who beats up Fozzie Bear while Steve Whitmire appears as a man in the Bogen County Fair. Also, director Tim Burton is one of the puppeteers in the final shot of the film. John Landis is also in the final shot, performing Grover. Landis and Burton were both uncredited.\\r\\nThe main obstacle the filmmakers were faced with during the development of The Muppet Movie was whether the Muppets would transition seamlessly from television to film. In 1978, director James Frawley, Jim Henson, and Frank Oz filmed several camera tests outside London to test how the characters would appear in real-world locations.[4]\\r\\nTo perform Kermit static on a log, Henson squeezed into a specially designed metal container complete with an air hose (to breathe), a rubber sleeve which came out of the top to perform Kermit and a monitor to see his performance, and placed himself under the water, log, and the Kermit puppet.[5] He was also assisted in this operation by Kathryn Mullen and Steve Whitmire. This scene took five days to film.\\r\\nBefore this, no film had a hand puppet act with its entire body appearing on-screen. That is, hand puppets were only seen from the waist up, and it became a major plot point to show Kermit with legs. To have Kermit ride a bicycle in a full-body shot, a Kermit puppet with legs was posed onto the seat and his legs and arms were attached to the pedals and handlebars. An overhead crane with a marionette system held the bicycle through strong strings invisible to the camera, guiding the bicycle forward. The crane and system was out of the camera's frame of vision.[4]\\r\\nOther shots required Muppets standing and acting in a full-body shot. Specially-made, remote-controlled puppets were placed on the set and controlled by puppeteers out of the frame. A dancing Kermit and Fozzie Bear were operated by Henson and Frank Oz in front of a blue screen, and were composited onto a separate reel of the stage. Both of these effects and the bicycle effect would be used again, and refined, in subsequent Muppet films.\\r\\nAustin Pendleton recalled that the film was shot on \\"a very unhappy set, because Jim [Frawley] was very unhappy directing that movie. And I noticed that was the only time the Muppet people used an outside person to direct a Muppet movie. They never did that again. After that, it was either Jim Henson or Frank Oz. And I would have liked to have been in one of those, because those sets were very harmonious. But this was not.\\"[6] Filming locations included Albuquerque, New Mexico.[7]\\r\\nThe closing reprise of \\"Rainbow Connection\\" featured a crowd of more than 250 Muppet charactersvirtually every Muppet that had been created up to that point in time. According to Henson Archivist Karen Falk: \\"137 puppeteers were enlisted from the Puppeteers of America (along with the regular Muppet performers) to perform every Muppet extant. Prior to the day-long filming of the shot, Jim Henson gave the enthusiastic participants a lesson in the art of cinematic puppetry. Amazingly, it did take just one day.\\" The Muppet Show Fan Club newsletter answered the question of \\"How did they do it?\\" The response was \\"There are 250 puppets in the last shot of the film, and they're all moving. How? 150 puppeteers in a 6' deep, 17' wide pit, that's how. They were recruited through the Los Angeles Guild of The Puppeteers of America and almost every puppeteer west of the Rockies reported for pit duty.\\"[8] The film is dedicated to ventriloquist Edgar Bergen who appears in the movie in a cameo role and died during production in September 1978.\\r\\nThe Muppet Movie uses meta-references as a source of humor, as characters occasionally break the fourth wall to address the audience or comment on their real-life circumstances. In one scene, Kermit and Fozzie encounter Big Bird on the road, offering him a lift to Hollywood, but he declines, heading to New York City to break into public television, referencing the character's role in Sesame Street.\\r\\nIn a particularly meta-fictional plot twist, Kermit and Fozzie actually give the screenplay to Dr. Teeth, who later uses it to find and rescue them after they have been stranded in the desert.\\r\\nSeveral classic cars were specially selected by Henson for appearances in the film. The most prominent were a pair of 1951 Studebaker Commander Coupes driven by Fozzie Bear in the film. One car was painted but unmodified and driven by a person in the front seat. It was used for long, traveling shots. The second car was driven by a person in the trunk, who viewed the road through a TV set. The television received its image from a camera located in the center nose of the car's front grille. This made it possible for Frank Oz to perform Fozzie Bear in the front seat, and have the character seemingly drive the car in close-up shots. This car is now on display at the Studebaker Museum in South Bend, Indiana.\\r\\nDoc Hopper is chauffeured throughout the movie by Max in a 1959 Cadillac Fleetwood 75 Limousine.\\r\\nThe final car driven by the Muppets is a 1946 Ford Woodie station wagon, famous for its wood panel siding and a valuable collectible.\\r\\nThe film's music was written by Kenneth Ascher and Paul Williams. Regarding the music's composition, Williams said; \\"Jim Henson gave you more [creative] freedom than anybody I've ever worked with in my life. I said, 'You want to hear the songs as we're writing them?' He said, 'No. I'll hear them in the studio. I know I'm gonna love them.' You just don't get that kind of freedom on a project these days.\\"[9]\\r\\n\\"Movin' Right Along\\", \\"Never Before, Never Again\\", and \\"I Hope That Somethin' Better Comes Along\\" were shortened in the film, compared to their soundtrack versions, for continuity purposes. The latter, a duet between Rowlf and Kermit, contained references that the studio considered too mature for children, although the song appeared complete in the British theatrical and home video debut versions. In \\"Finale: The Magic Store\\", a line performed by Kermit in the film is sung by Fozzie on the soundtrack recording.\\r\\nThe film proved to be a huge hit at the box office during the summer of 1979 and ended up grossing $76,657,000 domestically[2][3] (adjusted for inflation, this would equal $265,703,546 in 2016 dollars), making it the seventh highest-grossing film of 1979 and also, the second highest-grossing Muppet film after the release of The Muppets in 2011. The success of the film gave Jim Henson Productions an opportunity to release more Muppet productions theatrically.\\r\\nThe film's successful theatrical release encouraged Lew Grade into furthering his own film distribution company, which later backfired with the massive box office failures of Can't Stop the Music (from EMI) and Raise the Titanic (from ITC), both released by Associated Film Distribution just a year later.[10]\\r\\nThe Muppet Movie received positive reviews. The film holds an 87% approval rating on aggregate review site Rotten Tomatoes with an average score of 8/10, based on 47 reviews. The site's consensus says \\"The Muppet Movie, the big-screen debut of Jim Henson's plush creations, is smart, lighthearted, and fun for all ages.\\"[11]\\r\\nRoger Ebert of The Chicago Sun-Times gave the film three-and-a-half out of four stars. In his favorable review, he was fascinated that \\"The Muppet Movie not only stars the Muppets but, for the first time, shows us their feet.\\"[12] Vincent Canby of The New York Times offered equal praise, stating that the film \\"demonstrates once again that there's always room in movies for unbridled amiability when it's governed by intelligence and wit.\\"[13]\\r\\nIn 2009, it was named to the National Film Registry by the Library of Congress for being culturally, historically or aesthetically significant and will be preserved for all time.[14]\\r\\nThe Muppet Movie was the first film from ITC Entertainment to be released on home video when Magnetic Video issued it in January 1980, having acquired the video rights to ITC's films. It was reissued a few times more by CBS/Fox Video before it was released by Jim Henson Video in 1993. The movie was reissued on VHS by Columbia Tristar Home Video and Jim Henson Home Entertainment in June, 1999. The film's first DVD release was from Sony Pictures Home Entertainment and Jim Henson Home Entertainment on June 5, 2001. It was re-released by Walt Disney Home Entertainment on DVD and reissued as a Walt Disney Pictures release on November 29, 2005 as Kermit's 50th Anniversary Edition.\\r\\nWalt Disney Studios Home Entertainment released The Muppet Movie as the Nearly 35th Anniversary Edition on Blu-ray Disc and DVD on August 13, 2013.[17]","input":"What kind of car does fozzie bear drive?"},{"output":"clergy house","context":"A clergy house is the residence, or former residence, of one or more priests or ministers of religion.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nClergy houses are typically owned and maintained by a church, as a benefit to its clergy. The practice exists in many denominations because of the tendency of clergy to be transferred from one church to another at relatively frequent intervals. Catholic clergy houses in particular may be lived in by several priests from a parish. Clergy houses frequently serve as the administrative office of the local parish as well as a residence; they are normally located next to, or at least close to, the church their occupant serves.\\r\\nPartly because of the general conservationism of churches, many clergy houses are of historic interest or even importance. In the United Kingdom the 14th-century Alfriston Clergy House was the first property to be acquired by the National Trust. It was purchased in a state of near ruin in 1896 for S10, the vicarage having moved elsewhere long before.[1]\\r\\nIn some countries where the clergy houses were often rather grand they have now been sold off by the churches, exchanged for more modest properties. In England the \\"Old Vicarage\\" or \\"Old Rectory\\" is very common in villages, as a comfortable home for the upper middle-classes, and in Scotland the \\"Old Manse\\". Others are now offices or used for various functions. In Poland they call it \\"Plebania\\".\\r\\nThere are a number of more specific terms whose use depends on the rank of the occupant, the denomination and the locality.

Other titles may have different names for their houses.\\r\\nA rectory is the residence, or former residence, of an ecclesiastical rector, although also in some cases an academic rector (e.g. a Scottish university rector) or other person with that title.

Colostrum contains antibodies to protect the newborn against disease. In general, protein concentration in colostrum is substantially higher than in milk.  Fat concentration is substantially higher in colostrum than in milk in some species, e.g. sheep[4][5][6] and horses,[7][8]  but lower in colostrum than in milk in some other species, e.g. camels[9] and humans.[10] In swine,  fat concentration of milk at 48 to 72 hours after parturition may be higher than in colostrum or in late-lactation milk.[11]  Fat concentration in bovine colostrum is extremely variable.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nNewborns have very immature and small  digestive systems, and colostrum delivers its nutrients in a very concentrated low-volume form. It has a mild laxative effect, encouraging the passing of the baby's first stool, which is called meconium.  This clears excess bilirubin, a waste-product of dead red blood cells, which is produced in large quantities at birth due to blood volume reduction from the infant's body and helps prevent jaundice. Colostrum is known to contain immune cells (as lymphocytes)[13][14] and many antibodies such as IgA,  IgG, and IgM.  These are some of the components of the adaptive immune system.  In preterm infants some IgA may be absorbed through the intestinal epithelium and enter the blood stream though there is very little uptake in full term babies.[15]  This is due to the early \\"closure\\" of the intestinal epithelium to large molecule uptake in humans unlike the case in cattle which continue to uptake immunoglobulin from milk shortly after birth.  Other immune components of colostrum include the major components of the innate immune system, such as lactoferrin,[16] lysozyme,[17] lactoperoxidase,[18] complement,[19] and proline-rich polypeptides (PRP).[20] A number of cytokines (small messenger peptides that control the functioning of the immune system) are found in colostrum as well,[21] including interleukins,[21] tumor necrosis factor,[22] chemokines,[23] and others. Colostrum also contains a number of growth factors, such as insulin-like growth factors I (IGF-1),[24] and II,[25] transforming growth factors alpha,[26] beta 1 and beta 2,[27][28] fibroblast growth factors,[29] epidermal growth factor,[30] granulocyte-macrophage-stimulating growth factor,[31] platelet-derived growth factor,[31] vascular endothelial growth factor,[32] and colony-stimulating factor-1.[33]\\r\\n\\r\\nNotably in humans a lack of colostrum production is linked to a mutation in the ABCC11 gene that occurs in most people of East Asian descent. This gene is also one the determining factors in wet or dry type earwax, as the mammary glands are a form of apocrine gland.[34]\\r\\n\\r\\nColostrum is crucial for newborn farm animals.  They receive no passive transfer of immunity via the placenta before birth, so any antibodies that they need have to be ingested (unless supplied by injection or other artificial means). The ingested antibodies are absorbed from the intestine of the neonate.[35][36][37][38][39]  The newborn animal must receive colostrum within 6 hours of being born for maximal absorption of colostral antibodies to occur. Recent studies indicate that colostrum should be fed to bovines within the first thirty minutes to maximize IgG absorption rates.[40]\\r\\n\\r\\nColostrum varies in quality and quantity. In the dairy industry, the quality of colostrum is measured as the amount of IgG (Immunoglobulin G) per liter. It is recommended that newborn calves receive at least 4 quarts (liters) of colostrum with each containing at least 50 grams of IgG/liter. Testing of colostral quality can be done by multitude of devices including colostrometer, optical refractometer or digital refractometer. Mature dairy cattle produce an average of 33 liters of colostrum in the first milking after calving.[41]\\r\\n\\r\\nLivestock breeders commonly bank colostrum from their animals. Colostrum can be stored frozen but it does lose some of its inherent quality. Colostrum produced on a breeder's own premises is considered to be superior to colostrum from other sources, because it is produced by animals already exposed to (and, thus, making antibodies to) pathogens occurring on the premises. A German study reported that multiparous mares produced on average a liter (quart) of colostrum containing 70?grams of IgG.[42]\\r\\nIn most dairy cow herds, the calves are removed from their mothers soon after birth and fed colostrum from a bottle.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough many claims of health benefits have been made for colostrum consumption in adults, until recently there have been limited randomized trials to support these assertions. It is probable that little absorption of intact growth factors and antibodies into the bloodstream occurs, due to digestion in the gastrointestinal tract.  However, the presence of casein and other buffering proteins does allow growth factors and other bioactive molecules to pass into the lumen of the small intestine intact, where they can stimulate repair and inhibit microbes, working via local effects.[43] This provides a probable mechanism explaining the positive results of colostrum on adult gut health in several recent well controlled published studies.[44][45][46][47] Evidence for the beneficial effect of colostrum on extra-gastrointestinal problems is less well developed, due in part to the limited number of randomised double-blind studies published, although a variety of possible uses have been suggested.[48][49][50]\\r\\n\\r\\nDairy cattle are naturally exposed to pathogens and produce immunoglobulins against them. These antibodies are present in the cows bloodstream and in the colostrum. These immunoglobulins are specific to many human pathogens, including Escherichia coli, Cryptosporidium parvum, Shigella flexneri, Salmonella species, Staphylococcus species,[51] and rotavirus (which causes diarrhea in infants). Before the development of antibiotics, colostrum was the main source of immunoglobulins used to fight bacteria. In fact, when Albert Sabin made his first oral vaccine against polio, the immunoglobulin he used came from bovine colostrum.[52] When antibiotics began to appear, interest in colostrum waned, but, now that antibiotic-resistant strains of pathogens have developed, interest is once again returning to natural alternatives to antibiotics, namely, colostrum.[53]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe gut plays several important roles including acting as the main pathway for fluid, electrolyte and nutrient absorption while also acting as a barrier to toxic agents present in the gut lumen including acid, digestive enzymes and gut bacteria. It is also a major immunological defence mechanism, detecting natural commensals and triggering immune response when toxic microbes are present. Failure of homeostasis due to trauma, drugs and infectious microbes not only damages the gut but can lead to influx of damaging agents into the bloodstream. These mechanisms have relevance for multiple conditions affecting all areas of the world and socioeconomic groups such as ulcers, inflammation, and infectious diarrhoea.[54] There is currently much interest in the potential value of colostrum for the prevention and treatment of these conditions as it is derived from natural sources and can influence damaging factors through multiple pathways including nutritional support, immunological intervention (through its immunoglobulin and other anti-microbial factors) and growth/healing factor constituents.[55] As pointed out by Kelly, inconsistency between results in some published studies may be due in part to variation in dose given and to the timing of the colostrum collection being tested (first milking versus pooled colostrum collected up to day 5 following calving).[56]\\r\\n\\r\\nSome athletes have used colostrum in an attempt to improve their performance,[57] decrease recovery time,[58] and prevent sickness during peak performance levels.[59][60] Supplementation with bovine colostrum, 20 grams per day (g/d), in combination with exercise training for 8 wk may increase bone-free lean body mass in active men and women.[57][61]\\r\\n\\r\\nLow IGF-1 levels may be associated with dementia in the very elderly, although causation has not been established.[62] People with eating disorders also have low levels of IGF-1 due to malnutrition,[63] as do obese individuals.[64] Supplementation with colostrum, which is rich in IGF-1, can be a useful part of a weight reduction program.[citation needed] Although IGF-1 is not absorbed intact by the body, some studies suggest it stimulates the production of IGF-1 when taken as a supplement[65] whereas others do not[66]\\r\\n\\r\\nColostrum also has antioxidant components, such as lactoferrin[67] and hemopexin, which binds free heme in the body.[68]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Isle of Man had a local delicacy called \\"Groosniuys\\", a pudding made with colostrum.[69]\\r\\n\\r\\nHyperimmune colostrum was an early attempt to boost the effectiveness of natural bovine colostrum by immunizing cows with a specific pathogen and then collecting the colostrum after the cow gave birth.  This initially appeared very promising as antibodies did appear towards the specific pathogens or antigens that were used in the original challenge.  However, upon closer examination and comparison, it was found that IgG levels in natural colostrum towards 19 specific human pathogens were just as high as in hyperimmune colostrum, and natural colostrum nearly always had higher antibody titers than did the hyperimmune version.[51]\\r\\n\\r\\nThese small immune signaling peptides (PRPs) were independently discovered in colostrum and other sources, such as blood plasma, in the United States,[70] Czechoslovakia and Poland.[71] Hence they appear under various names in the literature, including Colostrinin, CLN, transfer factor and PRP.  They function as signal transducing molecules that have the unique effect of modulating the immune system, turning it up when the body comes under attack from pathogens or other disease agents, and damping it when the danger is eliminated or neutralized.[72] At first thought to actually transfer immunity from one immune system to another, it now appears that PRPs simply stimulate cell-mediated immunity.[73]","input":"What is the first milk after birth called?"},{"output":"Lewis Burwell \\"Chesty\\" Puller","context":"Banana Wars\\r\\nWorld War II\\r\\nKorean War\\r\\nLewis Burwell \\"Chesty\\" Puller (June 26, 1898 ÿ October 11, 1971) was a United States Marine Corps lieutenant general who fought guerrillas in Haiti and Nicaragua, in World War II and the Korean War.\\r\\nPuller is the most decorated Marine in American history. He is one of two U.S. servicemen awarded five Navy Crosses and one Army Distinguished Service Cross. Puller's six Crosses are next in number to the eight times Eddie Rickenbacker received the nation's second-highest military award for valor.[1]\\r\\nIn 1955 (after 37 years of service), Lieutenant General Puller retired from the Marine Corps. He lived in Virginia and died in 1971, at age 73.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPuller was born in West Point, Virginia, to Matthew and Martha Puller. His father was a grocer who died when Lewis was 10 years old. Puller grew up listening to old veterans' tales of the American Civil War and idolizing Thomas \\"Stonewall\\" Jackson. He wanted to enlist in the United States Army to fight in the Border War with Mexico in 1916, but he was too young and could not get parental consent from his mother.[2]\\r\\nThe following year, Puller attended the Virginia Military Institute but left in August 1918 as World War I was still ongoing, saying that he wanted to \\"go where the guns are!\\"[3] Inspired by the 5th Marines at Belleau Wood, he enlisted in the United States Marine Corps as a private and attended boot camp at the Marine Corps Recruit Depot, Parris Island, South Carolina.[2]\\r\\nAlthough he never saw action in that war, the Marine Corps was expanding, and soon after graduating he attended their non-commissioned officer school and Officer Candidates School (OCS) at Quantico, Virginia, following that. Graduating from OCS on June 16, 1919, Puller was appointed a second lieutenant in the reserves, but the reduction in force from 73,000 to 1,100 officers and 27,400 men[4] following the war led to his being put on inactive status 10 days later and given the rank of corporal.[2]\\r\\nCorporal Puller received orders to serve in the Gendarmerie d'Haiti as a lieutenant, seeing action in Haiti.[5] While the United States was working under a treaty with Haiti, he participated in over forty engagements during the ensuing five years against the Caco rebels and attempted to regain his commission as an officer twice. In 1922, he served as an adjutant to Major Alexander Vandegrift, a future Commandant of the Marine Corps.\\r\\nPuller returned stateside and was finally recommissioned as a second lieutenant on March 6, 1924 (Service No. 03158), afterward completing assignments at the Marine Barracks in Norfolk, Virginia, The Basic School in Quantico, Virginia, and with the 10th Marine Artillery Regiment in Quantico, Virginia. He was assigned to the Marine Barracks at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, in July 1926 and in San Diego, California, in 1928.\\r\\nIn December 1928, Puller was assigned to the Nicaraguan National Guard detachment, where he was awarded his first Navy Cross for his actions from February 16 to August 19, 1930, when he led \\"five successive engagements against superior numbers of armed bandit forces.\\" He returned stateside in July 1931 and completed the year-long Company Officers Course at Fort Benning, Georgia, thereafter returning to Nicaragua from September 20 to October 1, 1932, and was awarded a second Navy Cross. Puller led American Marines and Nicaraguan National Guardsmen into battle against Sandinista rebels in the last major engagement of the Sandino Rebellion near El Sauce on December 26, 1932.\\r\\nAfter his service in Nicaragua, Puller was assigned to the Marine detachment at the American Legation in Beijing, China, commanding a unit of China Marines. He then went on to serve aboard USS?Augusta, a cruiser in the Asiatic Fleet, which was commanded by then-Captain Chester W. Nimitz. Puller returned to the States in June 1936 as an instructor at The Basic School in Philadelphia, where he trained Ben Robertshaw, Pappy Boyington, and Lew Walt.[6]\\r\\nIn May 1939, he returned to the Augusta as commander of the on-board Marine detachment, and then back to China, disembarking in Shanghai in May 1940 to serve as the executive officer and commanding officer of 2nd Battalion, 4th Marines (2/4) until August 1941. Major Puller returned to the U.S. on August 28, 1941. After a short leave, he was given command of 1st Battalion, 7th Marines (1/7) of the 1st Marine Division, stationed at New River, North Carolina (later Camp Lejeune).[7]\\r\\nEarly in the Pacific theater, the 7th Marines formed the nucleus of the newly created 3rd Marine Brigade and arrived to defend Samoa on May 8, 1942. Later they were redeployed from the brigade and on September 4, 1942, they left Samoa and rejoined the 1st Division at Guadalcanal on September 18, 1942.\\r\\nSoon after arriving on Guadalcanal, Lt. Col. Puller led his battalion in a fierce action along the Matanikau, in which Puller's quick thinking saved three of his companies from annihilation. In the action, these companies were surrounded and cut off by a larger Japanese force. Puller ran to the shore, signaled a United States Navy destroyer, the USS Ballard (DD-267),[8] and then Puller directed the destroyer to provide fire support while landing craft rescued his Marines from their precarious position. U.S. Coast Guard Signalman First Class Douglas Albert MunroOfficer-in-Charge of the group of landing craft, was killed while providing covering fire from his landing craft for the Marines as they evacuated the beach and was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor for the action, to date the only Coast Guardsman to receive the decoration. Puller, for his actions, was awarded the Bronze Star Medal with Combat \\"V\\".\\r\\nLater on Guadalcanal, Puller was awarded his third Navy Cross, in what was later known as the \\"Battle for Henderson Field\\". Puller commanded 1st Battalion 7th Marines (1/7), one of two American infantry units defending the airfield against a regiment-strength Japanese force. The 3rd Battalion of the U.S. Army's 164th Infantry Regiment (3/164) fought alongside the Marines. In a firefight on the night of October 24ÿ25, 1942, lasting about three hours, 1/7 and 3/164 sustained 70 casualties; the Japanese force suffered over 1,400 killed in action, and the Americans held the airfield. He nominated two of his men (one being Sgt. John Basilone) for Medals of Honor. He was wounded himself on November 9.\\r\\nPuller was then made executive officer of the 7th Marine Regiment. While serving in this capacity at Cape Gloucester, Puller was awarded his fourth Navy Cross for overall performance of duty between December 26, 1943, and January 19, 1944. During this time, when the battalion commanders of 3rd Battalion, 7th Marines (3/7) and later, 3rd Battalion, 5th Marines (3/5), were under heavy machine gun and mortar fire, he expertly reorganized the battalion and led the successful attack against heavily fortified Japanese defensive positions. He was promoted to colonel effective February 1, 1944, and by the end of the month had been named commander of the 1st Marine Regiment. In September and October 1944, Puller led the 1st Marine Regiment into the protracted battle on Peleliu, one of the bloodiest battles in Marine Corps history, and received his first of two Legion of Merit awards. The 1st Marines under Puller's command lost 1,749 out of approximately 3,000 men, but these losses did not stop Puller from ordering frontal assaults against the well-entrenched enemy. The corps commander had to order the 1st Marine Division commanding general to pull the annihilated 1st Marine Regiment out of the line.[9]\\r\\nDuring the summer of 1944, Puller's younger brother, Samuel D. Puller, the Executive Officer of the 4th Marine Regiment, was killed by an enemy sniper on Guam.[10]\\r\\nPuller returned to the United States in November 1944, was named executive officer of the Infantry Training Regiment at Camp Lejeune and, two weeks later, Commanding Officer. After the war, he was made Director of the 8th Reserve District at New Orleans, and later commanded the Marine Barracks at Pearl Harbor.\\r\\nAt the outbreak of the Korean War, Puller was once again assigned as commander of the First Marine Regiment. He participated in the landing at Inchon on September 15, 1950, and was awarded the Silver Star Medal.[11] For leadership from September 15 through November 2, he was awarded his second Legion of Merit. He was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross from the U.S. Army for heroism in action from November 29 to December 4, and his fifth Navy Cross for heroism during December 5ÿ10, 1950, at the Battle of Chosin Reservoir. It was during that battle that he said the famous line, \\"We've been looking for the enemy for some time now. We've finally found him. We're surrounded. That simplifies things.\\"[12]\\r\\nIn January 1951, Puller was promoted to brigadier general and was assigned duty as assistant division commander (ADC) of the 1st Marine Division. On February 24, however, his immediate superior, Major General O.P. Smith, was hastily transferred to command IX Corps when its Army commander, Major General Bryant Moore, died. Smith's transfer left Puller temporarily in command of the 1st Marine Division until sometime in March. He completed his tour of duty as assistant commander and left for the United States on May 20, 1951.[13] He took command of the 3rd Marine Division at Camp Pendleton, California until January 1952, and then was assistant commander of the division until June 1952. He then took over Troop Training Unit Pacific at Coronado, California. In September 1953, he was promoted to major general.\\r\\nIn July 1954, Puller took command of the 2nd Marine Division at Camp Lejeune, North Carolina until February 1955 when he became Deputy Camp Commander. He suffered a stroke,[14] and was retired by the Marine Corps on November 1, 1955 with a tombstone promotion to lieutenant general.[15]\\r\\nRegarding his nickname, in a handwritten addition to a typed 22 November 1954 letter to Maj. Frank C. Sheppard, Puller wrote, \\"I agree with you 100%. I had done a little soldiering previous to Guadalcanal and had been called a lot of names, but why Chesty? Especially the steel part??\\"[16]\\r\\nPuller's son, Lewis Burwell Puller, Jr. (generally known as Lewis Puller), served as a Marine lieutenant in the Vietnam War. While serving with 2nd Battalion, 1st Marines (2/1), Lewis Jr. was severely wounded by a mine explosion, losing both legs and parts of his hands. Lieutenant General Puller broke down sobbing at seeing his son for the first time in the hospital.[17] Lewis Jr. won a 1992 Pulitzer Prize for his autobiography Fortunate Son: The Healing of a Vietnam Vet.\\r\\nPuller was father-in-law to Colonel William H. Dabney, USMC (Retired), a Virginia Military Institute (VMI) graduate, who was the commanding officer (then Captain) of two heavily reinforced rifle companies of the Third Battalion, Twenty-Sixth Marines (3/26) from January 21 to April 14, 1968 in Vietnam. During the entire period, Colonel Dabney's force stubbornly defended Hill 881S, a regional outpost vital to the defense of the Khe Sanh Combat Base during the 77-day siege. Following Khe Sanh, Dabney was recommended for the Navy Cross for his actions on Hill 881 South, but his battalion executive officer's helicopter carrying the recommendation papers crashedand the papers were lost. It was not until April 15, 2005, that Colonel Dabney received the Navy Cross during an award ceremony at Virginia Military Institute.\\r\\nPuller was a distant cousin to the famous U.S. Army General George S. Patton.[18]\\r\\nHe was an Episcopalian and parishioner of Christ Church Parish and is buried in the historic cemetery next to his wife Virginia Montague Evans.[19]\\r\\nPuller received the second-highest U.S. military award six times (one of only two persons so honored): five Navy Crosses and one U.S. Army Distinguished Service Cross. He was the second of two U.S. servicemen to ever receive five Navy Crosses, U.S. Navy submarine commander Roy Milton Davenport was the first to receive five Navy Crosses.\\r\\nPuller's military awards include:\\r\\nCitation:\\r\\n\\"For distinguished service in the line of his profession while commanding a Nicaraguan National Guard patrol. First Lieutenant Lewis B.

Puller, United States Marine Corps (Captain, Guardia Nacional de Nicaragua) performed exceptionally meritorious service in a duty of great responsibility while in command of a Guardia Patrol from 20 September to 1 October 1932. Lieutenant Puller and his command of forty Guardia and Gunnery Sergeant William A. Lee, United States Marine Corps, serving as a First Lieutenant in the Guardia, penetrated the isolated mountainous bandit territory for a distance of from eighty to one hundred miles north of Jinotega, his nearest base. This patrol was ambushed on 26 September 1932, at a point northeast of Mount Kilambe by an insurgent force of one hundred fifty in a well-prepared position armed with not less than seven automatic weapons and various classes of small arms and well-supplied with ammunition. Early in the combat, Gunnery Sergeant Lee, the Second in Command, was seriously wounded and reported as dead. The Guardia immediately behind Lieutenant Puller in the point was killed by the first burst of fire, Lieutenant Puller, with great courage, coolness and display of military judgment, so directed the fire and movement of his men that the enemy were driven first from the high ground on the right of his position, and then by a flanking movement forced from the high ground to the left and finally were scattered in confusion with a loss of ten killed and many wounded by the persistent and well-directed attack of the patrol. The numerous casualties suffered by the enemy and the Guardia losses of two killed and four wounded are indicative of the severity of the enemy resistance. This signal victory in jungle country, with no lines of communication and a hundred miles from any supporting force, was largely due to the indomitable courage and persistence of the patrol commander. Returning with the wounded to Jinotega, the patrol was ambushed twice by superior forces on 30 September.

The park is adjacent to the Colorado River, 4 miles (6?km) north of Moab, Utah. More than 2,000 natural sandstone arches are located in the park, including the well-known Delicate Arch, as well as a variety of unique geological resources and formations. The park contains the highest density of natural arches in the world.[3][4]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe park consists of 76,679 acres (119.811?sq?mi; 31,031?ha; 310.31?km2) of high desert located on the Colorado Plateau.[5] The highest elevation in the park is 5,653 feet (1,723?m) at Elephant Butte, and the lowest elevation is 4,085 feet (1,245?m) at the visitor center. The park receives an average of less than 10 inches (250?mm) of rain annually.\\r\\n\\r\\nAdministered by the National Park Service, the area was originally named a national monument on April 12, 1929, and was redesignated as a national park on November 12, 1971.[6] The park is expected to receive 1.8 million visitors in 2018.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe national park lies above an underground evaporite layer or salt bed, which is the main cause of the formation of the arches, spires, balanced rocks, sandstone fins, and eroded monoliths in the area. This salt bed is thousands of feet thick in places, and was deposited in the Paradox Basin of the Colorado Plateau some 300 million years ago when a sea flowed into the region and eventually evaporated. Over millions of years, the salt bed was covered with debris eroded from the Uncompahgre Uplift to the northeast. During the Early Jurassic (about 210 Ma) desert conditions prevailed in the region and the vast Navajo Sandstone was deposited. An additional sequence of stream laid and windblown sediments, the Entrada Sandstone (about 140 Ma), was deposited on top of the Navajo. Over 5,000 feet (1,500 m) of younger sediments were deposited and have been mostly eroded away. Remnants of the cover exist in the area including exposures of the Cretaceous Mancos Shale. The arches of the area are developed mostly within the Entrada formation.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe weight of this cover caused the salt bed below it to liquefy and thrust up layers of rock into salt domes. The evaporites of the area formed more unusual salt anticlines or linear regions of uplift.[8] Faulting occurred and whole sections of rock subsided into the areas between the domes. In some places, they turned almost on edge. The result of one such 2,500-foot (760?m) displacement, the Moab Fault, is seen from the visitor center.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs this subsurface movement of salt shaped the landscape, erosion removed the younger rock layers from the surface. Except for isolated remnants, the major formations visible in the park today are the salmon-colored Entrada Sandstone, in which most of the arches form, and the buff-colored Navajo Sandstone. These are visible in layer cake fashion throughout most of the park. Over time, water seeped into the surface cracks, joints, and folds of these layers. Ice formed in the fissures, expanding and putting pressure on surrounding rock, breaking off bits and pieces. Winds later cleaned out the loose particles. A series of free-standing fins remained. Wind and water attacked these fins until, in some, the cementing material gave way and chunks of rock tumbled out. Many damaged fins collapsed. Others, with the right degree of hardness and balance, survived despite their missing sections. These became the famous arches.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough the park's terrain may appear rugged and durable, it is extremely fragile. More than 1 million visitors each year threaten the fragile high desert ecosystem.[9] The problem lies within the soil's crust which is composed of cyanobacteria, algae, fungi, and lichens that grow in the dusty parts of the park. Factors that make Arches National Park sensitive to visitor damage include: semiarid region, and the scarce, unpredictable rainfall, lack of deep freezing, and lack of plant litter which results in soils that have both a low resistance to, and slow recovery from, compressional forces such as foot traffic. Methods of indicating effects on the soil are cytophobic soil crust index, measuring of water infiltration, and t-tests that are used to compare the values from the undisturbed and disturbed areas.[10]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHumans have occupied the region since the last ice age 10,000 years ago. Fremont people and Ancient Pueblo People lived in the area up until about 700 years ago. Spanish missionaries encountered Ute and Paiute tribes in the area when they first came through in 1775, but the first European-Americans to attempt settlement in the area were the Mormon Elk Mountain Mission in 1855, who soon abandoned the area. Ranchers, farmers, and prospectors later settled Moab in the neighboring Riverine Valley in the 1880s. Word of the beauty of the surrounding rock formations spread beyond the settlement as a possible tourist destination.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Arches area was first brought to the attention of the National Park Service by Frank A. Wadleigh, passenger traffic manager of the Denver and Rio Grande Western Railroad. Wadleigh, accompanied by railroad photographer George L. Beam, visited the area in September 1923 at the invitation of Alexander Ringhoffer, a Hungarian-born prospector living in Salt Valley. Ringhoffer had written to the railroad in an effort to interest them in the tourist potential of a scenic area he had discovered the previous year with his two sons and a son-in-law, which he called the \\"Devil's Garden\\" (known today as the \\"Klondike Bluffs\\"). Wadleigh was impressed by what Ringhoffer showed him, and suggested to Park Service director Stephen T. Mather that the area be made a national monument.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe following year, additional support for the monument idea came from Laurence Gould, a University of Michigan graduate student (and future polar explorer) studying the geology of the nearby La Sal Mountains, who was shown the scenic area by local physician Dr. J. W. \\"Doc\\" Williams.\\r\\n\\r\\nA succession of government investigators examined the area, in part due to confusion as to the precise location. In the process, the name \\"Devil's Garden\\" was transposed to an area on the opposite side of Salt Valley, and Ringhoffer's original discovery was omitted, while another area nearby, known locally as \\"The Windows\\", was included. Designation of the area as a national monument was supported by the Park Service from 1926, but was resisted by President Calvin Coolidge's Interior Secretary, Hubert Work. Finally in April 1929, shortly after his inauguration, President Herbert Hoover signed a presidential proclamation creating Arches National Monument, consisting of two comparatively small, disconnected sections. The purpose of the reservation under the 1906 Antiquities Act was to protect the arches, spires, balanced rocks, and other sandstone formations for their scientific and educational value. The name \\"Arches\\" was suggested by Frank Pinkely, superintendent of the Park Service's southwestern national monuments, following a visit to the Windows section in 1925.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn late 1938, President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed a proclamation which enlarged Arches to protect additional scenic features and permit development of facilities to promote tourism. A small adjustment was made by President Dwight Eisenhower in 1960 to accommodate a new road alignment.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn early 1969, just before leaving office, President Lyndon B. Johnson signed a proclamation substantially enlarging Arches. Two years later, President Richard Nixon signed legislation enacted by Congress which significantly reduced the total area enclosed, but changed its status to a national park.\\r\\n\\r\\nClimbing Balanced Rock or any named or unnamed arch in Arches National Park with an opening of more than 3 feet is banned by park regulations. Climbing on other features in the park is allowed, but regulated; in addition, slacklining and BASE jumping are banned parkwide.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nClimbing on named arches within the park had long been banned by park regulations, but following Dean Potter's successful free climb on Delicate Arch in May 2006, the wording of the regulations was deemed unenforceable by the park attorney. In response, the park revised its regulations later that month,[13]\\r\\neventually imposing the current ban on arch climbing in 2014.[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nApproved recreational activities include auto touring, backpacking, biking, camping, and hiking, some of which require permits. Guided commercial tours and ranger programs are also available.\\r\\n\\r\\nAstronomy is also popular in the park due to its dark skies despite the increasing light pollution from towns like Moab.[15][16]\\r\\n\\r\\nAmerican writer Edward Abbey was a park ranger at Arches National Monument where he kept journals that became his book Desert Solitaire. The success of this book, as well as the rise in adventure-based recreation, has drawn many hikers, mountain-bikers, and off-road enthusiasts to the area, but activities are limited within park boundaries: camping, foot hiking (along designated trails), and driving only along marked roads. The Hayduke Trail, an 825-mile (1,328?km) backpacking route named after one of Edward Abbey's characters, begins in the park.\\r\\n\\r\\nArches National Park is the subject of the third 2014 quarter of the U.S. Mint's America the Beautiful quarters coin program commemorating national parks and historic sites.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is an abundance of wildlife in Arches. The list includes: spadefoot toad, antelope squirrel, scrub jay, peregrine falcon, many kinds of sparrows, red fox, desert bighorn sheep, kangaroo rat, mule deer, cougar, midget faded rattlesnake, yucca moth, western rattlesnake, and the collared lizard.[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nPlants also dominate the landscape in the park. The list of plants includes: prickly pear cactus, Indian ricegrass, bunch grasses, cheatgrass, lichen, moss, liverworts, Utah juniper, Mormon tea, blackbrush, cliffrose, four-winged saltbrush, pinyon pine, evening primrose, sand verbena, yucca, and sacred datura.[18]\\r\\n\\r\\nBiological soil crust consisting of cyanobacteria, lichen, mosses, green algae, and microfungi is found throughout southeastern Utah. The fibrous growths help keep soil particles together, creating a layer that is more resistant to erosion. The living soil layer readily absorbs and stores water, allowing more complex forms of plant life to grow in places with low precipitation levels.[19]\\r\\n\\r\\nAmong the notable features of the park are:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCourthouse Towers area from the La Sal Mountains viewpoint\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Three Gossips\\r\\n\\r\\nDark Angel\\r\\n\\r\\nBroken Arch\\r\\n\\r\\nDouble Arch\\r\\n\\r\\nDouble O Arch\\r\\n\\r\\nGarden of Eden\\r\\n\\r\\nLandscape Arch\\r\\n\\r\\nNavajo Arch\\r\\n\\r\\nSkyline Arch\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Windows\\r\\n\\r\\nPartion Arch\\r\\n\\r\\nPine Tree Arch\\r\\n\\r\\nTunnel Arch\\r\\n\\r\\nSand Dune Arch","input":"When did arches national park become a national park?"},{"output":"early 1990s","context":"Pensions in the United Kingdom fall into three major divisions and 7 sub-divisions, including both defined-benefit and defined-contribution:\\r\\nPersonal accounts, automatic enrolment and the minimum employer contribution will be new policies joining these from 2012.[1]\\r\\nAutomatic enrolment has been successful but there are a number of myths[2] remaining around the scheme, which professional bodies and companies are working to eradicate.\\r\\nThe state provides basic pension provision intended to prevent poverty in old age. Until 2010 men over the age of 65 and women over the age of 60 were entitled to claim state pension; from April 2010 the age for women is gradually being harmonised to match that for men.[3] Longer-term, the retirement age for both men and women will rise to 68 by no later than 2046[4] and possibly much earlier.\\r\\nThe basic state pension, then known as the \\"Old Age Pension\\" was introduced in the United Kingdom (which included all of Ireland at that time) in January 1909. A pension of 5 shillings per week (25p, equivalent, using the Consumer Price Index, to S24 in present-day terms),[5] or 7s.6d per week (equivalent to S36 today) for a married couple, was payable to a person with an income below S21 per annum (equivalent to S2000 today), following the passage of the Old Age Pensions Act 1908. The qualifying age was 70, and the pensions were subject to a means test.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nUntil the 20th century, poverty was seen as a quasi-criminal state, and this was reflected in the Vagabonds and Beggars Act 1495 that imprisoned beggars. During Elizabethan times, English poor laws represented a shift whereby the poor were seen merely as morally degenerate, and were expected to perform forced labour in workhouses.\\r\\nThe beginning of the modern state pension was the Old Age Pensions Act 1908, that provided 5 shillings (S0.25) a week for those over 70 whose annual means did not exceed S31 10s. (S31.50). It coincided with the Royal Commission on the Poor Laws and Relief of Distress 1905-09 and was the first step in the Liberal welfare reforms to the completion of a system of social security, with unemployment and health insurance through the National Insurance Act 1911.\\r\\nAfter the war, the National Insurance Act 1946 completed universal coverage of social security. The National Assistance Act 1948 formally abolished the poor law, and gave a minimum income to those not paying national insurance.\\r\\nThe early 1990s established the existing framework for state pensions in the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992 and Superannuation and other Funds (Validation) Act 1992. Following the highly respected Goode Report, occupational pensions were covered by comprehensive statutes in the Pension Schemes Act 1993 and the Pensions Act 1995.\\r\\nIn 2002 the Pensions Commission was established as a cross party body to review pensions in the United Kingdom. The first Act to follow was the Pensions Act 2004 that updated regulation by replacing OPRA with the Pensions Regulator and relaxing the stringency of minimum funding requirements for pensions, while ensuring protection for insolvent businesses. In a major update of the state pension, the Pensions Act 2007, which aligned and raised retirement ages. Following that, the Pensions Act 2008 has set up automatic enrolment for occupational pensions, and a public competitor designed to be a low-cost and efficient fund manager, called the National Employment Savings Trust (or \\"Nest\\").\\r\\nThe Act amends the timetable for increasing the state pension age to 66. Under the PA 2007, the increase to 66 was due to take effect between 2004 and 2026. This Act will bring forward the increase so that state pension age for both men and women will begin rising from 65 in December 2018 to reach 66 by October 2020. As a result of bringing forward the increase to 66, the timetable contained in the PA 1995 for equalising womens state pension age with mens at 65 by April 2020 will be accelerated, so that womens state pension age reaches 65 by November 2018.[6]\\r\\nThe Act introduces amendments to primary legislation to amend the regulatory framework for the duty on employers to automatically enrol eligible workers into a qualifying pension scheme and to contribute to the scheme. These measures implement recommendations from the Making Automatic Enrolment Work review and revise some of the automatic enrolment provisions in the PA 2008.\\r\\nThe Act amends existing legislation that provides for revaluation or indexation of occupational pensions and payments by the Pension Protection Fund.\\r\\nThe Act defines \\"money purchase benefits\\" in legislation relating to pensions. This is in consequence of the judgment of the Supreme Court in Houldsworth v Bridge Trustees and Secretary of State for Work and Pensions. The Act takes powers to make transitional, consequential or supplementary provision as well as the power to make further amendments to the definition of \\"money purchase benefits\\" if necessary.\\r\\nThe Act introduces provisions into the current judicial pension schemes to allow contributions to be taken towards the cost of providing personal pension benefits to members of those schemes.\\r\\nFinally, this Act contains a number of measures to correct particular references in the existing body of pensions-related legislation and other small and technical measures to both state and private pension legislation. This includes the following measures:\\r\\nState pension comprises three main elements ÿ the basic pension, additional pensions, and pension guarantee. These are described in the following sections.\\r\\nThree different state schemes have existed to provide extra pension provision above the Basic State Pension (BSP). These are collectively known as Additional Pension. They have been available only to employees paying National Insurance contributions and to certain exempted groups (not including the self-employed). The three schemes are/were:\\r\\nUnlike the Basic State Pension, participation in the Additional Pension schemes is voluntary. Those who do not wish to participate can contract out. This option was introduced with SERPS in 1978 and is only available to those who have made alternative pension arrangements through Personal or Occupational schemes. Further changes to be introduced in 2012 will see S2P change from an \\"earnings related\\" to a \\"flat rate\\" pension, and individuals will lose the right to contract out.\\r\\nOccupational pension schemes are arrangements established by employers to provide pension and related benefits for their employees. These are created under the Pension Schemes Act 1993, the Pensions Act 1995 and the Pensions Act 2008.\\r\\nThe Pensions Act 2008 is an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. The principal change brought about by the Act is that all workers will have to opt out of an occupational pension plan of their employer, rather than opt in. This is referred to as automatic enrolment, and moves a significant amount of responsibility onto the employer to ensure that their employees are enrolled in a workplace pension scheme.[7]\\r\\nEmployers are required to initiate automatic enrolment into their workplace according to set staging dates based on the number of employees in the company. These dates vary from 1 January 2012 to 1 January 2017, with larger firms required to meet compliance guidelines first, and smaller firms later.[8] There are penalties for companies who are not compliant by their staging date.[9] There are a number of solutions available to help companies meet government compliance by their staging date.\\r\\nMore than 6000 occupational schemes were in place in the UK in 2015,[10] of which over 5000 were in deficit. The total shortfall of the schemes was over 360 billion pounds as of February 2015. A large number of UK employers offer their employees access to a defined benefit occupational pension scheme, often based on final salary. In such an arrangement, the employee was typically promised a pension of a fixed proportion of their salary in the period leading up to retirement. The proportion would depend on the number of years of service with the employer. Post retirement increases are typically partly discretionary. The amounts payable are restricted by taxation rules, the maximum being typically either a pension of one-sixtieth of final salary for each year of membership or a pension of one-eightieth of their salary per year of membership plus a tax free lump sum of three-eightieths. With increases in longevity and reductions in interest rates, such arrangements were becoming progressively unaffordable. So following a review by a Pensions Commission, to get a given income, the length it is necessary to pay into a pension in the public sector is linked to longevity.\\r\\nOver recent years, many employers have closed their defined benefit schemes to new members, and established defined contribution or money purchase arrangements instead. In this arrangement, the employer (and sometimes also the employee) makes regular payments (typically a percentage of salary) into a pension fund, and the fund is used to buy a pension when the employee retires. So the amount of pension depends on a number of factors including the accumulated amount of the fund, interest rates and projected mortality rates at the time the individual retires.\\r\\nUK occupational pension schemes are typically jointly funded by the employer and the employees. These are called \\"contributory pension schemes\\" since the employee contributes ÿ typically something in the region of 6% of salary, tax free. \\"Non contributory pension schemes\\" are where the employer funds the scheme with no contribution from the individual. Contributions are typically put into a separate trust, whose assets will be used to provide benefits in due course.\\r\\nDefined benefit pension schemes may be affected to swings in the financial markets. The Pension Protection Fund was set up to act as a safety net in case a scheme was unable to pay the defined benefits it was committed to. According to the PPF Pension Funds in the UK is estimated to have been 367.5 Billion pounds at the end of January 2015. The report[10] puts the deficit at 40%- The PPF figures show that the funds fell into deficit at the end of 2011. The situation of the schemes is driven largely by quantitative easing.[11][12]\\r\\nMost schemes are also registered for tax purposes, which gives the scheme various tax advantages ÿ assets grow free from income tax, capital gains tax and corporation tax, employees can normally make contributions out of their gross (untaxed) income, and employer contributions are generally tax deductible. Only funded schemes can be registered.\\r\\nPrior to April 2006 schemes were 'approved' by HMRC rather than registered. Approval placed certain limits on the benefits which could be provided, which led to a growth of 'unapproved' (i.e. without the generous tax treatment) retirement arrangements ÿ these unapproved schemes were commonly distinguished by reference to their funding status (funded unapproved retirement benefit schemes FURBS and unfunded unapproved retirement benefit schemes UURBS).\\r\\nIt is also possible for an individual to make contributions under an arrangement they themselves make with a provider (such as an insurance company). Similar tax advantages will usually be available as for occupational schemes. Contributions are typically invested during an individual's working life, and then used to purchase a pension at or following retirement. Various names are given to different types of individual arrangement, but they are not fundamentally different in nature. The generic term personal pension is used to refer to arrangements established since the rules were liberalised in the 1980s (earlier arrangements are usually called retirement annuity contracts), but can be subdivided into other types (such as the Self-invested personal pension, where the member is allowed to direct what their contributions should be invested in).\\r\\nStakeholder pensions (insured personal pensions, with charges capped at a low level) are a form of pension arrangement designed to be easily understandable and available. Stakeholder pensions are in effect personal pension schemes set up on terms which meet standards set by the government (for example there are restrictions on the charges the provider may make). Although a stakeholder pension is a personal pension, they can (and in some circumstances must) be offered by an employer as a cost-effective way of providing pension cover for their workforce.\\r\\nGroup personal pensions are another pension arrangement that are personal pensions, but are linked to an employer. A group personal pension plan (GPPP) can be established by an employer as a way of providing all of its employees with access to a pension plan run by a single provider. By grouping all the employees together in this way, it is normally possible for the employer to negotiate favourable terms with the provider, thus reducing the cost of pension provision to the employees. The employer will also normally contribute to the GPPP.\\r\\nPerpetual pensions were freely granted either to favourites or as a reward for political services from the time of Charles II onwards. Such pensions were very frequently attached as salaries to places which were sinecures, or, just as often, posts which were really necessary were grossly overpaid, while the duties were discharged by a deputy at a small salary.\\r\\nPrior to the reign of Queen Anne, such pensions and annuities were charged on the hereditary revenues of the sovereign and were held to be binding on the sovereign's successors.[13] By the Taxation, etc. Act 1702 (I Anne c. 7) it was provided that no portion of the hereditary revenues could be charged with pensions beyond the life of the reigning sovereign. This act did not affect the hereditary revenues of Ireland and Scotland, and many persons were quartered, as they had been before the act, on the Irish and Scottish revenues who could not be provided for in England for example, the Duke of St Albans, illegitimate son of Charles II, had an Irish pension of S800 a year (S117?thousand today); Catherine Sedley, mistress of James II, had an Irish pension of S5,000 a year; the Duchess of Kendall and the Countess of Darlington, respectively mistress and half-sister of George I, had pensions of the united annual value of S5,000 (S433?thousand today), while Madame de Wallmoden, a mistress of George II, had a pension of S3,000 (S399?thousand today).[14]\\r\\nThese pensions had been granted in every conceivable form during the pleasure of the Crown, for the life of the sovereign, for terms of years, for the life of the grantee, and for several lives in being or in reversion (Erskine May, Constitutional History of England). On the accession of George III and his surrender of the hereditary revenues in return for a fixed civil list, this civil list became the source from which the pensions were paid. The three pension lists of England, Scotland and Ireland were consolidated in 1830, and the civil pension list reduced to finance the remainder of the pensions being charged on the Consolidated Fund.\\r\\nIn 1887 Charles Bradlaugh MP protested strongly against the payment of perpetual pensions, and as a result a committee of the House of Commons inquired into the subject (Report of Select Committee on Perpetual Pensions, 248, 1887). An appendix to the Report contains a detailed list of all hereditary pensions, payments and allowances in existence in 1881, with an explanation of the origin in each case and the ground of the original grant; there are also shown the pensions, etc., redeemed from time to time, and the terms upon which the redemption took place. The nature of some of these pensions may be gathered from the following examples:\\r\\nAll these pensions were for services rendered, and although justifiable from that point of view, a preferable policy is pursued in the 20th century, by Parliament voting a lump sum, as in the cases of Lord Kitchener in 1902 (S50,000) and Lord Cromer in 1907 (S50,000).\\r\\nCharles II granted the office of Receiver-General and Controller of the Seals of the Court of Kings Bench and Common Pleas to the Duke of Grafton. This was purchased in 1825 from the duke for an annuity of S843, which in turn was commuted in 1883 for a sum of S22,714 12s. 8d. To the same duke was given the Office of the Pipe or Remembrancer of First-Fruits and Tenths of the Clergy. This office was sold by the duke in 1765 and, after passing through various hands, was purchased by one R. Harrisor in 1798. In 1835 on the loss of certain fees the holder was compensated by a perpetual pension of S62 9s. 8d. The Duke of Graftol also possessed an annuity of S6,870 in respect of the commutator of the dues of butlerage and prisage.\\r\\nTo the Duke of St Albans was granted in 1684 the office of Master of the Hawks. The sum granted by the original patent were: Master of Hawks, salary S391 1s. 5d.; four falconers at S50 per annum each, S200; provision of hawks, S600; provision of pigeons, hens and other meats S182 10s.; total, S1373 11s. 5d. This amount was reduced by office fees and other deductions to S965, at which amount it stood until commuted in 1891 for S18,335.\\r\\nTo the Duke of Richmond and his heirs was granted in 1676 a duty of one shilling per ton of all coals exported from the Tyne for consumption in England. This was redeemed in 1799 for an annuity of S19,000 (chargeable on the consolidated fund), which was afterwards redeemed for S633,333.\\r\\nThe Duke of Hamilton, as hereditary keeper of the palace of Holyrood House, received a perpetual pension of S45,105 and the descendants of the heritable usher of Scotland drew a salary of S242 10s.\\r\\nThe conclusions of the committee were that pensions allowances and payments should not in future be granted in perpetuity, on the ground that such grants should be limited to the persons actually rendering the service, and that such reward should be defrayed by the generation benefited; that offices with salaries and without duties, or with merely nominal duties, ought to be abolished; that all existing perpetual pensions and payments and all hereditary offices should be abolished: that where no service or merely nominal service is rendered by the holder of an hereditary office or the original grantee of a pension, the pension or payment should in no case continue beyond the life of the present holder and that in all cases the method of commutation ought to ensure a real and substantial saving to the nation (the existing rate, about 27 years purchase, being considered by the committee to be too high). These recommendations of the committee were adopted by the government and outstanding hereditary pensions were gradually commuted, the only ones left outstanding being those to Lord Rodney (S2,000) and to Lord Nelson (S5,000), both chargeable on the Consolidated Fund.\\r\\nThese are type sui generis as they either reward a career in domestic politics or are awarded in the colonial context not on grounds of justice, contract or socio-economic merits, but as a political decision, in order to take a politically significant person (often deemed a potential political danger) out of the picture by paying him or her off, regardless of seniority.\\r\\nThese are pensions granted by the Sovereign from the Civil List upon the recommendation of the First Lord of the Treasury. They were to be \\"granted to such persons only as have just claims on the royal beneficence or who by their personal services to the Crown, or by the performance of duties to the public, or by their useful discoveries in science and attainments in literature and the arts, have merited the gracious consideration of their sovereign and the gratitude of their country.\\"[15] As of 1911, a sum of S1,200 was allotted each year from the Civil List, in addition to the pensions already in force. In 1908, the total of civil list pensions payable in that year amounted to S24,665. For 2012-13 the total annual cost of civil list pensions paid to 53 people was S126,293. The average pension was S2,383.[16]\\r\\nThere are certain offices of the executive whose pensions are regulated by particular acts of Parliament. Judges of the High Court, on completing fifteen years services or becoming permanently incapacitated for duty, whatever their length of service, may be granted a pension equal to two-thirds of their salary (Supreme Court of Judicature Act 1873). The Lord Chancellor of Great Britain however short a time he may have held office, receives a pension of S45,000, but he usually continues to sit as a Law Lord in the House of Lords; so also does the Lord Chancellor of Northern Ireland, who receives a pension of S3,692 6s. A considerable number of local authorities have obtained special parliamentary powers for the purpose of superannuating their officials and workmen who have reached the age of 65. Poor law officers receive superannuation allowances under the Poor Law Officers Superannuation Act 1864ÿ1897.\\r\\nBishops, deans, canons or incumbent who are incapacitated by age or infirmity from the discharge of their ecclesiastical duties may receive pensions which are a charged upon the revenues of the see or cure vacated.\\r\\nNavy pensions were first instituted by William III of England in 1693 and regularly established by an order in council of Queen Anne in 1700. Since then the rate of pensions has undergone various modification and alterations; the full regulations concerning pensions to all ranks will be found in the quarterly Navy List, published by authority of the Admiralty. In addition to the ordinary pension there are also good-service pensions, Greenwich Hospital pension and pensions for wounds.\\r\\nAn officer is entitled to a pension when he is retired at the age of 45, or if he retires between the ages c 40 and 45 at his own request, otherwise he receives only half pay. The amount of his pension depends upon his rank, length of service and age. As an example, in past, the maximum retired pay of an admiral was S850 per annum, for which 30 years service or its equivalent in half-pay time is necessary; he may, in addition, have held a good service pension of 300 per annum. The maximum retired pay of a vice-admiral with 29 years service was S725; of rear-admirals with 27 years service, S600 per annum. Pensions of captains who retire at the age of 55, commanders, who retire at 50, and lieutenants who retire at 45, ranged from S200 per annum for 17 years service to S525 for 24 years service. The pensions of other officers were calculated in the same way, according to age and length of service.\\r\\nThe good-service pensions consisted of ten pensions of S300 per annum for flag-officers, two of which may be held by vice-admirals and two by rear-admirals; twelve of S150 for captains; two of S200 a year and two of S150 a year for engineer officers; three of 100 a year for medical officers of the navy; six of S200 a year for general officers of the Royal Marines and two of S150 a year for colonels and lieutenant-colonels of the same. Greenwich Hospital pensions range from S150 a year for flag officers to S25 a year for warrant officers. All seamen and marines who have completed twenty-two years service are entitled to pensions ranging from 1d. a day to a maximum of 1s. 2d. a day, according to the number of good-conduct badges, together with the good-conduct medal, possessed. Petty officers, in addition to the rates of pension allowed them as seamen, are allowed for each years service in the capacity of superior petty officer, 15s. 2d. a year, and in the capacity of inferior petty officer 7s. 7d. a year.\\r\\nMen who are discharged from the service on account of injuries and wounds or disability attributable to the service are pensioned with sums varying from 6d. a day to 2s. a day. Pensions are also given to the widows of officers in certain circumstances and compassionate allowances made to the children of officers. In the Navy estimates for 1908ÿ1909 the amount required for halfpay and retired-pay was S868,800, and for pensions, gratuities and compassionate allowances S1,334,600, a total of S2,203,400.\\r\\nThe system of pensions in the British Army is somewhat intricate, provision being made for dealing with almost every case separately.\\r\\nThe Family resources survey[17] from the UK Department for Work and Pensions, details levels of income, saving and pension provision for a representative selection of UK households and is the source for the table below for UK employees (Table 7.12):\\r\\nMost employees over the state pension age of 65 would not have pension provision as part of their salary and benefits ÿ they may well however be receiving income from a pension from previous employment","input":"When were state pensions introduced in the uk?"},{"output":"English","context":"Coordinates: 1703N 6148W? / ?17.050N 61.800W? / 17.050; -61.800\\r\\nAntigua and Barbuda (/?n?ti?(w)??...?b?r?b(j)u?d?/?(?listen); ann-TEE-g(w)? ... bar-B(Y)OO-d?) is a sovereign state in the Americas, lying between the Caribbean Sea and the Atlantic Ocean. It consists of two major islands, Antigua and Barbuda, and a number of smaller islands (including Great Bird, Green, Guiana, Long, Maiden and York Islands and further south, the island of Redonda). The permanent population numbers about 81,800 (at the 2011 Census) and the capital and largest port and city is St. John's, on Antigua.\\r\\nLying near each other (the main Barbuda airport is less than 0.5 of latitude, or 30 nautical miles, north of the main Antigua airport), Antigua and Barbuda are in the middle of the Leeward Islands, part of the Lesser Antilles, roughly at 17N of the equator. The country's name was given by Christopher Columbus in 1493 after discovering the island, in honor of the Virgin of La Antigua in the Seville Cathedral. The country is nicknamed \\"Land of 365 Beaches\\" due to the many beaches surrounding the islands. Its governance, language, and culture have all been strongly influenced by the British Empire, of which the country was formerly a part, gaining sovereignty on 1 November 1981. It remains a member of the Commonwealth and Queen Elizabeth II is the head of state.[4]\\r\\nIn September 2017, Hurricane Irma damaged or destroyed 95% of Barbuda's buildings and infrastructure. Everyone on the island was evacuated to Antigua.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAntigua is Spanish for \\"ancient\\" and barbuda is Spanish for \\"bearded\\". The island of Antigua, originally called Wadadli by Arawaks, is today called Wadadli by locals; Caribs possibly called it Wa'omoni. Christopher Columbus, while sailing by in 1493 may have named it Santa Maria la Antigua, after an icon in the Spanish Seville Cathedral.\\r\\nAntigua was first settled by archaic age hunter-gatherer Amerindians called the Siboney or Ciboney.[6] Carbon dating has established the earliest settlements started around 3100 BC. They were succeeded by the ceramic age pre-Columbian Arawak-speaking Saladoid people who migrated from the lower Orinoco River.\\r\\nThe Arawaks introduced agriculture, raising, among other crops, the famous Antigua black pineapple (Moris cultivar of Ananas comosus), corn, sweet potatoes, chiles, guava, tobacco, and cotton.\\r\\nThe indigenous West Indians made excellent seagoing vessels which they used to sail around on the Atlantic and the Caribbean. As a result, Caribs and Arawaks were able to colonise much of South America and the Caribbean Islands. Their descendants still live there, notably in Brazil, Venezuela, and Colombia.\\r\\nMost Arawaks left Antigua around 1100 AD; those who remained were later raided by the Caribs. According to the Catholic Encyclopedia, the Caribs' superior weapons and seafaring prowess allowed them to defeat most of the West Indian Arawak nations, enslaving some and possibly cannibalising others.\\r\\nThe Catholic Encyclopedia makes it clear that the European invaders had difficulty differentiating between the various groups of the native peoples they encountered. As a result, the number and types of ethnic/tribal groups in existence at that time may have been much more varied and numerous than just the two mentioned in this article.\\r\\nEuropean and African diseases, malnutrition, and slavery eventually killed most of the Caribbean's native population. Smallpox was probably the greatest killer.[7] Some historians[who?] believe that the psychological stress of slavery may also have played a part in the massive number of deaths amongst enslaved natives. Others believe the reportedly abundant but starchy, low-protein diet may have contributed to their severe malnutrition as they were used to a diet fortified with protein from the sea.[8]\\r\\nThe Spaniards did not colonise Antigua because it lacked fresh water but not aggressive Caribs. The English settled on Antigua in 1632; Christopher Codrington settled on Barbuda in 1684. Slavery, established to run sugar plantations around 1684, was abolished in 1834. The British ruled from 1632 to 1981, with a brief French interlude in 1666.\\r\\nThe islands became an independent state within the Commonwealth of Nations on 1 November 1981, with Elizabeth II as the first Queen of Antigua and Barbuda. Vere Cornwall Bird Sr became the first Prime Minister.\\r\\nMost of Barbuda was devastated in early September 2017 by Hurricane Irma, which brought winds with speeds reaching 295 km/h (185 mph). The storm damaged or destroyed 95% of the island's buildings and infrastructure, leaving Barbuda \\"barely habitable\\" according to Prime Minister Gaston Browne. Nearly everyone on the island was evacuated to Antigua.[5]\\r\\nAntigua and Barbuda both are generally low-lying islands whose terrain has been influenced more by limestone formations than volcanic activity. The highest point on Antigua is Mount Obama (formerly Boggy Peak), the remnant of a volcanic crater rising 402 metres (1,319 feet).\\r\\nThe shorelines of both islands are greatly indented with beaches, lagoons, and natural harbours. The islands are rimmed by reefs and shoals. There are few streams as rainfall is slight. Both islands lack adequate amounts of fresh groundwater.\\r\\nAntigua1750N 61480W? / ?17.08333N 61.80000W? / 17.08333; -61.80000\\r\\nBarbuda17370N 61480W? / ?17.61667N 61.80000W? / 17.61667; -61.80000\\r\\nRedonda165620N 622030W? / ?16.93889N 62.34167W? / 16.93889; -62.34167\\r\\nRainfall averages 990?mm (39?in) per year, with the amount varying widely from season to season. In general the wettest period is between September and November. The islands generally experience low humidity and recurrent droughts. Temperatures average 27?C (80.6?F), with a range from 23?C (73.4?F) to 29?C (84.2?F) in the winter to from 25?C (77.0?F) to 30?C (86.0?F) in the summer and autumn. The coolest period is between December and February.\\r\\nHurricanes strike on an average of once a year, including the powerful Category 5 Hurricane Irma, on 6 September 2017, which damaged 95% of the structures on Barbuda.[9] Some 1,800 people were evacuated to Antigua.[10]\\r\\nAn estimate published by Time indicated that over $100 million would be required to rebuild homes and infrastructure. Philmore Mullin, Director of Barbuda's National Office of Disaster Services, said that \\"all critical infrastructure and utilities are non-existent ÿ food supply, medicine, shelter, electricity, water, communications, waste management\\". He summarised the situation as follows: \\"Public utilities need to be rebuilt in their entirety... It is optimistic to think anything can be rebuilt in six months ... In my 25 years in disaster management, I have never seen something like this.\\"[11]\\r\\nThe sandy soil on much of the islands has only scrub vegetation. Some parts of Antigua are more fertileÿmost notably the central plainÿdue to the volcanic ash in the soil. These areas support some tropical vegetation and agricultural uses. The planting of acacia, mahogany, and red and white cedar on Antigua has led to as much as 11% of the land becoming forested, helping to conserve the soil and water.\\r\\nAntigua has a population of 100,963,[1] mostly made up of people of West African, British, and Madeiran descent. The ethnic distribution consists of 91% Black & Mulatto, 4.4% mixed race, 1.7% White, and 2.9% other (primarily East Indian and other Asian). Most Whites are of Irish or British descent. Christian Levantine Arabs, and a small number of Asians and Sephardic Jews make up the remainder of the population.\\r\\nAn increasingly large percentage of the population lives abroad, most notably in the United Kingdom (Antiguan Britons), United States and Canada. A minority of Antiguan residents are immigrants from other countries, particularly from Dominica, Guyana and Jamaica, and, increasing, from the Dominican Republic, St. Vincent and the Grenadines and Nigeria. An estimated 4,500 American citizens also make their home in Antigua and Barbuda, making their numbers one of the largest American populations in the English-speaking Eastern Caribbean.[12]\\r\\nEnglish is the official language. The Barbudan accent is slightly different from the Antiguan.\\r\\nIn the years before Antigua and Barbuda's independence, Standard English was widely spoken in preference to Antiguan Creole. Generally, the upper and middle classes shun Antiguan Creole. The educational system dissuades the use of Antiguan Creole and instruction is done in Standard (British) English.\\r\\nMany of the words used in the Antiguan dialect are derived from British as well as African languages. This can be easily seen in phrases such as: \\"Ent it?\\" meaning \\"Ain't it?\\" which is itself dialectal and means \\"Isn't it?\\". Common island proverbs can often be traced to Africa.\\r\\nSpanish is spoken by around 10,000 inhabitants.[13]\\r\\nA majority of 77%[14] of Antiguans are Christians, with the Anglicans (17,6%) being the largest single denomination. Other Christian denominations present are Seventh-day Adventist Church (12,4%), Pentecostalism (12,2%), Moravian Church (8,3%), Roman Catholics (8,2%), Methodist Church (5,6%), Wesleyan Holiness Church (4,5%), Church of God (4,1%), Baptists (3,6%), Mormons (<1,0%), and Jehovah's Witnesses.\\r\\nNon-Christian religions practised in the islands include the Rastafari, Islam, and Bah' Faith.\\r\\nThe politics of Antigua and Barbuda take place within a framework of a unitary, parliamentary, representative democratic monarchy, in which the Head of State is the Monarch who appoints the Governor General as vice-regal representative.[15] Elizabeth II is the present Queen of Antigua and Barbuda, having served in that position since the islands' independence from the United Kingdom in 1981. The Queen is currently represented by Governor General Sir Rodney Williams. A Council of Ministers is appointed by the Governor General on the advice of the Prime Minister, currently Gaston Browne (2014ÿ). The Prime Minister is the Head of Government.\\r\\nExecutive power is exercised by the government while legislative power is vested in both the government and the two Chambers of Parliament. The bicameral Parliament consists of the Senate (17 members appointed by members of the government and the opposition party, and approved by the Governor-General), and the House of Representatives (17 members elected by first past the post) to serve five-year terms.\\r\\nThe current Leader of Her Majesty's Loyal Opposition is the United Progressive Party Member of Parliament (MP), the Honourable Baldwin Spencer.\\r\\nThe last elections held were on 12 June 2014, during which the Antigua Labour Party won 14 seats, and the United Progressive Party 3 seats.\\r\\nSince 1949, elections have been won by the populist Antigua Labour Party. However, in the Antigua and Barbuda legislative election of 2004 saw the defeat of the longest-serving elected government in the Caribbean. Prime Minister Lester Bryant Bird, who had succeeded his father Vere Cornwall Bird Sr., and Deputy Robin Yearwood had been in office since 1976.\\r\\nThe elder Bird was Prime Minister from 1981 to 1994 and Chief Minister of Antigua from 1960 to 1981, except for the 1971ÿ1976 period when the Progressive Labour Movement (PLM) defeated his party. Vere Cornwall Bird, the nation's first Prime Minister, is credited with having brought Antigua and Barbuda and the Caribbean into a new era of independence.\\r\\nGaston Browne defeated his predecessor Lester Bryant Bird at the Antigua Labour Party's biennial convention in November 2012 held to elect a political leader and other officers. The party then altered its name from the Antigua Labour Party (ALP) to the Antigua and Barbuda Labour Party (ABLP). This was done to officially include the party's presence on the sister island of Barbuda in its organisation, the only political party on the mainland to have a physical branch in Barbuda.\\r\\nThe Judicial branch is the Eastern Caribbean Supreme Court (based in Saint Lucia; one judge of the Supreme Court is a resident of the islands and presides over the High Court of Justice). Antigua is also a member of the Caribbean Court of Justice. The Judicial Committee of the Privy Council serves as its Supreme Court of Appeal.[16]\\r\\nAntigua and Barbuda is a member of the United Nations, the Bolivarian Alliance for the Americas, the Commonwealth of Nations, the Caribbean Community, the Organization of Eastern Caribbean States, the Organization of American States, the World Trade Organization and the Eastern Caribbean's Regional Security System.\\r\\nAntigua and Barbuda is also a member of the International Criminal Court (with a Bilateral Immunity Agreement of Protection for the US military as covered under Article 98 of the Rome Statute).\\r\\nIn 2013, Antigua and Barbuda called for reparations for slavery at the United Nations. Prime Minister Baldwin Spencer said \\"We have recently seen a number of leaders apologising\\", and that they should now \\"match their words with concrete and material benefits\\".[17]\\r\\nThe Royal Antigua and Barbuda Defence Force has around 260 members dispersed between the line infantry regiment, service and support unit and coast guard. There is also the Antigua and Barbuda Cadet Corps made up of 200 teenagers between the ages of 12 to 18.\\r\\nAntigua and Barbuda is divided into six parishes and two dependencies:\\r\\nNote: Though Barbuda and Redonda are called dependencies they are integral parts of the state, making them essentially administrative divisions. Dependency is simply a title.\\r\\nTourism dominates the economy, accounting for more than half of the gross domestic product (GDP). Antigua is famous for its many luxury resorts. Weak tourist activity since early 2000 has slowed the economy, however, and squeezed the government into a tight fiscal corner.\\r\\nInvestment banking and financial services also make up an important part of the economy. Major world banks with offices in Antigua include the Royal Bank of Canada (RBC) and Scotiabank. Financial-services corporations with offices in Antigua include PriceWaterhouseCoopers. The US Securities and Exchange Commission has accused the Antigua-based Stanford International Bank, owned by Texas billionaire Allen Stanford, of orchestrating a huge fraud which may have bilked investors of some $8 billion.[18] (check status 20100312)\\r\\nThe twin-island nation's agricultural production is focused on its domestic market and constrained by a limited water supply and a labour shortage stemming from the lure of higher wages in tourism and construction work.\\r\\nManufacturing is made up of enclave-type assembly for export, the major products being bedding, handicrafts and electronic components. Prospects for economic growth in the medium term will continue to depend on income growth in the industrialised world, especially in the United States, from which about one-third of all tourists come.\\r\\nFollowing the opening of the American University of Antigua College of Medicine by investor and attorney Neil Simon in 2003, a new source of revenue was established. The university employs many local Antiguans and the approximate 1000 students consume a large amount of the goods and services.\\r\\nAntigua and Barbuda also utilizes an economic citizenship program to spur investment into the country.\\r\\nAntigua & Barbuda has a greater than 90% literacy rate. In 1998, Antigua and Barbuda adopted a national mandate to become the pre-eminent provider of medical services in the Caribbean. As part of this mission, Antigua and Barbuda built the most technologically advanced hospital in the Caribbean, the Mt. St. John Medical Centre. The island of Antigua currently has two foreign-owned for-profit offshore medical schools, the American University of Antigua (AUA),[19] founded in 2004, and The University of Health Sciences Antigua (UHSA),[20] founded in 1982. The island's medical schools cater mostly to foreign students but contribute to the local economy and health care.\\r\\nThere is also a government owned state college in Antigua as well as the Antigua and Barbuda Institute of Information Technology (ABIIT) and the Antigua and Barbuda Hospitality Training Institute (ABHTI). The University of the West Indies has a branch in Antigua for local students to continue university studies.\\r\\nAntigua has two international primary/secondary schools: CCSET International, which offers the Ontario Secondary School Diploma, and Island Academy, which offers the International Baccalaureate. There are also many other private schools but these institutions tend to follow the same local curriculum (CXCs) as government schools.\\r\\nThe culture is predominantly a mixture of West African and British cultural influences.\\r\\nCricket is the national sport. Other popular sports include football, boat racing and surfing. (Antigua Sailing Week attracts locals and visitors from all over the world).\\r\\nCalypso and soca music, both originating primarily out of Trinidad, are important in Antigua and Barbuda.[citation needed][21]\\r\\nThe national Carnival held each August commemorates the abolition of slavery in the British West Indies, although on some islands, Carnival may celebrate the coming of Lent. Its festive pageants, shows, contests and other activities are a major tourist attraction.\\r\\nCorn and sweet potatoes play an important role in Antiguan cuisine. For example, a popular Antiguan dish, Dukuna /?du?ku??n?/ is a sweet, steamed dumpling made from grated sweet potatoes, flour and spices. One of the Antiguan staple foods, fungi /?fu?nd?i?/, is a cooked paste made of cornmeal and water.\\r\\nThere are two daily newspapers: the \\"Daily Observer\\" and \\"Caribbean Times\\". The local channel ABS TV 10 is available (it is the only station which shows exclusively local programs). There are also several local and regional radio stations, such as V2C-AM 620, ZDK-AM 1100, VYBZ-FM 92.9, ZDK-FM 97.1, Observer Radio 91.1 FM, DNECA Radio 90.1 FM, Second Advent Radio 101.5 FM, Abundant Life Radio 103.9 FM, Crusader Radio 107.3 FM, Nice FM 104.3\\r\\nJamaica Kincaid, has published over 20 pieces of literature[22].\\r\\nThe Antigua and Barbuda national cricket team represented the country at the 1998 Commonwealth Games, but Antiguan cricketers otherwise play for the Leeward Islands cricket team in domestic matches and the West Indies cricket team internationally. The 2007 Cricket World Cup was hosted in the West Indies from 11 March to 28 April 2007.\\r\\nAntigua hosted eight matches at the Sir Vivian Richards Stadium, which was completed on 11 February 2007 and can hold up to 20,000 people. Antigua is a Host of Stanford Twenty20 ÿ Twenty20 Cricket, a version started by Allen Stanford in 2006 as a regional cricket game with almost all Caribbean islands taking part. Rugby and netball are popular as well.\\r\\nAssociation football, or soccer, is also a very popular sport. Antigua has a national football team which entered World Cup qualification for the 1974 tournament and for 1986 and onwards. A professional team was formed in 2011, Antigua Barracuda FC, which played in the USL Pro, a lower professional league in the USA. The nation's team had a major achievement in 2012, getting out of its preliminary group for the 2014 World Cup, notably due to a victory over powerful Haiti. In its first game in the next CONCACAF group play on 8 June 2012 in Tampa, FL, Antigua and Barbuda, comprising 17 Barracuda players and 7 from the lower English professional leagues, scored a goal against the United States. However, the team lost 3:1 to the US.\\r\\nThe national bird is the frigate bird, and the national tree is the Talipariti elatum(Blue Mahoe tree)\\r\\nClick on a coloured area to see an article about English in that country or region","input":"What is the language of antigua and barbuda?"},{"output":"November 1912","context":"Gitanjali (Bengali: ?????????, lit.?Song offering) is a collection of poems by the Bengali poet Rabindranath Tagore.

The English Gitanjali or Song Offerings is a collection of 103 English poems of Tagore's own English translations of his Bengali poems first published in November 1912 by the India Society of London. It contained translations of 53 poems from the original Bengali Gitanjali, as well as 50 other poems which were from his drama Achalayatan and eight other books of poetry  mainly Gitimalya (17 poems), Naivedya (15 poems) and Kheya (11 poems).[1]\\r\\nThe translations were often radical, leaving out or altering large chunks of the poem and in one instance fusing two separate poems (song 95, which unifies songs 89,90 of Naivedya).

Mission commander Neil Armstrong and pilot Buzz Aldrin, both American, landed the lunar module Eagle on July 20, 1969, at 20:18 UTC. Armstrong became the first to step onto the lunar surface six hours after landing on July 21 at 02:56:15 UTC; Aldrin joined him about 20 minutes later. They spent about two and a quarter hours together outside the spacecraft, and collected 47.5 pounds (21.5?kg) of lunar material to bring back to Earth. Michael Collins piloted the command module Columbia alone in lunar orbit while they were on the Moon's surface. Armstrong and Aldrin spent just under a day on the lunar surface before rejoining Columbia in lunar orbit.\\r\\nApollo 11 was launched by a Saturn V rocket from Kennedy Space Center in Merritt Island, Florida, on July 16 at 9:32 am EDT (13:32 UTC) and was the fifth manned mission of NASA's Apollo program. The Apollo spacecraft had three parts: a command module (CM) with a cabin for the three astronauts, and the only part that landed back on Earth; a service module (SM), which supported the command module with propulsion, electrical power, oxygen, and water; and a lunar module (LM) that had two stages ÿ a lower stage for landing on the Moon, and an upper stage to place the astronauts back into lunar orbit.\\r\\nAfter being sent toward the Moon by the Saturn V's upper stage, the astronauts separated the spacecraft from it and traveled for three days until they entered into lunar orbit. Armstrong and Aldrin then moved into the lunar module Eagle and landed in the Sea of Tranquility. They stayed a total of about 21.5 hours on the lunar surface. The astronauts used Eagle's upper stage to lift off from the lunar surface and rejoin Collins in the command module. They jettisoned Eagle before they performed the maneuvers that blasted them out of lunar orbit on a trajectory back to Earth. They returned to Earth and landed in the Pacific Ocean on July 24.\\r\\nThe landing was broadcast on live TV to a worldwide audience. Armstrong stepped onto the lunar surface and described the event as \\"one small step for [a] man, one giant leap for mankind.\\" Apollo 11 effectively ended the Space Race and fulfilled a national goal proposed in 1961 by U.S. President John F. Kennedy: \\"before this decade is out, of landing a man on the Moon and returning him safely to the Earth.\\"[7]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nApollo 11 was the second all-veteran multi-person crew (the first being Apollo 10) in human spaceflight history.[8] A previous solo veteran flight had been made on Soyuz 1 in 1967 by Soviet cosmonaut Vladimir Komarov.[9]\\r\\nCollins was originally slated to be the Command Module Pilot (CMP) on Apollo 8 but was removed when he required surgery on his back and was replaced by Jim Lovell, his backup for that flight. After Collins was medically cleared, he took what would have been Lovell's spot on Apollo 11; as a veteran of Apollo 8, Lovell was transferred to Apollo 11's backup crew and promoted to backup commander.\\r\\nIn early 1969, Anders accepted a job with the National Space Council effective August 1969 and announced that he would retire as an astronaut on that date. At that point Ken Mattingly was moved from the support crew into parallel training with Anders as backup Command Module Pilot in case Apollo 11 was delayed past its intended July launch (at which point Anders would be unavailable if needed) and would later join Lovell's crew and ultimately be assigned as the original Apollo 13 CMP.[10]\\r\\nAfter the crew of Apollo 10 named their spacecraft Charlie Brown and Snoopy, assistant manager for public affairs Julian Scheer wrote to Manned Spacecraft Center director George M. Low to suggest the Apollo 11 crew be less flippant in naming their craft. During early mission planning, the names Snowcone and Haystack were used and put in the news release,[11] but the crew later decided to change them.\\r\\nThe Command Module was named Columbia after the Columbiad, the giant cannon shell \\"spacecraft\\" fired by a giant cannon (also from Florida) in Jules Verne's 1865 novel From the Earth to the Moon.[12] The Lunar Module was named Eagle for the national bird of the United States, the bald eagle, which is featured prominently on the mission insignia.\\r\\nThe Apollo 11 mission insignia was designed by Collins, who wanted a symbol for \\"peaceful lunar landing by the United States\\". He chose an eagle as the symbol, put an olive branch in its beak, and drew a lunar background with the Earth in the distance. NASA officials said the talons of the eagle looked too \\"warlike\\" and after some discussion, the olive branch was moved to the claws. The crew decided the Roman numeral XI would not be understood in some nations and went with \\"Apollo 11\\"; they decided not to put their names on the patch, so it would \\"be representative of everyone who had worked toward a lunar landing\\".[13] All colors are natural, with blue and gold borders around the patch.\\r\\nWhen the Eisenhower dollar coin was released in 1971, the patch design provided the eagle for its reverse side.[14] The design was also used for the smaller Susan B. Anthony dollar unveiled in 1979, ten years after the Apollo 11 mission.[15]\\r\\nNeil Armstrong's personal preference kit carried a piece of wood from the Wright brothers' 1903 airplane's left propeller and a piece of fabric from its wing,[16] along with a diamond-studded astronaut pin originally given to Deke Slayton by the widows of the Apollo 1 crew. This pin had been intended to be flown on Apollo 1 and given to Slayton after the mission but following the disastrous launch pad fire and subsequent funerals, the widows gave the pin to Slayton and Armstrong took it on Apollo 11.[17]\\r\\nIn addition to many people crowding highways and beaches near the launch site, millions watched the event on television, with NASA Chief of Public Information Jack King providing commentary. President Richard M. Nixon viewed the proceedings from the Oval Office of the White House.\\r\\nA Saturn V launched Apollo 11 from Launch Pad 39A, part of the Launch Complex 39 site at the Kennedy Space Center on July 16, 1969, at 13:32:00 UTC (9:32:00?a.m. EDT local time). It entered Earth orbit, at an altitude of 100.4 nautical miles (185.9?km) by 98.9 nautical miles (183.2?km), twelve minutes later.[1] After one and a half orbits, the S-IVB third-stage engine pushed the spacecraft onto its trajectory toward the Moon with the trans-lunar injection (TLI) burn at 16:22:13 UTC. About 30 minutes later, the transposition, docking, and extraction maneuver was performed: this involved separating the Apollo Command/Service Module (CSM) from the spent rocket stage, turning around, and docking with the Lunar Module still attached to the stage. After the Lunar Module was extracted, the combined spacecraft headed for the Moon, while the rocket stage flew on a trajectory past the Moon and into orbit around the Sun.[4]\\r\\nOn July 19 at 17:21:50 UTC, Apollo 11 passed behind the Moon and fired its service propulsion engine to enter lunar orbit. In the thirty orbits[18] that followed, the crew saw passing views of their landing site in the southern Sea of Tranquility (Mare Tranquillitatis) about 12 miles (19?km) southwest of the crater Sabine D (0.67408N, 23.47297E). The landing site was selected in part because it had been characterized as relatively flat and smooth by the automated Ranger 8 and Surveyor 5 landers along with the Lunar Orbiter mapping spacecraft and unlikely to present major landing or extravehicular activity (EVA) challenges.[19]\\r\\nOn July 20, 1969, the Lunar Module Eagle separated from the Command Module Columbia. Collins, alone aboard Columbia, inspected Eagle as it pirouetted before him to ensure the craft was not damaged.\\r\\nAs the descent began, Armstrong and Aldrin found that they were passing landmarks on the surface four seconds early and reported that they were \\"long\\"; they would land miles west of their target point.\\r\\nFive minutes into the descent burn, and 6,000 feet (1,800?m) above the surface of the Moon, the LM navigation and guidance computer distracted the crew with the first of several unexpected \\"1202\\" and \\"1201\\" program alarms. Inside Mission Control Center in Houston, Texas, computer engineer Jack Garman told guidance officer Steve Bales it was safe to continue the descent, and this was relayed to the crew. The program alarms indicated \\"executive overflows\\", meaning the guidance computer could not complete all of its tasks in real time and had to postpone some of them.[20]\\r\\nDue to an error in the checklist manual, the rendezvous radar switch was placed in the wrong position. This caused it to send erroneous signals to the computer. The result was that the computer was being asked to perform all of its normal functions for landing while receiving an extra load of spurious data which used up 15% of its time. The computer (or rather the software in it) was smart enough to recognize that it was being asked to perform more tasks than it should be performing. It then sent out an alarm, which meant to the astronaut, I'm overloaded with more tasks than I should be doing at this time and I'm going to keep only the more important tasks; i.e., the ones needed for landing?... Actually, the computer was programmed to do more than recognize error conditions. A complete set of recovery programs was incorporated into the software. The software's action, in this case, was to eliminate lower priority tasks and re-establish the more important ones?... If the computer hadn't recognized this problem and taken recovery action, I doubt if Apollo 11 would have been the successful moon landing it was.[21][a]\\r\\nWhen Armstrong again looked outside, he saw that the computer's landing target was in a boulder-strewn area just north and east of a 300-meter (980?ft) diameter crater (later determined to be West crater, named for its location in the western part of the originally planned landing ellipse). Armstrong took semi-automatic control[26] and, with Aldrin calling out altitude and velocity data, landed at 20:17:40 UTC on Sunday July 20 with about 25 seconds of fuel left.[5]\\r\\nApollo 11 landed with less fuel than other missions, and the astronauts encountered a premature low fuel warning. This was later found to be the result of greater propellant 'slosh' than expected, uncovering a fuel sensor. On subsequent missions, extra anti-slosh baffles were added to the tanks to prevent this.[5]\\r\\nThroughout the descent, Aldrin had called out navigation data to Armstrong, who was busy piloting the LM. A few moments before the landing, a light informed Aldrin that at least one of the 67-inch (170?cm) probes hanging from Eagle's footpads had touched the surface, and he said: \\"Contact light!\\" Three seconds later, Eagle landed and Armstrong said \\"Shutdown.\\" Aldrin immediately said \\"Okay, engine stop. ACA ÿ out of detent.\\" Armstrong acknowledged \\"Out of detent. Auto\\" and Aldrin continued \\"Mode control ÿ both auto. Descent engine command override off. Engine arm ÿ off. 413 is in.\\"\\r\\nCharles Duke, CAPCOM during the landing phase, acknowledged their landing by saying \\"We copy you down, Eagle.\\"\\r\\nArmstrong acknowledged Aldrin's completion of the post landing checklist with \\"Engine arm is off\\", before responding to Duke with the words, \\"Houston, Tranquility Base here. The Eagle has landed.\\" Armstrong's unrehearsed[27] change of call sign from \\"Eagle\\" to \\"Tranquility Base\\" emphasized to listeners that landing was complete and successful. Duke mispronounced his reply as he expressed the relief at Mission Control: \\"Roger, Twan Tranquility, we copy you on the ground. You got a bunch of guys about to turn blue. We're breathing again. Thanks a lot.\\"[5][28]\\r\\nTwo and a half hours after landing, before preparations began for the EVA, Aldrin radioed to Earth:\\r\\nThis is the LM pilot. I'd like to take this opportunity to ask every person listening in, whoever and wherever they may be, to pause for a moment and contemplate the events of the past few hours and to give thanks in his or her own way.[29]\\r\\nHe then took communion privately. At this time NASA was still fighting a lawsuit brought by atheist Madalyn Murray O'Hair (who had objected to the Apollo 8 crew reading from the Book of Genesis) demanding that their astronauts refrain from broadcasting religious activities while in space. As such, Aldrin chose to refrain from directly mentioning taking communion on the Moon. Aldrin was an elder at the Webster Presbyterian Church, and his communion kit was prepared by the pastor of the church, the Rev. Dean Woodruff. Aldrin described communion on the Moon and the involvement of his church and pastor in the October 1970 edition of Guideposts magazine and in his book Return to Earth. Webster Presbyterian possesses the chalice used on the Moon and commemorates the event each year on the Sunday closest to July 20.[30]\\r\\nThe schedule for the mission called for the astronauts to follow the landing with a five-hour sleep period as they had been awake since early morning. However, they elected to forgo the sleep period and begin the preparations for the EVA early, thinking that they would be unable to sleep.\\r\\nThe astronauts planned placement of the Early Apollo Scientific Experiment Package (EASEP)[31] and the U.S. flag by studying their landing site through Eagle's twin triangular windows, which gave them a 60 field of view. Preparation required longer than the two hours scheduled. Armstrong initially had some difficulties squeezing through the hatch with his Portable Life Support System (PLSS). According to veteran Moon-walker John Young, a redesign of the LM to incorporate a smaller hatch had not been followed by a redesign of the PLSS backpack, so some of the highest heart rates recorded from Apollo astronauts occurred during LM egress and ingress.[32][33]\\r\\nSeveral books indicate early mission timelines had Buzz Aldrin rather than Neil Armstrong as the first man on the Moon.[34]\\r\\nAt 02:39 UTC on Monday July 21, 1969, Armstrong opened the hatch, and at 02:51 UTC began his descent to the lunar surface. The Remote Control Unit controls on his chest kept him from seeing his feet. Climbing down the nine-rung ladder, Armstrong pulled a D-ring to deploy the Modular Equipment Stowage Assembly (MESA) folded against Eagle's side and activate the TV camera, and at 02:56:15 UTC he set his left foot on the surface.[35][36] The first landing used slow-scan television incompatible with commercial TV, so it was displayed on a special monitor and a conventional TV camera viewed this monitor, significantly reducing the quality of the picture.[37] The signal was received at Goldstone in the United States but with better fidelity by Honeysuckle Creek Tracking Station in Australia. Minutes later the feed was switched to the more sensitive Parkes radio telescope in Australia.[38] Despite some technical and weather difficulties, ghostly black and white images of the first lunar EVA were received and broadcast to at least 600 million people on Earth.[39] Although copies of this video in broadcast format were saved and are widely available, recordings of the original slow scan source transmission from the lunar surface were accidentally destroyed during routine magnetic tape re-use at NASA.\\r\\nWhile still on the ladder, Armstrong uncovered a plaque mounted on the LM Descent Stage bearing two drawings of Earth (of the Western and Eastern Hemispheres), an inscription, and signatures of the astronauts and President Nixon. The inscription read:\\r\\nHere men from the planet Earth first set foot upon the Moon, July 1969 A.D. We came in peace for all mankind.\\r\\nAfter describing the surface dust as \\"very fine-grained\\" and \\"almost like a powder,\\"[36] six and a half hours after landing,[1] Armstrong stepped off Eagle's footpad and declared, \\"That's one small step for [a] man, one giant leap for mankind.\\"[b][40][41][42][43]\\r\\nArmstrong intended to say \\"That's one small step for a man\\", but the word \\"a\\" is not audible in the transmission, and thus was not initially reported by most observers of the live broadcast. When later asked about his quote, Armstrong said he believed he said \\"for a man\\", and subsequent printed versions of the quote included the \\"a\\" in square brackets. One explanation for the absence may be that his accent caused him to slur the words \\"for a\\" together; another is the intermittent nature of the audio and video links to Earth, partly because of storms near Parkes Observatory. More recent digital analysis of the tape claims to reveal the \\"a\\" may have been spoken but obscured by static.[44][45]\\r\\nAbout seven minutes after stepping onto the Moon's surface, Armstrong collected a contingency soil sample using a sample bag on a stick. He then folded the bag and tucked it into a pocket on his right thigh. This was to guarantee there would be some lunar soil brought back in case an emergency required the astronauts to abandon the EVA and return to the LM.[46]\\r\\nTwelve minutes after the contingency sample was collected,[1] Aldrin joined Armstrong on the surface, and described the view with the simple phrase, \\"Magnificent desolation.\\"[36]\\r\\nIn addition to fulfilling President Kennedy's mandate to land a man on the Moon before the end of the 1960s,[47] Apollo 11 was an engineering test of the Apollo system; therefore, Armstrong snapped photos of the LM so engineers would be able to judge its post-landing condition. He removed the TV camera from the MESA and made a panoramic sweep, then mounted it on a tripod 68 feet (21?m) from the LM. The TV camera cable remained partly coiled and presented a tripping hazard throughout the EVA.\\r\\nArmstrong said that moving in the lunar gravity, one-sixth of Earth's, was \\"even perhaps easier than the simulations?... It's absolutely no trouble to walk around.\\"[36] Aldrin joined him on the surface and tested methods for moving around, including two-footed kangaroo hops. The PLSS backpack created a tendency to tip backwards, but neither astronaut had serious problems maintaining balance. Loping became the preferred method of movement. The astronauts reported that they needed to plan their movements six or seven steps ahead. The fine soil was quite slippery. Aldrin remarked that moving from sunlight into Eagle's shadow produced no temperature change inside the suit, though the helmet was warmer in sunlight, so he felt cooler in shadow.[36]\\r\\nThe astronauts planted a specially designed U.S. flag on the lunar surface, in clear view of the TV camera. Some time later, President Richard Nixon spoke to them through a telephone-radio transmission which Nixon called \\"the most historic phone call ever made from the White House.\\"[48] Nixon originally had a long speech prepared to read during the phone call, but Frank Borman, who was at the White House as a NASA liaison during Apollo 11, convinced Nixon to keep his words brief, to respect the lunar landing as Kennedy's legacy.[49] Armstrong thanked the President, and gave a brief reflection on the significance of the moment:\\r\\nNixon: Hello, Neil and Buzz. I'm talking to you by telephone from the Oval Room at the White House. And this certainly has to be the most historic telephone call ever made. I just can't tell you how proud we all are of what you've done. For every American, this has to be the proudest day of our lives. And for people all over the world, I am sure they too join with Americans in recognizing what an immense feat this is. Because of what you have done, the heavens have become a part of man's world. And as you talk to us from the Sea of Tranquility, it inspires us to redouble our efforts to bring peace and tranquility to Earth. For one priceless moment in the whole history of man, all the people on this Earth are truly one: one in their pride in what you have done, and one in our prayers that you will return safely to Earth.\\r\\nArmstrong: Thank you, Mr. President. It's a great honor and privilege for us to be here, representing not only the United States, but men of peace of all nations, and with interest and curiosity, and men with a vision for the future. It's an honor for us to be able to participate here today.\\r\\nThe MESA failed to provide a stable work platform and was in shadow, slowing work somewhat. As they worked, the moonwalkers kicked up gray dust which soiled the outer part of their suits, the integrated thermal meteoroid garment.\\r\\nThey deployed the EASEP, which included a passive seismograph and a Lunar Ranging Retroreflector (LRRR). Then Armstrong walked 196 feet (60?m) from the LM to snap photos at the rim of Little West Crater while Aldrin collected two core tubes. He used the geological hammer to pound in the tubes ÿ the only time the hammer was used on Apollo 11. The astronauts then collected rock samples using scoops and tongs on extension handles. Many of the surface activities took longer than expected, so they had to stop documenting sample collection halfway through the allotted 34 minutes.\\r\\nThree new minerals were discovered in the rock samples collected by the astronauts: armalcolite, tranquillityite, and pyroxferroite. Armalcolite was named after Armstrong, Aldrin, and Collins.\\r\\nDuring this period, Mission Control used a coded phrase to warn Armstrong that his metabolic rates were high and that he should slow down. He was moving rapidly from task to task as time ran out. However, as metabolic rates remained generally lower than expected for both astronauts throughout the walk, Mission Control granted the astronauts a 15-minute extension.[50] In a 2010 interview, Armstrong, who had walked a maximum of 196 feet (60?m) from the LM, explained that NASA limited the first moonwalk's time and distance because there was no empirical proof of how much cooling water the astronauts' PLSS backpacks would consume to handle their body heat generation while working on the Moon.[51]\\r\\nAldrin entered Eagle first. With some difficulty the astronauts lifted film and two sample boxes containing 21.55 kilograms (47.5?lb) of lunar surface material to the LM hatch using a flat cable pulley device called the Lunar Equipment Conveyor. Armstrong reminded Aldrin of a bag of memorial items in his suit pocket sleeve, and Aldrin tossed the bag down; Armstrong then jumped to the ladder's third rung and climbed into the LM. After transferring to LM life support, the explorers lightened the ascent stage for return to lunar orbit by tossing out their PLSS backpacks, lunar overshoes, one Hasselblad camera, and other equipment. They then pressurized the LM and settled down to sleep.[52]\\r\\nPresident Nixon's speech writer William Safire had prepared In Event of Moon Disaster for the President to read on television in the event the Apollo 11 astronauts were stranded on the Moon.[53] The contingency plan originated in a memo from Safire to Nixon's White House Chief of Staff H. R. Haldeman, in which Safire suggested a protocol the administration might follow in reaction to such a disaster.[54][55] According to the plan, Mission Control would \\"close down communications\\" with the LM, and a clergyman would \\"commend their souls to the deepest of the deep\\" in a public ritual likened to burial at sea. The last line of the prepared text contained an allusion to Rupert Brooke's First World War poem, \\"The Soldier\\".[55] The plan included presidential telephone calls to the astronauts' wives.\\r\\nWhile moving within the cabin, Aldrin accidentally damaged the circuit breaker that would arm the main engine for lift off from the Moon. There was concern this would prevent firing the engine, stranding them on the Moon. Fortunately, a felt-tip pen was sufficient to activate the switch.[52] Had this not worked, the Lunar Module circuitry could have been reconfigured to allow firing the ascent engine.[56]\\r\\nAfter about seven hours of rest, the crew was awakened by Houston to prepare for the return flight. Two and a half hours later, at 17:54 UTC, they lifted off in Eagle's ascent stage to rejoin Collins aboard Columbia in lunar orbit.\\r\\nAfter more than 21? total hours on the lunar surface, they had left behind scientific instruments that included a retroreflector array used for the Lunar Laser Ranging Experiment and a Passive Seismic Experiment Package used to measure moonquakes. They also left an Apollo 1 mission patch, and a memorial bag containing a gold replica of an olive branch as a traditional symbol of peace and a silicon message disk. The disk carries the goodwill statements by Presidents Eisenhower, Kennedy, Johnson, and Nixon and messages from leaders of 73 countries around the world. The disc also carries a listing of the leadership of the US Congress, a listing of members of the four committees of the House and Senate responsible for the NASA legislation, and the names of NASA's past and present top management.[57] (In his 1989 book, Men from Earth, Aldrin says that the items included Soviet medals commemorating Cosmonauts Vladimir Komarov and Yuri Gagarin.) Also, according to Deke Slayton's book Moonshot, Armstrong carried with him a special diamond-studded astronaut pin from Slayton.\\r\\nFilm taken from the LM Ascent Stage upon liftoff from the Moon reveals the American flag, planted some 25 feet (8?m) from the descent stage, whipping violently in the exhaust of the ascent stage engine. Aldrin looked up in time to witness the flag topple:[1] \\"The ascent stage of the LM separated?... I was concentrating on the computers, and Neil was studying the attitude indicator, but I looked up long enough to see the flag fall over.\\"[18] Subsequent Apollo missions usually planted the American flags at least 100 feet (30?m) from the LM to prevent them being blown over by the ascent engine exhaust.\\r\\nAfter rendezvous with Columbia, Eagle's ascent stage was jettisoned into lunar orbit on July 21, 1969, at 23:41 UTC. Just before the Apollo 12 flight, it was noted that Eagle was still likely to be orbiting the Moon. Later NASA reports mentioned that Eagle's orbit had decayed, resulting in it impacting in an \\"uncertain location\\" on the lunar surface.[58] The location is uncertain because the Eagle ascent stage was not tracked after it was jettisoned, and the lunar gravity field is sufficiently non-uniform to make the orbit of the spacecraft unpredictable after a short time. NASA estimated that the orbit had decayed within months and would have impacted on the Moon.\\r\\nOn July 23, the last night before splashdown, the three astronauts made a television broadcast in which Collins commented:\\r\\n...?The Saturn V rocket which put us in orbit is an incredibly complicated piece of machinery, every piece of which worked flawlessly?... We have always had confidence that this equipment will work properly. All this is possible only through the blood, sweat, and tears of a number of a people?... All you see is the three of us, but beneath the surface are thousands and thousands of others, and to all of those, I would like to say, \\"Thank you very much.\\"\\r\\nAldrin added:\\r\\nThis has been far more than three men on a mission to the Moon; more, still, than the efforts of a government and industry team; more, even, than the efforts of one nation. We feel that this stands as a symbol of the insatiable curiosity of all mankind to explore the unknown?... Personally, in reflecting on the events of the past several days, a verse from Psalms comes to mind. \\"When I consider the heavens, the work of Thy fingers, the Moon and the stars, which Thou hast ordained; What is man that Thou art mindful of him?\\"\\r\\nArmstrong concluded:\\r\\nThe responsibility for this flight lies first with history and with the giants of science who have preceded this effort; next with the American people, who have, through their will, indicated their desire; next with four administrations and their Congresses, for implementing that will; and then, with the agency and industry teams that built our spacecraft, the Saturn, the Columbia, the Eagle, and the little EMU, the spacesuit and backpack that was our small spacecraft out on the lunar surface. We would like to give special thanks to all those Americans who built the spacecraft; who did the construction, design, the tests, and put their hearts and all their abilities into those craft. To those people tonight, we give a special thank you, and to all the other people that are listening and watching tonight, God bless you. Good night from Apollo 11.[18]\\r\\nOn the return to Earth, a bearing at the Guam tracking station failed, potentially preventing communication on the last segment of the Earth return. A regular repair was not possible in the available time but the station director, Charles Force, had his ten-year-old son Greg use his small hands to reach into the housing and pack it with grease. Greg later was thanked by Armstrong.[59]\\r\\nOn July 24, the astronauts returned home aboard the Command Module Columbia just before dawn local time (16:51 UTC[4]) at 1319N 1699W? / ?13.317N 169.150W? / 13.317; -169.150? (Apollo 11 splashdown), in the Pacific Ocean 2,660?km (1,440?nmi) east of Wake Island, 380?km (210?nmi) south of Johnston Atoll, and 24?km (13?nmi) from the recovery ship, USS?Hornet.[1]\\r\\nAt 16:44 UTC the drogue parachutes had been deployed and seven minutes later the Command Module struck the water forcefully. During splashdown, the Command Module landed upside down but was righted within 10 minutes by flotation bags triggered by the astronauts. \\"Everything's okay. Our checklist is complete. Awaiting swimmers\\", was Armstrong's last official transmission from the Columbia. A diver from the Navy helicopter hovering above attached a sea anchor to the Command Module to prevent it from drifting. Additional divers attached flotation collars to stabilize the module and position rafts for astronaut extraction. Though the chance of bringing back pathogens from the lunar surface was considered remote, it was considered a possibility and NASA took great precautions at the recovery site. Divers provided the astronauts with Biological Isolation Garments (BIGs) which were worn until they reached isolation facilities on board the Hornet. Additionally, astronauts were rubbed down with a sodium hypochlorite solution and the Command Module wiped with Betadine to remove any lunar dust that might be present. The raft containing decontamination materials was then intentionally sunk.[60]\\r\\nA second Sea King helicopter hoisted the astronauts aboard one by one, where a NASA flight surgeon gave each a brief physical check during the 0.5 nautical miles (930?m) trip back to the Hornet.\\r\\nAfter touchdown on the Hornet, the astronauts exited the helicopter, leaving the flight surgeon and three crewmen. The helicopter was then lowered into hangar bay #2 where the astronauts walked the 30 feet (9.1?m) to the Mobile Quarantine Facility (MQF) where they would begin their 21 days of quarantine. This practice would continue for two more Apollo missions, Apollo 12 and Apollo 14, before the Moon was proven to be barren of life and the quarantine process dropped.[60][61]\\r\\nPresident Richard Nixon was aboard Hornet to personally welcome the astronauts back to Earth. He told the astronauts, \\"As a result of what you've done, the world has never been closer together before.\\"[62] After Nixon departed, the Hornet was brought alongside the five-ton Command Module where it was placed aboard by the ship's crane, placed on a dolly and moved next to the MQF. The Hornet sailed for Pearl Harbor where the Command Module and MQF were airlifted to the Manned Spacecraft Center.[60]\\r\\nIn accordance with the recently promulgated Extra-Terrestrial Exposure Law, the astronauts were placed in quarantine for fear that the Moon might contain undiscovered pathogens and that the astronauts might have been exposed to them during their Moon walks. However, after almost three weeks in confinement (first in their trailer and later in the Lunar Receiving Laboratory at the Manned Spacecraft Center), the astronauts were given a clean bill of health.[63] On August 10, 1969,[clarification needed] the astronauts exited quarantine.[citation needed]\\r\\nOn August 13, they rode in parades in their honor in New York, Chicago, and Los Angeles. On the same evening in Los Angeles there was an official State Dinner to celebrate the flight, attended by members of Congress, 44 governors, the Chief Justice of the United States, and ambassadors from 83 nations at the Century Plaza Hotel. President Richard Nixon and Vice President Spiro T. Agnew honored each astronaut with a presentation of the Presidential Medal of Freedom. This celebration was the beginning of a 45-day \\"Giant Leap\\" tour that brought the astronauts to 25 foreign countries and included visits with prominent leaders such as Queen Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom. Many nations honored the first manned Moon landing with special features in magazines or by issuing Apollo 11 commemorative postage stamps or coins.[64][65]\\r\\nOn September 16, 1969, the three astronauts spoke before a joint session of Congress on Capitol Hill. They presented two US flags, one to the House of Representatives and the other to the Senate, that had been carried to the surface of the Moon with them.\\r\\nThe Soviet Union was secretly[citation needed] attempting to compete with the US in landing a man on the Moon but had been hampered by repeated failures in development of a launcher comparable to the Saturn V.[66] Meanwhile, they tried to beat the US to return lunar material to the Earth by means of unmanned probes. On July 13, three days before Apollo 11's launch, they launched Luna 15, which reached lunar orbit before Apollo 11. During descent, a malfunction caused Luna 15 to crash in Mare Crisium about two hours before Armstrong and Aldrin took off from the Moon's surface to begin their voyage home. The Jodrell Bank Observatory radio telescope in England was later discovered to have recorded transmissions from Luna 15 during its descent, and this was published in July 2009 on the 40th anniversary of Apollo 11.[67]\\r\\nThe Command Module Columbia was displayed at the National Air and Space Museum (NASM), Washington, D.C. It was in the central Milestones of Flight exhibition hall in front of the Jefferson Drive entrance, sharing the main hall with other pioneering flight vehicles such as the Wright Flyer, the Spirit of St. Louis, the Bell X-1, the North American X-15, Mercury spacecraft Friendship 7, and Gemini 4. Armstrong's and Aldrin's space suits are displayed in the museum's Apollo to the Moon exhibit. The quarantine trailer, the flotation collar, and the righting spheres are displayed at the Smithsonian's Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center annex near Washington Dulles International Airport in Chantilly, Virginia.\\r\\nIn 2009, the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) imaged the various Apollo landing sites on the surface of the Moon, for the first time with sufficient resolution to see the descent stages of the lunar modules, scientific instruments, and foot trails made by the astronauts.\\r\\nIn March 2012 a team of specialists financed by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos located the F-1 engines that launched Apollo 11 into space. The engines were found below the Atlantic Ocean's surface through the use of advanced sonar scanning.[68] His team brought parts of two of the five engines to the surface. In July 2013, a conservator discovered a serial number under the rust on one of the engines raised from the Atlantic, which NASA confirmed was from the Apollo 11 launch.[69][70]\\r\\nColumbia was moved in 2017 to the NASM Mary Baker Engen Restoration Hangar at the Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center in Chantilly, VA, to be readied for a four-city tour titled Destination Moon: The Apollo 11 Mission. This will include Space Center Houston (October 14, 2017, to March 18, 2018), the Saint Louis Science Center (April 14 to September 3, 2018), the Senator John Heinz History Center in Pittsburgh (September 29, 2018, to February 18, 2019), and the Seattle Museum of Flight (March 16 to September 2, 2019).[71][72]\\r\\nOn July 15, 2009, Life.com released a photo gallery of previously unpublished photos of the astronauts taken by Life photographer Ralph Morse prior to the Apollo 11 launch.[73]\\r\\nFrom July 16ÿ24, 2009, NASA streamed the original mission audio on its website in real time 40 years to the minute after the events occurred.[74] In addition, it is in the process of restoring the video footage and has released a preview of key moments.[75]\\r\\nOn July 20, 2009, the crew of Armstrong, Aldrin, and Collins met with U.S. President Barack Obama at the White House.[76] \\"We expect that there is, as we speak, another generation of kids out there who are looking up at the sky and are going to be the next Armstrong, Collins and Aldrin\\", Obama said. \\"We want to make sure that NASA is going to be there for them when they want to take their journey.\\"[77]\\r\\nThe John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum set up a Flash website that rebroadcasts the transmissions of Apollo 11 from launch to landing on the Moon.[78]\\r\\nA group of British scientists interviewed as part of the anniversary events reflected on the significance of the Moon landing:\\r\\nIt was carried out in a technically brilliant way with risks taken?... that would be inconceivable in the risk-averse world of today?... The Apollo programme is arguably the greatest technical achievement of mankind to date?... nothing since Apollo has come close [to] the excitement that was generated by those astronauts ÿ Armstrong, Aldrin and the 10 others who followed them.[79]\\r\\nOn August 7, 2009, an act of Congress awarded the three astronauts a Congressional Gold Medal, the highest civilian award in the United States. The bill was sponsored by Florida Sen. Bill Nelson and Florida Rep. Alan Grayson.[80][81]\\r\\nIn July 2010, air-to-ground voice recordings and film footage shot in Mission Control during the Apollo 11 powered descent and landing was re-synchronised and released for the first time.[82]\\r\\nSpectators camp out to watch the launch\\r\\nSeating credential issued to viewers of the Apollo 11 launch\\r\\nLaunch Control Center before liftoff\\r\\nCollins, Aldrin and Armstrong consult with pad leader Guenter Wendt after Countdown Demonstration Test\\r\\nRoll-out of Saturn V AS-505 from the Vehicle Assembly Building to the launch pad\\r\\nThe Earth as seen from Apollo 11 on the third day out\\r\\nNeil Armstrong describes the Moon's surface before setting foot on it\\r\\nPresident Nixon speaks to Armstrong and Aldrin from the Oval Office\\r\\nThe Washington Post on Monday, July 21, 1969: \\"'The Eagle Has Landed'Two Men Walk on the Moon\\"\\r\\nNeil Armstrong's certification: \\"I certify that this World Scout Badge was carried to the surface of the Moon on man's first lunar landing, Apollo XI, July 20, 1969.\\"\\r\\nFirst Man on the Moon Commemorative Issue of 1969\\r\\nApollo 11 crew at the White House in 2004\\r\\n?This article incorporates?public domain material from websites or documents of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.\\r\\nFor young readers\\r\\nNASA reports\\r\\nMultimedia","input":"Who was the first american on the moon?"},{"output":"Acts of the Apostles","context":"","input":"When was saul paul first mentioned in the bible?"},{"output":"begun in 1892, completed in 1899","context":"","input":"When was the old post office in washington dc built?"},{"output":"Preston Burke","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nChief Medical Officer at Klausman Institute for Medical Research  \\r\\nSmith College, BA.\\r\\nStanford MD, first of her class.\\r\\nBerkeley, Phd. Biochemistry (S02E20, Band-Aid Covers The Bullet Hole)\\r\\n\\r\\nCristina Yang, M.D., Ph.D., is a fictional character from the medical drama television series Grey's Anatomy, which has aired for over 14 years on the American Broadcasting Company (ABC) in the United States. The character was created by series producer Shonda Rhimes, and is portrayed by actress Sandra Oh. Introduced as a surgical intern at the fictional Seattle Grace Hospital, Yang worked her way up to resident level, eventually becoming a cardiothoracic surgical fellow, while her relationships with colleagues Meredith Grey (Ellen Pompeo), George O'Malley (T. R. Knight), Izzie Stevens (Katherine Heigl), and Alex Karev (Justin Chambers) formed a focal point of the series. Yang earlier in the series got engaged to Preston Burke (Isaiah Washington), in the past had a relationship with renowned surgeon and mentor Colin Marlow, and wed but later divorced Owen Hunt (Kevin McKidd).\\r\\n\\r\\nOh originally auditioned for the role of Miranda Bailey, although Chandra Wilson was ultimately cast in the part. Oh has received generally positive reviews for her portrayal, with Mark Perigard of the Boston Herald considering her friendship with Meredith to be \\"the secret core of Grey's\\". Oh has also garnered numerous awards and nominations for her role as Yang, including Golden Globe and Screen Actors Guild Award wins in 2006. She was additionally nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series each year, from 2005 to 2009. Characterizing the character, ABC noted her competitiveness, ambition, and intelligence as her main traits, while her aggressive, and tactless attitude was highlighted as her main weakness. In May 2012, E! Online reported that Oh had signed on for two more years, along with her fellow cast members. Oh left the show after season 10, and her character Cristina Yang was written out of the storyline as a main cast member.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nCristina Yang is introduced as a graduate from Smith College and a fellow surgical intern to Meredith Grey (Ellen Pompeo), Izzie Stevens (Katherine Heigl), George O'Malley (T.R. Knight), and Alex Karev (Justin Chambers); the five of them working under Miranda Bailey (Chandra Wilson). An atheistic competitive intern of Korean-American ancestry, she first desired to become a doctor after a childhood car accident which killed her biological father. Yang also suffers from dyslexia, and was raised in Beverly Hills, California by her mother and supportive Jewish stepfather. She has BA from Smith College, an MD from Stanford University and a PhD from University of California, Berkeley, making her a \\"double doctor\\". While her emotional pragmatism, competitive perfectionism, and logical nature lead many to view her as a cutthroat \\"robot\\", Cristina hits it off with Meredith on their first day and the pair soon become best friends and each other's \\"person\\", sharing the same \\"dark and twisty\\" sense of humor.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring her internship, Cristina has an on-off relationship with the chief of cardiothoracic surgery Preston Burke (Isaiah Washington) that leads to an accidental pregnancy. Yang schedules an abortion without telling him about the pregnancy due to Burke's behavior towards their lack of relationship status. However, Yang experiences an ectopic pregnancy and Burke discovers the pregnancy after Yang collapses from a burst fallopian tube. Burke and Yang begin a relationship in the aftermath of her miscarriage. After Burke is shot in the arm and develops a hand tremor, Yang helps him cover it up by developing a covert partnership wherein she performs most of his surgeries. Yang initially denies involvement during a confrontation, but then confesses everything to Richard Webber (James Pickens, Jr.), the chief of surgery. Yang's actions jeopardize Burke's chances of becoming chief, which he sees as a huge betrayal. After a short breakup, Yang breaks the silence and Burke proposes marriage, which Yang accepts after eight days of hesitation. Burke calls off the wedding, leaving Yang at the altar. She goes on her honeymoon to Hawaii with Meredith to recover, returning to discover that Burke has disappeared from her life and transferred to a different hospital.\\r\\n\\r\\nBurke is replaced by Erica Hahn (Brooke Smith), who immediately dislikes Yang for her trend of having affairs with famous surgeons, such as Burke, going so far as refusing to let her scrub in on cardiac surgeries. Eventually, Callie Torres (Sara Ramirez) moves in with Yang, and she still tries to earn Hahn's approval. Hahn reveals that she dislikes Yang because she reminds her of an early version of herself and continues to cut Yang out of cardio surgeries and neglects to teach her, before eventually quitting the hospital and leaving Seattle Grace without a head of cardio.  Without a teacher, Yang begins to seriously doubt the purpose of remaining in her place at Seattle Grace when the program falls to twelfth on a list of the best teaching hospitals, and Burke wins the Harper-Avery award without mentioning her at all, despite her saving his career. Yang tells the Chief that her current existence in the hospital is \\"unbearable\\" and that she has turned into a ghost.\\r\\n\\r\\nYang meets Owen Hunt (Kevin McKidd), an army trauma surgeon, when he patches her up from being stabbed in the stomach by a falling icicle. The pair are immediately attracted to each other and share a brief kiss. After Owen Hunt is honorably discharged, he is hired as Seattle Grace's chief of trauma surgery and he and Yang begin a flirtation. Yang grows emotionally when she decides to support Meredith in her relationship with Derek Shepherd (Patrick Dempsey), despite her logical misgivings about their staying power, and begins to be more emotionally open towards Hunt. However, Hunt has repressed memories of his time in Iraq and PTSD which causes Hunt to behave erratically, and attack and strangle her while asleep. Yang attempts to be emotionally supportive, but ends their relationship as she is afraid of sleeping next to him. Cristina loses her shot at being the first resident to perform a solo surgery despite being unanimously chosen by the attending surgeons, having been disciplined from failing to report the irresponsible behavior of the new interns. Meredith and Cristina have a fight during the intern scandal, and Cristina chooses Alex to be her replacement. They eventually reconcile. When Izzie Stevens discovers her life-threatening cancer, Yang is the one she confides in over her other friends due to Yang's ability to remain emotionally distant. Yang saves Izzie's life by coming up with a treatment plan and forcing Izzie to tell their friends of her diagnosis. Hunt begins seeing a therapist, and Yang confesses her love for him. The pair begin a tentative relationship, hampered by Hunt's therapeutic progress and his hot and cold professional behavior, wherein he frequently ignores or penalizes Yang to avoid the appearance of favoritism.\\r\\n\\r\\nHunt hires ex-colleague from the Army, Teddy Altman (Kim Raver), to become the chief of cardio-thoracic surgery as a \\"gift\\" for Yang, after she breaks down over having no new head of cardio. Yang is unimpressed with Altman, neither published nor famous, but her calm proficiency and belief in Yang's skills win her over. A conflict arises in the trio due to Altman and Hunt's repressed feelings for each other. Altman chooses to resign her place as temporary head of cardio because of her feelings for Hunt. Devastated by the blow to her education and the depressing potential of returning to her previous directionless state, Yang begs Altman to stay and teach her, offering Hunt to Altman in exchange. Altman intellectually understands Yang choosing her gift over a man and their relationship is repaired, but Hunt is very hurt that Yang would trade him away. Hunt subconsciously tries to sabotage Yang's education and the two break up again after Hunt is unable to decide between the two women. Cristina saves Derek's life with a gun to her head after he is shot by Gary Clarke, a grieving widow who commits mass murder at the hospital. Hunt is injured by the same shooter after he chooses to return for Yang over Altman, and Grey treats him as Yang saves Grey's husband. Following the attack on the hospital, Hunt and Yang impulsively decide to get married. Yang is suffering from severe PTSD and is unable to bear being alone, making marriage to Hunt, who understands what she's going through, attractive. Yang spends the early days of her marriage in shock and hiding at Meredith's.\\r\\n\\r\\nDue to having severe PTSD and being unable to do her job correctly anymore, Cristina quits and begins bartending and eventually throws a housewarming party. Derek helps Cristina emotionally and she ultimately decides to go to work after helping the victim of a school shooting. Yang discovers she is pregnant with Hunt's child, and decides to get an abortion. Though Hunt accompanies her to the abortion, he is extremely angry with her decision. Yang then operates on Henry Burton (Scott Foley), Altman's husband, unknown of his identity. When the surgery fails and he dies, Yang is guilt stricken upon learning of her patient's identity. Altman forgives Yang and forces Yang to realize that she did everything possible. Altman's mentorship of Yang is punishing at times, and Altman brutally emphasizes that Yang must learn patience, compassion, and the basics over the flashy surgeries Yang prefers. Altman's tutelage is successful, and Yang evolves into an aware and well-rounded surgeon because of it. Altman allows Yang to come up with a wish list of dream surgeries to fulfill before Altman resigns and moves on.\\r\\n\\r\\nYang and Hunt distance themselves from each other as they keep fighting over the abortion, despite attending marriage counselling. Hunt has a one-night stand with a patient's friend, leaving Yang heartbroken. She decides to move on, unsure of her future with him. As the end of the fifth year of residency is near, the surgical residents, including Yang, prepare for their medical boards and for the different fellowships they plan on joining. After she passes her exams, Yang reconciles with Hunt and tells him she is leaving Seattle for the Mayo Clinic, Minnesota. Afterward, Yang, Meredith, Shepherd, Arizona Robbins (Jessica Capshaw), Mark Sloan (Eric Dane), and Lexie Grey (Chyler Leigh) are involved in an aviation accident while on the way to Boise, Idaho to perform surgery on conjoined twins. Lexie dies, and Mark later succumbs to his injuries after they are rescued and dies. Following their rescue, Yang, traumatized, suffers from brief reactive psychosis which provokes violent outbursts and makes her unresponsive. Yang leaves Seattle to become a cardiothoracic surgical fellow and goes, as planned, to the Mayo Clinic, but has difficulties adapting to her new colleagues' way of working. While in Minnesota, Yang develops a friendship with a near-retirement cardio surgeon, Craig Thomas (William Daniels). She mainly teases him with comments regarding his old age. She also begins an affair with the head of surgery Dr. Parker (Steven Culp) who has issues with Thomas. After Thomas dies from a heart attack, Yang returns to Seattle.\\r\\n\\r\\nCristina is re-hired and Owen asks for a divorce once Cristina wants to reconcile. Shocked, Cristina agrees, but later finds out that the potential conflict of interest regarding the plane crash lawsuit was a key motive behind Owen's request and confronts him. Owen tells her that he 'feels responsible' and was worried as he thought she was dead. They have a sexual relationship after divorcing. The hospital is sued and found guilty of negligence. The surviving doctors, including Yang, must receive $15 million of compensation each, which leads the hospital to a near bankruptcy as the insurers refuse to pay. Yang, Callie Torres (Sara Ramirez), and the other surviving doctors buy the hospital with the help of the Harper-Avery Foundation to prevent it from closing, and each become members of the new directing board. After buying the hospital, Yang realizes that she was made for the O.R. and breaks things off with Owen because he still wants kids and she still doesn't.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter breaking up with Owen, Cristina continues to excel at surgery and becomes de facto chief of cardio. Although supportive of Meredith's choice to become a mother, Cristina points out the fact that it has hurt Meredith's career and clinical judgement. This causes a wedge in their friendship. Grey attempts to catch up professionally with a research trial, but the divide widens when Cristina's trial overshadows Grey's and steals Grey's resources. When Dr. Shane Ross, a second-year resident, stands up to Meredith for her, Cristina gives Shane a kiss. Later, she begins sleeping with him, as well as becoming his mentor and passing on the skills learned from Altman. Cristina's project is immensely successful and she is informed that she could be considered for the Harper Avery award from her 3-D printing of a heart conduit. Grey and Yang reconcile when Grey acknowledges that Yang is correct, she has surpassed Grey, and that Grey is jealous of Yang's professional freedom and success, while her own is hampered by her family.\\r\\n\\r\\nCristina is nominated for the Harper Avery award and is a strong candidate, however she is passed over due to her relationship with the Harper-Avery Foundation that co-owns the hospital. Cristina goes to speak at a hospital in Zurich, Switzerland, orchestrated by Preston Burke who built his own hospital following his winning of the Harper Avery. He offers Cristina his job as the head of the hospital so that he can spend more time with his wife and kids.\\r\\n\\r\\nCristina accepts the offer and interviews candidates for her replacement position at the hospital, including Maggie Pierce for new chief of cardio. Cristina transfers her hospital shares to Alex Karev and recommends he take over her seat on the board.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the end of season 10, she says goodbye to her fellow co-workers she has come to know and love including Owen and Meredith. Cristina and Meredith share special moments together reminiscing about all the horrors they went through and dancing it out one last time. Cristina leaves for Zurich with surgical intern Shane Ross, who chooses to leave in order to study under her in Switzerland.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the creation of Yang, Shonda Rhimes said the character contained \\"a little bit of [her] personality\\".[2] Speaking with talk show host Oprah Winfrey, Rhimes said: \\"Cristina was second, simply because she's the kind of woman I know really well, and I like her. There's something interesting about a person who is that driven, a little bit emotionally disconnected but still a caring, sweet, and smart individual you could be friends with.\\"[3] Sandra Oh, initially auditioned for the character of Bailey, adding: \\"Thank God I did not get that part\\", explaining the show would not be the same without fellow cast member, Wilson.[4] Discussing casting Oh as Yang, Rhimes said: \\"She brought this energy that felt very fresh. From the beginning, I've been shaping Cristina around Sandra a little bit. One of my favorite things to do is take as much of her dialogue out of a scene as possible because she does so much nonverbally. Then I just watch what she manages to do without having a word to say.\\"[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe character of Yang was not originally supposed to be of Asian descent. Oh said her character was \\"a pert little blonde and the thing is the woman who runs the show, Shonda Rhimes, is a black woman, which makes a big [expletive] difference.\\"[5] In 2009, when asked why Oh signed on for Grey's Anatomy, Oh said:\\r\\n\\r\\nThe American Broadcasting Company (ABC) characterized Yang as \\"competitive\\", \\"ambitious\\", and \\"intelligent\\", while also noting her weaknesses: \\"bossy\\", \\"aggressive\\", and \\"tactless\\".[8] Oh said of her character: \\"I've always tried to play Cristina with a tremendous amount of focus and ambitionwhich is the reality for a female surgeon. I mean, in real life there aren't many of them. But the ones you encounter are at the very top of their game. You have to have a kind of ascetic personality to survive.\\"[9] James Pickens, Jr. who portrays Dr. Webber said: \\"That character itself set a bar in terms of how we look at millennial women: independent yet vulnerable, seriously competitive yet caring.\\"[10] Rhimes referred to Yang's relationship with Burke by the portmanteau \\"Burktina\\", citing \\"Losing My Religion\\" as one of her favorite episodes featuring them because it shows their evolution from the beginning of the second season to its end.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nRhimes commented, \\"[We see] her struggle to suppress all of her humanity in pursuit of perfection. And in my mind, what we realize is that she is not cold. She is terrified. Scared that if she lets her emotions out, they will overtake her and she will be hurt. And you cant hate her. Because it's so incredibly human and understandable.\\"[11] Yang's friendship with Meredith has been looked upon as \\"sisterhood\\", and Yang has repeatedly referred to the former as \\"her person\\". This led to the two being dubbed \\"the twisted sisters\\". At the conclusion of season three, the duo went on a \\"honeymoon\\" together, and Rhimes called it her favorite detail of the finale.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nNew York magazine wrote of the character: \\"There's probably no woman on TV right now more single-mindedly dedicated to her career than Cristina. It has long been her defining characteristic. If it occasionally makes her into a caricature, it has also unquestionably established that she would have an abortion in this circumstance.\\"[13] Talking about Yang's abortion in the eighth season, Rhimes explained she intended Yang to have an abortion already in the second season but changed it with an ectopic pregnancy at the suggestion of one of her writers because  \\"that was so much more interesting, story-wise\\". As for the abortion in the eighth season, Rhimes commented: \\"I really wanted Cristina Yang to stay true to who Cristina Yang is. And I feel like that is a character who has never really wanted to be a mother. The idea that this woman would have a child that she did not want and resented for ruining her career and resented Owen for making her have [it] would have been hideous. [The abortion] made sense for the character.\\"[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nDiscussing his onscreen relationship with Yang, McKidd said: \\"It's not going to be easy for them. What I read when I read the season premiere, and this is just my take on it, is that it was very much two very analytical people, Owen and Cristina. They're very similar in a way, I think, as people. Two analytical people see each other over a crowded ER room and their eyes meet.\\"[15] On the topic of Yang's triumphs and challenges in the eighth season, Oh said: \\"It has been an extremely challenging year that has had a lot of ups and downs, both challenging and exhilarating. We would shoot all our scenes for a day or two straight, and that was extremely challenging because emotionally and physically it becomes really exhausting.\\"[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nOh said of Yang's expressions of emotions during season eight: \\"You see her express her emotions with only two people: her best friend Meredith and her husband Owen. To see someone being pulled apart so intensely, which honestly most everyone goes through in their life in some ways, if you're lucky you're completely pulled apart and then you have to pull yourself together, which hopefully will be the exploration within hopefully the next season.\\"[16] Although the characters' marriage is tested, McKidd reported to The Hollywood Reporter: \\"I think they're meant for each other. I hold out faith in Cristina and Owen, even though they go to the darkest places out of all the couples on the show. It's going to get worse but it's going to get better soon.\\"[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe character was well received by the critics at the time of its inception and as the series  went on the reviews became increasingly positive and Cristina went on the become an iconic character not just for Grey's but for television itself. Kelli Catana of The Huffington Post named Yang \\"the best damn character\\" of the series.[18] Yang appeared in Comcast's list of TV's Most Intriguing Characters, with the website commenting that she is \\"an engaging yet comedic factor for the prime-time soap Grey's Anatomy.\\"[19] Philadelphia Magazine included Yang in its list of the \\"10 Best Doctors on Television\\".[20] However, the same periodical listed her as one of \\"The 12 Most Annoying Women on TV\\".[21] Mark Perigard of the Boston Herald considers her friendship with Meredith to be \\"the secret core of Grey's and perhaps creator Shonda Rhimes' greatest contribution to prime time.\\"[22] The Huffington Post's writer Kelli Catana agreed, saying: \\"the Meredith/Yang relationship is probably the most true friendship on network television.\\"[18] Their friendship was listed in AOL TV's \\"Top 20: TV's Best BFFs\\" and in Entertainment Weekly's \\"30 Best TV Bromances/Gal Pals\\".[23][24] Yahoo! Voices also put Yang on their list of \\"The Most Loyal TV Best Friends of All Time\\".[25] Television Without Pity writer Lauren Shotwell claimed Yang is \\"the only one of these five [residents] that regularly acts like an actual doctor\\".[26]\\r\\n\\r\\nYang's relationship with Burke was positively received; it was considered as \\"one of the most interesting relationships on the show\\".[27] Similarly, The Orange County Register wrote that their romance became \\"one of the most touching and funny attractions of Grey's Anatomy.\\"[28] Christopher Monfette of IGN was critical of their wedding planning in the third season, saying: \\"The will-they's and won't-they's fly and fall like hobbled pigeons until the season finale when the show solves both its personal and professional problems in the most obvious and least compelling of ways.\\"[29] UGO.com placed their break-up on its list of the most horrible TV breakups.[30] In 2009, Monfette said of Yang's relationship with Owen: \\"[Hunt's] interactions with Cristina were perfectly balanced for optimum drama, never together and never apart for so long that the back-and-forth became frustrating. Viewers could clearly see a softening of the typically hard-edged Cristina, a pleasant change for what had become something of a one-note character.\\"[31]\\r\\n\\r\\nJennifer Armstrong of Entertainment Weekly also praised the pairing, especially in \\"Elevator Love Letter\\", saying: \\"As good as they've been at amping up the romance crackling between Owen and Cristina, Kevin McKidd and Sandra Oh brought the Emmy consideration tonight from scene 1.\\"[32] She also added: \\"I loved seeing Cristina at least try to stand by her man.\\"[32] Of Yang and Owen's wedding, Armstrong said: \\"Glad we made a clean disposal of the Teddy-Owen-Cristina love triangle, though, when he quipped to Teddy, \\"I heard there's a guy,\\" and she said she was happy for him.\\"[33] She also praised Owen's proposal scene, giving it an \\"A\\".[33] Later, she praised their marriage, saying: \\"I am absolutely loving the stronger-than-ever lady-bond between these two this season. Is it because they're both married now? Just growing up? Whatever, it's the opposite of Blair and Serena's annoyingly fickle frenemy status on Gossip Girl, and I cant get enough.\\"[34]\\r\\n\\r\\nNew York Magazine praised the abortion storyline, saying that the show \\"was brave enough to do what almost no other series will: show this one particular, totally legal medical procedure on TV\\" and that the abortion was \\"the only plausible resolution\\" for Yang's pregnancy.[13] Tanner Stransky, also of Entertainment Weekly, said of Yang's actions after Owen's affair: \\"It alternately seems silly and not silly, when you really think about it.\\"[35] Robert Bianco of USA Today praised Yang's storylines in the eighth season, saying: \\"Their stories are effectively tied into that of a patient whose ability to move forward is complicated by a complex response to a hideous past.\\"[36] HitFix writer Liane Bonin Starr applauded Yang's brief departure from Seattle Grace to Mayo Clinic in the ninth season, which was \\"interesting\\" as \\"it showed us a new side of herand after so many seasons, that was some welcome insight.\\"[37]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe relation between Meredith and Cristina has been acclaimed and been a highlight of the show. Mark Perigard of the Boston Herald considered the friendship to be \\"the secret core of Grey's\\". Aisha Harris of Slate called their relation The Best Female Friendship on TV adding that \\"With those two characters, showrunner Shonda Rhimes and her team of writers created one of the most nuanced and realistic portrayals of female friendship on television.\\"[38] Samantha Highfill of Entertainment Weekly called Cristina and Meredith the best female friends on TV because \\"they don't try to be\\". There's nothing fake about them, which is a rarity in how female friends are portrayed on television. She further went on to call them 'soulmates', \\"And even though theyd never dare get sappy enough to say it, they're soul mates.[39] Margaret Lyons of Vulture (magazine) called the friendship \\"dream BFF relationship.\\" and the primary focus of the show, \\"One of the series' calling cards has been its depiction of female friendship and particularly the primacy that friendship enjoyed over romantic relationships.\\"[40]\\r\\n\\r\\nE! at the time of Sandra Oh's exit wrote, \\"In Grey's Anatomy's 10-year history, the doctor duo has been through a lot together: weddings, deaths, plane crashes, bomb threats, shooting, you name it, they've lived (and danced) through it.\\" and added, \\"And with the three words, \\"You're my person.\\" Cristina Yang and Meredith Grey solidified their status as the small screen's best best friends ever.\\"[41]\\r\\n\\r\\nOh has received numerous awards and nominations for her portrayal of Yang. In 2005, she was nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series, which she was nominated for every year until 2009.[42] Also in 2005, she was nominated for Best Supporting Actress ÿ Series, Miniseries or Television Film at the 10th Satellite Awards.[43] The next year, the cast won the Satellite Award for Best Cast ÿ Television Series.[44] In 2006, Oh won the award for Best Supporting Actress ÿ Series, Miniseries or Television Film at the 63rd Golden Globe Awards.[45] In 2006, the cast was nominated for the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Drama Series,[46] which they won in 2007,[47] and were nominated for again the following year.[48] Also at the 12th Screen Actors Guild Awards, Oh won the award for Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Drama Series.[46] In 2010, Oh was nominated for Outstanding Actress in a Drama Series at the 41st NAACP Image Awards,[49] which she was nominated for again in 2012,[50] and in 2011, she was nominated for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series at the 42nd NAACP Image Awards.[51] In 2011, Oh was nominated for Favorite TV Drama Actress and Favorite TV Doctor at the 37th People's Choice Awards an award she was nominated again for three years later at the 40th People's Choice Awards and also the subsequent year at the 41st People's Choice Awards. She was also nominated alongside Pompeo for the Favorite TV Gal Pals category.[52]\\r\\n\\r\\nSpecific\\r\\n\\r\\nGeneral","input":"Who is the father of christina yangs baby?"},{"output":"Meats","context":"A food pyramid or diet pyramid is a triangular diagram representing the optimal number of servings to be eaten each day from each of the basic food groups.[1]  The first pyramid was published in Sweden in 1974.[2][3][4] The 1992 pyramid introduced by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) was called the \\"Food Guide Pyramid\\". It was updated in 2005, and then it was replaced by MyPlate in 2011.[5][6]\\r\\n\\r\\nAmid high food prices in 1972, Sweden's National Board of Health and Welfare developed the idea of \\"basic foods\\" that were both cheap and nutritious, and \\"supplemental foods\\" that added nutrition missing from the basic foods. Anna-Britt Agns?ter, chief of the \\"test kitchen\\" for Kooperativa F?rbundet (a cooperative Swedish retail chain), held a lecture the next year on how to illustrate these food groups. Attendee Fjalar Clemes suggested a triangle displaying basic foods at the base. Agns?ter developed the idea into the first food pyramid, which was introduced to the public in 1974 in KF's Vi magazine.[2][3][4] The pyramid was divided into basic foods at the base, including milk, cheese, margarine, bread, cereals and potato; a large section of supplemental vegetables and fruit; and an apex of supplemental meat, fish and egg. The pyramid competed with the National Board's \\"dietary circle,\\" which KF saw as problematic for resembling a cake divided into seven slices, and for not indicating how much of each food should be eaten. While the Board distanced itself from the pyramid, KF continued to promote it, and food pyramids were developed in other Scandinavian countries, as well as West Germany, Japan and Sri Lanka. The United States later developed its first food pyramid in 1992.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe World Health Organization, in conjunction with the Food and Agriculture Organization, published guidelines that can effectively be represented in a food pyramid relating to objectives to prevent obesity, chronic diseases and dental caries based on meta-analysis [7][8] though they represent it as a table rather than a \\"pyramid\\".  The structure is similar in some respects to the USDA food pyramid, but there are clear distinctions between types of fats, and a more dramatic distinction where carbohydrates are split on the basis of free sugars versus sugars in their natural form.  Some food substances are singled out due to the impact on the target issues the \\"pyramid\\" is meant to address, while in a later revision, some recommendations are omitted since they follow automatically from other recommendations while other sub-categories are added.  The reports quoted here explain that where there is no stated lower limit in the table below, there is no requirement for that nutrient in the diet.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll percentages are percentages of calories, not of weight or volume.  To understand why, consider the determination of an amount of \\"10% free sugar\\" to include in a day's worth of calories.  For the same amount of calories, free sugars take up less volume and weight, being refined and extracted from the competing carbohydrates in their natural form.  In a similar manner all the items are in competition for various categories of calories.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe representation as a pyramid is not precise, and involves variations due to the alternative percentages of different elements, but the main sections can be represented.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe USDA food pyramid was created in 1992 and divided into six horizontal sections containing depictions of foods from each section's food group. It was updated in 2005 with colorful vertical wedges replacing the horizontal sections and renamed MyPyramid. MyPyramid was often displayed with the food images absent, creating a more abstract design.\\r\\nIn an effort to restructure food nutrition guidelines, the USDA rolled out its new MyPlate program in June 2011.  My Plate is divided into four slightly different sized quadrants, with fruits and vegetables taking up half the space, and grains and protein making up the other half.  The vegetables and grains portions are the largest of the four.\\r\\n\\r\\nA modified food pyramid was proposed in 1999 for adults aged over 70.[10][11]\\r\\n\\r\\nA vegetable is a part of a plant consumed by humans that is generally savory but is not sweet. A vegetable is not considered a grain, fruit, nut, spice, or herb. For example, the stem, root, flower, etc., may be eaten as vegetables. Vegetables contain many vitamins and minerals; however, different vegetables contain different spreads, so it is important to eat a wide variety of types. For example, green vegetables typically contain vitamin A, dark orange and dark green vegetables contain vitamin C, and vegetables like broccoli and related plants contain iron and calcium. Vegetables are very low in fats and calories, but ingredients added in preparation can often add these.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese foods provide complex carbohydrates, which are a good source of energy but provide little nutrition.  While they may serve as a filler in low-fat meal plans, replacing these with nuts and seeds would be a better option.  Examples include corn, wheat, pasta, and rice.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn terms of food (rather than botany), fruits are the sweet-tasting seed-bearing parts of plants, or occasionally sweet parts of plants which do not bear seeds.\\r\\nThese include apples, oranges, grapes, bananas, etc. Fruits are low in calories and fat and are a source of natural sugars, fiber and vitamins. Processing fruit when canning or making into juices may add sugars and remove nutrients. The fruit food group is sometimes combined with the vegetable food group. Note that a massive number of different plant species produce seed pods which are considered fruits in botany, and there are a number of botanical fruits which are conventionally  not considered fruits in cuisine because they lack the characteristic sweet taste, e.g., tomatoes or avocados.\\r\\n\\r\\nA food pyramid's tip is the smallest part, so the fats and sweets in the top of the Food Pyramid should comprise the smallest percentage of the diet. The foods at the top of the food pyramid should be eaten sparingly because they provide calories, but not much in the way of nutrition. These foods include salad dressings, oils, cream, butter, margarine, sugars, soft drinks, candies, and sweet desserts.\\r\\n\\r\\nDairy products are produced from the milk of mammals, usually but not exclusively cattle. They include milk, yogurt and cheese. Milk and its derivative products are a rich source of dietary calcium and also provide protein, phosphorus, vitamin A, and vitamin D. However, many dairy products are high in saturated fat and cholesterol compared to vegetables, fruits and whole grains, which is why skimmed products are available as an alternative.\\r\\nHistorically, adults were recommended to consume three cups of dairy products per day.[12]  More recently, evidence is mounting that dairy products have greater levels of negative effects on health than previously thought and confer fewer benefits.  For example, recent research has shown that dairy products are not related to stronger bones or less fractures; on the flip side, another study showed that milk (and yogurt) consumption results in higher bone mineral density in the hip. Overall, the majority of research suggests that dairy has some beneficial effects on bone health, in part because of milk's other nutrients.[13][14][15]\\r\\n\\r\\nMeat is the tissue ÿ usually muscle ÿ of an animal consumed by humans. Since most parts of many animals are edible, there is a vast variety of meats. Meat is a major source of protein, as well as iron, zinc, and vitamin B12. Meats, poultry, and fish include beef, chicken, pork, salmon, tuna, shrimp, and eggs.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe meat group is one of the major compacted food groups in the food guide pyramid. Many of the same nutrients found in meat can also be found in foods like eggs, dry beans, and nuts, such foods are typically placed in the same category as meats, as meat alternatives. These include tofu, products that resemble meat or fish but are made with soy, eggs, and cheeses. For those who do not consume meat or animal products (see Vegetarianism, veganism and Taboo food and drink), meat analogs, tofu, beans, lentils, chick peas, nuts and other high-protein vegetables are also included in this group.  The food guide pyramid suggests that adults eat 2ÿ3 servings per day. One serving of meat is 4?oz (110?g), about the size of a deck of cards.\\r\\n\\r\\nCertain dietary choices that have been linked to heart disease, such as an 8?oz (230?g) serving of hamburger daily, were technically permitted under the pyramid. The pyramid also lacked differentiation within the protein-rich group (\\"Meat, Poultry, Fish, Dry Beans, Eggs, and Nuts\\").[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn April 1991, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) halted publication of its Eating Right Pyramid, due to objections raised by meat and dairy lobbying groups concerning the guides display of their products. Despite the USDAs explanations that the guide required further research and testing, it was not until one year laterafter its content was supported by additional researchthat the Eating Right Pyramid was officially released. This time, even the guides graphic design was altered to appease industry concerns. This incident was only one of many in which the food industry attempted to alter federal dietary recommendations in their own economic self-interest.[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nSome of the recommended quantities for the different types of food in the old pyramid have also come under criticism for lack of clarity. For instance, the pyramid recommends two to three servings from the protein-rich group, but this is intended to be a maximum. The pyramid recommends two to four fruit servings, but this is intended to be the minimum.[18]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe fats group as a whole have been put at the tip of the pyramid, under the direction to eat as little as possible, which is largely problematic. Under the guide, one would assume to avoid fats and fatty foods, which can lead to health problems. For one, fat is essential in a person's general sustainability.[19][20][21] Research suggests that unsaturated fats aid in weight loss, reduce heart disease risk,[22] lower blood sugar, and even lower cholesterol.[23][24][25]  Also, they are very long sustaining, and help keep blood sugar at a steady level.[26][27] On top of that, these fats help brain function as well.[28]\\r\\n\\r\\nSeveral books have claimed that food and agricultural associations exert undue political power on the USDA.[29][30] Food industries, such as milk companies, have been accused of influencing the United States Department of Agriculture into making the colored spots on the newly created food pyramid larger for their particular product. The milk section has been claimed to be the easiest to see out of the six sections of the pyramid, making individuals believe that more milk should be consumed on a daily basis compared to the others.[31] Furthermore, the inclusion of milk as a group unto itself implies that is an essential part of a healthy diet, despite the many people who are lactose intolerant or choose to abstain from dairy, and a number of cultures that have historically consumed little if any dairy products. Joel Fuhrman says in his book Eat to Live that U.S. taxpayers must contribute $20 billion on price supports to artificially reduce the price of cattle feed to benefit the dairy, beef and veal industries, and then pay the medical bills for an overweight population.[32] He asks if the USDA is under the influence of the food industry, because a food pyramid based on science would have vegetables at its foundation.[32]\\r\\n\\r\\nThese controversies prompted the creation of pyramids for specific audiences, particularly the mediterranean pyramid in 1993[33] and some Vegetarian Diet Pyramids.[34][35][36][37]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Harvard School of Public Health proposes a healthy eating pyramid, which includes calcium and multi-vitamin supplements as well as moderate amounts of alcohol, as an alternative to the Food Guide Pyramid.\\r\\nMany observers[who?] believe that the Harvard pyramid follows the results of nutrition studies published in peer-reviewed scientific journals more closely.[citation needed]\\r\\nBut in their book Fantastic Voyage: Live Long Enough to Live Forever, published in 2004, Ray Kurzweil and Terry Grossman M.D., point out that the guidelines provided in the Harvard Pyramid fail to distinguish between healthy and unhealthy oils. In addition, whole-grain foods are given more priority than vegetables, which should not be the case, as vegetables have a lower glycemic load. Other observations are that fish should be given a higher priority due to its high omega-3 content, and that high fat dairy products should be excluded. As an alternative, the authors postulate a new food pyramid, emphasising low glycemic-load vegetables, healthy fats, such as avocados, nuts and seeds, lean animal protein, fish, and extra virgin olive oil.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe University of Michigan Integrative Medicines Healing Foods Pyramid emphasizes plant-based choices, variety and balance. It includes sections for seasonings and water as well as healthy fats.\\r\\n\\r\\nMyPlate is the current nutrition guide published by the United States Department of Agriculture, depicting a place setting with a plate and glass divided into five food groups. It replaced the USDA's MyPyramid guide on June 2, 2011, concluding 19 years of USDA food pyramid diagrams.","input":"What class of food does egg belong to?"},{"output":"December 2010","context":"Electric vehicles first appeared in the mid-19th century. An electric vehicle held the vehicular land speed record until around 1900. The high cost, low top speed, and short range of battery electric vehicles, compared to later internal combustion engine vehicles, led to a worldwide decline in their use; although electric vehicles have continued to be used in the form of electric trains and other niche uses.\\r\\nAt the beginning of the 21st century, interest in electric and other alternative fuel vehicles has increased due to growing concern over the problems associated with hydrocarbon-fueled vehicles, including damage to the environment caused by their emissions, and the sustainability of the current hydrocarbon-based transportation infrastructure as well as improvements in electric vehicle technology. Since 2010, combined sales of all-electric cars and utility vans achieved 1?million units delivered globally in September 2016.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe invention of the first model electric vehicle is attributed to various people.[2] In 1828, nyos Jedlik, a Hungarian who invented an early type of electric motor, created a small model car powered by his new motor. In 1834, Vermont blacksmith Thomas Davenport built a similar contraption which operated on a short, circular, electrified track.[3] In 1834, Professor Sibrandus Stratingh of Groningen, the Netherlands and his assistant Christopher Becker created a small-scale electrical car, powered by non-rechargeable primary cells.[4]\\r\\nThe first known electric car was built in 1837 by chemist Robert Davidson of Aberdeen. It was powered by galvanic cells (batteries). Davidson later built a larger locomotive named Galvani, exhibited at the Royal Scottish Society of Arts Exhibition in 1841. The seven-ton vehicle had two direct-drive reluctance motors, with fixed electromagnets acting on iron bars attached to a wooden cylinder on each axle, and simple commutators. It hauled a load of six tons at four miles per hour for a distance of one and a half miles. It was tested on the Edinburgh and Glasgow Railway in September of the following year, but the limited power from batteries prevented its general use. It was destroyed by railway workers, who saw it as a threat to their security of employment.[5][6][7][8]\\r\\nBetween 1832 and 1839, British inventor Robert Anderson also invented a crude electrical carriage.[9] A patent for the use of rails as conductors of electric current was granted in England in 1840, and similar patents were issued to Lilley and Colten in the United States in 1847.[10]\\r\\nRechargeable batteries that provided a viable means for storing electricity on board a vehicle did not come into being until 1859, with the invention of the leadÿacid battery by French physicist Gaston Plant.[11][12] Camille Alphonse Faure, another French scientist, significantly improved the design of the battery in 1881; his improvements greatly increased the capacity of such batteries and led directly to their manufacture on an industrial scale.[13]\\r\\nAn early electric-powered two-wheel cycle was put on display at the 1867 World Exposition in Paris by the Austrian inventor Franz Kravogl, but it was regarded as a curiosity and could not drive reliably in the street.[14] Another cycle, this time with three wheels, was tested along a Paris street in April 1881 by French inventor Gustave Trouv [15]\\r\\nEnglish inventor Thomas Parker, who was responsible for innovations such as electrifying the London Underground, overhead tramways in Liverpool and Birmingham, and the smokeless fuel coalite, built the first production electric car in London in 1884, using his own specially designed high-capacity rechargeable batteries.[16] Parker's long-held interest in the construction of more fuel-efficient vehicles led him to experiment with electric vehicles. He also may have been concerned about the malign effects smoke and pollution were having in London.[17]\\r\\nProduction of the car was in the hands of the Elwell-Parker Company, established in 1882 for the construction and sale of electric trams. The company merged with other rivals in 1888 to form the Electric Construction Corporation; this company had a virtual monopoly on the British electric car market in the 1890s. The company manufactured the first electric 'dog cart' in 1896.[18]\\r\\nFrance and the United Kingdom were the first nations to support the widespread development of electric vehicles.[9] The first electric car in Germany was built by the engineer Andreas Flocken in 1888.[19]\\r\\nElectric trains were also used to transport coal out of mines, as their motors did not use up precious oxygen. Before the pre-eminence of internal combustion engines, electric automobiles also held many speed and distance records.[20] Among the most notable of these records was the breaking of the 100?km/h (62?mph) speed barrier, by Camille Jenatzy on 29 April 1899 in his 'rocket-shaped' vehicle Jamais Contente, which reached a top speed of 105.88?km/h (65.79?mph). Also notable was Ferdinand Porsche's design and construction of an all-wheel drive electric car, powered by a motor in each hub, which also set several records in the hands of its owner E.W. Hart.\\r\\nThe first electric car in the United States was developed in 1890-91 by William Morrison of Des Moines, Iowa; the vehicle was a six-passenger wagon capable of reaching a speed of 14 miles per hour (23?km/h). It was not until 1895 that consumers began to devote attention to electric vehicles, after A.L. Ryker introduced the first electric tricycles to the U.S.[21], by which point Europeans had been making use of electric tricycles, bicycles, and cars for almost 15 years.\\r\\nInterest in motor vehicles increased greatly in the late 1890s and early 1900s. Electric battery-powered taxis became available at the end of the 19th century. In London, Walter C. Bersey designed a fleet of such cabs and introduced them to the streets of London in 1897. They were soon nicknamed \\"Hummingbirds\\" due to the idiosyncratic humming noise they made.[22] In the same year in New York City, the Samuel's Electric Carriage and Wagon Company began running 12 electric hansom cabs.[23] The company ran until 1898 with up to 62 cabs operating until it was reformed by its financiers to form the Electric Vehicle Company.[24]\\r\\nDue to technological limitations and the lack of transistor-based electric technology, the top speed of these early electric vehicles was limited to about 32?km/h (20?mph).[citation needed] Despite this slow speed, electric vehicles had a number of advantages over their early-1900s competitors. They did not have the vibration, smell, and noise associated with gasoline cars. They also did not require gear changes. (While steam-powered cars also had no gear shifting, they suffered from long start-up times of up to 45 minutes on cold mornings.) The cars were also preferred because they did not require a manual effort to start, as did gasoline cars which featured a hand crank to start the engine.\\r\\nElectric cars found popularity among well-heeled customers who used them as city cars, where their limited range proved to be even less of a disadvantage. Electric cars were often marketed as suitable vehicles for women drivers due to their ease of operation; in fact, early electric cars were stigmatized by the perception that they were \\"women's cars\\", leading some companies to affix radiators to the front to disguise the car's propulsion system.\\r\\nAcceptance of electric cars was initially hampered by a lack of power infrastructure, but by 1912, many homes were wired for electricity, enabling a surge in the popularity of the cars. In the United States by the turn of the century, 40 percent of automobiles were powered by steam, 38 percent by electricity, and 22 percent by gasoline. A total of 33,842 electric cars were registered in the United States, and America became the country where electric cars had gained the most acceptance.[25] Most early electric vehicles were massive, ornate carriages designed for the upper-class customers that made them popular. They featured luxurious interiors and were replete with expensive materials. Sales of electric cars peaked in the early 1910s.\\r\\nIn order to overcome the limited operating range of electric vehicles, and the lack of recharging infrastructure, an exchangeable battery service was first proposed as early as 1896.[26] The concept was first put into practice by Hartford Electric Light Company through the GeVeCo battery service and initially available for electric trucks. The vehicle owner purchased the vehicle from General Vehicle Company (GVC, a subsidiary of the General Electric Company) without a battery and the electricity was purchased from Hartford Electric through an exchangeable battery. The owner paid a variable per-mile charge and a monthly service fee to cover maintenance and storage of the truck. Both vehicles and batteries were modified to facilitate a fast battery exchange. The service was provided between 1910 and 1924 and during that period covered more than 6 million miles. Beginning in 1917 a similar successful service was operated in Chicago for owners of Milburn Wagon Company cars who also could buy the vehicle without the batteries.[26]\\r\\nAfter enjoying success at the beginning of the 20th century, the electric car began to lose its position in the automobile market. A number of developments contributed to this situation. By the 1920s an improved road infrastructure required vehicles with a greater range than that offered by electric cars. Worldwide discoveries of large petroleum reserves led to the wide availability of affordable gasoline, making gas-powered cars cheaper to operate over long distances. Electric cars were limited to urban use by their slow speed (no more than 24ÿ32?km/h or 15ÿ20?mph.[25]) and low range (30ÿ40 miles or 50ÿ65?km[25]), and gasoline cars were now able to travel farther and faster than equivalent electrics.\\r\\nGasoline cars became even easier to operate thanks to the invention of the electric starter by Charles Kettering in 1912,[27] which eliminated the need of a hand crank for starting a gasoline engine, and the noise emitted by ICE cars became more bearable thanks to the use of the muffler, which Hiram Percy Maxim had invented in 1897. Finally, the initiation of mass production of gas-powered vehicles by Henry Ford brought their price down.[28] By contrast, the price of similar electric vehicles continued to rise; by 1912, an electric car sold for almost double the price of a gasoline car.[9]\\r\\nMost electric car makers stopped production at some point in the 1910s. Electric vehicles became popular for certain applications where their limited range did not pose major problems. Forklift trucks were electrically powered when they were introduced by Yale in 1923.[29] In Europe, especially the United Kingdom, milk floats were powered by electricity, and for most of the 20th century the majority of the world's battery electric road vehicles were British milk floats.[30] Electric golf carts were produced by Lektro as early as 1954.[31] By the 1920s, the early heyday of electric cars had passed, and a decade later, the electric automobile industry had effectively disappeared. Michael Brian examines the social and technological reasons for the failure of electric cars in his book Taking Charge: The Electric Automobile in America.[32]\\r\\nYears passed without a major revival in the use of electric cars. Fuel-starved European countries fighting in World War II experimented with electric cars such as the British milk floats and the French Breguet Aviation car, but overall, while ICE development progressed at a brisk pace, electric vehicle technology stagnated. In the late 1950s, Henney Coachworks and the National Union Electric Company, makers of Exide batteries, formed a joint venture to produce a new electric car, the Henney Kilowatt, based on the French Renault Dauphine. The car was produced in 36-volt and 72-volt configurations; the 72-volt models had a top speed approaching 96?km/h (60?mph) and could travel for nearly an hour on a single charge. Despite the Kilowatt's improved performance with respect to previous electric cars, consumers found it[citation needed] too expensive compared to equivalent gasoline cars of the time, and production ended in 1961.\\r\\nIn 1959, American Motors Corporation (AMC) and Sonotone Corporation announced a joint research effort to consider producing an electric car powered by a \\"self-charging\\" battery.[33] AMC had a reputation for innovation in economical cars while Sonotone had technology for making sintered plate nickel-cadmium batteries that could be recharged rapidly and weighed less than traditional lead-acid versions.[34] That same year, Nu-Way Industries showed an experimental electric car with a one-piece plastic body that was to begin production in early 1960.[33]\\r\\nIn the mid 1960s a few battery-electric concept cars appeared, such as the Scottish Aviation Scamp (1965),[35] and an electric version of General Motors gasoline car, the Electrovair (1966).[36] None of them entered production. The 1966 Enfield 8000 did make it into small-scale production, 112 were eventually produced.[37]In 1967, AMC partnered with Gulton Industries to develop a new battery based on lithium and a speed controller designed by Victor Wouk.[38] A nickel-cadmium battery supplied power to an all-electric 1969 Rambler American station wagon.[38] Other \\"plug-in\\" experimental AMC vehicles developed with Gulton included the Amitron (1967) and the similar Electron (1977).\\r\\nOn 31 July 1971, an electric car received the unique distinction of becoming the first manned vehicle to drive on the Moon; that car was the Lunar rover, which was first deployed during the Apollo 15 mission. The \\"moon buggy\\" was developed by Boeing and GM subsidiary Delco Electronics (co-founded by Kettering)[27] featured a DC drive motor in each wheel, and a pair of 36-volt silver-zinc potassium hydroxide non-rechargeable batteries.\\r\\nAfter years outside the limelight, the energy crises of the 1970s and 1980s brought about renewed interest in the perceived independence electric cars had from the fluctuations of the hydrocarbon energy market. General Motors created a concept car of another of their gasoline cars, the Electrovette (1976). At the 1990 Los Angeles Auto Show, General Motors President Roger Smith unveiled the GM Impact electric concept car, along with the announcement that GM would build electric cars for sale to the public.\\r\\nIn the early 1990s, the California Air Resources Board (CARB), the government of California's \\"clean air agency\\", began a push for more fuel-efficient, lower-emissions vehicles, with the ultimate goal being a move to zero-emissions vehicles such as electric vehicles.[39][40] In response, automakers developed electric models, including the Chrysler TEVan, Ford Ranger EV pickup truck, GM EV1 and S10 EV pickup, Honda EV Plus hatchback, Nissan lithium-battery Altra EV miniwagon and Toyota RAV4 EV. The automakers were accused of pandering to the wishes of CARB in order to continue to be allowed to sell cars in the lucrative Californian market, while failing to adequately promote their electric vehicles in order to create the impression that the consumers were not interested in the cars, all the while joining oil industry lobbyists in vigorously protesting CARB's mandate.[40] GM's program came under particular scrutiny; in an unusual move, consumers were not allowed to purchase EV1s, but were instead asked to sign closed-end leases, meaning that the cars had to be returned to GM at the end of the lease period, with no option to purchase, despite leasee interest in continuing to own the cars.[40] Chrysler, Toyota, and a group of GM dealers sued CARB in Federal court, leading to the eventual neutering of CARB's ZEV Mandate.[citation needed]\\r\\nAfter public protests by EV drivers' groups upset by the repossession of their cars, Toyota offered the last 328 RAV4-EVs for sale to the general public during six months, up until 22 November 2002. Almost all other production electric cars were withdrawn from the market and were in some cases seen to have been destroyed by their manufacturers.[40] Toyota continues to support the several hundred Toyota RAV4-EV in the hands of the general public and in fleet usage. GM famously de-activated the few EV1s that were donated to engineering schools and museums.[citation needed]\\r\\nThroughout the 1990s, interest in fuel-efficient or environmentally friendly cars declined among consumers in the United States, who instead favored sport utility vehicles, which were affordable to operate despite their poor fuel efficiency thanks to lower gasoline prices. Domestic U.S. automakers chose to focus their product lines around the truck-based vehicles, which enjoyed larger profit margins than the smaller cars which were preferred in places like Europe or Japan.\\r\\nMost electric vehicles on the world roads are low-speed, low-range neighborhood electric vehicles (NEVs). Pike Research estimated there were almost 479,000 NEVs on the world roads in 2011.[41] As of July?2006[update], there were between 60,000 and 76,000 low-speed battery-powered vehicles in use in the United States, up from about 56,000 in 2004.[42] North America's top selling NEV is the Global Electric Motorcars (GEM) vehicles, with more than 50,000 units sold worldwide by mid 2014.[43] The world's two largest NEV markets in 2011 were the United States, with 14,737 units sold, and France, with 2,231 units.[44] Other micro electric cars sold in Europe was the Kewet, since 1991, and replaced by the Buddy, launched in 2008.[45] Also the Th!nk City was launched in 2008 but production was halted due to financial difficulties.[46] Production restarted in Finland in December 2009.[47] The Th!nk was sold in several European countries and the U.S.[48][49] In June 2011 Think Global filed for bankruptcy and production was halted.[50] Worldwide sales reached 1,045 units by March 2011.[51] A total of 200,000 low-speed small electric cars were sold in China in 2013, most of which are powered by lead-acid batteries. These electric vehicles are not considered by the government as new energy vehicles due to safety and environmental concerns, and consequently, do not enjoy the same benefits as highway legal plug-in electric cars.[52]\\r\\nCalifornia electric car maker Tesla Motors began development in 2004 on the Tesla Roadster, which was first delivered to customers in 2008.[53] The Roadster was the first highway legal serial production all-electric car to use lithium-ion battery cells, and the first production all-electric car to travel more than 200 miles (320?km) per charge.[54] Since 2008, Tesla sold approximately 2,450 Roadsters in over 30 countries through December 2012.[55] Tesla sold the Roadster until early 2012, when its supply of Lotus Elise gliders ran out, as its contract with Lotus Cars for 2,500 gliders expired at the end of 2011.[56][57] Tesla stopped taking orders for the Roadster in the U.S. market in August 2011,[58][59] and the 2012 Tesla Roadster was sold in limited numbers only in Europe, Asia and Australia.[60][61] The next Tesla vehicle, the Model S, was released in the U.S. on 22 June 2012[62] and the first delivery of a Model S to a retail customer in Europe took place on 7 August 2013.[63] Deliveries in China began on 22 April 2014.[64] The next model was the Tesla Model X. In November 2014 Tesla delayed one more time the start of deliveries to retail customers, and announced the company expects Model X deliveries to begin in the third quarter of 2015.[65]\\r\\nThe Mitsubishi i-MiEV was launched in Japan for fleet customers in July 2009, and for individual customers in April 2010,[66][67][68] followed by sales to the public in Hong Kong in May 2010, and Australia in July 2010 via leasing.[69][70] The i-MiEV was launched in Europe in December 2010, including a rebadged version sold in Europe as Peugeot iOn and Citro?n C-Zero.[71][72] The market launch in the Americas began in Costa Rica in February 2011, followed by Chile in May 2011.[73][74] Fleet and retail customer deliveries in the U.S. and Canada began in December 2011.[75][76][77] Accounting for all vehicles of the iMiEV brand, Mitsubishi reports around 27,200 units sold or exported since 2009 through December 2012, including the minicab MiEVs sold in Japan, and the units rebadged and sold as Peugeot iOn and Citro?n C-Zero in the European market.[78]\\r\\nSenior leaders at several large automakers, including Nissan and General Motors, have stated that the Roadster was a catalyst which demonstrated that there is pent-up consumer demand for more efficient vehicles. In an August 2009 edition of The New Yorker, GM vice-chairman Bob Lutz was quoted as saying, \\"All the geniuses here at General Motors kept saying lithium-ion technology is 10 years away, and Toyota agreed with us ÿ and boom, along comes Tesla. So I said, 'How come some tiny little California startup, run by guys who know nothing about the car business, can do this, and we can't?' That was the crowbar that helped break up the log jam.\\"[79]\\r\\nThe Nissan Leaf, introduced in Japan and the United States in December 2010, became the first modern all-electric, zero tailpipe emission five door family hatchback to be produced for the mass market from a major manufacturer.[80][81] As of January?2013[update], the Leaf is also available in Australia, Canada and 17 European countries.[82]\\r\\nThe Better Place network was the first modern commercial deployment of the battery swapping model. The Renault Fluence Z.E. was the first mass production electric car enable with switchable battery technology and sold for the Better Place network in Israel and Denmark.[83] Better Place launched its first battery-swapping station in Israel, in Kiryat Ekron, near Rehovot in March 2011. The battery exchange process took five minutes.[84] As of December?2012[update], there were 17 battery switch stations fully operational in Denmark enabling customers to drive anywhere across the country in an electric car.[85] By late 2012 the company began to suffer financial difficulties, and decided to put on hold the roll out in Australia and reduce its non-core activities in North America, as the company decided to concentrate its resources on its two existing markets.[86][87][88] On 26 May 2013, Better Place filed for bankruptcy in Israel.[89] The company's financial difficulties were caused by the high investment required to develop the charging and swapping infrastructure, about US$850 million in private capital, and a market penetration significantly lower than originally predicted by Shai Agassi. Less than 1,000 Fluence Z.E. cars were deployed in Israel and around 400 units in Denmark.[90][91]\\r\\nThe Smart electric drive, Wheego Whip LiFe, Mia electric, Volvo C30 Electric, and the Ford Focus Electric were launched for retail customers during 2011. The BYD e6, released initially for fleet customers in 2010, began reatail sales in Shenzhen, China in October 2011.[92] The Bollor Bluecar was released in December 2011 and deployed for use in the Autolib' carsharing service in Paris.[93] Leasing to individual and corporate customers began in October 2012 and is limited to the ?le-de-France area.[94] In February 2011, the Mitsubishi i MiEV became the first electric car to sell more than of more than 10,000 units, including the models badged in Europe as Citro?n C-Zero and Peugeot. The record was officially registered by Guinness World Records. Several months later, the Nissan Leaf overtook the i MiEV as the best selling all-electric car ever,[95] and by February 2013 global sales of the Leaf reached the 50,000 unit mark.[82]\\r\\nModels released to the market in 2012 and 2013 include the BMW ActiveE, Coda, Renault Fluence Z.E., Tesla Model S, Honda Fit EV, Toyota RAV4 EV, Renault Zoe, Roewe E50, Mahindra e2o, Chevrolet Spark EV, Mercedes-Benz SLS AMG Electric Drive, Fiat 500e, Volkswagen e-Up!, BMW i3, and Kandi EV. Toyota released the Scion iQ EV in the U.S. (Toyota eQ in Japan) in 2013. The car production is limited to 100 units. The first 30 units were delivered to the University of California, Irvine in March 2013 for use in its Zero Emission Vehicle-Network Enabled Transport (ZEV-NET) carsharing fleet. Toyota announced that 90 out of the 100 vehicles produced globally will be placed in carsharing demonstration projects in the United States and the rest in Japan.[96]\\r\\nThe Coda sedan went out of production in 2013, after selling only about 100 units in California. Its manufacturer, Coda Automotive, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on 1 May 2013. The company stated that it expects to emerge from the bankruptcy process to focus on energy storage solutions as it has decided to abandon car manufacturing.[97]\\r\\nThe Tesla Model S ranked as the top selling plug-in electric car in North America during the first quarter of 2013 with 4,900 cars sold, ahead of the Chevrolet Volt (4,421) and the Nissan Leaf (3,695).[98] European retail deliveries of the Tesla Model S began in Oslo in August 2013,[99] and during its first full month in the market, the Model S ranked as the top selling car in Norway with 616 units delivered, representing a market share of 5.1% of all the new cars sold in the country in September 2013, becoming the first electric car to top the new car sales ranking in any country, and contributing to a record all-electric car market share of 8.6% of new car sales during that month.[100][101] In October 2013, an electric car was the best selling car in the country for a second month in a row. This time was the Nissan Leaf with 716 units sold, representing a 5.6% of new car sales that month.[102][103]\\r\\nThe RenaultÿNissan Alliance reached global sales of 100,000 all-electric vehicles in July 2013.[106] The 100,000th customer was a U.S. student who bought a Nissan Leaf.[107] In mid January 2014, global sales of the Nissan Leaf reached the 100,000 unit milestone, representing a 45% market share of worldwide pure electric vehicles sold since 2010. The 100,000th car was delivered to a British customer.[108]\\r\\nAs of June?2014[update], there were over 500,000 plug-in electric passenger cars and utility vans in the world, with the U.S. leading plug-in electric car sales with a 45% share of global sales.[109][110] In September 2014, sales of plug-in electric cars in the United States reached the 250,000 unit milestone.[111] Global cumulative sales of the Tesla Model S passed the 50,000 unit milestone in October 2014.[112] In November 2014 the RenaultÿNissan Alliance reached 200,000 all-electric vehicles delivered globally, representing a 58% share of the global light-duty all-electric market segment.[113]\\r\\nThe world's top selling all-electric cars in 2014 were the Nissan Leaf (61,507), Tesla Model S (31,655), BMW i3 (16,052), and the Renault Zoe (11,323). Accounting for plug-in hybrids, the Leaf and the Model S also ranked first and second correspondinly among the world's top 10 selling plug-in electric cars.[105] All-electric models released to the retail customers in 2014 include the BMW Brilliance Zinoro 1E, Chery eQ, Geely-Kandi Panda EV, Zotye Zhidou E20, Kia Soul EV, Volkswagen e-Golf, Mercedes-Benz B-Class Electric Drive, and Venucia e30.\\r\\nGeneral Motors unveiled the Chevrolet Bolt EV concept car at the 2015 North American International Auto Show.[115] The Bolt is scheduled for availability in late 2016 as a model year 2017.[116] GM anticipates the Bolt will deliver an all-electric range more than 200?mi (320?km), with pricing starting at US$37,500 before any applicable government incentives.[117] The European version, marketed as the Opel Ampera-e, will go into production in 2017.[118]\\r\\nIn May 2015, global sales of highway legal all-electric passenger cars and light utility vehicles passed the 500,000 unit milestone, accounting for sales since 2008. Out these, Nissan accounts for about 35%, Tesla Motors about 15%, and Mitsubishi about 10%.[119] Also in May 2015, the Renault Zoe and the BMW i3 passed the 25,000 unit global sales milestone.[120] In June 2015, worldwide sales of the Model S passed the 75,000 unit milestone in June 2015.[112]\\r\\nBy early June 2015, the RenaultÿNissan Alliance continued as the leading all-electric vehicle manufacturer with global sales of over 250,000 pure electric vehicles representing about half of the global light-duty all-electric market segment. Nissan sales totaled 185,000 units, which includes the Nissan Leaf and the e-NV200 van. Renault has sold 65,000 electric vehicles, and its line-up includes the ZOE passenger car, the Kangoo Z.E. van, the SM3 Z.E. (previously Fluence Z.E.) sedan and the Twizy heavy quadricycle.[121]\\r\\nBy mid-September 2015, the global stock of highway legal plug-in electric passenger cars and utility vans passed the one million sales milestone, with the pure electrics capturing about 62% of global sales.[123] The United States is the plug-in segment market leader with a stock of over 363,000 plug-in electric cars delivered since 2008 through August 2015, representing 36.3% of global sales.[123] The tate of California is the largest plug-in car regional market, with more than 158,000 units sold between December 2010 and June 2015, representing 46.5% of all plug-in cars sold in the U.S.[124][125][126][126][127] Until December 2014, California not only had more plug-in electric vehicles than any other state in the nation, but also more than any other country.[128][129]\\r\\nAs of August?2015[update], China ranked as the world's second top selling country plug-in market, with over 157,000 units sold since 2011 (15.7%), followed by Japan with more than 120,000 plug-in units sold since 2009 (12.1%).[123] As of June?2015[update], over 310,000 light-duty plug-in electric vehicles have been registered in the European market since 2010.[130][131] European sales are led by Norway, followed by the Netherlands, and France.[123] In the heavy-duty segment, China is the world's leader, with over 65,000 buses and other commercial vehicles sold through August 2015.[123]\\r\\nAs of December?2015[update], global sales of electric cars were led by the Nissan Leaf with over 200,000 units sold making the Leaf the world's top selling highway-capable electric car in history. The Tesla Model S, with global deliveries of more than 100,000 units, is the world's second best selling all-electric car of all-time.[132] The Model S ranked as the world's best selling plug-in electric vehicle in 2015, up from second best in 2014.[133][134] The Model S was also the top selling plug-in car in the U.S. in 2015.[135] Most models released in the world's markets to retail customers during 2015 were plug-in hybrids. The only new series production all-electric cars launched up to October 2015 were the BYD e5 and the Tesla Model X, together with several variants of the Tesla Model S line-up.[136]\\r\\nThe Tesla Model 3 was unveiled on 31 March 2016. With pricing starting at US$35,000 and an all-electric range of 215?mi (346?km), the Model 3 is Tesla Motors first vehicle aimed for the mass market. Before the unveiling event, over 115,000 people had reserved the Model 3.[137] As of 7?April?2016[update], one week after the event, Tesla Motors reported over 325,000 reservations, more than triple the 107,000 Model S cars Tesla had sold by the end of 2015. These reservations represent potential sales of over US$14 billion.[138][139] As of 31?March?2016[update], Tesla Motors has sold almost 125,000 electric cars worldwide since delivery of its first Tesla Roadster in 2008.[140] Tesla reported the number of net reservations totaled about 373,000 as of 15?May?2016[update], after about 8,000 customer cancellations and about 4,200 reservations canceled by the automaker because these appeared to be duplicates from speculators.[141][142]\\r\\nThe Hyundai Ioniq Electric was released in South Korea in July 2016, and sold over 1,000 units during its first two months in the market.[144] The Renault-Nissan Alliance achieved the milestone of 350,000 electric vehicles sold globally in August 2016, and also set an industry record of 100,000 electric vehicle sold in a single year.[145] Nissan global electric vehicle sales passed the 250,000 unit milestone also in August 2016.[145] Renault global electric vehicle sales passed the 100,000 unit milestone in early September 2016.[146] Global sales of the Tesla Model X passed the 10,000 unit mark in August 2016, with most cars delivered in the United States.[147]\\r\\nCumulative global sales of pure electric passenger cars and utility vans passed the 1?million unit milestone in September 2016.[1] Global sales of the Tesla Model S achieved the 150,000 unit milestone in November 2016, four years and five months after its introduction, and just five more months than it took the Nissan Leaf to achieve the same milestone.[148] Norway achieved the milestone of 100,000 all-electric vehicles registered in December 2016.[149] Retail deliveries of the 238?mi (383?km) Chevrolet Bolt EV began in the San Francisco Bay Area on 13 December 2016.[143] In December 2016, Nissan reported that Leaf owners worldwide achieved the milestone of 3 billion km (1.9 billion miles) driven collectively through November 2016, saving the equivalent of nearly 500 million kg (1,100 million lb) of CO2 emissions.[150] Global Nissan Leaf sales passed 250,000 units delivered in December 2016.[151][152] The Tesla Model S was the world's best-selling plug-in electric car in 2016 for the second year running, with 50,931 units delivered globally.[122][153]\\r\\nIn December 2016, Norway became the first country where 5% of all registered passenger cars was a plug-in electric.[154] When new car sales in Norway are breakdown by powertrain or fuel, nine of the top ten best-selling models in 2016 were electric-drive models.

The vast majority of bows are used with string instruments, such as the violin, although some bows are used with musical saws and other bowed idiophones.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA bow consists of a specially shaped stick with other material forming a ribbon stretched between its ends, which is used to stroke the string and create sound. Different musical cultures have adopted various designs for the bow. For instance, in some bows a single cord is stretched between the ends of the stick. In the Western tradition of bow makingbows for the instruments of the violin and viol familiesa hank of horsehair is normally employed.\\r\\nThe manufacture of bows is considered a demanding craft, and well-made bows command high prices. Part of the bow maker's skill is the ability to choose high quality material for the stick. Historically, Western bows have been made of pernambuco wood from Brazil. However, pernambuco is now an endangered species whose export is regulated by international treaty,[1] so makers are currently adopting other materials: woods such as Ip (Tabebuia)[2] and synthetic materials, such as carbon fiber epoxy composite and fiberglass. Carbon fiber bows have become very popular, and some of the better carbon fiber bows are now comparable to fine pernambuco sticks.\\r\\nFor the frog,[3] which holds and adjusts the near end of the horsehair, ebony is most often used, but other materials, often decorative, were used as well, such as ivory and tortoiseshell. Materials such as mother of pearl or abalone shell are often used on the slide which covers the mortise, as well as in round decorative \\"eyes\\" inlaid on the side surfaces. Sometimes \\"Parisian eyes\\" are used, with the circle of shell surrounded by a metal ring. The metal parts of the frog, or mountings, may be used by the maker to mark various grades of bow, ordinary bows being mounted with nickel silver, better bows with silver, and the finest being gold-mounted. (Not all makers adhere uniformly to this practice.) Near the frog is the grip, which is made of a wire, silk, or \\"whalebone\\" wrap and a thumb cushion made of leather or snakeskin. The tip plate of the bow may be made of bone, ivory, mammoth ivory, or metal, such as silver.\\r\\nA bow maker or archetier typically uses between 150 and 200 hairs [4] from the tail of a horse for a violin bow. Bows for other members of the violin family typically have a wider ribbon, using more hairs. There is a widely held belief among string players, neither proven nor disproven scientifically, that white hair produces a \\"smoother\\" sound and black hair (used mainly for double bass bows) is coarser and thus produces a \\"rougher\\" sound. Lower quality (inexpensive) bows often use nylon or synthetic hair. Rosin, or colophony, a hard, sticky substance made from resin (sometimes mixed with wax), is regularly applied to the bow hair to increase friction.\\r\\nIn making a wooden bow, the greater part of the woodworking is done on a straight stick. According to James McKean,[5] \\"the bow maker graduates the stick in precise gradations so that it is evenly flexible throughout\\". These gradations were originally calculated by Fran?ois Tourte, discussed below. In order to shape the curve or \\"camber\\" of the bow stick, the maker carefully heats the stick in an alcohol flame, a few inches at a time, bending the heated stick gradually to the proper shape. A metal or wooden template is used to get the model's exact curve and shape while heating.\\r\\nThe art of making wooden bows has changed little since the 19th century; most modern composite sticks roughly resemble the Tourte design. Various inventors have tried, at times, to come up with new ways of bow-making; the Incredibow,[6] for example, has a straight stick cambered only by the fixed tension of the synthetic hair.\\r\\nSlightly different bows, varying in weight and length, are used for the violin, viola, cello, and double bass.\\r\\nThese are generally variations on the same basic design. However, two distinct forms of the double bass bow are in current usage. The \\"French\\" overhand bow is constructed along the same lines as the bow used with the other instruments of the orchestral string family. The French stick is grasped from opposite the frog. The \\"German\\" or \\"Butler\\" underhand bow is broader and longer than the French bow with a larger frog curved to fit the palm of the hand. The German stick is grasped with the hand encompassing the frog loosely. The German bow is the older of the two designs, having superseded the earlier arched bow. The French bow became popular with its adoption in the 19th century by virtuoso Giovanni Bottesini. Both are found in the orchestra, though typically an individual bass player prefers to perform using one or the other type of bow.\\r\\nThe characteristic long, sustained, and singing sound produced by the violin, viola, violoncello, and double bass is due to the drawing of the bow against their strings. This sustaining of musical sound with a bow is comparable to a singer using breath to sustain sounds and sing long, smooth, or legato melodies.\\r\\nIn modern practice, the bow is almost always held in the right hand while the left is used for fingering. When the player pulls the bow across the strings (such that the frog moves away from the instrument), it is called a down-bow; pushing the bow so the frog moves toward the instrument is an up-bow (the directions \\"down\\" and \\"up\\" are literally descriptive for violins and violas, and are employed in analogous fashion for the cello and double bass). Two consecutive notes played in the same bow direction are referred to as a hooked bow; a down-bow following a whole down-bow is called a retake.\\r\\nGenerally, the down-bow stroke is used for the strong musical beats, the up-bow for weak beats. However, in the viola da gamba, it is the reverse; thus violinists, violists, and cellists look like they are \\"pulling\\" on the strong beats when they play, whereas gamba players look like they are \\"stabbing\\" on the strong beats. The difference almost certainly results from the different ways in which the bow is held in these instrument families: violin/viola/cello players hold the wood part of the bow closer to the palm, whereas gamba players use the opposite orientation, with the horsehair closer. The orientation appropriate to each instrument family permits the stronger wrist muscles (flexors) to reinforce the strong beat.\\r\\nString players control their tone quality by touching the bow to the strings at varying distances from the bridge, emphasizing the higher harmonics by playing sul ponticello (\\"on the bridge\\"), or reducing them, and emphasizing the fundamental frequency by playing sul tasto (\\"on the fingerboard\\").\\r\\nOccasionally, composers ask the player to use the bow by touching the strings with the wood rather than the hair; this is known by the Italian phrase col legno (\\"with the wood\\"). Coll'arco (\\"with the bow\\") is the indication to use the bow hair to create the sound in the normal way.\\r\\nThe question of when and where the bow was invented is of interest because the technique of using it to produce sound on a stringed instrument has led to many important historical and regional developments in music, as well as the variety of instruments used.\\r\\nPictorial and sculptural evidence from early Egyptian, Indian, Hellenic, and Anatolian civilizations indicate that plucked stringed instruments existed long before the technique of bowing developed. In spite of the ancient origins of the bow and arrow, it would appear that bowed string instruments only developed during a comparatively recent period.\\r\\nEric Halfpenny, writing in the 1988 Encyclop?dia Britannica, says, \\"bowing can be traced as far back as the Islamic civilization of the 10th century ... it seems likely that the principle of bowing originated among the nomadic horse riding cultures of Central Asia, whence it spread quickly through Islam and the East, so that by 1000 it had almost simultaneously reached China, Java, North Africa, the Near East and Balkans, and Europe.\\"[7] Halfpenny notes that in many Eurasian languages the word for \\"bridge\\" etymologically means \\"horse,\\" and that the Chinese regarded their own bowed instruments (huqin) as having originated with the \\"barbarians\\" of Central Asia.\\r\\nThe Central Asian theory is endorsed by Werner Bachmann, writing in The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians. Bachmann notes evidence from a tenth-century Central Asian wall painting for bowed instruments in what is now the city of Kurbanshaid in Tajikistan.\\r\\nCircumstantial evidence also supports the Central Asian theory. All the elements that were necessary for the invention of the bow were probably present among the Central Asian horse riding peoples at the same time:\\r\\n(From all this it is tempting to imagine the invention of the bow: the Mongol warrior, having just used rosin on his equipment, idly stroked his harp or lyre with a rosin-dusted finger and produced a brief continuous sound, which caused him to have an inspiration; whereupon he seized his bow, restrung it with horsehair, and so on. Obviously, the degree to which this fantasy is true will never be known.)\\r\\nHowever the bow was invented, it soon spread very widely. The Central Asian horse peoples occupied a territory that included the Silk Road, along which goods and innovations were transported rapidly for thousands of miles (including, via India, by sea to Java). This would account for the near-simultaneous appearance of the musical bow in the many locations cited by Halfpenny.\\r\\nThe kind of bow in use today was brought into its modern form largely by the bow maker Fran?ois Tourte in 19th-century France. Pernambuco wood which was imported into France to make textile dye, was found by the early French bow masters to have just the right combination of strength, resiliency, weight, and beauty. According to James McKean, Tourte's bows, \\"like the instruments of Stradivari, are still considered to be without equal.\\"[5]\\r\\nThe early 18th-century bow referred to as the Corelli-Tartini model is also referred to as the Italian 'sonata' bow. This basic Baroque bow supplanted by 1725 an earlier French dance bow which was quite short with a little point. The French dance bow was held with the thumb under the hair and played with short, quick strokes for rhythmic dance music. The Italian sonata bow was longer, from 24 to 28 inches (61ÿ71?cm.), with a straight or slightly convex stick. The head is described as a pike's head, and the frog is either fixed (the clip-in bow) or has a screw mechanism. The screw is an early improvement, indicative of further changes to come. As compared to a modern Tourte-style bow, the Corelli-Tartini model is shorter and lighter, especially at the tip, the balance point is lower down on the stick, the hair more yielding, and the ribbon of hair narrowerabout 6?mm wide.\\r\\nIn the early bow (the Baroque bow), the natural bow stroke is a non-legato norm, producing what Leopold Mozart called a \\"small softness\\" at the beginning and end of each stroke.\\r\\nA lighter, clearer sound is produced, and quick notes are cleanly articulated without the hair leaving the string.\\r\\nA truly great example of such a bow, described by David Boyden,[10] is part of the Ansley Salz Collection at the University of California at Berkeley. It was made around 1700, and is attributed to Stradivari.\\r\\nTowards the middle of the century (18th century), there was a move into the Transitional period, the separation of hair from stick became greater, particularly at the head. This greater separation is necessary because the stick becomes longer and straighter, approaching a concave shape.\\r\\nUp until the advent of the bow by Tourte, there was absolutely no standardization of bow features during this Transitional period, and every bow was different in weight, length and balance. In particular, the heads varied enormously by any given maker.\\r\\nAnother transitional type of bow may be called the Cramer bow, after the violinist Wilhelm Cramer (1746ÿ99) who lived the early part of his life in Mannheim (Germany) and, after 1772, in London. This bow and models comparable to it in Paris, generally prevailed between the gradual demise of the Corelli-Tartini model and the birth of the Tourtethat is, roughly 1750 until 1785. In the view of top experts, the Cramer bow represents a decisive step towards the modern bow.\\r\\nThe Cramer bow and others like it were gradually rendered obsolete by the advent of Fran?ois Tourte's standardized bow. The hair (on the Cramer bow) is wider than the Corelli model but still narrower than a Tourte, the screw mechanism becomes standard, and more sticks are made from pernambuco, rather than the earlier snakewood, ironwood, and china wood, which were often fluted for a portion of the length of the stick.[11]\\r\\nFine makers of these Transitional models were Ducha?ne, La Fleur, Meauchand, Tourte pre, and Edward Dodd.\\r\\nThe underlying reasons for the change from the old Corelli-Tartini model to the Cramer and, finally, to the Tourte were naturally related to musical demands on the part of composers and violinists. Undoubtedly the emphasis on cantabile, especially the long drawn out and evenly sustained phrase, required a generally longer bow and also a somewhat wider ribbon of hair.[12] These new bows were ideal to fill the new, very large concert halls with sound and worked great with the late classical and the new romantic repertoire.\\r\\nToday, with the rise of the historically informed performance movement, string players have developed a revived interest in the lighter, pre-Tourte bow, as more suitable for playing stringed instruments made in pre-19th-century style.\\r\\nA Stradivari bow, The King Charles IV Violin Bow attributed to the Stradivari Workshop, is currently in the collection of the National Music Museum at the University of South Dakota in Vermillion, South Dakota. The Rawlins Gallery violin bow, NMM 4882, is attributed to the workshop of Antonio Stradivari, Cremona, ca. 1700. This bow is one of two bows (the other in a private collection in London) attributed to the workshop of Antonio Stradivari.[13]\\r\\nThe Chinese yazheng and yaqin, and Korean ajaeng zithers are generally played by \\"bowing\\" with a rosined stick, which creates friction against the strings without any horsehair. The hurdy-gurdy's strings are similarly set into vibration by means of a \\"rosin wheel,\\" a wooden wheel which contacts the strings as it is rotated by means of a crank handle, creating a \\"bowed\\" tone.\\r\\nCareful owners always loosen the hair on a bow before putting it away. James McKean recommends that the owner \\"loosen the hair completely, then bring it back just a single turn of the button.\\" The goal is to \\"keep the hair even but allow the bow to relax.\\"[5] Over-tightening the bow, however, can also be damaging to the stick and cause it to break.[14]\\r\\nSince hairs may break in service, bows must be periodically rehaired, an operation usually performed by professionals rather than by the instrument owner.\\r\\nBows sometimes lose their correct camber (see above), and are recambered using the same heating method as is used in the original manufacture.\\r\\nLastly, the grip or winding of the bow must occasionally be replaced to maintain a good grip and protect the wood.\\r\\nThese repairs are usually left to professionals, as the head of the bow is extremely fragile, and a poor rehair, or a broken ivory plate on the tip, can lead to ruining the bow.\\r\\nIn vernacular speech the bow is occasionally called a fiddlestick. Bows for particular instruments are often designated as such: violin bow, cello bow, and so on.\\r\\nSources\\r\\nNotes","input":"How many horse hairs are on a violin bow?"},{"output":"the end of 2018","context":"The Tappan Zee Bridge, officially named the Governor Mario M.

The north span officially opened to westbound traffic on August 26, 2017; it also opened to eastbound traffic on October 6, 2017. Tappan Zee Constructors then began demolishing the old bridge. Eastbound traffic will be switched to the south span upon its completion. Both spans are expected to be operational by the end of 2018.[4]\\r\\nThe official name of the bridge has been controversial since its announcement, with a petition and proposed legislation opposing the attachment of Mario Cuomo's name to the bridge.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Tappan Zee river crossing was named by 17th century Dutch settlers.[5] The Tappan Zee Bridge and the smaller Bear Mountain Bridge are the only crossings of the stretch of the Hudson between Westchester and Rockland counties, both of which are part of New York City's populous northern suburbs.\\r\\nThe original Tappan Zee Bridge was a cantilever bridge built from 1952 to 1955.[6][7] The bridge was 3 miles (4.8?km) long and spanned the Hudson at its second-widest point. It was the longest bridge in New York State, at a length of 16,013 feet (4,881?m) including approaches.[8] Built immediately after the Korean War, the bridge had a low construction budget of only $81 million and a designed life-span of only 50 years.[9] During its first decade, the bridge carried fewer than 40,000 vehicles per day.\\r\\nBy the 2000s, the bridge was \\"decaying\\" and \\"overburdened\\".[9] The deteriorating structure bore an average of 140,000 vehicles per day, substantially more traffic than its designed capacity.[10] The collapse of Minnesota's I-35W Mississippi River bridge in 2007 raised worries about the Tappan Zee Bridge's structural integrity.[11] These concerns, together with traffic overcapacity and increased maintenance costs, escalated the serious discussions already ongoing about replacing the Tappan Zee with a tunnel or a new bridge.[12][13] Six options were identified and submitted for project study and environmental review.[14]\\r\\nThe 1950s Tappan Zee bridge was retired from service in 2017, as a replacement bridge was constructed.[10] The new bridge is intended to last at least 100 years.[15]\\r\\nThe Federal Highway Administration issued a report in October 2011 designating the Tappan Zee's replacement to be a dual-span twin bridge. The new bridge is now under construction a few yards to the north of the existing bridge, and will connect to the existing highway approaches of the New York State Thruway (I-87/I-287) on both river banks.[16] Construction began as scheduled during October 2013,[17][18] with completion targeted for 2017.[19] After some delays, the project is currently expected to be completed by June 15, 2018,[20] at a cost of $3.98 billion.[21]\\r\\nOriginally, some motorists thought that bridge tolls could more than double (to $12-$15 for automobiles, eastbound only), rising to those of New York City's Hudson River crossings.[15] However, the state passed legislation freezing the toll on the bridge at $5 through 2020 in its 2016 legislative session.[22]\\r\\nThe new Tappan Zee Bridge was proposed to include four vehicle lanes on each span, for a total of eight lanes, as well as a shared-use bicycle and pedestrian path. Like its predecessor, the new Tappan Zee Bridge is to be administered by the New York State Thruway Authority. The authority is the project co-sponsor, along with the state Department of Transportation.[16]\\r\\nThe New York Metropolitan Transportation Council added the Tappan Zee Bridge to its list of projects eligible for federal funds in August 2012.[23] The United States Department of Transportation approved the plan on September 25, 2012. The approval process took fewer than 10 months as opposed to the traditional multi-year process as a result of being placed on a \\"fast track\\" for approval by the Obama Administration.[24] On December 17, 2012, New York state officials dropped their proposal for a 45 percent increase on the state Thruway toll for trucks, while advancing a $3.14 billion project to replace the bridge.[25]\\r\\nThe new Tappan Zee Bridge was built by Tappan Zee Constructors, a design-build LLC composed of Fluor Corporation, American Bridge Company, Granite Construction Northeast and Traylor Bros. The Left Coast Lifter was used to install groups of pre-assembled girders one full span at a time.[26] By the end of 2013, General Electric had completed four seasons of dredging to remove contaminants from the river bottom. Approximately 70 percent of the sediments targeted for dredging were removed (totaling more than 1,900,000 cubic yards (1,500,000?m3) of sediment).[27]\\r\\nThe project timeline originally indicated that the old bridge would be closed in 2016 and that the demolition of the old bridge would begin in February 2017,[28] however, that timeline has since been amended. The first span of the bridge opened to westbound traffic on August 26, 2017,[3] and the project is expected to be completed by June 15, 2018.[20]\\r\\nWhen completed, the new Tappan Zee Bridge will be one of the widest cable-stayed bridges in the world, having a combined width across both decks of 183 feet (56?m).[2] The new spans will equal the width of the relatively short-span, cable-stayed Leonard Zakim Bridge in downtown Boston.[29] Turkey's 3rd Bosphorus bridge, completed in 2016, has a single deck about 192 feet (59?m) wide. The new Tappan Zee Bridge will also be one of the longest cable-stayed spans in the nation.[2][not in citation given]\\r\\nOn July 19, 2016, a crane used for the construction of the bridge collapsed onto the existing older bridge. Five people were injured, including three drivers and two bridge workers; no one was killed or critically injured.[30][31]\\r\\nThe new northbound/westbound span opened on August 26, 2017.[3][32] Southbound/eastbound traffic remained on the existing span until October 6, 2017, when it was shifted to the new northbound/westbound span to allow for the completion of the new southbound/eastbound span.[33] The northbound/westbound span of the new Tappan Zee Bridge temporarily has four lanes in both directions until the new southbound/eastbound span is complete.\\r\\nWest of the Tappan Zee, the 680,000 residents of Rockland and Orange counties currently have very limited mass transit to New York City via NJ Transit's Port Jervis Line and Pascack Valley Line commuter rail services or Coach USA's Rockland Coaches bus services. The bridge plan includes as an objective merely, \\"Providing a crossing that does not preclude future trans-Hudson transit services.\\"[16]\\r\\nA proposed bus rapid transit system using the new bridge was shelved as too expensive. However, the bridge was structurally built for expansion with BRT and/or commuter rail at a later date. The existing Tarrytown station of the Metro-North Railroad's Hudson Line is located about 2,000 feet (610?m) from the new bridge's eastern landing. In 2011, the state estimated that a bus connector to the station would cost about $151 million, about 3 percent of the bridge's projected cost.[34] Responding to widespread concerns about the lack of new public transit service, bridge planners agreed only to build one \\"dedicated express bus lane\\" in each direction for use during rush hour.[35]\\r\\nDuring construction, the project's website referred to the crossing as the \\"New NY Bridge\\".[36] However, other sources referred to the crossing as the \\"New Tappan Zee Bridge\\".[37][38]\\r\\nGovernor Andrew Cuomo was successful in passing legislation to name the bridge after his father, former Governor Mario Cuomo, on June 29, 2017.[39] This has been met with stiff criticism as a Reclaim New York Initiative poll of Rockland and Westchester county residents found only 14.7% of respondents support the new name.[40] Many have cited the timing of the New York State legislature vote at the last session before the summer term ended and the last chance to enact a state budget.[41] As of November 29, 2017, over 100,000 people have signed a Change.org petition called \\"Return the Cuomo Bridge its original name: The Tappan Zee.

Once calcium is introduced into the cytosol, it binds to the troponin of thin filaments, which causes the troponin-tropomyosin complex to change shape and allow the myosin heads to bind to the active sites of actin proteins.[1] In rigor mortis myosin heads continue binding with the active sites of actin proteins via adenosine diphosphate (ADP), and the muscle is unable to relax until further enzyme activity degrades the complex.[2]\\r\\nNormal relaxation would occur by replacing ADP with ATP, which would destabilize the myosin-actin bond and break the cross-bridge.[1] However, as ATP is absent, there must be a breakdown of muscle tissue by enzymes (endogenous or bacterial) during decomposition. As part of the process of decomposition, the myosin heads are degraded by the enzymes, allowing the muscle contraction to release and the body to relax.[4][5] Decomposition of the myofilaments occurs 48 to 60 hours after the peak of rigor mortis, which occurs approximately 13 hours after death.[1]\\r\\nAt the time of death, a condition called \\"primary flaccidity\\" occurs. Following this, the muscles stiffen in rigor mortis. All muscles in the body are affected. Starting between two and six hours following death, rigor mortis begins with the eyelids, neck, and jaw. The sequence may be due to different lactic acid levels among different muscles, which is directly related to the difference in glycogen levels and different types of muscle fibers.\\r\\nRigor mortis then spreads to the other muscles, including the internal organs, within the next four to six hours. The onset of rigor mortis is affected by the individual's age, sex, physical condition, and muscular build. Rigor mortis may not be perceivable in many infant and child corpses due to their smaller muscle mass.[6]\\r\\nRigor mortis is very important in meat technology. The onset of rigor mortis and its resolution partially determine the tenderness of meat. If the post-slaughter meat is immediately chilled to 15?C (59?F), a phenomenon known as cold shortening occurs, whereby the muscle sarcomeres shrink to a third of their original length.\\r\\nCold shortening is caused by the release of stored calcium ions from the sarcoplasmic reticulum of muscle fibers, in response to the cold stimulus. The calcium ions trigger powerful muscle contraction aided by ATP molecules. To prevent cold shortening, a process known as electrical stimulation is carried out, especially in beef carcasses, immediately after slaughter and skinning. In this process, the carcass is stimulated with alternating current, causing it to contract and relax, which depletes the ATP reserve from the carcass and prevents cold shortening.[7]\\r\\nThe degree of rigor mortis may be used in forensic pathology, to determine the approximate time of death. A dead body holds its position as rigor mortis sets in. If the body is moved after death, but before rigor mortis begins, forensic techniques such as livor mortis can be applied. If the position in which a body is found does not match the location where it is found (for example, if it is flat on its back with one arm sticking straight up), that could mean someone moved it.\\r\\nSeveral factors also affect the progression of rigor mortis, and investigators take these into account when estimating the time of death. One such factor is the ambient temperature. When conditions are warm, the onset and pace of rigor mortis are sped up by providing a conducive environment for the metabolic processes that cause decay. Low temperatures, however, slow them down. Therefore, for a person who dies outside in frozen conditions rigor mortis may last several days more than normal, so investigators may have to abandon it as a tool for determining time of death.[8][9]","input":"How long does it take for rigamortis to set in on a dead body?"},{"output":"Terminal 1","context":"Fort LauderdaleÿHollywood International Airport (IATA: FLL, ICAO: KFLL, FAA LID: FLL) is in Broward County, Florida, United States, The airport is off Interstate 595, U.S. Route 1, Florida State Road A1A, and Florida State Road 5 bounded by the cities Fort Lauderdale, Hollywood and Dania Beach,[4] three miles (5?km) southwest of downtown Fort Lauderdale[3] and 21 miles (34?km) north of Miami. The airport is near cruise line terminals at Port Everglades and is popular among tourists bound for the Caribbean. Since the late 1990s, FLL has become an intercontinental gateway, although Miami International Airport still handles most long-haul flights.\\r\\nIt is the largest base for Spirit Airlines, catering mainly to the airline's international to domestic network, and it is a focus city for JetBlue and Norwegian Long Haul. It is also a focus city for Allegiant Air and Southwest Airlines. In 2016, the top five air carriers by market share were JetBlue Airways at 25%, Southwest Airlines at 19.7%, Spirit Airlines at 19.4%, Delta Air Lines at 10.2%, and American Airlines at 6.9%.[5] FLL is ranked as the 19th busiest airport (in terms of passenger traffic) in the United States, as well as the nation's 14th busiest international air gateway and one of the world's 50 busiest airports. FLL is classified by the US Federal Aviation Administration as a \\"major hub\\" facility serving commercial air traffic. In 2017 the airport processed 32,511,053 passengers[1] (11.3% more than 2016) including 7,183,275 international passengers (18.6% more than 2016).\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMerle Fogg Airport opened on an abandoned 9-hole golf course on May 1, 1929. At the start of World War II, it was commissioned by the United States Navy and renamed Naval Air Station Fort Lauderdale. The base was initially used for refitting civil airliners for military service before they were ferried across the Atlantic to Europe and North Africa. NAS Fort Lauderdale later became a main training base for Naval Aviators and enlisted naval air crewmen flying the Grumman TBF and TBM Avenger for the U.S. Navy and U.S. Marine Corps aboard aircraft carriers and from expeditionary airfields ashore. NAS Fort Lauderdale was the home base for Flight 19, the five TBM Avengers that disappeared in December 1945, leading in part to the notoriety of the Bermuda Triangle.\\r\\nNAS Fort Lauderdale closed on October 1, 1946 and was transferred to county control, becoming Broward County International Airport.\\r\\nCommercial flights to Nassau began on June 2, 1953, and domestic flights began in 1958ÿ1959: Northeast Airlines and National Airlines DC-6Bs flew nonstop to Idlewild, and Northeast flew nonstop to Washington National.

(Northeast's nonstop to Los Angeles had already been dropped.)\\r\\nBy 1974, the airport was served by Braniff International Airways, Delta Air Lines, Eastern Air Lines, National Airlines, Northwest Orient Airlines, Shawnee Airlines and United Airlines.[6] By 1979, following deregulation, Air Florida, Bahamasair, Florida Airlines, Mackey International Airlines, Republic Airlines, Trans World Airlines and Western Airlines also served the airport.[7]\\r\\nLow-cost airline traffic grew in the 1990s, with Southwest opening its base in 1996, Spirit in 1999, and JetBlue in 2000. Spirit Airlines made FLL a hub in 2002. In 2003, JetBlue made FLL a focus city. US Airways also planned a hub at Fort Lauderdale in the mid-2000s as part of its reorganization strategy before its merger with America West.[8]\\r\\nLow-cost competition forced several major legacy airlines to cut back service to FLL, with United pulling out of the airport entirely in 2008[9] and American Airlines moving its New York and Los Angeles services to West Palm Beach in 2013.[10]\\r\\nDuring the 2005 hurricane season FLL was affected by Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Wilma. Katrina struck land in late August as a Category 1 and made landfall on Keating Beach just two miles from the airport (near the border of Broward and MiamiÿDade counties) with 80?mph (130?km/h) winds but caused only minor damage; however, the airport was closed for about a 48-hour period. However, when Hurricane Wilma made landfall in October roof damage was reported along with broken windows, damaged jetways, and destroyed canopies. The airport was closed for a period of 5 days. Hurricane Wilma was a Category 2 when its center passed to the west of FLL.\\r\\nIn February 2007, the airport started fees to all users, including private aircraft. FLL is one of the few airports to administer fees to private pilots. A minimum charge of $10 is assessed on landing private aircraft.\\r\\nOn October 11, 2016, Emirates announced that they would operate a flight from Dubai to Ft.

Proposed improvements include an extension of runway 10R/28L,[17] construction and modifications to the airport's taxiway system to provide for increased speed, improved inter-terminal passenger movement and extensive terminal upgrades. The plan was updated a second time in April 25, 2006. Complaints by nearby communities about noise, along with concerns about buyout requirements, delayed construction that is expected to keep Fort LauderdaleÿHollywood International Airport viable through 2020.[18]\\r\\nOn June 5, 2007 Broward County commissioners voted six to three in favor of extending the southern 10R/28L runway. The proposal looks to extend the runway to 8,000?ft in order to accommodate larger aircraft and to allow airplanes to land side by side at the same time. The proposal was approved by the FAA and expansion of the south runway is now complete, with the opening of the runway in September 2014.[13] The crosswind runway (13/31) was decommissioned on May 6, 2013.[19] All four terminals, now having 57 gates, will have 97 with the completion of a new long-haul international Terminal Four and Concourse A at Terminal One. By 2020, Ft. LauderdaleÿHollywood is projected to handle 36 million passengers annually.[20]\\r\\nDuring and after the expansion of runway 10R/28L, reconstruction of Terminal Four will begin at the cost of $450 million. The H concourse will be demolished to build the new \\"G\\" concourse. In this process four new gates will be added. Concession space will be increased from 2,128?ft2 to 28,000?ft2 and a secure walkway will be added to connect terminals three and four.[21]\\r\\nFort LauderdaleÿHollywood International Airport has four terminals. Terminal 1, commonly referred to as \\"The New Terminal,\\" opened in stages between 2001 and 2003 and was designed by Hellmuth, Obata and Kassabaum[22] and Cartaya Associates.[23] The other three terminals were constructed in 1986 and designed by Reynolds, Smith & Hills as part of a $263 million construction project.[24] Terminal 4, commonly referred to as the International Terminal, was inaugurated by a Concorde visit in 1983. Since 2005, T4 has been undergoing renovations and a major expansion designed by PGAL/Zyscovich joint venture. The airport announced that Terminal 1, common known as \\"The New Terminal\\", will undergo $300 million makeover. Construction began in late 2015 and was completed in June 2017.[25]\\r\\nSee Fort Lauderdale Executive Airport\\r\\nInternationally known artist and sculptor Duane Hanson created an installation for his work \\"Vendor with walkman\\" at the Departure Level of Terminal 3 at the airport. Hamson who retired and died in nearby Boca Raton created a seated middled age man wearing a red T-shirt, blue pants, baseball cap and listening to a walkman during a break. The installation accessories give additional clues to the narrative of the artwork: toy airplane, various signs and announcement for the shop, janitorial supplies.[71]\\r\\nFLL is served by Broward County Transit bus Route 1 which offers connecting service through the Central Terminal in Downtown Fort Lauderdale, and also service to Aventura, in Miami-Dade County.\\r\\nRail service between Miami and West Palm Beach is provided by Tri-Rail commuter rail service at the Fort Lauderdale/Hollywood International Airport station, accessible via a free Tri-Rail shuttle from the main terminals. The shuttle stops at 3 locations at the airport, all on the lower level: west end of terminal 1, between terminals 2 and 3, and between terminals 3 and 4.

The aircraft then caught fire but all passengers and crew were able to safely evacuate.[72]\\r\\nOn July 7, 1983, Air Florida Flight 8 with 47 people on board was flying from Fort Lauderdale International Airport to Tampa International Airport. One of the passengers handed a note to one of the flight attendants, saying that he had a bomb, and telling them to fly the plane to Havana, Cuba. He revealed a small athletic bag, which he opened, and inside was an apparent explosive device. The airplane was diverted to Havana-Jos Mart International Airport, and the hijacker was taken into custody by Cuban authorities.[73]\\r\\nOn November 19, 2013, an Air Evac International Learjet 35 crashed shortly after take-off from the airport, on its way to Cozumel, Mexico, after calling mayday and during an attempt to return to the airport, possibly due to engine failure, leaving 4 persons dead.[74]\\r\\nOn October 29, 2015, Dynamic Airways Flight 405, a Boeing 767-246ER (N251MY) was taxiing to a runway to take off for a flight to Caracas, Venezuela. when its left engine caught fire due to a fuel leak. The crew immediately stopped the airplane and fire crews arrived on the scene. All 101 passengers and crew were evacuated the aircraft, and 17 passengers were transported to a hospital. All runways were shut down and air operations ceased at the airport for three hours.[75]\\r\\nOn October 28, 2016, Fedex Express Flight 910, a McDonnell Douglas MD-10-10F cargo aircraft (N370FE) arriving from Memphis, Tennessee, caught fire after its left landing gear collapsed upon landing. The fire destroyed its left engine and wing. The three-person crew evacuated the aircraft safely.\\r\\nOn January 6, 2017, a mass shooting occurred in the baggage claim area of Terminal 2 of the airport.[76] Five people were killed, eight others were injured. The shooter was taken into custody without incident and was identified by authorities as Esteban Santiago-Ruiz. Santiago acted alone.[77] In May of 2018, Santiago plead guilty to the killings to avoid the death penalty as part of a plea deal. The specifics of the plea deal call for him to serve five consecutive life sentences followed by 120 years in prison without a right to appeal.

Having a semi-arid climate, it stretches across the south-central latitudes of Northern Africa between the Atlantic Ocean and the Red Sea. The name is derived from the Arabic word s?il (????, Arabic pronunciation:?[?sa??il]) meaning \\"coast\\" or \\"shore\\" in a figurative sense (in reference to the southern edge of the vast Sahara),[2][3] while the name Swahili means \\"coastal [dweller]\\" in a literal sense.\\r\\nThe Sahel part of Africa includes (from west to east) parts of northern Senegal, southern Mauritania, central Mali, northern Burkina Faso, the extreme south of Algeria, Niger, the extreme north of Nigeria, central Chad, central and southern Sudan, the extreme north of South Sudan, Eritrea, Cameroon, Central African Republic and extreme north of Ethiopia.[4]\\r\\nHistorically, the western part of the Sahel was sometimes known as the Sudan region.[5] This belt was roughly located between the Sahara and the coastal areas of West Africa.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Sahel spans 5,400?km (3,360?mi) from the Atlantic Ocean in the west to the Red Sea in the east, in a belt that varies from several hundred to a thousand kilometers (c. 600 miles) in width, covering an area of 3,053,200 square kilometers (1,178,850?sq?mi). It is a transitional ecoregion of semi-arid grasslands, savannas, steppes, and thorn shrublands lying between the wooded Sudanian Savanna to the south and the Sahara to the north.[6]\\r\\nThe topography of the Sahel is mainly flat; most of the region lies between 200 and 400 meters (660 and 1,310?ft) in elevation. Several isolated plateaus and mountain ranges rise from the Sahel, but are designated as separate ecoregions because their flora and fauna are distinct from the surrounding lowlands. Annual rainfall varies from around 100ÿ200?mm (4ÿ8?in) in the north of the Sahel to around 600?mm (24?in) in the south.[6]\\r\\nThe Sahel is mostly covered in grassland and savanna, with areas of woodland and shrubland. Grass cover is fairly continuous across the region, dominated by annual grass species such as Cenchrus biflorus, Schoenefeldia gracilis and Aristida stipoides. Species of acacia are the dominant trees, with Acacia tortilis the most chicken , along with Acacia senegal and Acacia laeta. Other tree species include Commiphora africana, Balanites aegyptiaca, Faidherbia albida, and Boscia senegalensis. In the northern part of the Sahel, areas of desert shrub, including Panicum turgidum and Aristida sieberana, alternate with areas of grassland and savanna. During the long dry season, many trees lose their leaves and the predominantly annual grasses die.\\r\\nThe Sahel was formerly home to large populations of grazing mammals, including the scimitar-horned oryx (Oryx dammah), dama gazelle (Gazella dama), Dorcas gazelle (Gazella dorcas), red-fronted gazelle (Gazella rufifrons), the giant prehistoric buffalo (Pelorovis) and Bubal hartebeest (Alcelaphus busephalus buselaphus), along with large predators like the African wild dog (Lycaon pictus), the Northwest African cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus hecki), the Northeast African cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus soemmeringii), the West African lion (Panthera leo senegalensis) and the East African lion (Panthera leo melanochaita). The larger species have been greatly reduced in number by over-hunting and competition with livestock, and several species are vulnerable (Dorcas gazelle, cheetah, lion and red-fronted gazelle), endangered (Dama gazelle and African wild dog), or extinct (the Scimitar-horned oryx is probably extinct in the wild, and both Pelorovis and the Bubal hartebeest are now extinct).\\r\\nThe seasonal wetlands of the Sahel are important for migratory birds moving within Africa and on the African-Eurasian flyways.[6]\\r\\nThe Sahel has a tropical, hot steppe climate (K?ppen climate classification BSh). The climate is typically hot, sunny, dry and somewhat windy all year long. The Sahel's climate is similar to, but less extreme than, the climate of the Sahara desert located just to the north.\\r\\nThe Sahel mainly receives a low to a very low amount of precipitation annually. The steppe has a very long, prevailing dry season and a short rainy season. The precipitation is also extremely irregular, and varies considerably from season to season. Most of the rain usually falls during only one or two months, while the other months may remain absolutely dry. The entire Sahel region generally receives between 100?mm and 600?mm of rain yearly. A system of subdivisions often adopted for the Sahelian climate based on annual rainfall is as follows: the Saharan-Sahelian climate, with mean annual precipitation between around 100 and 200?mm (such as Khartoum, Sudan), the strict Sahelian climate, with mean annual precipitation between around 200 and 600?mm (such as Kiffa, Mauritania) and the Sahelian-Sudanese climate, with mean annual precipitation between around 200 and 400?mm (such as Niamey, Niger). The relative humidity in the steppe is low to very low, often between 10% and 25% during the dry season and between 25% and 75% during the rainy season. The least humid places have a relative humidity under 35%.\\r\\nThe Sahel is characterized by constant, intense heat, with an unvarying temperature. The Sahel rarely experiences cold temperatures. During the hottest period, the average high temperatures are generally between 36 and 42?C (97 and 108?F) (and even more in the hottest regions), often for more than three months, while the average low temperatures are around 25 to 31?C (77 to 88?F). During the \\"coldest period\\", the average high temperatures are between 27 and 33?C (81 and 91?F) and the average low temperature are between 15 and 21?C (59 and 70?F). Everywhere in the Sahel, the average mean temperature is over 18?C (64?F) due to the tropical climate.\\r\\nThe Sahel has a high to very high sunshine duration year-round, between 2,700 hours (about 61% of the daylight hours) and 3,500 hours (more than 79% of the daylight hours). The sunshine duration in the Sahel approaches desert levels, and is comparable to that in the Arabian Desert, for example, even though the Sahel is only a steppe and not a desert. The cloud cover is low to very low. For example, Niamey, Niger has 3,082 hours of bright sunshine; Gao, Mali has near 3,385 hours of sunshine; Timbuktu, Mali has 3,409 sunny hours, and N'Djamena, Chad has 3,205 hours of sunlight.[7][8][9][10]\\r\\nTraditionally, most of the people in the Sahel have been semi-nomads, farming and raising livestock in a system of transhumance, which is probably the most sustainable way of utilizing the Sahel. The difference between the dry North with higher levels of soil nutrients and the wetter South with more vegetation, is utilized by having the herds graze on high quality feed in the North during the wet season, and trek several hundred kilometers to the South to graze on more abundant, but less nutritious feed during the dry period.[citation needed]\\r\\nIn Western Sahel, polygamy and child marriage are common.[11] Female genital mutilation is also practiced across the Sahel.[11][12]\\r\\nAround 4000 BC, the climate of the Sahara and the Sahel started to become drier at an exceedingly fast pace. This climate change caused lakes and rivers to shrink rather significantly and caused increasing desertification. This, in turn, decreased the amount of land conducive to settlements and caused migrations of farming communities to the more humid climate of West Africa.[13]\\r\\nThe Sahelian kingdoms were a series of monarchies centered in the Sahel between the 9th and 18th centuries. The wealth of the states came from controlling the trans-Saharan trade routes across the desert, especially the slave trade with the Islamic world. Their power came from having large pack animals like camels and horses that were fast enough to keep a large empire under central control and were also useful in battle. All of these empires were quite decentralized with member cities having a great deal of autonomy. The first large Sahelian kingdoms emerged after AD 750 and supported several large trading cities in the Niger Bend region, including Timbuktu, Gao, and Djenn.\\r\\nThe Sahel states were hindered from expanding south into the forest zone of the Ashanti and Yoruba peoples as mounted warriors were all but useless in the forests and the horses and camels could not survive the heat and diseases of the region.\\r\\nThe Western Sahel fell to France in the late 19th century as part of French West Africa. Chad was added in 1900 as part of French Equatorial Africa. The French territories were decolonized in 1960.\\r\\nThe Eastern Sahel (the part in what is now Sudan) did not fall to the European powers but was annexed by Muhammad Ali of Egypt in 1820. It came under British administration as part of the Sultanate of Egypt in 1914. The Sudanese Sahel became part of independent Sudan in 1956, and South Sudan in turn achieved its independence from Sudan proper in 2011.\\r\\nFor hundreds of years, the Sahel region has experienced regular droughts and megadroughts. One megadrought, from 1450 to 1700, lasted 250 years.[14] There was a major drought in the Sahel in 1914 caused by annual rains far below average, leading to large-scale famine. From 1951 to 2004, the Sahel experienced some of the most consistent and severe droughts in Africa.[15] The 1960s saw a large increase in rainfall in the region, making the northern drier region more accessible. There was a push, supported by governments, for people to move northwards. When the long drought period from 1968 through 1974 began, grazing quickly became unsustainable and large-scale denuding of the terrain followed. Like the drought in 1914, this led to a large-scale famine, but this time somewhat tempered by international visibility and an outpouring of aid. This catastrophe led to the founding of the International Fund for Agricultural Development.\\r\\nIn June to August 2010 famine struck the Sahel.[16] Niger's crops failed to mature in the heat, 350,000 faced starvation, and 1,200,000 were at risk of famine.[17] In Chad the temperature reached 47.6?C (117.7?F) on 22 June in Faya-Largeau, breaking a record set in 1961 at the same location. Niger tied its highest temperature record set in 1998, also on 22 June, at 47.1?C in Bilma. That record was broken the next day, when Bilma hit 48.2?C (118.8?F). The hottest temperature recorded in Sudan was reached on 25 June, at 49.6?C (121.3?F) in Dongola, breaking a record set in 1987.[18] Niger reported on 14 July that diarrhea, starvation, gastroenteritis, malnutrition, and respiratory diseases had sickened or killed many children. The new military junta appealed for international food aid and took serious steps to call on overseas help.[19] On 26 July, the heat reached near-record levels over Chad and Niger,[20] and in northern Niger about 20 people reportedly died of dehydration by 27 July.\\r\\nOver-farming, over-grazing, over-population of marginal lands, and natural soil erosion, have caused serious desertification of the region.[21][22] This has had an impact on shelter construction, making it necessary to change the used materials. The Woodless Construction project was introduced in Sahel in 1980 by the Development Workshop, achieving since then a high social impact in the region.[23]\\r\\nMajor dust storms are a frequent occurrence as well. During November 2004, a number of major dust storms hit Chad, originating in the Bodl Depression.[24] This is a common area for dust storms (occurring, on average, 100 days every year).\\r\\nOn 23 March 2010, a major sandstorm hit Mauritania, Senegal, Gambia, Guinea-Bissau, Guinea, and inland Sierra Leone. Another struck in southern Algeria, inland Mauritania, Mali, and northern Ivory Coast[25] at the same time.","input":"What are the grasslands south of egypt called?"},{"output":"January 13, 1847","context":"","input":"When did california become part of the usa?"},{"output":"prehistoric Adena culture indigenous peoples of eastern North America","context":"Number of monuments: 10\\r\\nMounds State Park is a state park in Anderson, Indiana (not to be confused with Mounds State Recreation Area (SRA) near Brookville, Indiana) featuring Native American heritage, and 10 ceremonial mounds built by the prehistoric Adena culture indigenous peoples of eastern North America, and also used centuries later by Hopewell culture inhabitants.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe largest earthwork, the \\"Great Mound\\", is believed to have been constructed around 160 BC.

There are seven enclosures and four additional earthworks, which have been divided into two groups, the northern complex and the southern complex. The Great Mound enclosure is the dominant structure in the park and the southern group.[3]\\r\\nThe Great Mound is approximately 300 feet (91?m) across and consists of an outer embankment 9 feet (2.7?m) high and 63 feet (19?m) wide, surrounding a 60 feet (18?m) wide ditch that is 10.5 feet (3.2?m) deep.

These dates are obtained through radiocarbon dating and some artifacts.[3] A nearby log tomb was found with a platform pipe typical of Hopewell styles from 50 C.E. Post hole remnants were dated to 60 BCE and 230 CE. Radiocarbon dates from excavated material of the Great Mound established 160 BCE +/- 90 for the embankment. The neighboring Fiddleback Mound was dated to 120 BCE +/- 70.[3]\\r\\nIn 1900, a series of strange misshapen skeletons were unearthed from similar mounds in nearby Alexandria, Indiana. This brought thousands of tourists from around the Mid-West. In 1910, several locals admitted to stealing chimpanzee skeletons from the nearby Muncie Zoo's monkey house. In 1915 the skeletons were sold to a local museum which burned down in 1919.[4]\\r\\nWhat is now Mounds State Park was the location of an amusement park which operated from 1897 until 1929. While the amusement park exploited the native-made mounds, it also helped to protect them by making them a \\"point of regional pride and a destination,\\" otherwise they may have been plundered or otherwise destroyed. When the Great Depression hit, the property was sold to Madison County Historical Society, which transferred ownership to the State of Indiana, after which it became Mounds State Park.[5]\\r\\nCanoeing is also available in Mounds State Park, on the White River.","input":"Who built the great mound near anderson indiana?"},{"output":"March 24, 1989","context":"The Exxon Valdez oil spill occurred in Prince William Sound, Alaska, March 24, 1989, when Exxon Valdez, an oil tanker owned by Exxon Shipping Company, bound for Long Beach, California, struck Prince William Sound's Bligh Reef at 12:04?am[1][2] local time and spilled 10.8?million US gallons (260,000?bbl; 41,000?m3) of crude oil over the next few days.[3] It is considered to be one of the most devastating human-caused environmental disasters.[4] The Valdez spill is the second largest in US waters, after the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill, in terms of volume released.[5] Prince William Sound's remote location, accessible only by helicopter, plane, or boat, made government and industry response efforts difficult and severely taxed existing response plans. The region is a habitat for salmon, sea otters, seals and seabirds. The oil, originally extracted at the Prudhoe Bay oil field, eventually covered 1,300 miles (2,100?km) of coastline,[3] and 11,000 square miles (28,000?km2) of ocean.[6][7]\\r\\nAccording to official reports, the ship was carrying 53.09451?million US gallons (1,264,155?bbl; 200,984.6?m3) of oil, of which about 10.8?million US gallons (260,000?bbl; 41,000?m3) were spilled into the Prince William Sound.[1][8] An approximate figure of 11?million US gallons (260,000?bbl; 42,000?m3) was a commonly accepted estimate of the spill's volume and has been used by the State of Alaska's Exxon Valdez Oil Spill Trustee Council,[3] the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and environmental groups such as Greenpeace and the Sierra Club.[5][9][10]\\r\\nMultiple factors have been identified as contributing to the incident:\\r\\nCaptain Joseph Hazelwood, who was widely reported to have been drinking heavily that night, was not at the controls when the ship struck the reef. However, as the senior officer, he was in command of the ship even though he was asleep in his bunk. In light of the other findings, investigative reporter Greg Palast stated in 2008, \\"Forget the drunken skipper fable. As to Captain Joe Hazelwood, he was below decks, sleeping off his bender. At the helm, the third mate never would have collided with Bligh Reef had he looked at his RAYCAS radar. But the radar was not turned on. In fact, the tanker's radar was left broken and disabled for more than a year before the disaster, and Exxon management knew it. It was just too expensive to fix and operate.\\"[14] Exxon blamed Captain Hazelwood for the grounding of the tanker.[13]\\r\\nOther factors, according to an MIT course entitled \\"Software System Safety\\" by Professor Nancy G. Leveson,[15] included:\\r\\nThis disaster resulted in International Maritime Organization introducing comprehensive marine pollution prevention rules (MARPOL) through various conventions. The rules were ratified by member countries and, under International Ship Management rules, the ships are being operated with a common objective of \\"safer ships and cleaner oceans\\".[19]\\r\\nIn 2009, Exxon Valdez Captain Joseph Hazelwood offered a \\"heartfelt apology\\" to the people of Alaska, suggesting he had been wrongly blamed for the disaster: \\"The true story is out there for anybody who wants to look at the facts, but that's not the sexy story and that's not the easy story,\\" he said. Hazelwood said he felt Alaskans always gave him a fair shake.[20]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChemical dispersant, a surfactant and solvent mixture, was applied to the slick by a private company on March 24 with a helicopter. But the helicopter missed the target area. Scientific data on its toxicity were either thin or incomplete. In addition, public acceptance of a new, widespread chemical treatment was lacking. Landowners, fishing groups, and conservation organizations questioned the use of chemicals on hundreds of miles of shoreline when other alternatives may have been available.\\"[21][22][22][23]\\r\\nAccording to a report by David Kirby for TakePart, the main component of the Corexit formulation used during cleanup, 2-butoxyethanol, was identified as \\"one of the agents that caused liver, kidney, lung, nervous system, and blood disorders among cleanup crews in Alaska following the 1989 Exxon Valdez spill.[24]\\r\\nMechanical cleanup was started shortly afterwards using booms and skimmers, but the skimmers were not readily available during the first 24 hours following the spill, and thick oil and kelp tended to clog the equipment. Despite civilian insistence for a complete clean, only 10% of total oil was actually completely cleaned.[1] Exxon was widely criticized for its slow response to cleaning up the disaster and John Devens, the mayor of Valdez, has said his community felt betrayed by Exxon's inadequate response to the crisis.[25] More than 11,000 Alaska residents, along with some Exxon employees, worked throughout the region to try to restore the environment.\\r\\nBecause Prince William Sound contained many rocky coves where the oil collected, the decision was made to displace it with high-pressure hot water. However, this also displaced and destroyed the microbial populations on the shoreline; many of these organisms (e.g. plankton) are the basis of the coastal marine food chain, and others (e.g. certain bacteria and fungi) are capable of facilitating the biodegradation of oil. At the time, both scientific advice and public pressure was to clean everything, but since then, a much greater understanding of natural and facilitated remediation processes has developed, due somewhat in part to the opportunity presented for study by the Exxon Valdez spill. Despite the extensive cleanup attempts, less than ten percent of the oil was recovered and a study conducted by NOAA determined that as of early 2007 more than 26?thousand U.S. gallons (98?m3) of oil remain in the sandy soil of the contaminated shoreline, declining at a rate of less than 4% per year.[26][27]\\r\\nBoth the long-term and short-term effects of the oil spill have been studied.[28] Immediate effects included the deaths of 100,000 to as many as 250,000 seabirds, at least 2,800 sea otters, approximately 12 river otters, 300 harbor seals, 247 bald eagles, and 22 orcas, and an unknown number of salmon and herring.[8][29]\\r\\nIn 2003, fourteen years after the spill, a team from the University of North Carolina found that the remaining oil was lasting far longer than anticipated, which in turn had resulted in more long-term loss of many species than had been expected. The researchers found that at only a few parts per billion, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons caused a long-term increase in mortality rates. They reported that \\"species as diverse as sea otters, harlequin ducks and killer whales suffered large, long-term losses and that oiled mussel beds and other tidal shoreline habitats will take an estimated 30 years to recover.\\"[30]\\r\\nIn 2006, a study done by the National Marine Fisheries Service in Juneau found that about 6 miles (9.7?km) of shoreline around Prince William Sound was still affected by the spill, with 101.6 tonnes of oil remaining in the area. Exxon Mobil denied any concerns over any remaining oil, stating that they anticipated a remaining fraction that they assert will not cause any long-term ecological impacts, according to the conclusions of the studies they had done: \\"We've done 350 peer-reviewed studies of Prince William Sound, and those studies conclude that Prince William Sound has recovered, it's healthy and it's thriving.\\"[31] However, in 2007 a NOAA study concluded that this contamination can produce chronic low-level exposure, discourage subsistence where the contamination is heavy, and decrease the \\"wilderness character\\" of the area.[27]\\r\\nThe effects of the spill continued to be felt for many years afterwards. As of 2010 there were an estimated 23,000 US gallons (87?m3) of Valdez crude oil still in Alaska's sand and soil, breaking down at a rate estimated at less than 4% per year.[32]\\r\\nOn March 24, 2014, the twenty-fifth anniversary of the spill, NOAA scientists reported that some species seem to have recovered, with the sea otter the latest creature to return to pre-spill numbers. Scientists who have monitored the spill area for the last 25 years report that concern remains for one of two pods of local orca whales, with fears that one pod may eventually die out.[33] Federal scientists estimate that between 16,000 and 21,000 US gallons (61 to 79 m3) of oil remains on beaches in Prince William Sound and up to 450 miles (725 km) away. Some of the oil does not appear to have biodegraded at all. A USGS scientist who analyses the remaining oil along the coastline states that it remains among rocks and between tide marks. \\"The oil mixes with seawater and forms an emulsion...Left out, the surface crusts over but the inside still has the consistency of mayonnaise ÿ or mousse.\\"[34] Alaska state senator Berta Gardner is urging Alaskan politicians to demand that the US government force ExxonMobil to pay the final $92 million (S57 million) still owed from the court settlement. The major part of the money would be spent to finish cleaning up oiled beaches and attempting to restore the crippled herring population.[34]\\r\\nIn the case of Exxon v. Baker, an Anchorage jury awarded $287?million for actual damages and $5?billion for punitive damages. To protect itself in case the judgment was affirmed, Exxon obtained a $4.8?billion credit line from J.P. Morgan & Co. J.P. Morgan created the first modern credit default swap in 1994, so that Morgan's would not have to hold as much money in reserve (8% of the loan under Basel I) against the risk of Exxon's default.[35]\\r\\nMeanwhile, Exxon appealed the ruling, and the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ordered the original judge, Russel Holland, to reduce the punitive damages. On December 6, 2002, the judge announced that he had reduced the damages to $4?billion, which he concluded was justified by the facts of the case and was not grossly excessive. Exxon appealed again and the case returned to court to be considered in light of a recent Supreme Court ruling in a similar case, which caused Judge Holland to increase the punitive damages to $4.5?billion, plus interest.[citation needed]\\r\\nAfter more appeals, and oral arguments heard by the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals on January 27, 2006, the damages award was cut to $2.5?billion on December 22, 2006. The court cited recent Supreme Court rulings relative to limits on punitive damages.[36]\\r\\nExxon appealed again. On May 23, 2007, the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals denied ExxonMobil's request for a third hearing and let stand its ruling that Exxon owes $2.5?billion in punitive damages. Exxon then appealed to the Supreme Court, which agreed to hear the case.[37] On February 27, 2008, the Supreme Court heard oral arguments for 90 minutes. Justice Samuel Alito, who at the time, owned between $100,000 and $250,000 in Exxon stock, recused himself from the case.[38] In a decision issued June 25, 2008, Justice David Souter issued the judgment of the court, vacating the $2.5?billion award and remanding the case back to the lower court, finding that the damages were excessive with respect to maritime common law. Exxon's actions were deemed \\"worse than negligent but less than malicious.\\"[39] The punitive damages were further reduced to an amount of $507.5?million.[40] The Court's ruling was that maritime punitive damages should not exceed the compensatory damages,[40] supported by a peculiar precedent dating back from 1818.[41] Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick J. Leahy has decried the ruling as \\"another in a line of cases where this Supreme Court has misconstrued congressional intent to benefit large corporations.\\"[42]\\r\\nExxon's official position was that punitive damages greater than $25?million were not justified because the spill resulted from an accident, and because Exxon spent an estimated $2?billion cleaning up the spill and a further $1?billion to settle related civil and criminal charges. Attorneys for the plaintiffs contended that Exxon bore responsibility for the accident because the company \\"put a drunk in charge of a tanker in Prince William Sound.\\"[43]\\r\\nExxon recovered a significant portion of clean-up and legal expenses through insurance claims associated with the grounding of the Exxon Valdez.[44][45] Also, in 1991, Exxon made a quiet, separate financial settlement of damages with a group of seafood producers known as the Seattle Seven for the disaster's effect on the Alaskan seafood industry. The agreement granted $63.75?million to the Seattle Seven, but stipulated that the seafood companies would have to repay almost all of any punitive damages awarded in other civil proceedings. The $5?billion in punitive damages was awarded later, and the Seattle Seven's share could have been as high as $750?million if the damages award had held. Other plaintiffs have objected to this secret arrangement,[46] and when it came to light, Judge Holland ruled that Exxon should have told the jury at the start that an agreement had already been made, so the jury would know exactly how much Exxon would have to pay.[47]\\r\\nAs of December 15, 2009, Exxon paid all owed $507.5 million punitive damages, including lawsuit costs, plus interest, which were further distributed to thousands of plaintiffs.[48]\\r\\nIn October 1989, Exxon filed suit against the State of Alaska, charging that the government had interfered with Exxon's attempts to clean up the spill by refusing to approve the use of dispersant chemicals until the night of the 26th. The government disputed the claim, stating that there was a long-standing agreement to allow the use of dispersants to clean up spills, thus Exxon did not require permission to use them, and that in fact Exxon had not had enough dispersant on hand to effectively handle a spill of the size created by the Valdez.[49] Exxon filed claims in October 1990 against the Coast Guard, asking to be reimbursed for cleanup costs and damages awarded to plaintiffs in any lawsuits filed by the State of Alaska or the Federal Government against Exxon. The company claimed that the Coast Guard was \\"wholly or partially responsible\\" for the spill, because they had granted mariners' licenses to the crew of the Valdez, and because they had given the Valdez permission to leave regular shipping lanes to avoid ice. They also reiterated the claim that the Coast Guard had delayed cleanup by refusing to give permission to use chemical dispersants on the spill immediately.[50]\\r\\nThe Oil Spill Recovery Institute was formed after United States Congress approved it to seek a solution. Collaborating with InnoCentive they found a partial solution for the flow of oil.[51]\\r\\nA report by the US National Response Team summarized the event and made a number of recommendations, such as changes to the work patterns of Exxon crew in order to address the causes of the accident.[1]\\r\\nIn response to the spill, the United States Congress passed the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA). The legislation included a clause that prohibits any vessel that, after March 22, 1989, has caused an oil spill of more than 1?million US gallons (3,800?m3) in any marine area, from operating in Prince William Sound.[52]\\r\\nIn April 1998, the company argued in a legal action against the Federal government that the ship should be allowed back into Alaskan waters. Exxon claimed OPA was effectively a bill of attainder, a regulation that was unfairly directed at Exxon alone.[53] In 2002, the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled against Exxon. As of 2002, OPA had prevented 18 ships from entering Prince William Sound.[54]\\r\\nOPA also set a schedule for the gradual phase in of a double hull design, providing an additional layer between the oil tanks and the ocean. While a double hull would likely not have prevented the Valdez disaster, a Coast Guard study estimated that it would have cut the amount of oil spilled by 60 percent.[55]\\r\\nThe Exxon Valdez supertanker was towed to San Diego, arriving on July 10. Repairs began on July 30. Approximately 1,600 short tons (1,500?t) of steel were removed and replaced. In June 1990 the tanker, renamed S/R Mediterranean, left harbor after $30?million of repairs.[54] It was still sailing as of January 2010, registered in Panama. The vessel was then owned by a Hong Kong company, who operated it under the name Oriental Nicety. In August 2012, it was beached at Alang, India and dismantled.\\r\\nIn the aftermath of the spill, Alaska governor Steve Cowper issued an executive order requiring two tugboats to escort every loaded tanker from Valdez out through Prince William Sound to Hinchinbrook Entrance. As the plan evolved in the 1990s, one of the two routine tugboats was replaced with a 210-foot (64?m) Escort Response Vehicle (ERV). Tankers at Valdez are no longer single-hulled. Congress enacted legislation requiring all tankers to be double-hulled as of 2015.[56]\\r\\nIn 1991, following the collapse of the local marine population (particularly clams, herring and seals) the Chugach Alaska Corporation, an Alaska Native Corporation, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. It has since recovered.[57]\\r\\nAccording to several studies funded by the state of Alaska, the spill had both short-term and long-term economic effects. These included the loss of recreational sports, fisheries, reduced tourism, and an estimate of what economists call \\"existence value\\", which is the value to the public of a pristine Prince William Sound.[58][59][60][61]\\r\\nThe economy of the city of Cordova, Alaska was adversely affected after the spill damaged stocks of salmon and herring in the area.[62][63] The village of Chenega was transformed into an emergency base and media outlet.The local villagers had to cope with a tripling of their population from 80 to 250. When asked how they felt about the situation, a village councillor noted that they were too shocked and busy to be depressed; others emphasized the human costs of leaving children unattended while their parents worked to clean up.[64] Many Native Americans were worried that too much time was spent on the fishery and not enough on the land that supports subsidence hunting.?\\r\\nIn 2010, a CNN report alleged that many oil spill cleanup workers involved in the Exxon Valdez response had subsequently become sick. Anchorage lawyer Dennis Mestas found that this was true of 6,722 of 11,000 worker files he was able to inspect. Access to the records was controlled by Exxon. Exxon responded in a statement to CNN:\\r\\n\\"After 20 years, there is no evidence suggesting that either cleanup workers or the residents of the communities affected by the Valdez spill have had any adverse health effects as a result of the spill or its cleanup.\\"[65][66]\\r\\nIn 1992, Exxon released a video titled Scientists and the Alaska Oil Spill, to be distributed to schools. Dr. Michael Fry called it a piece of \\"corporate propaganda\\".[67]\\r\\nIn December 1994, the Unabomber assassinated Burson-Marsteller executive Thomas Mosser, accusing him of having \\"helped Exxon clean up its public image after the Exxon Valdez incident\\". The PR company claimed not to have been contracted during the actual crisis.[68]","input":"When did the exxon valdez oil spill occur?"},{"output":"Maine","context":"","input":"What are the states that make up new england?"},{"output":"public sculpture","context":"Coordinates: 415257.67N 873723.97W? / ?41.8826861N 87.6233250W? / 41.8826861; -87.6233250\\r\\nCloud Gate is a public sculpture by Indian-born British artist Sir Anish Kapoor, that is the centerpiece of AT&T Plaza at Millennium Park in the Loop community area of Chicago, Illinois. The sculpture and AT&T Plaza are located on top of Park Grill, between the Chase Promenade and McCormick Tribune Plaza & Ice Rink. Constructed between 2004 and 2006, the sculpture is nicknamed The Bean because of its shape. Made up of 168 stainless steel plates welded together, its highly polished exterior has no visible seams. It measures 33 by 66 by 42 feet (10 by 20 by 13?m), and weighs 110 short tons (100?t; 98 long tons).\\r\\nKapoor's design was inspired by liquid mercury and the sculpture's surface reflects and distorts the city's skyline. Visitors are able to walk around and under Cloud Gate's 12-foot (3.7?m) high arch. On the underside is the \\"omphalos\\" (Greek for \\"navel\\"), a concave chamber that warps and multiplies reflections. The sculpture builds upon many of Kapoor's artistic themes, and it is popular with tourists as a photo-taking opportunity for its unique reflective properties.\\r\\nThe sculpture was the result of a design competition. After Kapoor's design was chosen, numerous technological concerns regarding the design's construction and assembly arose, in addition to concerns regarding the sculpture's upkeep and maintenance. Various experts were consulted, some of whom believed the design could not be implemented. Eventually, a feasible method was found, but the sculpture's construction fell behind schedule. It was unveiled in an incomplete form during the Millennium Park grand opening celebration in 2004, before being concealed again while it was completed. Cloud Gate was formally dedicated on May 15, 2006, and has since gained considerable popularity, both domestically and internationally.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLying between Lake Michigan to the east and the Loop to the west, Grant Park has been Chicago's front yard since the mid-19th century. Its northwest corner, north of Monroe Street and the Art Institute, east of Michigan Avenue, south of Randolph Street, and west of Columbus Drive, had been Illinois Central rail yards and parking lots until 1997, when it was made available for development by the city as Millennium Park.[1] For 2007, the park was Chicago's second largest tourist attraction, trailing only Navy Pier.[2]\\r\\nIn 1999, Millennium Park officials and a group of art collectors, curators and architects reviewed the artistic works of 30?different artists and asked two for proposals. American artist Jeff Koons submitted a proposal to erect a permanent 150-foot (46?m) sculpture of a playground slide;[3][4] his glass and steel design featured an observation deck 90 feet (27?m) above the ground that was accessible via an elevator.[5] The committee chose the second design by internationally acclaimed artist Anish Kapoor. Measuring 33 by 66 by 42 feet (10 by 20 by 13?m) and weighing 110 short tons (100?t; 98 long tons), the proposal featured a seamless, stainless steel surface inspired by liquid mercury.[6] This mirror-like surface would reflect the Chicago skyline, but its elliptical shape would distort and twist the reflected image.[7] As visitors walk around the structure, its surface acts like a fun-house mirror as it distorts their reflections.[8]\\r\\nIn the underside of the sculpture is the omphalos, an indentation whose mirrored surface provides multiple reflections of any subject situated beneath it.[9] The apex of the omphalos is 27 feet (8.2?m) above the ground. The concave underside allows visitors to walk underneath to see the omphalos, and through its arch to the other side so that they view the entire structure.[10] During the grand opening week in July 2004, press reports described the omphalos as the \\"spoon-like underbelly\\".[11][12] The stainless steel sculpture was originally envisioned as the centerpiece of the Lurie Garden at the southeast corner of the park. However, Park officials believed the piece was too large for the Lurie Garden and decided to locate it at AT&T Plaza, despite Kapoor's objections.[13] Skyscrapers to the north along East Randolph Street, including The Heritage, the Smurfit-Stone Building, Two Prudential Plaza, One Prudential Plaza, and Aon Center are visible, reflected on both the east and west sides of the sculpture.\\r\\nAlthough Kapoor does not draw with computers, computer modeling was essential to the process of analyzing the complex form,[14] which created numerous issues. Since the sculpture was expected to be outdoors, concerns arose that it might retain and conduct heat in a way that would make it too hot to touch during the summer and so cold that one's tongue might stick to it during the winter. The extreme temperature variation between seasons was also feared to weaken the structure. Graffiti, bird droppings and fingerprints were also potential problems, as they would affect the aesthetics of the surface.[4][15] The most pressing issue was the need to create a single seamless exterior for the external shell, a feat architect Norman Foster once believed to be nearly impossible.[15]\\r\\nWhile the sculpture was being constructed, public and media outlets nicknamed it \\"The Bean\\" because of its shape, a name that Kapoor described as \\"completely stupid\\".[13] Months later, Kapoor officially named the piece \\"Cloud Gate\\".[16] (Kapoor eventually accepted the nickname of \\"The Bean\\".[17]) Critical reviews describe the sculpture as a passage between realms.[18] Three-quarters of the sculpture's external surface reflects the sky and the name refers to it acting as a type of gate that helps bridge the space between the sky and the viewer.[19] The sculpture and plaza are sometimes referred to jointly as \\"Cloud Gate on the AT&T Plaza\\".[20] It is Kapoor's first public outdoor work in the United States,[20] and is the work by which he is best known in the country according to the Financial Times.[21]\\r\\nThe British engineering firm Atelier One and freelance engineer Chris Hornzee-Jones (who later went on to form the engineering firm Aerotrope in 2005) provided the sculpture's structural design,[22][23] and Performance Structures, Inc. (PSI) was chosen to fabricate it because of their ability to produce nearly invisible welds.[3] The project began with PSI attempting to recreate the design in miniature. A high-density polyurethane foam model was selected by Kapoor, which was then used to design the final structure, including the interior structural components.[24] Initially, PSI planned to build and assemble the sculpture in Oakland, California, and ship it to Chicago through the Panama Canal and St. Lawrence Seaway. However, this plan was discarded after park officials deemed it too risky, so the decision was made to transport the individual panels by truck and to assemble the structure on-site, a task undertaken by MTH Industries.[3][24][25]\\r\\nThe sculpture's weight raised concerns. Estimating the thickness of the steel needed to create the sculpture's desired aesthetics before fabrication was difficult.[26] Cloud Gate was originally estimated to weigh 60 short tons (54?t; 54 long tons) when completed.[27] However, the final figure was almost twice as heavy at 110 short tons (100?t; 98 long tons). This extra weight required engineers to reconsider the sculpture's supporting structures. The roof of the Park Grill, upon which Cloud Gate sits, had to be built strong enough to bear the weight. The large retaining wall separating Chicago's Metra train tracks from the North Grant Park garage supports much of the weight of the sculpture and forms the back side of the restaurant. This wall, along with the rest of the garage's foundation, required additional bracing before the piece was erected.[26] Cloud Gate is further buttressed by lateral members underneath the plaza that are anchored to the sculpture's interior structure by tie rods.[24]\\r\\nInside Cloud Gate's polished exterior shell are several steel structures that keep the sculpture standing. The first structural pieces, two type 304 stainless steel rings, were put into place in February 2004. As construction continued, crisscrossing pipe trusses were assembled between the two rings.[28] The trusses and supporting structures were only present for the construction phases. The finished sculpture has no inner bracing.[29] The supporting structural components were designed and constructed to ensure that no specific point was overloaded, and to avoid producing unwanted indentations on the exterior shell. The frame was also designed to expand and contract with the sculpture as temperatures fluctuate. As a result, the two large rings supporting the sculpture move independently of each other, allowing the shell to move independently of the rings.[24]\\r\\nWhen Cloud Gate's interior components were completed, construction crews prepared to work on the outer shell; this comprises 168?stainless steel panels, each 3?8 inch (10?mm) thick and weighing 1,000 to 2,000 pounds (450 to 910?kg).[30] They were fabricated using three-dimensional modeling software.[24] Computers and robots were essential in the bending and shaping of the plates,[25] which was performed by English wheel and a robotic scanning device.[31] Metal stiffeners were welded to each panel's interior face to provide a small degree of rigidity. About a third of the plates, along with the entire interior structure, were fabricated in Oakland.[24] The plates were polished to 98?percent of their final state and covered with protective white film before being sent to Chicago via trucks.[32] Once in Chicago, the plates were welded together on-site, creating 2,442?linear feet (744?m) of welded seams.[30] Welders used keyhole welding machines rather than traditional welding guns.[6] The plates were fabricated so precisely that no on-site cutting or filing was necessary when lifting and fitting them into position.[30]\\r\\nWhen construction of the shell began in June 2004, a large tent was erected around the piece to shield it from public view.[33] Construction began with the omphalos, where plates were attached to the supporting internal steel structure, from the inside (underside) of the sculpture downward to the outermost surfaces.[32] This sequence caused the structure to resemble a large sombrero when the bottom was complete.[34]\\r\\nThe shell of Cloud Gate was fully erected for the grand opening of Millennium Park on July 15, 2004, although it was unpolished and thus unfinished, because its assembly had fallen behind schedule. The piece was temporarily uncovered on July 8 for the opening, although Kapoor was unhappy with this as it allowed the public to see the sculpture in an unfinished state.[35] The original plan was to re-erect the tent around the sculpture for polishing on July 24, but public appreciation for the piece convinced park officials to leave it uncovered for several months. The tent was again erected in January 2005 as a 24-person crew from Ironworkers Local 63 polished the seams between each plate.[30][36] In order to grind, sand and polish the seams, six levels of scaffolding were erected around the sides of the sculpture, while climbing ropes and harnesses were used to polish harder-to-reach areas.[30] When the upper and side portions of the shell were completed, the tent was once again removed in August 2005. On October 3, the omphalos was closed off as workers polished the final section.[37] Every weld on the Cloud Gate underwent a five-stage process, required to produce the sculpture's mirror-like finish.[30]\\r\\nThe sculpture was finally completed on August 28, 2005, and officially unveiled on May 15, 2006.[38][39] The cost for the piece was first estimated at $6?million; this had escalated to $11.5?million by the time the park opened in 2004,[40] with the final figure standing at $23?million in 2006.[4] No public funds were involved; all funding came from donations from individuals and corporations.[4]\\r\\nKapoor's contract states that the constructed piece should be expected to survive for 1,000?years.[41] The lower 6 feet (1.8?m) of Cloud Gate is wiped down twice a day by hand, while the entire sculpture is cleaned twice a year with 40 U.S. gallons (33?imp?gal; 150?L) of liquid detergent. The daily cleanings use a Windex-like solution, while the semi-annual cleanings use Tide.[42] A notable February 2009 rare incident saw two names etched in letters about 1 inch (25?mm) tall on the northeast side of the curved sculpture. The graffiti was removed by the same firm that did the original polishing.[43]\\r\\nChicago Mayor Richard M. Daley declared the day of the sculpture's dedication, May 15, 2006, to be \\"Cloud Gate Day\\". Kapoor attended the celebration, while local jazz trumpeter and bandleader Orbert Davis and the Chicago Jazz Philharmonic played \\"Fanfare for Cloud Gate\\", which Davis composed.[44] The public took an instant liking to the sculpture, affectionately referring to it as \\"The Bean\\".[45] Cloud Gate has become a popular piece of public art[8][46] and is now a fixture on many souvenirs such as postcards, sweatshirts, and posters.[47] The sculpture has attracted a large number of locals, tourists, and art aficionados from around the world.[48] The sculpture is now the piece by which Kapoor is most identified in the United States.[49]\\r\\nTime describes the piece as an essential photo opportunity, and more of a destination than a work of art.[8]The New York Times writes that it is both a \\"tourist magnet\\" and an \\"extraordinary art object\\",[48][50] while USA Today refers to the sculpture as a monumental abstract work.[51] Chicago art critic Edward Lifson considers Cloud Gate to be among the greatest pieces of public art in the world.[44] The American Welding Society recognized Cloud Gate, MTH Industries and PSI with the group's Extraordinary Welding Award.[52] Time named Millennium Park one of the ten best architectural achievements of 2004, citing Cloud Gate as one of the park's major attractions.[53]\\r\\nWhen the park first opened in 2004, Metra police stopped a Columbia College Chicago journalism student who was working on a photography project in Millennium Park and confiscated his film because of fears of terrorism.[54] In 2005, the sculpture attracted some controversy when a professional photographer without a paid permit was denied access to the piece.[55] As is the case for all works of art currently covered by United States copyright law, the artist holds the copyright for the sculpture. This allows the public to freely photograph Cloud Gate, but permission from Kapoor or the City of Chicago (which has licensed the art) is required for any commercial reproductions of the photographs. The city first set a policy of collecting permit fees for photographs. These permits were initially set at $350 per day for professional still photographers, $1,200 per day for professional videographers and $50 per hour for wedding photographers. The policy has been changed so permits are only required for large-scale film, video and photography requiring ten-person crews and equipment.[56]\\r\\nIn addition to restricting photography of public art, closing a public park for a private event has also been controversial. In 2005 and 2006, almost all of Millennium Park was closed for a day for corporate events. On both occasions, as one of the park's primary attractions, Cloud Gate was the focus of controversy. On September 8, 2005, Toyota Motor Sales USA paid $800,000 to rent most venues in the park including Cloud Gate on AT&T Plaza from 6?a.m. to 11?p.m.[57][58] On August 7, 2006, Allstate paid $700,000 to rent the park. For this price, Allstate acquired the visitation rights to a different set of features and only had exclusive access to Cloud Gate after 4?p.m.[59] These corporate closures denied tourists access to Kapoor's public sculpture, and commuters who walk through the park were forced to take alternative routes. City officials stated that the money would help finance free public programs in Millennium Park.[57]\\r\\nIn 2015, a sculpture similar to Cloud Gate was reported in Karamay, China at the site of an oil discovery, which according to Eduardo Pe?alver, the Dean of Cornell Law School, \\"very probably\\" is a copyright infringement against Cloud Gate.[60] Though designed to resemble an oil bubble, Kapoor hoped that legal action would be taken against what he termed a Chinese knockoff.[61] Mayor Rahm Emanuel was less concerned and said that it was a flattering imitation.[62]\\r\\nAnish Kapoor has a reputation for creating spectacles in urban settings by producing works of extreme size and scale.[21] Before creating Cloud Gate, Kapoor had created art that distorted images of the viewer instead of portraying images of its own. In so doing, he acquired experience blurring the boundary between the limit and the limitless.[63] Kapoor drew on past experience to design Cloud Gate, in particular the designing of Sky Mirror (2001), a 20-foot (6.1?m) 10-short-ton (9?t; 9-long-ton) concave stainless steel mirror that also used a theme of distorted perception on a grand scale.[63]\\r\\nKapoor's objects often aim to evoke immateriality and the spiritual, an outcome he achieves either by carving dark voids into stone pieces, or more recently, through the sheer shine and reflectivity of his objects.[45] This Indian artist's works have no fixed identity, but rather occupy an illusionary space that is consistent with eastern theologies shared by Buddhism, Hinduism and Taoism, as well as Albert Einstein's views of a non-three-dimensional world.[18] Kapoor explores the theme of ambiguity with his works that place the viewer in a state of \\"in-betweenness\\".[64] The artist often questions and plays with such dualities as solidityÿemptiness or realityÿreflection, which in turn allude to such paired opposites as fleshÿspirit, the hereÿthe beyond, eastÿwest, skyÿearth, etc. that create the conflict between internal and external, superficial and subterranean, and conscious and unconscious.[65] Kapoor also creates a tension between masculine and feminine within his art by having concave points of focus that invite the entry of visitors and multiplies their images when they are positioned correctly.[65][66]\\r\\nKapoor often speaks of removing both the signature of the artist from his works as well as any traces of their fabrication, or what he refers to as \\"traces of the hand\\".[18][45] He aspires to make his works look like they have independent realities that he reveals rather than creates.[18] For him, removing all the seams from Cloud Gate was necessary in order to make the sculpture seem as though it was \\"perfect\\" and ready-made. These effects increase the viewer's fascination with it and makes them wonder what it is and where it came from.[46] His attempts to hide his works' seams as an artist stand in contrast to Frank Gehry's architectural designs in the park, Jay Pritzker Pavilion and BP Pedestrian Bridge, which display their seams prominently.[16]\\r\\nCloud Gate is described as a transformative, iconic work.[67] It is similar to many of Kapoor's previous works in the themes and issues it addresses. While the sculpture's mirror effects are reminiscent of fun-house fairground mirrors, they also have a more serious intent; they help dematerialize this very large object, making it seem light and almost weightless.[8][68] Cloud Gate is considered Kapoor's most ambitious use of complex mirrored form dynamics.[69] Kapoor challenges his viewers to internalize his work through intellectual and theoretical exercise. By reflecting the sky, visiting and non-visiting pedestrians and surrounding architecture, Cloud Gate limits its viewers to partial comprehension at any time. The interaction with the viewer who moves to create his own vision gives it a spiritual dimension.[64] The sculpture is described as a disembodied, luminous form,[64] which is also how his earlier 1000 Names (1979ÿ80) was described when it addressed the metaphysical and mystical.[65]\\r\\nThe viewer physically enters the art when he walks underneath it into its \\"navel\\". The omphalos is a \\"warped dimension of fluid space\\". In this dimension, solid is transformed into fluid in a disorienting multiplicative manner that intensifies the experience. It is emblematic of Kapoor's work to deconstruct empirical space and venture into manifold possibilities of abstract space.[69] The experience is described as a displaced or virtual depth that is composed of multiplied surfaces.[70]\\r\\nAccording to project manager Lou Cerny of MTH Industries, \\"When the light is right, you can't see where the sculpture ends and the sky begins.\\"[71] The sculpture challenges perception by distorting and deforming the surrounding architecture.[72] The skyscrapers along East Randolph Street to the northeast (Two Prudential Plaza, and Aon Center), north (One Prudential Plaza) and northwest (The Heritage, Crain Communications Building) are reflected on Cloud Gate's surface when viewed from either the east or the west. The sculpture also warps viewers' perception of time by changing the speed of movements such as the passing of clouds.[72]\\r\\nAlthough in the conventional sense Cloud Gate is not an opening that leads anywhere in the same way that monumental gates do, it frames a view and is celebratory in the way it creates a ceremonial place. The work is credited with achieving a new level or understanding described as a transubstantiation of material, reminiscent of that which the artist experienced during a 1979 trip to India. Kapoor's 1000 Names evolved immediately after this trip; twenty-five years later he created Cloud Gate, an object that emerged from material forms to become immaterial.[18]\\r\\nKapoor often relies on tenets of Hinduism in his art and says that \\"The experience of opposites allows for the expression of wholeness.\\"[18] Primal dualities that are one, such as the lingam and yoni, are important to Indian culture, and Cloud Gate represents both the male and female in one entity by symbolizing both the vagina and testicles.[18] Thus, it represents the tension between the masculine and the feminine.\\r\\nThe sculpture has been used as a backdrop in commercial films, notably in the 2006 Hollywood film The Break-Up, which had to reshoot several scenes because the sculpture was under cover for the initial filming.[73] It is also prominently featured in the ending scene of Source Code. Director Duncan Jones felt the structure was a metaphor for the movie's subject matter and aimed for it to be shown at the beginning and end of the movie.[74] The sculpture served as an aesthetic and symbolic setting for the 2012 film The Vow when the lead characters share a kiss under it.[75][76] It also appears in the video to \\"Homecoming\\", a song by Chicago native Kanye West, featuring Chris Martin of the band Coldplay.[77] The sculpture is also featured in the 2008 mumblecore film Nights and Weekends. It was also featured in the Bollywood film Dhoom 3[78] and the 2014 movie, Transformers: Age of Extinction, the fourth installment in the Transformers series.[79] A modified reproduction of Cloud Gate is also included in Watch Dogs, a video game released in 2014 that takes place in Chicago.[80] Unlike the real sculpture, the in-game replica is a curved, white torus.[81]","input":"Why is there a giant bean in chicago?"},{"output":"Mr. Zahid Hamid","context":"Coordinates: 334401.5N 730547.2E? / ?33.733750N 73.096444E? / 33.733750; 73.096444\\r\\nParliament\\r\\nExecutive:\\r\\nJudiciary\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Ministry of Law and Justice (Urdu: ????? ????? ? ???????, abbreviated as MoJ) is a Cabinet-level ministry of Pakistan, responsible and for the enforcement of law and administration of justice.\\r\\nThe ministry's political executive figure is known as the Minister for Law, Justice and Human Rights, who must be an elected legislator and Parliamentarian.

In fish, the divisions of the small intestine are not as clear and the terms posterior intestine or distal intestine may be used instead of ileum.[2]\\r\\nThe ileum follows the duodenum and jejunum and is separated from the cecum by the ileocecal valve (ICV). In humans, the ileum is about 2ÿ4 m long, and the pH is usually between 7 and 8 (neutral or slightly alkaline).\\r\\nIleum is derived from the Greek word eilein, meaning \\"to twist up tightly.\\"[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe ileum is the third and final part of the small intestine. It follows the jejunum and ends at the ileocecal junction, where the terminal ileum communicates with the cecum of the large intestine through the ileocecal valve. The ileum, along with the jejunum, is suspended inside the mesentery, a peritoneal formation that carries the blood vessels supplying them (the superior mesenteric artery and vein), lymphatic vessels and nerve fibers.[3]\\r\\nThere is no line of demarcation between the jejunum and the ileum. There are, however, subtle differences between the two:[3]\\r\\nThe four layers that make up the wall of the ileum are consistent with those of the gastrointestinal tract. From the inner to the outer surface, these are:[4]:589\\r\\nGeneral structure of the gut wall. Brunner's glands are not found in the ileum, but are a distinctive feature of the duodenum.\\r\\nGoblet cells in the wall of an ileum vili. At its sides, enterocytes are visible over a core of lamina propria.\\r\\nCross section of ileum with a Peyer's patch circled.\\r\\nThe small intestine develops from the midgut of the primitive gut tube.[6] By the fifth week of embryological life, the ileum begins to grow longer at a very fast rate, forming a U-shaped fold called the primary intestinal loop. The proximal half of this loop will form the ileum. The loop grows so fast in length that it outgrows the abdomen and protrudes through the umbilicus. By week 10, the loop retracts back into the abdomen. Between weeks six and ten the small intestine rotates anticlockwise, as viewed from the front of the embryo. It rotates a further 180 degrees after it has moved back into the abdomen. This process creates the twisted shape of the large intestine.[6]\\r\\nIn the fetus the ileum is connected to the navel by the vitelline duct. In roughly 2?4% of humans, this duct fails to close during the first seven weeks after birth, leaving a remnant called Meckel's diverticulum.[7]\\r\\nThe function of the ileum is mainly to absorb vitamin B12 and bile salts and whatever products of digestion were not absorbed by the jejunum. The wall itself is made up of folds, each of which has many tiny finger-like projections known as villi on its surface. In turn, the epithelial cells that line these villi possess even larger numbers of microvilli. Therefore, the ileum has an extremely large surface area both for the adsorption (attachment) of enzyme molecules and for the absorption of products of digestion. The DNES (diffuse neuroendocrine system) cells of the ileum secrete various hormones (gastrin, secretin, cholecystokinin) into the blood. Cells in the lining of the ileum secrete the protease and carbohydrase enzymes responsible for the final stages of protein and carbohydrate digestion into the lumen of the intestine. These enzymes are present in the cytoplasm of the epithelial cells.\\r\\nThe villi contain large numbers of capillaries that take the amino acids and glucose produced by digestion to the hepatic portal vein and the liver. Lacteals are small lymph vessels, and are present in villi. They absorb fatty acid and glycerol, the products of fat digestion. Layers of circular and longitudinal smooth muscle enable the chyme (partly digested food and water) to be pushed along the ileum by waves of muscle contractions called peristalsis. The remaining chyme is passed to the colon.Also ileum is very important as without it many useful nutrients not collected by the jejunum would be deducted or lost.\\r\\nIt is of importance in medicine as it can be affected in a number of diseases,[8] including:\\r\\nIn veterinary anatomy, the ileum is distinguished from the jejunum by being that portion of the jejunoileum that is connected to the caecum by the ileocecal fold.\\r\\nThe ileum is the short terminal part of the small intestine and forms the connection to the large intestine. It is suspended by the caudal part of the mesentery (mesoileum) and is attached, in addition, to the cecum by the ileocecal fold. The ileum terminates at the cecocolic junction of the large intestine forming the ileal orifice. In the dog the ileal orifice is located at the level of the first or second lumbar vertebra, in the ox in the level of the fourth lumbar vertebrae, in the sheep and goat at the level of the caudal point of the costal arch.[9] By active muscular contraction of the ileum, and closure of the ileal opening as a result of engorgement, the ileum prevents the backflow of ingesta and the equalization of pressure between jejunum and the base of the cecum. Disturbance of this sensitive balance is not uncommon and is one of the causes of colic in horses. During any intestinal surgery, for instance, during appendectomy, distal 2 feet of ileum should be checked for the presence of Meckel's diverticulum.","input":"What is the terminal part of the small intestine?"},{"output":"March 1, 1872","context":"","input":"When did yellowstone national park become a national park?"},{"output":"Neil Armstrong","context":"\\r\\nApollo 11 was the spaceflight that landed the first two humans on the Moon. Mission commander Neil Armstrong and pilot Buzz Aldrin, both American, landed the lunar module Eagle on July 20, 1969, at 20:18 UTC. Armstrong became the first human to step onto the lunar surface six hours after landing on July 21 at 02:56:15 UTC; Aldrin joined him about 20 minutes later. They spent about two and a quarter hours together outside the spacecraft, and collected 47.5 pounds (21.5?kg) of lunar material to bring back to Earth. Michael Collins piloted the command module Columbia alone in lunar orbit while they were on the Moon's surface. Armstrong and Aldrin spent just under a day on the lunar surface before rejoining Columbia in lunar orbit.\\r\\nApollo 11 was launched by a Saturn V rocket from Kennedy Space Center on Merritt Island, Florida, on July 16 at 9:32 am EDT (13:32 UTC) and was the fifth manned mission of NASA's Apollo program. The Apollo spacecraft had three parts: a command module (CM) with a cabin for the three astronauts, and the only part that returned to Earth; a service module (SM), which supported the command module with propulsion, electrical power, oxygen, and water; and a lunar module (LM) that had two stages ÿ a descent stage for landing on the Moon, and an ascent stage to place the astronauts back into lunar orbit.\\r\\nAfter being sent to the Moon by the Saturn V's third stage, the astronauts separated the spacecraft from it and traveled for three days until they entered into lunar orbit. Armstrong and Aldrin then moved into the lunar module Eagle and landed in the Sea of Tranquility. They stayed a total of about 21.5 hours on the lunar surface. The astronauts used Eagle's upper stage to lift off from the lunar surface and rejoin Collins in the command module. They jettisoned Eagle before they performed the maneuvers that blasted them out of lunar orbit on a trajectory back to Earth. They returned to Earth and splashed down in the Pacific Ocean on July 24 after more than eight days in space.\\r\\nThe landing was broadcast on live TV to a worldwide audience. Armstrong stepped onto the lunar surface and described the event as \\"one small step for [a] man, one giant leap for mankind.\\" Apollo 11 effectively ended the Space Race and fulfilled a national goal proposed in 1961 by U.S. President John F. Kennedy: \\"before this decade is out, of landing a man on the Moon and returning him safely to the Earth.\\"[6]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe crew assignment of Neil Armstrong as Commander, Jim Lovell as Command Module Pilot (CMP) and Buzz Aldrin as Lunar Module Pilot (LMP) was officially announced on November 20, 1967.[7] Apollo 11 was the second all-veteran multi-person crew on an American mission,[8] the first being that of Apollo 10).[9] An all-veteran crew would not be flown again until STS-26 in 1988.[8] Lovell and Aldrin had previously flown together as the crew of Gemini 12. The crew was initially assigned as the backup for Apollo 9. Due to design and manufacturing delays in the Lunar Module (LM), Apollo 8 and Apollo 9 swapped prime and backup crews, and Armstrong's crew became the backup for Apollo 8. Based on the normal crew rotation scheme, Armstrong was then expected to command Apollo 11.[10] There would be one change. Mike Collins on the Apollo 8 crew began experiencing trouble with his legs. Doctors diagnosed the problem as a bony growth between his fifth and sixth vertebrae, requiring surgery.[11] Lovell took his place on the Apollo 8 crew, and, when he recovered, Collins joined Armstrong's crew as CMP. In the meantime, Fred Haise filled in as backup LMP, and Aldrin as backup CMP for Apollo 8.[12]\\r\\nThe backup crew consisted of Lovell as Commander), William Anders as CMP, and Haise as LMP. Anders had flown with Lovell on Apollo 8.[8] In early 1969, he accepted a job with the National Space Council effective August 1969 and announced that he would retire as an astronaut on that date. At that point Ken Mattingly was moved from the support crew into parallel training with Anders as backup CMP in case Apollo 11 was delayed past its intended July launch, at which point Anders would be unavailable. Lovell, Haise, and Mattingly would ultimately be assigned as the prime crew of Apollo 13.[13]\\r\\nAfter the crew of Apollo 10 named their spacecraft Charlie Brown and Snoopy, assistant manager for public affairs Julian Scheer wrote to Manned Spacecraft Center director George M. Low to suggest the Apollo 11 crew be less flippant in naming their craft. During early mission planning, the names Snowcone and Haystack were used and put in the news release.[14]\\r\\nThe Command Module was named Columbia after the Columbiad, the giant cannon shell \\"spacecraft\\" fired by a giant cannon (also from Florida) in Jules Verne's 1865 novel From the Earth to the Moon. It also referenced Columbia, a personification of the United States. The Lunar Module was named Eagle for the national bird of the United States, the bald eagle, which was featured prominently on the mission insignia.[15]\\r\\nThe Apollo 11 mission insignia was designed by Collins, who wanted a symbol for \\"peaceful lunar landing by the United States\\". At Lovell's suggestion, he chose an eagle as the symbol, put an olive branch in its beak, and drew a lunar background with the Earth in the distance. The sunlight in the image was coming from the wrong direction; the shadow should have been in the lower part of the Earth instead of the left. NASA officials felt that the talons of the eagle looked too \\"warlike\\" and after some discussion, the olive branch was moved to the claws. Armstrong was concerned that \\"eleven\\" would not be understood by non-English speakers, so they went with \\"Apollo 11\\";[16] they decided not to put their names on the patch, so it would \\"be representative of everyone who had worked toward a lunar landing\\".[17] All colors are natural, with blue and gold borders around the patch.[citation needed]\\r\\nWhen the Eisenhower dollar coin was released in 1971, the patch design provided the eagle for its reverse side.[18] The design was also used for the smaller Susan B. Anthony dollar unveiled in 1979, ten years after the Apollo 11 mission.[19]\\r\\nNeil Armstrong's personal preference kit carried a piece of wood from the Wright brothers' 1903 airplane's left propeller and a piece of fabric from its wing,[20] along with a diamond-studded astronaut pin originally given to Deke Slayton by the widows of the Apollo 1 crew. This pin had been intended to be flown on Apollo 1 and given to Slayton after the mission but following the disastrous launch pad fire and subsequent funerals, the widows gave the pin to Slayton and Armstrong took it on Apollo 11.[21]\\r\\nIn addition to many people crowding highways and beaches near the launch site, millions watched the event on television, with NASA Chief of Public Information Jack King providing commentary. President Richard M. Nixon viewed the proceedings from the Oval Office of the White House.[citation needed]\\r\\nA Saturn V launched Apollo 11 from Launch Pad 39A, part of the Launch Complex 39 site at the Kennedy Space Center on July 16, 1969, at 13:32:00 UTC (9:32:00?a.m. EDT local time). It entered Earth orbit, at an altitude of 100.4 nautical miles (185.9?km) by 98.9 nautical miles (183.2?km), twelve minutes later. After one and a half orbits, the S-IVB third-stage engine pushed the spacecraft onto its trajectory toward the Moon with the trans-lunar injection (TLI) burn at 16:22:13 UTC. About 30 minutes later, the transposition, docking, and extraction maneuver was performed: this involved separating the Apollo Command/Service Module (CSM) from the spent rocket stage, turning around, and docking with the Lunar Module still attached to the stage. After the Lunar Module was extracted, the combined spacecraft headed for the Moon, while the rocket stage flew on a trajectory past the Moon and into orbit around the Sun.[3]\\r\\nOn July 19 at 17:21:50 UTC, Apollo 11 passed behind the Moon and fired its service propulsion engine to enter lunar orbit. In the thirty orbits[22] that followed, the crew saw passing views of their landing site in the southern Sea of Tranquility (Mare Tranquillitatis) about 12 miles (19?km) southwest of the crater Sabine D (0.67408N, 23.47297E). The landing site was selected in part because it had been characterized as relatively flat and smooth by the automated Ranger 8 and Surveyor 5 landers along with the Lunar Orbiter mapping spacecraft and unlikely to present major landing or extravehicular activity (EVA) challenges.[23]\\r\\nOn July 20, 1969, the Lunar Module Eagle separated from the Command Module Columbia. Collins, alone aboard Columbia, inspected Eagle as it pirouetted before him to ensure the craft was not damaged.\\r\\nAs the descent began, Armstrong and Aldrin found that they were passing landmarks on the surface four seconds early and reported that they were \\"long\\"; they would land miles west of their target point.\\r\\nFive minutes into the descent burn, and 6,000 feet (1,800?m) above the surface of the Moon, the LM navigation and guidance computer distracted the crew with the first of several unexpected \\"1202\\" and \\"1201\\" program alarms. Inside Mission Control Center in Houston, Texas, computer engineer Jack Garman told guidance officer Steve Bales it was safe to continue the descent, and this was relayed to the crew. The program alarms indicated \\"executive overflows\\", meaning the guidance computer could not complete all of its tasks in real time and had to postpone some of them.[24]\\r\\nDue to an error in the checklist manual, the rendezvous radar switch was placed in the wrong position. This caused it to send erroneous signals to the computer. The result was that the computer was being asked to perform all of its normal functions for landing while receiving an extra load of spurious data which used up 15% of its time. The computer (or rather the software in it) was smart enough to recognize that it was being asked to perform more tasks than it should be performing. It then sent out an alarm, which meant to the astronaut, I'm overloaded with more tasks than I should be doing at this time and I'm going to keep only the more important tasks; i.e., the ones needed for landing?... Actually, the computer was programmed to do more than recognize error conditions. A complete set of recovery programs was incorporated into the software. The software's action, in this case, was to eliminate lower priority tasks and re-establish the more important ones?... If the computer hadn't recognized this problem and taken recovery action, I doubt if Apollo 11 would have been the successful moon landing it was.[25][a]\\r\\nWhen Armstrong again looked outside, he saw that the computer's landing target was in a boulder-strewn area just north and east of a 300-meter (980?ft) diameter crater (later determined to be West crater, named for its location in the western part of the originally planned landing ellipse). Armstrong took semi-automatic control[30] and, with Aldrin calling out altitude and velocity data, landed at 20:17:40 UTC on Sunday July 20 with about 25 seconds of fuel left.[4]\\r\\nApollo 11 landed with less fuel than other missions, and the astronauts encountered a premature low fuel warning. This was later found to be the result of greater propellant 'slosh' than expected, uncovering a fuel sensor. On subsequent missions, extra anti-slosh baffles were added to the tanks to prevent this.[4]\\r\\nThroughout the descent, Aldrin had called out navigation data to Armstrong, who was busy piloting the LM. A few moments before the landing, a light informed Aldrin that at least one of the 67-inch (170?cm) probes hanging from Eagle's footpads had touched the surface, and he said: \\"Contact light!\\" Three seconds later, Eagle landed and Armstrong said \\"Shutdown.\\" Aldrin immediately said \\"Okay, engine stop. ACA ÿ out of detent.\\" Armstrong acknowledged \\"Out of detent. Auto\\" and Aldrin continued \\"Mode control ÿ both auto. Descent engine command override off. Engine arm ÿ off. 413 is in.\\"\\r\\nCharles Duke, CAPCOM during the landing phase, acknowledged their landing by saying \\"We copy you down, Eagle.\\"\\r\\nArmstrong acknowledged Aldrin's completion of the post landing checklist with \\"Engine arm is off\\", before responding to Duke with the words, \\"Houston, Tranquility Base here. The Eagle has landed.\\" Armstrong's unrehearsed[31] change of call sign from \\"Eagle\\" to \\"Tranquility Base\\" emphasized to listeners that landing was complete and successful. Duke mispronounced his reply as he expressed the relief at Mission Control: \\"Roger, Twan Tranquility, we copy you on the ground. You got a bunch of guys about to turn blue. We're breathing again. Thanks a lot.\\"[4][32]\\r\\nTwo and a half hours after landing, before preparations began for the EVA, Aldrin radioed to Earth:\\r\\nThis is the LM pilot. I'd like to take this opportunity to ask every person listening in, whoever and wherever they may be, to pause for a moment and contemplate the events of the past few hours and to give thanks in his or her own way.[33]\\r\\nHe then took communion privately. At this time NASA was still fighting a lawsuit brought by atheist Madalyn Murray O'Hair (who had objected to the Apollo 8 crew reading from the Book of Genesis) demanding that their astronauts refrain from broadcasting religious activities while in space. As such, Aldrin chose to refrain from directly mentioning taking communion on the Moon. Aldrin was an elder at the Webster Presbyterian Church, and his communion kit was prepared by the pastor of the church, the Rev. Dean Woodruff. Aldrin described communion on the Moon and the involvement of his church and pastor in the October 1970 edition of Guideposts magazine and in his book Return to Earth. Webster Presbyterian possesses the chalice used on the Moon and commemorates the event each year on the Sunday closest to July 20.[34]\\r\\nThe schedule for the mission called for the astronauts to follow the landing with a five-hour sleep period as they had been awake since early morning. However, they elected to forgo the sleep period and begin the preparations for the EVA early, thinking that they would be unable to sleep.\\r\\nThe astronauts planned placement of the Early Apollo Scientific Experiment Package (EASEP)[35] and the U.S. flag by studying their landing site through Eagle's twin triangular windows, which gave them a 60 field of view. Preparation required longer than the two hours scheduled. Armstrong initially had some difficulties squeezing through the hatch with his Portable Life Support System (PLSS). According to veteran Moon-walker John Young, a redesign of the LM to incorporate a smaller hatch had not been followed by a redesign of the PLSS backpack, so some of the highest heart rates recorded from Apollo astronauts occurred during LM egress and ingress.[36][37]\\r\\nSeveral books indicate early mission timelines had Buzz Aldrin rather than Neil Armstrong as the first man on the Moon.[38]\\r\\nAt 02:39 UTC on Monday July 21, 1969, Armstrong opened the hatch, and at 02:51 UTC began his descent to the lunar surface. The Remote Control Unit controls on his chest kept him from seeing his feet. Climbing down the nine-rung ladder, Armstrong pulled a D-ring to deploy the Modular Equipment Stowage Assembly (MESA) folded against Eagle's side and activate the TV camera, and at 02:56:15 UTC he set his left foot on the surface.[39][40] The first landing used slow-scan television incompatible with commercial TV, so it was displayed on a special monitor and a conventional TV camera viewed this monitor, significantly reducing the quality of the picture.[41] The signal was received at Goldstone in the United States but with better fidelity by Honeysuckle Creek Tracking Station in Australia. Minutes later the feed was switched to the more sensitive Parkes radio telescope in Australia.[42] Despite some technical and weather difficulties, ghostly black and white images of the first lunar EVA were received and broadcast to at least 600 million people on Earth.[43] Although copies of this video in broadcast format were saved and are widely available, recordings of the original slow scan source transmission from the lunar surface were accidentally destroyed during routine magnetic tape re-use at NASA.\\r\\nWhile still on the ladder, Armstrong uncovered a plaque mounted on the LM descent stage bearing two drawings of Earth (of the Western and Eastern Hemispheres), an inscription, and signatures of the astronauts and President Nixon. The inscription read:\\r\\nHere men from the planet Earth first set foot upon the Moon, July 1969 A.D. We came in peace for all mankind.\\r\\nAfter describing the surface dust as \\"very fine-grained\\" and \\"almost like a powder,\\"[40] six and a half hours after landing,[3] Armstrong stepped off Eagle's footpad and declared, \\"That's one small step for [a] man, one giant leap for mankind.\\"[b][44][45][46][47]\\r\\nArmstrong intended to say \\"That's one small step for a man\\", but the word \\"a\\" is not audible in the transmission, and thus was not initially reported by most observers of the live broadcast. When later asked about his quote, Armstrong said he believed he said \\"for a man\\", and subsequent printed versions of the quote included the \\"a\\" in square brackets. One explanation for the absence may be that his accent caused him to slur the words \\"for a\\" together; another is the intermittent nature of the audio and video links to Earth, partly because of storms near Parkes Observatory. More recent digital analysis of the tape claims to reveal the \\"a\\" may have been spoken but obscured by static.[48][49]\\r\\nAbout seven minutes after stepping onto the Moon's surface, Armstrong collected a contingency soil sample using a sample bag on a stick. He then folded the bag and tucked it into a pocket on his right thigh. This was to guarantee there would be some lunar soil brought back in case an emergency required the astronauts to abandon the EVA and return to the LM.[50]\\r\\nTwelve minutes after the contingency sample was collected,[3] Aldrin joined Armstrong on the surface, and described the view with the simple phrase, \\"Magnificent desolation.\\"[40]\\r\\nIn addition to fulfilling President Kennedy's mandate to land a man on the Moon before the end of the 1960s,[51] Apollo 11 was an engineering test of the Apollo system; therefore, Armstrong snapped photos of the LM so engineers would be able to judge its post-landing condition. He removed the TV camera from the MESA and made a panoramic sweep, then mounted it on a tripod 68 feet (21?m) from the LM. The TV camera cable remained partly coiled and presented a tripping hazard throughout the EVA.\\r\\nArmstrong said that moving in the lunar gravity, one-sixth of Earth's, was \\"even perhaps easier than the simulations?... It's absolutely no trouble to walk around.\\"[40] Aldrin joined him on the surface and tested methods for moving around, including two-footed kangaroo hops. The PLSS backpack created a tendency to tip backward, but neither astronaut had serious problems maintaining balance. Loping became the preferred method of movement. The astronauts reported that they needed to plan their movements six or seven steps ahead. The fine soil was quite slippery. Aldrin remarked that moving from sunlight into Eagle's shadow produced no temperature change inside the suit, though the helmet was warmer in sunlight, so he felt cooler in shadow.[40]\\r\\nThe astronauts planted a specially designed U.S. flag on the lunar surface, in clear view of the TV camera. Sometime later, President Richard Nixon spoke to them through a telephone-radio transmission which Nixon called \\"the most historic phone call ever made from the White House.\\"[52] Nixon originally had a long speech prepared to read during the phone call, but Frank Borman, who was at the White House as a NASA liaison during Apollo 11, convinced Nixon to keep his words brief, to respect the lunar landing as Kennedy's legacy.[53] Armstrong thanked the President, and gave a brief reflection on the significance of the moment:\\r\\nNixon: Hello, Neil and Buzz. I'm talking to you by telephone from the Oval Room at the White House. And this certainly has to be the most historic telephone call ever made. I just can't tell you how proud we all are of what you've done. For every American, this has to be the proudest day of our lives. And for people all over the world, I am sure they too join with Americans in recognizing what an immense feat this is. Because of what you have done, the heavens have become a part of man's world. And as you talk to us from the Sea of Tranquility, it inspires us to redouble our efforts to bring peace and tranquility to Earth. For one priceless moment in the whole history of man, all the people on this Earth are truly one: one in their pride in what you have done, and one in our prayers that you will return safely to Earth.\\r\\nArmstrong: Thank you, Mr. President. It's a great honor and privilege for us to be here, representing not only the United States, but men of peace of all nations, and with interest and curiosity, and men with a vision for the future. It's an honor for us to be able to participate here today.\\r\\nThe MESA failed to provide a stable work platform and was in shadow, slowing work somewhat. As they worked, the moonwalkers kicked up gray dust which soiled the outer part of their suits, the integrated thermal meteoroid garment.\\r\\nThey deployed the EASEP, which included a passive seismograph and a Lunar Ranging Retroreflector (LRRR). Then Armstrong walked 196 feet (60?m) from the LM to snap photos at the rim of Little West Crater while Aldrin collected two core tubes. He used the geological hammer to pound in the tubes ÿ the only time the hammer was used on Apollo 11. The astronauts then collected rock samples using scoops and tongs on extension handles. Many of the surface activities took longer than expected, so they had to stop documenting sample collection halfway through the allotted 34 minutes.\\r\\nThree new minerals were discovered in the rock samples collected by the astronauts: armalcolite, tranquillityite, and pyroxferroite. Armalcolite was named after Armstrong, Aldrin, and Collins.\\r\\nDuring this period, Mission Control used a coded phrase to warn Armstrong that his metabolic rates were high and that he should slow down. He was moving rapidly from task to task as time ran out. However, as metabolic rates remained generally lower than expected for both astronauts throughout the walk, Mission Control granted the astronauts a 15-minute extension.[54] In a 2010 interview, Armstrong, who had walked a maximum of 196 feet (60?m) from the LM, explained that NASA limited the first moonwalk's time and distance because there was no empirical proof of how much cooling water the astronauts' PLSS backpacks would consume to handle their body heat generation while working on the Moon.[55]\\r\\nAldrin entered Eagle first. With some difficulty the astronauts lifted film and two sample boxes containing 21.55 kilograms (47.5?lb) of lunar surface material to the LM hatch using a flat cable pulley device called the Lunar Equipment Conveyor. Armstrong reminded Aldrin of a bag of memorial items in his suit pocket sleeve, and Aldrin tossed the bag down; Armstrong then jumped to the ladder's third rung and climbed into the LM. After transferring to LM life support, the explorers lightened the ascent stage for the return to lunar orbit by tossing out their PLSS backpacks, lunar overshoes, one Hasselblad camera, and other equipment. They then pressurized the LM and settled down to sleep.[56]\\r\\nPresident Nixon's speech writer William Safire had prepared In Event of Moon Disaster for the President to read on television in the event the Apollo 11 astronauts were stranded on the Moon.[57] The contingency plan originated in a memo from Safire to Nixon's White House Chief of Staff H. R. Haldeman, in which Safire suggested a protocol the administration might follow in reaction to such a disaster.[58][59] According to the plan, Mission Control would \\"close down communications\\" with the LM, and a clergyman would \\"commend their souls to the deepest of the deep\\" in a public ritual likened to burial at sea. The last line of the prepared text contained an allusion to Rupert Brooke's First World War poem, \\"The Soldier\\".[59] The plan included presidential telephone calls to the astronauts' wives.\\r\\nWhile moving inside the cabin, Aldrin accidentally damaged the circuit breaker that would arm the main engine for lift off from the Moon. There was a concern this would prevent firing the engine, stranding them on the Moon. Fortunately, a felt-tip pen was sufficient to activate the switch.[56] Had this not worked, the Lunar Module circuitry could have been reconfigured to allow firing the ascent engine.\\r\\nAfter about seven hours of rest, the crew was awakened by Houston to prepare for the return flight. Two and a half hours later, at 17:54 UTC, they lifted off in Eagle's ascent stage to rejoin Collins aboard Columbia in lunar orbit.\\r\\nAfter more than 21? total hours on the lunar surface, they had left behind scientific instruments that included a retroreflector array used for the Lunar Laser Ranging Experiment and a Passive Seismic Experiment Package used to measure moonquakes. They also left an Apollo 1 mission patch, and a memorial bag containing a gold replica of an olive branch as a traditional symbol of peace and a silicon message disk. The disk carries the goodwill statements by Presidents Eisenhower, Kennedy, Johnson, and Nixon and messages from leaders of 73 countries around the world. The disc also carries a listing of the leadership of the US Congress, a listing of members of the four committees of the House and Senate responsible for the NASA legislation, and the names of NASA's past and present top management.[60] (In his 1989 book, Men from Earth, Aldrin says that the items included Soviet medals commemorating Cosmonauts Vladimir Komarov and Yuri Gagarin.) Also, according to Deke Slayton's book Moonshot, Armstrong carried with him a special diamond-studded astronaut pin from Slayton.\\r\\nFilm taken from the LM Ascent Stage upon liftoff from the Moon reveals the American flag, planted some 25 feet (8?m) from the descent stage, whipping violently in the exhaust of the ascent stage engine. Aldrin looked up in time to witness the flag topple:[3] \\"The ascent stage of the LM separated?... I was concentrating on the computers, and Neil was studying the attitude indicator, but I looked up long enough to see the flag fall over.\\"[22] Subsequent Apollo missions usually planted the American flags at least 100 feet (30?m) from the LM to prevent them being blown over by the ascent engine exhaust.\\r\\nAfter rendezvous with Columbia, Eagle's ascent stage was jettisoned into lunar orbit on July 21, 1969, at 23:41 UTC. Just before the Apollo 12 flight, it was noted that Eagle was still likely to be orbiting the Moon. Later NASA reports mentioned that Eagle's orbit had decayed, resulting in it impacting in an \\"uncertain location\\" on the lunar surface.[61] The location is uncertain because the Eagle ascent stage was not tracked after it was jettisoned, and the lunar gravity field is sufficiently non-uniform to make the orbit of the spacecraft unpredictable after a short time. NASA estimated that the orbit had decayed within months and would have impacted on the Moon.\\r\\nOn July 23, the last night before splashdown, the three astronauts made a television broadcast in which Collins commented:\\r\\n...?The Saturn V rocket which put us in orbit is an incredibly complicated piece of machinery, every piece of which worked flawlessly?... We have always had confidence that this equipment will work properly. All this is possible only through the blood, sweat, and tears of a number of a people?... All you see is the three of us, but beneath the surface are thousands and thousands of others, and to all of those, I would like to say, \\"Thank you very much.\\"\\r\\nAldrin added:\\r\\nThis has been far more than three men on a mission to the Moon; more, still, than the efforts of a government and industry team; more, even, than the efforts of one nation. We feel that this stands as a symbol of the insatiable curiosity of all mankind to explore the unknown?... Personally, in reflecting on the events of the past several days, a verse from Psalms comes to mind. \\"When I consider the heavens, the work of Thy fingers, the Moon and the stars, which Thou hast ordained; What is man that Thou art mindful of him?\\"\\r\\nArmstrong concluded:\\r\\nThe responsibility for this flight lies first with history and with the giants of science who have preceded this effort; next with the American people, who have, through their will, indicated their desire; next with four administrations and their Congresses, for implementing that will; and then, with the agency and industry teams that built our spacecraft, the Saturn, the Columbia, the Eagle, and the little EMU, the spacesuit and backpack that was our small spacecraft out on the lunar surface. We would like to give special thanks to all those Americans who built the spacecraft; who did the construction, design, the tests, and put their hearts and all their abilities into those craft. To those people tonight, we give a special thank you, and to all the other people that are listening and watching tonight, God bless you. Good night from Apollo 11.[22]\\r\\nOn the return to Earth, a bearing at the Guam tracking station failed, potentially preventing communication on the last segment of the Earth return. A regular repair was not possible in the available time but the station director, Charles Force, had his ten-year-old son Greg use his small hands to reach into the housing and pack it with grease. Greg later was thanked by Armstrong.[62]\\r\\nOn July 24, the astronauts returned home aboard the Command Module Columbia just before dawn local time (16:51 UTC[3]) at 1319N 1699W? / ?13.317N 169.150W? / 13.317; -169.150? (Apollo 11 splashdown), in the Pacific Ocean 2,660?km (1,440?nmi) east of Wake Island, 380?km (210?nmi) south of Johnston Atoll, and 24?km (13?nmi) from the recovery ship, USS?Hornet.[3] This is near the village of Vatia in American Samoa.[63] The American Samoa-flag which was brought to the moon by Apollo 11 is on display at the Jean P. Haydon Museum in Pago Pago, the territorial capital of American Samoa.[64]\\r\\nAt 16:44 UTC the drogue parachutes had been deployed and seven minutes later the Command Module struck the water forcefully. During splashdown, the Command Module landed upside down but was righted within 10 minutes by flotation bags triggered by the astronauts. \\"Everything's okay. Our checklist is complete. Awaiting swimmers\\", was Armstrong's last official transmission from Columbia. A diver from the Navy helicopter hovering above attached a sea anchor to the Command Module to prevent it from drifting. Additional divers attached flotation collars to stabilize the module and position rafts for astronaut extraction. Though the chance of bringing back pathogens from the lunar surface was considered remote, it was considered a possibility and NASA took great precautions at the recovery site. Divers provided the astronauts with Biological Isolation Garments (BIGs) which were worn until they reached isolation facilities on board the Hornet. Additionally, astronauts were rubbed down with a sodium hypochlorite solution and the Command Module wiped with Betadine to remove any lunar dust that might be present. The raft containing decontamination materials was then intentionally sunk.[65]\\r\\nA second Sea King helicopter - \\"Helicopter 66\\" - hoisted the astronauts aboard one by one, where a NASA flight surgeon gave each a brief physical check during the 0.5 nautical miles (930?m) trip back to the Hornet.\\r\\nAfter touchdown on the Hornet, the astronauts exited the helicopter, leaving the flight surgeon and three crewmen. The helicopter was then lowered into hangar bay #2 where the astronauts walked the 30 feet (9.1?m) to the Mobile Quarantine Facility (MQF) where they would begin the earth-based portion of their 21 days of quarantine.[66] This practice would continue for two more Apollo missions, Apollo 12 and Apollo 14, before the Moon was proven to be barren of life and the quarantine process dropped.[65][67]\\r\\nPresident Richard Nixon was aboard Hornet to personally welcome the astronauts back to Earth. He told the astronauts, \\"As a result of what you've done, the world has never been closer together before.\\"[68] After Nixon departed, the Hornet was brought alongside the five-ton Command Module where it was placed aboard by the ship's crane, placed on a dolly and moved next to the MQF. The Hornet sailed for Pearl Harbor where Columbia and the MQF were airlifted to the Manned Spacecraft Center.[65]\\r\\nIn accordance with the Extra-Terrestrial Exposure Law, a set of regulations promulgated by NASA on July 16[69] to codify its quarantine protocol, the astronauts continued in quarantine out of concern that the Moon might contain undiscovered pathogens and that the astronauts might have been exposed to them during their Moon walks. However, after three weeks in confinement (first in the Apollo spacecraft, then in their trailer on the Hornet, and finally in the Lunar Receiving Laboratory at the Manned Spacecraft Center), the astronauts were given a clean bill of health.[70] On August 10, 1969, the Interagency Committee on Back Contamination met in Atlanta and lifted the quarantine on the astronauts, on those who had joined them in quarantine (NASA physician William Carpentier and MQF project engineer John Hirasaki[71]), and on Columbia itself.[72] Loose equipment from the spacecraft would remain in isolation until the lunar samples were released for study.[72]\\r\\nOn August 13, they rode in parades in their honor in New York, Chicago, and Los Angeles.[73][74] On the same evening in Los Angeles there was an official State Dinner to celebrate the flight, attended by members of Congress, 44 governors, the Chief Justice of the United States, and ambassadors from 83 nations at the Century Plaza Hotel.[74] President Richard Nixon and Vice President Spiro T. Agnew honored each astronaut with a presentation of the Presidential Medal of Freedom.[74] This celebration was the beginning of a 45-day \\"Giant Leap\\" tour that brought the astronauts to 25 foreign countries and included visits with prominent leaders such as Queen Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom. Many nations honored the first manned Moon landing with special features in magazines or by issuing Apollo 11 commemorative postage stamps or coins.[75][76]\\r\\nOn September 16, 1969, the three astronauts spoke before a joint session of Congress on Capitol Hill. They presented two US flags, one to the House of Representatives and the other to the Senate, that had been carried to the surface of the Moon with them.[77]\\r\\nThe Soviet Union had been competing with the US in landing a man on the Moon but had been hampered by repeated failures in development of a launcher comparable to the Saturn V.[78] Meanwhile, they tried to beat the US to return lunar material to the Earth by means of unmanned probes. On July 13, three days before Apollo 11's launch, they launched Luna 15, which reached lunar orbit before Apollo 11. During descent, a malfunction caused Luna 15 to crash in Mare Crisium about two hours before Armstrong and Aldrin took off from the Moon's surface to begin their voyage home. The Jodrell Bank Observatory radio telescope in England was later discovered to have recorded transmissions from Luna 15 during its descent, and this was published in July 2009 on the 40th anniversary of Apollo 11.[79]\\r\\nThe Command Module Columbia was displayed at the National Air and Space Museum (NASM), Washington, D.C. It was in the central Milestones of Flight exhibition hall in front of the Jefferson Drive entrance, sharing the main hall with other pioneering flight vehicles such as the Wright Flyer, the Spirit of St. Louis, the Bell X-1, the North American X-15, Mercury spacecraft Friendship 7, and Gemini 4. Armstrong's and Aldrin's space suits are displayed in the museum's Apollo to the Moon exhibit. The quarantine trailer, the flotation collar, and the righting spheres are displayed at the Smithsonian's Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center annex near Washington Dulles International Airport in Chantilly, Virginia.\\r\\nIn 2009, the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) imaged the various Apollo landing sites on the surface of the Moon, for the first time with sufficient resolution to see the descent stages of the lunar modules, scientific instruments, and foot trails made by the astronauts.\\r\\nIn March 2012 a team of specialists financed by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos located the F-1 engines that launched Apollo 11 into space. The engines were found below the Atlantic Ocean's surface through the use of advanced sonar scanning.[80] His team brought parts of two of the five engines to the surface. In July 2013, a conservator discovered a serial number under the rust on one of the engines raised from the Atlantic, which NASA confirmed was from the Apollo 11 launch.[81][82]\\r\\nColumbia was moved in 2017 to the NASM Mary Baker Engen Restoration Hangar at the Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center in Chantilly, VA, to be readied for a four-city tour titled Destination Moon: The Apollo 11 Mission. This will include Space Center Houston (October 14, 2017 to March 18, 2018), the Saint Louis Science Center (April 14 to September 3, 2018), the Senator John Heinz History Center in Pittsburgh (September 29, 2018 to February 18, 2019), and the Seattle Museum of Flight (March 16 to September 2, 2019).[83][84]\\r\\nOn July 15, 2009, Life.com released a photo gallery of previously unpublished photos of the astronauts taken by Life photographer Ralph Morse prior to the Apollo 11 launch.[85] From July 16ÿ24, 2009, NASA streamed the original mission audio on its website in real time 40 years to the minute after the events occurred.[86] In addition, it is in the process of restoring the video footage and has released a preview of key moments.[87] In July 2010, air-to-ground voice recordings and film footage shot in Mission Control during the Apollo 11 powered descent and landing was re-synchronised and released for the first time.[88] The John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum set up a Flash website that rebroadcasts the transmissions of Apollo 11 from launch to landing on the Moon.[89]\\r\\nOn July 20, 2009, the crew of Armstrong, Aldrin, and Collins met with U.S. President Barack Obama at the White House.[90] \\"We expect that there is, as we speak, another generation of kids out there who are looking up at the sky and are going to be the next Armstrong, Collins, and Aldrin\\", Obama said. \\"We want to make sure that NASA is going to be there for them when they want to take their journey.\\"[91] On August 7, 2009, an act of Congress awarded the three astronauts a Congressional Gold Medal, the highest civilian award in the United States. The bill was sponsored by Florida Sen. Bill Nelson and Florida Rep. Alan Grayson.[92][93]\\r\\nA group of British scientists interviewed as part of the anniversary events reflected on the significance of the Moon landing:\\r\\nIt was carried out in a technically brilliant way with risks taken?... that would be inconceivable in the risk-averse world of today?... The Apollo programme is arguably the greatest technical achievement of mankind to date?... nothing since Apollo has come close [to] the excitement that was generated by those astronauts ÿ Armstrong, Aldrin and the 10 others who followed them.[94]\\r\\nRoll-out of Saturn V AS-505 from the Vehicle Assembly Building to the launch pad\\r\\nThe Earth as seen from Apollo 11 on the third day out\\r\\nNeil Armstrong describes the Moon's surface before setting foot on it\\r\\nThe Washington Post on Monday, July 21, 1969: \\"'The Eagle Has Landed'Two Men Walk on the Moon\\"\\r\\n?This article incorporates?public domain material from websites or documents of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.","input":"Who was the first to step on moon?"},{"output":"Guyana","context":"Coordinates: 500N 5845W? / ?5N 58.75W? / 5; -58.75\\r\\nin South America??(grey)\\r\\nGuyana (pronounced /a???n?/ or /a???n?/),[9][10] officially the Co-operative Republic of Guyana,[11] is a sovereign state on the northern mainland of South America. It is, however, often considered part of the Caribbean region because of its strong cultural, historical, and political ties with other Anglo Caribbean countries and the Caribbean Community (CARICOM). Guyana is bordered by the Atlantic Ocean to the north, Brazil to the south and southwest, Suriname to the east and Venezuela to the west. With 215,000 square kilometres (83,000?sq?mi), Guyana is the fourth-smallest country on mainland South America after Uruguay, Suriname and French Guiana (an overseas region of France).\\r\\nThe region known as \\"the Guianas\\" consists of the large shield landmass north of the Amazon River and east of the Orinoco River known as the \\"land of many waters\\". Originally inhabited by many indigenous groups, Guyana was settled by the Dutch before coming under British control in the late 18th century. It was governed as British Guiana, with mostly a plantation-style economy until the 1950s. It gained independence in 1966, and officially became a republic within the Commonwealth of Nations in 1970. The legacy of British rule is reflected in the country's political administration and diverse population, which includes Indian, African, Amerindian, and multiracial groups.\\r\\nGuyana is the only South American nation in which English is the official language. The majority of the population, however, speak Guyanese Creole, an English-based creole language, as a first language. Guyana is part of the Anglophone Caribbean. CARICOM, of which Guyana is a member, is headquartered in Guyana's capital and largest city, Georgetown. In 2008, the country joined the Union of South American Nations as a founding member.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe name \\"Guyana\\" is derived from Guiana, the original name for the region that formerly included Guyana (British Guiana), Suriname (Dutch Guiana), French Guiana, and parts of Colombia, Venezuela and Brazil. According to the Oxford English Dictionary, Guyana is derived from an Indigenous Amerindian language and means \\"land of many waters\\".[12]\\r\\nThere are nine indigenous tribes residing in Guyana: the Wai Wai, Macushi, Patamona, Lokono, Kalina, Wapishana, Pemon, Akawaio and Warao.[13] Historically the Lokono and Kalina tribes dominated Guyana. Although Christopher Columbus was the first European to sight Guyana during his third voyage (in 1498), and Sir Walter Raleigh wrote an account in 1596, the Dutch were the first Europeans to establish colonies: Essequibo (1616), Berbice (1627), and Demerara (1752). After the British assumed control in 1796,[14] the Dutch formally ceded the area in 1814. In 1831 the three separate colonies became a single British colony known as British Guiana.\\r\\nSince its independence in 1824 Venezuela has claimed the area of land to the west of the Essequibo River. Sim܇n Bolvar wrote to the British government warning against the Berbice and Demerara settlers settling on land which the Venezuelans, as assumed heirs of Spanish claims on the area dating to the sixteenth century, claimed was theirs. In 1899 an international tribunal ruled the land belonged to Great Britain. The British territorial claim stemmed from Dutch involvement and colonization of the area also dating to the sixteenth century, which was ceded to the British.\\r\\nGuyana achieved independence from the United Kingdom on 26 May 1966 and became a republic on 23 February 1970, remaining a member of the Commonwealth. The US State Department and the US Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), along with the British government, played a strong role in influencing political control in Guyana during this time.[15] The American government supported Forbes Burnham during the early years of independence because Cheddi Jagan was identified as a Marxist. They provided secret financial support and political campaign advice to Burnham's People's National Congress, to the detriment of the Jagan-led People's Progressive Party, which was mostly supported by Guyanese of East Indian background.\\r\\nIn 1978, Guyana received international notice when 918 members of the American cult, Peoples Temple, died in a mass murder/suicide drinking cyanide-laced Flavor Aid. However, most of the suicides were by Americans and not Guyanese. More than 300 children were killed; the people were members of a group led by Jim Jones in Jonestown, the settlement which they had created. Jim Jones's bodyguards had earlier attacked people taking off at a small remote airstrip close to Jonestown, killing five people, including Leo Ryan, a US congressman.\\r\\nIn May 2008, President Bharrat Jagdeo was a signatory to the UNASUR Constitutive Treaty of the Union of South American Nations. Guyana has ratified the treaty.\\r\\nThe territory controlled by Guyana lies between latitudes 1 and 9N, and longitudes 56 and 62W.\\r\\nThe country can be divided into five natural regions; a narrow and fertile marshy plain along the Atlantic coast (low coastal plain) where most of the population lives; a white sand belt more inland (hilly sand and clay region), containing most of Guyana's mineral deposits; the dense rain forests (Forested Highland Region) in the southern part of the country; the dryer savannah areas in the south-west; and the smallest interior lowlands (interior savannah) consisting mostly of mountains that gradually rise to the Brazilian border.\\r\\nSome of Guyana's highest mountains are Mount Ayanganna (2,042 metres or 6,699 feet), Monte Cabura (1,465 metres or 4,806 feet) and Mount Roraima (2,772 metres or 9,094 feet ÿ the highest mountain in Guyana) on the Brazil-Guyana-Venezuela tripoint border, part of the Pakaraima range. Mount Roraima and Guyana's table-top mountains (tepuis) are said to have been the inspiration for Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's 1912 novel The Lost World. There are also many volcanic escarpments and waterfalls, including Kaieteur Falls which is believed to be the largest water drop in the world.[16] North of the Rupununi River lies the Rupununi savannah, south of which lie the Kanuku Mountains.\\r\\nThe four longest rivers are the Essequibo at 1,010 kilometres (628?mi) long, the Courentyne River at 724 kilometres (450?mi), the Berbice at 595 kilometres (370?mi), and the Demerara at 346 kilometres (215?mi). The Corentyne river forms the border with Suriname. At the mouth of the Essequibo are several large islands, including the 145?km (90?mi) wide Shell Beach lies along the northwest coast, which is also a major breeding area for sea turtles (mainly leatherbacks) and other wildlife.\\r\\nThe local climate is tropical and generally hot and humid, though moderated by northeast trade winds along the coast. There are two rainy seasons, the first from May to mid-August, the second from mid-November to mid-January.\\r\\nGuyana has one of the largest unspoiled rainforests in South America, some parts of which are almost inaccessible by humans. The rich natural history of Guyana was described by early explorers Sir Walter Raleigh and Charles Waterton and later by naturalists Sir David Attenborough and Gerald Durrell. In 2008, the BBC broadcast a three-part programme called Lost Land of the Jaguar which highlighted the huge diversity of wildlife, including undiscovered species and rare species such as the giant otter and harpy eagle.\\r\\nIn 2012, Guyana received a $45 million reward from Norway for its rainforest protection efforts. This stems from a 2009 agreement between the nations for a total of $250 million for protecting and maintaining the natural habitat. Thus far, the country has received $115 million of the total grant.\\r\\nGuyana is divided into 10 regions:[17][18]\\r\\nThe regions are divided into 27 neighbourhood councils.[19]\\r\\nGuyana is in border disputes with both Suriname, which claims the area east of the left bank of the Corentyne River and the New River in southwestern Suriname, and Venezuela which claims the land west of the Essequibo River, once the Dutch colony of Essequibo as part of Venezuela's Guayana Essequiba.[20][21][22][23] The maritime[24][25] component of the territorial dispute with Suriname was arbitrated by the United Nations Convention on Law of the Sea, and a ruling was announced on 21 September 2007. The ruling concerning the Caribbean Sea north of both nations found both parties violated treaty obligations and declined to order any compensation to either party.[26]\\r\\nWhen the British surveyed British Guiana in 1840, they included the entire Cuyuni River basin within the colony. Venezuela did not agree with this as it claimed all lands west of the Essequibo River. In 1898, at Venezuela's request, an international arbitration tribunal was convened, and in 1899 the tribunal issued an award giving about 94% of the disputed territory to British Guiana. The arbitration was concluded, settled and accepted into International law by both Venezuela and the U.K. Venezuela brought up again the settled claim, during the 1960s cold war period, and during Guyana's Independence period. This issue is now governed by the Treaty of Geneva of 1966, which was signed by the Governments of Guyana, Great Britain and Venezuela, and Venezuela continues to claim Guayana Esequiba.[27] Venezuela calls this region \\"Zona en Reclamaci܇n\\" (Reclamation Zone) and Venezuelan maps of the national territory routinely include it, drawing it in with dashed lines.[28]\\r\\nSpecific small disputed areas involving Guyana are Ankoko Island with Venezuela; Corentyne River[29] with Suriname; and Tigri Area or New River Triangle[30] with Suriname. In 1967 a Surinamese survey team was found in the New River Triangle and was forcibly removed. In August 1969 a patrol of the Guyana Defence Force found a survey camp and a partially completed airstrip inside the triangle, and documented evidence of the Surinamese intention to occupy the entire disputed area. After an exchange of gunfire, the Surinamese were driven from the triangle.\\r\\nThe following habitats have been categorised for Guyana: coastal, marine, littoral, estuarine palustrine, mangrove, riverine, lacustrine, swamp, savanna, white sand forest, brown sand forest, montane, cloud forest, moist lowland and dry evergreen scrub forests (NBAP, 1999). About 14 areas of biological interest have been identified as possible hotspots for a National Protected Area System. More than 80% of Guyana is still covered by forests, those forest also contains the worlds rarest orchids ranging from dry evergreen and seasonal forests to montane and lowland evergreen rain forests. These forests are home to more than a thousand species of trees. Guyana's tropical climate, unique geology, and relatively pristine ecosystems support extensive areas of species-rich rain forests and natural habitats with high levels of endemism. Approximately eight thousand species of plants occur in Guyana, half of which are found nowhere else.\\r\\nGuyana has one of the highest levels of biodiversity in the world. With 1,168 vertebrate species and 814 bird species, it boasts one of the richest mammalian fauna assemblages of any comparably sized area in the world. The Guiana Shield region is little known and extremely rich biologically. Unlike other areas of South America, over 70% of the natural habitat remains pristine.\\r\\nThe rich natural history of British Guiana was described by early explorers Sir Walter Raleigh and Charles Waterton and later by naturalists Sir David Attenborough and Gerald Durrell.\\r\\nIn February 2004, the Government of Guyana issued a title to more than 1?million acres (4,000?km2) of land in the Konashen Indigenous District declaring this land as the Konashen Community-Owned Conservation Area (COCA), to be managed by the Wai Wai. In doing so Guyana created the world's largest Community-Owned Conservation Area.[31]\\r\\nThis important event followed a request made by the Wai Wai community to the government of Guyana and Conservation International Guyana (CIG) for assistance in developing a sustainable plan for their lands in Konashen. The three parties signed a Memorandum of Cooperation which outlines a plan for sustainable use of the Konashen COCA's biological resources, identifies threats to the area's biodiversity, and helps develop projects to increase awareness of the COCA as well as generate the income necessary to maintain its protected status.\\r\\nThe Konashen Indigenous District of Southern Guyana houses the headwaters of the Essequibo River, Guyana's principal water source, and drains the Kassikaityu, Kamoa, Sipu and Chodikar rivers. Southern Guyana is host to some of the most pristine expanses of evergreen forests in the northern part of South America. Most of the forests found here are tall, evergreen hill-land and lower montane forests, with large expanses of flooded forest along major rivers. Thanks to the very low human population density of the area, most of these forests are still intact. The Smithsonian Institution has identified nearly 2,700 species of plants from this region, representing 239 distinct families, and there are certainly additional species still to be recorded.\\r\\nSuch incredible diversity of plants supports even more impressive diversity of animal life, recently documented by a biological survey organised by Conservation International. The clean, unpolluted waters of the Essequibo watershed support a remarkable diversity of fish and aquatic invertebrates, and are home to giant otters, capybaras, and several species of caimans.\\r\\nOn land, large mammals, such as jaguars, tapirs, bush dogs, giant anteaters, and saki monkeys are still common. Over 400 species of birds have been reported from the region, and the reptile and amphibian faunas are similarly rich. The Konashen COCA forests are also home to countless species of insects, arachnids, and other invertebrates, many of which are still undiscovered and unnamed.\\r\\nThe Konashen COCA is relatively unique in that it contains a high level of biological diversity and richness that remains in nearly pristine condition; such places have become rare on earth. This fact has given rise to various non-exploitative, environmentally sustainable industries such as ecotourism, successfully capitalising on the biological wealth of the Konashen COCA with comparatively little enduring impact.\\r\\nGuyana signed the Convention Concerning the Protection of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage treaty in 1977, the first Caribbean country to do so. In the mid-1990s, Guyana began the process of selecting sites for World Heritage nomination, and three sites were considered: Kaieteur National Park, Shell Beach and Historic Georgetown. By 1997, work on Kaieteur National Park was started, and in 1998 work on Historic Georgetown was begun. To date, however, Guyana has not made a successful nomination.[citation needed]\\r\\nGuyana submitted the Kaieteur National Park, including the Kaieteur Falls, to UNESCO as its first World Heritage Site nomination. The proposed area and surrounds have some of Guyana's most diversified life zones with one of the highest levels of endemic species found in South America. The Kaieteur Falls are the most spectacular feature of the park, falling a distance of 226?metres. The nomination of Kaieteur National Park as a World Heritage Site was not successful, primarily because the area was seen by the evaluators as being too small, especially when compared with the Central Suriname Nature Reserve that had just been nominated as a World Heritage Site (2000). The dossier was thus returned to Guyana for revision.[citation needed]\\r\\nGuyana continues in its bid for a World Heritage Site. Work continues, after a period of hiatus, on the nomination dossier for Historic Georgetown. A tentative list indicating an intention to nominate Historic Georgetown was submitted to UNESCO in December 2004. In April 2005, two Dutch experts in conservation spent two weeks in Georgetown supervising architecture staff and students of the University of Guyana in a historic building survey of the selected area. This is part of the data collection for the nomination dossier.[citation needed]\\r\\nMeanwhile, as a result of the Kaieteur National Park being considered too small, there is a proposal to prepare a nomination for a Cluster Site that will include the Kaieteur National Park, the Iwokrama Forest and the Kanuku Mountains. The Iwokrama rain forest, an area rich in biological diversity, has been described by Major General (Retired) Joseph Singh as \\"a flagship project for conservation.\\" The Kanuku Mountains area is in a pristine state and is home to more than four hundred species of birds and other animals.[citation needed]\\r\\nGuyana holds two of the World Wildlife Fund's Global 200 eco-regions,[citation needed] the Guianan and Guiana Highlands moist forests. It is also home to several endemic species including the greenheart tree.\\r\\nThe main economic activities in Guyana are agriculture (production of rice and Demerara sugar), bauxite and gold mining, timber, shrimp fishing and minerals. In 2015 the first of several significant deep water oil discoveries were found, which will have a significant effect on the economy. Chronic problems include a shortage of skilled labour and a deficient infrastructure. In 2008, the economy witnessed a 3% increase in growth amid the global economic crisis, grew an impressive 5.4% in 2011 and 3.7% in 2012.\\r\\nUntil recently, the government was juggling a sizeable external debt against the urgent need for expanded public investment. Low prices for key mining and agricultural commodities combined with troubles in the bauxite and sugar industries, had threatened the government's tenuous fiscal position and dimmed prospects for the future. However, the Guyanese economy has rebounded slightly and exhibited moderate economic growth since 1999, thanks to an expansion in the agricultural and mining sectors, a more favourable atmosphere for business initiatives, a more realistic exchange rate, fairly low inflation, and the continued support of international organisations.\\r\\nThe sugar industry, which accounts for 28% of all export earnings, is largely run by the company GuySuCo, which employs more people than any other industry. Many industries have a large foreign investment. For example, the mineral industry is heavily invested in by the American company Reynolds Metals and the British-Australian Rio Tinto's Rio Tinto Alcan subsidiary; the Korean/Malaysian Barama Company has a large stake in the logging industry.\\r\\nThe production of balat (natural latex) was once big business in Guyana. Most of the balata bleeding in Guyana took place in the foothills of the Kanuku Mountains in the Rupununi. Early exploitation also took place in the North West District, but most of the trees in the area were destroyed by illicit bleeding methods that involved cutting down the trees rather than making incisions in them. Uses of balat included the making of cricket balls, the temporary filling of troublesome tooth cavities, and the crafting of figurines and other decorative items (particularly by the Macushi people of the Kanuku mountains).\\r\\nMajor private sector organisations include the Private Sector Commission (PSC)[32] and the Georgetown Chamber of Commerce & Industry (GCCI);[33]\\r\\nThe government initiated a major overhaul of the tax code in early 2007. The Value Added Tax (VAT) was brought into effect, replacing six different taxes. Prior to the implementation of the VAT, it had been relatively easy to evade sales tax, and many businesses were in violation of tax code. Many businesses were very opposed to VAT introduction because of the extra paperwork required; however, the Government has remained firm on the VAT. By replacing several taxes with one flat tax rate, it will also be easier for government auditors to spot embezzlement. This was prevalent under the former PPP/C regime who authorised the VAT to be equal to 50% of the value of the good. While the adjustment to VAT has been difficult, it may improve day-to-day life because of the significant additional funds the government will have available for public spending.\\r\\nPresident Bharrat Jagdeo had made debt relief a foremost priority of his administration. He was quite successful, getting US$800?million of debt written off by the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the World Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB), in addition to millions more from other industrial nations. Jagdeo was lauded by IDB President Moreno for his strong leadership and negotiating skills in pursuing debt relief for Guyana and several other regional countries.\\r\\nThe Charter of the OAS was signed in Bogota in 1948 and was amended by several Protocols which were named after the city and the year in which the Protocol was signed, such as Managua in 1993 forming part of the name of the Protocol.[35]\\r\\nGuyana is listed as entering into the Inter ÿ American system in 1991.[36]\\r\\nThe last Summits of the Americas, the seventh, was held in Panama City, Panama in 2015 with the eighth summit being held in Lima, Peru in 2018 according to the website of the Summits of Americas.[37]\\r\\nWith Guyana having many groups of indigenous persons and given the geographical location of the country, recent developments in the oil and gas sector internationally and offshore, (such as Eliza I and II) the contributions of the Guyanese to the OAS with respect to this area, that is indigenous people may be significant going forward.[38]\\r\\nThe position of the OAS with respect to indigenous persons appears to be developing over the years. The following statements appear to capture the position of the OAS with respect to the ILSA?:\\"The \\"OAS has supported and participated in the organisation of Indigenous Leaders Summits of Americas (ILSA)\\" according to the OAS's website. The most recent \\"statement made by the Heads of State of the hemisphere was in the Declaration of Commitments of Port of Spain in 2009 ÿ Paragraph 86\\" according to the OAS's website.\\"[39]\\r\\nThe Draft American Declaration of the Rights of the Indigenous Persons appears to be a working document. The last \\"Meeting for Negotiations in the Quest for Consensus on this area appeared to be Meeting Number (18) eighteen and is listed as being held in May 2015 according to the website.[40]\\r\\nAt a CARICOM Meeting, representatives of Trinidad and Tobago and Guyana, Kenneth Valley and Asgar Ally respectively signed The Double Taxation Relief (CARICOM) Treaty 1994 on 19 August 1994.[42]\\r\\nEarlier in the year, on 6 July 1994, representatives of eight (8) CARICOM countries signed similar agreements at Sherbourne Conference Centre, St. Michael, Barbados.[43] The other countries whose representatives signed the treaties in Barbados prior to Guyana's signing of a similar treaty were: Antigua and Barbuda, Belize, Grenada, Jamaica, St. Kitts and Nevis, St. Lucia, St. Vincent and the Grenadines and Trinidad and Tobago.[44]\\r\\nThis treaty covered taxes, residence, tax jurisdictions, capital gains, business profits, interest, dividends, royalties and other areas.\\"\\r\\nOn 30 June 2014, Guyana signed a Model 1 agreement with the United States of America in relation to the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA).[45] This Model 1 agreement includes a reference to the Tax Information Exchange Agreement (Clause 3) which was signed on 22 July 1992 in Georgetown, Guyana which was intended to exchange Tax information on an automatic basis.\\r\\nThe chief majority (about 90%) of Guyana's 773,000 population lives along a narrow coastal strip which ranges from a width of 16 to 64 kilometres (10 to 40?mi) inland and which makes up approximately only 10% of the nation's total land area.[46]\\r\\nThe present population of Guyana is racially and ethnically heterogeneous, with ethnic groups originating from India, Africa, Europe, and China, as well as indigenous or aboriginal peoples. Despite their diverse ethnic backgrounds, these groups share two common languages: English and Creole.\\r\\nThe largest ethnic group is the Indo-Guyanese (also known as East Indians), the descendants of indentured servants from India, who make up 43.5% of the population, according to the 2002 census. They are followed by the Afro-Guyanese, the descendants of slaves from Africa, who constitute 30.2%. Guyanese of mixed heritage make up 16.7%, while the indigenous peoples (known locally as Amerindians) make up 9.1%. The indigenous groups include the Arawaks, the Wai Wai, the Caribs, the Akawaio, the Arecuna, the Patamona, the Wapixana, the Macushi and the Warao.[34] The two largest groups, the Indo-Guyanese and Afro-Guyanese, have experienced some racial tension.[47][48][49]\\r\\nThe majority of Indo-Guyanese are descended from indentured servants who came from Bhojpuri-speaking areas of North India.[50] A sizable minority are South Indian, largely of Tamil and Telugu descent.[51]\\r\\nThe distribution pattern in the 2002 census was similar to those of the 1980 and 1991 censuses, but the share of the two main groups has declined. Indo-Guyanese made up 51.9% of the total population in 1980, but by 1991 this had fallen to 48.6%, and then to 43.5% in the 2002 census. Those of African descent increased slightly from 30.8% to 32.3% during the first period (1980 and 1991) before falling to 30.2% in the 2002 census. With small growth in the overall population, the decline in the shares of the two larger groups has resulted in the relative increase of shares of the multiracial and Amerindian groups. The Amerindian population rose by 22,097 people between 1991 and 2002. This represents an increase of 47.3% or annual growth of 3.5%. Similarly, the multiracial population increased by 37,788 persons, representing a 43.0% increase or annual growth rate of 3.2% from the base period of 1991 census. The number of Portuguese (4.3% of the population in 1891) has been declining constantly over the decades.[52]\\r\\nEnglish is the official language of Guyana and is used for education, government, media, and services. The vast majority of the population speaks Guyanese Creole, an English-based creole with slight African and East Indian influence, as their native tongue.[54] In addition, Cariban languages (Akawaio, Wai-Wai, and Macushi) are spoken by a small minority, while Indic languages are retained for cultural and religious reasons.\\r\\nReligion in Guyana (2012 census)[55]\\r\\nAccording to a 2002 nationwide census on religious affiliation, 57.4% of the population was Christian, 28.4% was Hindu, 7.2% was Muslim, 1.9% adhered to other religions, while 2.3% of the population did not profess any.[56]\\r\\nAmong Christians, most are Protestants (34.8%) or other Christian (20.8%), but there is also a minority of Roman Catholics (7.1%). Among Hindu, Vaishnavism is the major tradition. Among Muslims, Sunni are in the majority, while there are also Shia and Ahmadiyya minorities. Among other religions, the Rastafari movement, Buddhism, and the Baha'i Faith are the most popular.\\r\\nThe politics of Guyana takes place in a framework of a presidential representative democratic republic, in which the President of Guyana is both head of state and head of government, and of a multi-party system. Executive power is exercised by the President and the Government. Legislative power is vested in both the President and the National Assembly of Guyana. Historically, politics are a source of tension in the country, and violent riots have often broken out during elections. During the 1970s and 1980s, the political landscape was dominated by the People's National Congress.\\r\\nIn 1992, the first \\"free and fair\\" elections were overseen by former United States President Jimmy Carter, and the People's Progressive Party led the country until 2015. The two parties are principally organised along ethnic lines and as a result often clash on issues related to the allocation of resources. In the General Elections held on 28 November 2011, the People's Progressive Party (PPP) retained a majority, and their presidential candidate Donald Ramotar was elected as President. On 11 May 2015, early general elections were held, resulting in a victory for A Partnership for National Unity-Alliance for Change (APNU-AFC) Coalition party. APNU-AFC, a multi-ethnic, multi-party coalition, won a majority, 33 of 65 seats in the National Assembly. On 16 May 2015, retired army general David A. Granger became the eighth President of Guyana.\\r\\nPublic procurement in Guyana is overseen by the Public Procurement Commission, appointed under the Public Procurement Commission Act 2003. Due to lengthy delay in identifying and agreeing commission members, the commission was not appointed until 2016.[57]\\r\\nThe Guyana Defence Force (GDF) is the military service of Guyana.\\r\\nHomosexual acts are illegal in Guyana.[58]\\r\\nThere are a total of 187 kilometres (116?mi) of railway, all dedicated to ore transport. There are 7,969 kilometres (4,952?mi) of highway, of which 591 kilometres (367?mi) are paved. Navigable waterways extend 1,077 kilometres (669?mi), including the Berbice, Demerara, and Essequibo rivers. There are ports at Georgetown, Port Kaituma, and New Amsterdam. There are two international airports (Cheddi Jagan International Airport, Timehri and Eugene F. Correira International Airport (formerly Ogle Airport); along with about 90 airstrips, nine of which have paved runways. Guyana, Suriname and the Falkland Islands are the only three regions in South America which drive on the left.\\r\\nThe electricity sector in Guyana is dominated by Guyana Power and Light (GPL), the state-owned vertically integrated utility. Although the country has a large potential for hydroelectric and bagasse-fueled power generation, most of its 226 MW of installed capacity correspond to inefficient thermoelectric diesel-engine driven generators.[citation needed]\\r\\nSeveral initiatives are in place to improve energy access in the hinterland.\\r\\nPer the CIA World Factbook:[34]\\r\\nGuyana Telephone & Telegraph (GT&T) is the main mobile phone provider[59][60][61]\\r\\nDigicel is also present in Guyana since 2007 providing mobile service for its citizens\\r\\nTelevision broadcast was officially introduced to Guyana in 1991.\\r\\nOf which are; L.R.T.V.S-Little Rock Television Station channel 10 (New Amsterdam, Berbice) H.G.P-Halagala General Productions television (Beterverwagting Village, Demerara) RCA Television charity, Essequibo coast\\r\\nLife expectancy at birth is estimated to be 67.39 years for both males and females in 2012.[67] The PAHO/ WHO Global Health Report 2014 (using statistics of 2012) ranked the country as having the highest suicide rate in the world, with a mortality rate of 44.2 per 100,000 inhabitants.[68][69] According to 2011 estimates from the WHO, HIV prevalence is 1.2% of the teen/adult population (ages 15ÿ49).[70] Although Guyana's health profile falls short in comparison with many of its Caribbean neighbours, there has been remarkable progress since 1988, and the Ministry of Health is working to upgrade conditions, procedures, and facilities.[citation needed]\\r\\nGuyana's educational system is considered to be among the best in the Caribbean, but it deteriorated significantly in the 1980s, because of inadequate funding and emigration of many highly educated citizens. Although the education system recovered in the 1990s, it still does not produce the quality of educated students necessary for Guyana to modernise its workforce.[citation needed] The country lacks a critical mass of expertise in many of the disciplines and activities on which it depends. At 88.5%, Guyana's literacy rate is the worst in South America.[71]\\r\\nThe educational system does not sufficiently focus on the training of Guyanese in science and technology, technical and vocational subjects, business management, or computer sciences.[citation needed] The Guyanese education system is modelled on the former British education system. Students are expected to take the NGSA (National Grade Six Assessment) for entrance into high school in grade 7. They take the CXC at the end of high school. Schools have introduced the CAPE exams which all other Caribbean countries have introduced. The A-level system, inherited from the British era, has all but disappeared and is offered only in a few schools.\\r\\nFurther adding to the problems of the educational system, many of the better-educated professional teachers have emigrated to other countries over the past two decades, mainly because of low pay, lack of opportunities and crime.[citation needed]\\r\\nGuyana's culture is very similar to that of the English-speaking Caribbean, and has historically been tied to the English-speaking Caribbean as part of the British Empire when it became a possession in the nineteenth century. Guyana is a founding member of the Caricom (Caribbean Community) economic bloc and also the home of the Bloc's Headquarters, the CARICOM Secretariat.\\r\\nGuyana's geographical location, its sparsely populated rain-forest regions, and its substantial Amerindian population differentiate it from English-speaking Caribbean countries. Its blend of Indo-Guyanese (East Indian) and Afro-Guyanese (African) cultures gives it similarities to Trinidad and distinguishes it from other parts of the Americas. Guyana shares similar interests with the islands in the West Indies, such as food, festive events, music, sports, etc.\\r\\nGuyana plays international cricket as a part of the West Indies cricket team, and the Guyana team plays first-class cricket against other nations of the Caribbean. In March and April 2007 Guyana co-hosted the Cricket World Cup 2007. In addition to its CARICOM membership, Guyana is a member of CONCACAF, the international football federation for North and Central America and the Caribbean.\\r\\nEvents include Mashramani (Mash), Phagwah (Holi), and Deepavali (Diwali).\\r\\nAmong the birds found on Guyana is cock of the rock (Rupicola rupicola).[72]\\r\\nThe major sports in Guyana are cricket (Guyana is part of the West Indies as defined for international cricket purposes[73]), basketball, football (soccer), and volleyball.[74] Minor sports include softball cricket (beach cricket), field hockey, netball, rounders, lawn tennis, table tennis, boxing, squash, rugby, horse racing and a few others.\\r\\nGuyana played host to international cricket matches as part of the 2007 Cricket World Cup (CWC 2007). The new 15,000-seat Providence Stadium, also referred to as Guyana National Stadium, was built in time for the World Cup and was ready for the beginning of play on 28 March. At the first international game of CWC 2007 at the stadium, Lasith Malinga of the Sri Lankan team took four wickets in four consecutive deliveries.[75]\\r\\nFor international football purposes, Guyana is part of CONCACAF.

The park preserves Fort Jefferson and the seven Dry Tortugas islands, the westernmost and most isolated of the Florida Keys. The archipelago's coral reefs are the least disturbed of the Florida Keys reefs.\\r\\nThe park is noted for abundant sea life, tropical bird breeding grounds, colorful coral reefs, and legends of shipwrecks and sunken treasures. The park's centerpiece is Fort Jefferson, a massive but unfinished coastal fortress. Fort Jefferson is the largest brick masonry structure in the Western Hemisphere,[3][4] and is composed of more than 16 million bricks. Among United States forts it is exceeded in size only by Fort Monroe, Virginia and Fort Adams, Rhode Island. Dry Tortugas is unique in its combination of a largely undisturbed tropical ecosystem with significant historic artifacts. The park is accessible only by seaplane or boat and has averaged about 63,000 visitors annually in the period from 2007 to 2016.[2] Activities include snorkeling, picnicking, birdwatching, camping, scuba diving, saltwater fishing and kayaking.\\r\\nDry Tortugas National Park is part of the Everglades & Dry Tortugas Biosphere Reserve, established by UNESCO in 1976 under its Man and the Biosphere Programme.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Dry Tortugas is a small archipelago of coral islands about 70 miles (110?km) west of Key West, Florida. They represent the westernmost extent of the Florida Keys, though several reefs and submarine banks continue westward outside the park, beyond the Tortugas. The park area is more than 99 percent water. The seven major islands, all within the park, are, roughly from west to east, Loggerhead Key, Garden Key, Bush Key, Long Key, Hospital Key, Middle Key and East Key.[6] The park is bordered on the east, south and west by the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary, and on the northwest by the Tortugas Ecological Reserve.[7] The total land area within the park is 104 acres (42?ha). The park is in a tropical maritime climate, with rainy seasons coinciding with hurricane season from May to October, and a drier season from November through April. The area is heavily influenced by frequent hurricanes and tropical storms. Even with exposure to tropical systems the Tortugas are among the driest places in Florida, with an annual precipitation of about 49 inches (120?cm). There is little temperature variation, with high temperatures in summer around 90?F (32?C) and low temperatures in winter around 66?F (19?C).[8]\\r\\nThe northern and western portions of the park, including the central island group, were designated a 46-square-mile (120?km2) \\"research natural area\\" on January 19, 2007, in which no marine life may be taken, nor may vessels anchor. Vessels wishing to moor in the research natural area must use designated mooring buoys or docks. About 54 percent of the park remains open for fishing.[9]\\r\\nVisiting the park by private boat is difficult because of its distance, so most visitors come by ferry or seaplane from Key West. Official ferry and transportation services to the Dry Tortugas includes the Yankee Freedom III catamaran and seaplane services.[10]\\r\\nThe Dry Tortugas are the western extension of an arcuate chain of Pleistocene reef and oolitic limestone islands, with the eastern limit in the vicinity of Miami. These Florida Keys are the surface expression of the 6 km thick southern Florida carbonate platform, which has been accumulating sediments since the Early Cretaceous. Two stratigraphic units are exposed at the surface, the Key Largo Limestone and the Miami Limestone. The Key Largo Limestone are reefs up to 60 m thick, parallel to the shelf edge, consisting of hermatypic corals and calcarenites. The Miami Limestone is less than 15 m thick, and in general, is found behind the Key Largo Limestone reef, but overlies it in the western extent of the keys. It consists of a bryozoan facies and an oolitic facies and represents a subtidal shoal. Additionally, excellent examples of Holocene carbonate-sand deposits are found in the Dry Tortugas, consisting mainly of disarticulated Halimeda plates. Between the Dry Tortugas and Key West is a 12 m thick example of these sand deposits, known as \\"the quicksands\\".[11]\\r\\nThe first European to see the Dry Tortugas was Juan Ponce de Le܇n, who visited on June 21, 1513. Ponce de Le܇n caught 160 sea turtles there and subsequently referred to the islands as the \\"Tortugas\\" (turtles). They are called Dry owing to the absence of surface fresh water on the island. The archipelago includes a high concentration of historically significant shipwrecks dating from the 17th century to the present.[12] The Dry Tortugas were a significant American naval base from colonial times to the early 20th century, providing a sheltered anchorage and coaling station through the SpanishÿAmerican War.[13]\\r\\nFlorida was acquired from Spain by the United States in 1822. The Dry Tortugas were seen as a strategic point for the control of the Florida Straits and the Gulf of Mexico. Work on a lighthouse on Garden Key started in 1825. Planning for a fortification began almost immediately, and construction started in 1847. In 1856 work on a new, more powerful lighthouse on Loggerhead Key was started to replace the Garden Key light.[13]\\r\\nWork was half complete in 1860. Construction continued into the American Civil War, but eventually stopped, and the fort was used as a military prison. It was here that Dr. Samuel Mudd and three others charged with conspiracy in the assassination of President Abraham Lincoln were imprisoned.[14] Mudd was pardoned in 1869 after averting a viral outbreak. This use as a military prison continued until 1874.[13] With the introduction of coal-fueled ships, the Dry Tortugas became a coaling station for U.S. Navy ships.\\r\\nFort Jefferson is a massive but unfinished coastal fortress. It is the largest masonry structure in the Western Hemisphere,[3][4] and is composed of more than 16 million bricks.\\r\\nComprising 47,125 acres (19,071?ha), Fort Jefferson National Monument was designated by President Franklin D. Roosevelt under the Antiquities Act on January 4, 1935. The monument was expanded in 1983 and redesignated as Dry Tortugas National Park on October 26, 1992, by an act of Congress.[15][16] Dry Tortugas is managed by the staff of Everglades National Park.[17] The park was established to protect the island and marine ecosystems of the Dry Tortugas, to preserve Fort Jefferson and submerged cultural resources such as shipwrecks, and to allow for public access in a regulated manner.[12]\\r\\nDuring the Federal government shutdown of 1995 and 1996, Dry Tortugas was closed along with all other national parks. Seeing this as having a damaging effect on their tourism-dependent economy, the residents of Key West, Florida, raised money to keep Dry Tortugas open. The effort was inspired by the Smithsonian Institution, which raised private donations to keep its museums open during the shutdown.\\r\\nFailing to find anybody to accept the money to reopen the park, Key West residents, under the auspices of the satirical micronation Conch Republic, sent a flotilla of civilian boats and fire department boats to Fort Jefferson in order to reopen the national park. When officials attempted to enter the fort, they were cited. The citation was contested in court the following year, and the resultant case, The United States of America v. Peter Anderson, was quickly dropped.\\r\\nThe park is a landing location for immigrants arriving from Cuba in homebuilt boats called \\"chugs.\\" Receiving and housing the migrants is a particular problem for Dry Tortugas, which has limited resources for such arrivals and which is several hours from the nearest Coast Guard or Border Patrol units. Communications with Key West are accomplished using a satellite-based voice-over-IP system, which is prone to garbling and delays, and by a radio relay system using an abandoned Air Force tower between Key West and the Dry Tortugas.[17]\\r\\nVisitation steadily rose for several decades, reaching a peak of 83,704 in 2000. Since then visitation has slowly declined, with an average of about 63,000 per year in the period from 2007 to 2016.[2]\\r\\nThe Dry Tortugas archipelago is classified as a borderline subtropicaltropical ecosystem, hosting species that do not normally breed in, and are not commonly found anywhere else within, the continental United States or the islands and waters surrounding it.\\r\\nWhen a cold front along Florida wiped out 96 percent of branching coral in 1976-77, once extensive branching coral formations became rubble fields.[18] The Dry Tortugas National Park now consists of patch reef and branching coral rubble.[18][19]\\r\\nDry Tortugas National Park has an official bird list of 299 species. Of these, only eight species frequently nest within the park: sooty tern, brown noddy, brown pelican, magnificent frigatebird, masked booby, roseate tern, bridled tern and mourning dove.[20] The park features the only nesting colonies of sooty tern, brown noddy, magnificent frigatebird, and masked booby in the contiguous United States.[8]\\r\\nBirdwatching activity peaks each spring (usually April) when dozens of migratory bird species can pass through the park in a single day. Many birds land inside the parade grounds of Fort Jefferson where they are often observed at close range. Common migratory warblers include the northern parula, American redstart, prairie warbler, hooded warbler, palm warbler, black-and-white warbler, common yellowthroat, yellow-rumped warbler, ovenbird, northern waterthrush, black-throated blue warbler, blackpoll warbler, and Cape May warbler, with more than 20 additional warbler species having shown up at least once. Several raptor species as well as cattle egrets are often seen hunting songbirds. Until early 2013 a small freshwater fountain existed beneath several seaside mahoe and buttonwood trees, and was the only freshwater source for many miles. Maintenance issues necessitated its removal, but a replacement water barrel is scheduled for installation in the fall of 2013. Each year several bird guides offer tours of Dry Tortugas National Park during April and early May when daily bird lists can often reach 100 or more species.\\r\\nAn active eradication program has resulted in the removal of invasive Casuarina trees and agave from Loggerhead Key, by cutting and herbicide treatment. Pterois, commonly known as lionfish, have also been found in the park's waters and the National Park Service was reviewing (in 2015) the lionfish management plan to determine what actions to take to manage the spread of this invasive species in Dry Tortugas National Park and Everglades National Park.[21]\\r\\n Media related to Dry Tortugas National Park at Wikimedia Commons","input":"When did dry tortugas become a national park?"},{"output":"Purandara Dasa","context":"Indian classical music is one of many forms of art music that have their roots in particular regional cultures. For other \\"classical\\" and art music traditions, see List of classical and art music traditions.\\r\\nIndian classical music is a genre of South Asian music.[1] It has two major traditions. The North Indian classical music tradition is called Hindustani, while the South Indian expression is called Carnatic.[2] These traditions were not distinct till about the 16th century. There on, during the turmoils of Islamic rule period of the Indian subcontinent, the traditions separated and evolved into distinct forms.[2] However, the two systems continue to have more common features than differences.[3]\\r\\nThe roots of the classical music of India are found in the Vedic literature of Hinduism and the ancient Natyashastra, the classic Sanskrit text on performance arts by Bharata Muni.[4][5] The 13th century Sanskrit text Sangita-Ratnakara of Sarangadeva is regarded as the definitive text by both the Hindustani music and the Carnatic music traditions.[6][7]\\r\\nThe Indian classical music has two foundational elements, raga and tala. The raga forms the fabric of a melodic structure, the tala measures the time cycle.[8] The raga gives an artist the ingredients palette to build the melody from sounds, while the tala provides them with a creative framework for rhythmic improvisation using time.[9][10][11] Dhrupads are among the oldest classical Indian music compositions, with heroic, laudatory and spiritual themes. They are the basis for many subgenre of Indian music.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe root of music in ancient India are found in the Vedic literature of Hinduism. The earliest Indian thought combined three arts, syllabic recital (vadya), melos (gita) and dance (nrtta).[13] As these fields developed, sangeeta became a distinct genre of art, in a form equivalent to contemporary music. This likely occurred before the time of Yska (c. 500 BCE), since he includes these terms in his nirukta studies, one of the six Vedanga of ancient Indian tradition. Some of the ancient texts of Hinduism such as the Samaveda (c. 1000 BCE) are structured entirely to melodic themes,[14][15] it is sections of Rigveda set to music.[16]\\r\\nThe Samaveda is organized into two formats. One part is based on the musical meter, another by the aim of the rituals.[17] The text is written with embedded coding, where swaras (octave notes) are either shown above or within the text, or the verse is written into parvans (knot or member) in simple words this embedded code of swaras is like the skeleton of the song. The swaras have about 12 different forms and different combinations of these swaras are made to sit under the names of different ragas. The specific code of a song clearly tells us what combination of swaras are present in a specific song. The lyrical part of the song is called \\"sahityam\\" and sahityam is just like singing the swaras altogether but using the lyrics of the song. The code in the form of swaras have even the notation of which note to be sung high and which one low. The hymns of Samaveda contain melodic content, form, rhythm and metric organization.[17] This structure is, however, not unique or limited to Samaveda. The Rigveda embeds the musical meter too, without the kind of elaboration found in the Samaveda. For example, the Gayatri mantra contains three metric lines of exactly eight syllables, with an embedded ternary rhythm.[18]\\r\\nIn the ancient traditions of Hinduism, two musical genre appeared, namely Gandharva (formal, composed, ceremonial music) and Gana (informal, improvised, entertainment music).[20] The Gandharva music also implied celestial, divine associations, while the Gana also implied singing.[20] The Vedic Sanskrit musical tradition had spread widely in the Indian subcontinent, and according to Rowell, the ancient Tamil classics make it \\"abundantly clear that a cultivated musical tradition existed in South India as early as the last few pre-Christian centuries\\".[21]\\r\\nThe classic Sanskrit text Natya Shastra is at the foundation of the numerous classical music and dance traditions of India. Before Natyashastra was finalized, the ancient Indian traditions had classified musical instruments into four groups based on their acoustic principle (how they work, rather than the material they are made of) for example flute which works with gracious in and out flow of air.[22] These four categories are accepted as given and are four separate chapters in the Natyashastra, one each on stringed instruments (chordophones), hollow instruments (aerophones), solid instruments (idiophones), and covered instruments (membranophones).[22] Of these, states Rowell, the idiophone in the form of \\"small bronze cymbals\\" were used for tala. Almost the entire chapter of Natyashastra on idiophones, by Bharata, is a theoretical treatise on the system of tala.[23] Time keeping with idiophones was considered a separate function than that of percussion (membranophones), in the early Indian thought on music theory.[23]\\r\\nThe early 13th century Sanskrit text Sangitaratnakara (literally, \\"Ocean of Music and Dance\\"), by Sarngadeva patronized by King Sighana of the Yadava dynasty in Maharashtra, mentions and discusses ragas and talas.[24] He identifies seven tala families, then subdivides them into rhythmic ratios, presenting a methodology for improvization and composition that continues to inspire modern era Indian musicians.[25] Sangitaratnakara is one of the most complete historic medieval era Hindu treatises on this subject that has survived into the modern era, that relates to the structure, technique and reasoning behind ragas and talas.[26][25]\\r\\nThe centrality and significance of music in ancient and early medieval India is also expressed in numerous temple and shrine reliefs, in Buddhism, Hinduism and Jainism, such as through the carving of musicians with cymbals at the fifth century Pavaya temple sculpture near Gwalior,[27] and the Ellora Caves.[28][29]\\r\\nThe post-Vedic era historical literature relating to Indian classical music has been extensive. The ancient and medieval texts are primarily in Sanskrit (Hinduism), but major reviews of music theory, instruments and practice were also composed in regional languages such as Braj, Kannada, Odissi, Pali (Buddhism), Prakrit (Jainism), Tamil and Telugu.[30] While numerous manuscripts have survived into the modern era, many original works on Indian music are believed to be lost, and are known to have existed only because they are quoted and discussed in other manuscripts on classical Indian music.[30][31] Many of the encyclopedic Puranas contain large chapters on music theory and instruments, such as the Bhagavata Purana, the Markandeya Purana, the Vayu Purana, the Linga Purana, and the Visnudharmottara Purana.[32][33][34]\\r\\nThe most cited and influential among these texts are the Sama Veda, Natya shastra (classic treatise on music theory, Gandharva), Brihaddesi (treatise on regional classical music forms), and Sangita Ratnakara (definitive text for Carnatic and Hindustani traditions).[6][30][35] Most historic music theory texts have been by Hindu scholars. Some classical music texts were also composed by Buddhists and Jaina scholars, and in 16th century by Muslim scholars. These are listed in the attached table.\\r\\nThe classical music tradition of the ancient and medieval Indian subcontinent (modern Bangladesh, India, Pakistan) were a generally integrated system through the 14th century, after which the socio-political turmoil of the Delhi Sultanate era isolated the north from the south. The music traditions of the North and South India were not considered as distinct till about the 16th century, but after that the traditions acquired distinct forms.[2] The North Indian classical music is called Hindustani, while the South Indian expression is called Carnatic (sometimes spelled as Karnatic). According to Nazir Ali Jairazbhoy, the North Indian tradition acquired its modern form after the 14th or the 15th century.[39]\\r\\nThe Indian classical music has historically adopted and evolved with many regional styles, such as the Bengali classical tradition. This openness to ideas led to assimilation of regional folk innovations, as well influences that arrived from outside the subcontinent. For example, the Hindustani music assimilated Arabian and Persian influences.[12] This assimilation of ideas was upon the ancient classical foundations such as raga, tala, matras as well as the musical instruments. The music theory and concepts from classical Indian music are not found in Persia and Arabia. For example, the Persian Rk is probably a pronunciation of Raga. According to Hormoz Farhat, Rk has no meaning in modern Persian language, and the concept of raga is unknown in Persia.[40]\\r\\nPurandara Dasa (1484 ÿ 1564) was a Hindu composer and musicologist who lived in Hampi of the Vijayanagara Empire.[41][42] He is considered Pithamaha (literally, \\"grandfather\\") of the Carnatic music. Purandara Dasa was a monk and a devotee of the Hindu god Krishna (Vishnu, Vittal avatar).[41] He systematized classical Indian music theory and developed exercises for musicians learn and perfect their art. He travelled widely sharing and teaching his ideas, and influenced numerous South Indian and Maharashtra Bhakti movement musicians.[43] These exercises, his teachings about raga, and his systematic methodology called Suladi Sapta Tala (literally, \\"primordial seven talas\\") remains in use in contemporary times.[42][44] The efforts of Purandara Dasa in the 16th century began the Carnatic style of Indian classical music.[43]\\r\\nCarnatic music, from South India, tends to be more rhythmically intensive and structured than Hindustani music. Examples of this are the logical classification of ragas into melakarthas, and the use of fixed compositions similar to Western classical music. Carnatic raga elaborations are generally much faster in tempo and shorter than their equivalents in Hindustani music. In addition, accompanists have a much larger role in Carnatic concerts than in Hindustani concerts. Today's typical concert structure was put in place by the vocalist Ariyakudi Ramanuja Iyengar. The opening piece is called a varnam, and is a warm-up for the musicians. A devotion and a request for a blessing follows, then a series of interchanges between ragams (unmetered melody) and thaalams (the ornamentation, equivalent to the jor). This is intermixed with hymns called krithis. The pallavi or theme from the raga then follows. Carnatic pieces also have notated lyrical poems that are reproduced as such, possibly with embellishments and treatments according to the performer's ideology.[citation needed]\\r\\nPrimary themes include worship, descriptions of temples, philosophy, and nayaka-nayika (Sanskrit \\"hero-heroine\\") themes. Tyagaraja (1759ÿ1847), Muthuswami Dikshitar (1776ÿ1827) and Syama Sastri (1762ÿ1827) have been the important historic scholars of Carnatic music. According to Eleanor Zelliot, Tyagaraja is known in the Carnatic tradition as one of the greatest composers, and he reverentially acknowledged the influence of Purandara Dasa.[43]\\r\\nIt is unclear when the process of differentiation of Hindustani music started. The process may have started in 14th century courts of the Delhi Sultans. However, according to Jairazbhoy, the North Indian tradition likely acquired its modern form after the 14th or after the 15th century.[45] The Hindustani music development reached a peak in the Indian subcontinent during the reign of Akbar. During this 16th century period, Tansen studied music and introduced musical innovations, for about the first sixty years of his life with patronage of the Hindu king Ram Chand of Gwalior, and thereafter performed at the Muslim court of Akbar.[46][47] Many musicians in northern Indian subcontinent consider the 16th century Tansen as the founder of Hindustani classical music.[48]\\r\\nTansen's style and innovations inspired many, and many modern gharanas (Hindustani music teaching houses) link themselves to his lineage.[49] The Muslim courts discouraged Sanskrit and Hindu religious words, and encouraged technical music. Such constraints led Hindustani music to evolve in a different way than the Carnatic music.[49][50]\\r\\nHindustani music style is mainly found in North India, Pakistan and Bangladesh. It exists in four major forms: Dhrupad, Khyal (or Khayal), Thumri and Tappa.[51] Dhrupad is ancient, Khyal evolved from it, Thumri evolved from Khyal.[52] Dhrupad is solemn music, uplifting and heroic, pure and spiritual. Khyal adds ornamental notes, shorter, moody and celebratory.[51] Thumri go one step further in their brevity, and are graceful songs. There are three major schools of Thumri: Lucknow gharana, Banaras gharana and Punjabi gharana. These weave in folk music innovations.[51] Tappa is the most folksy, one which likely existed in Rajasthan and Punjab region before it was systematized and integrated into classical music structure. It became popular, with the Bengali musicians developing their own Tappa.[53]\\r\\nKhayal are an important Hindustani musical form, and the term literally means \\"frolicsome imagination\\". They are significant because it was the template for Sufi musicians among the Islamic community of India, and Qawwals sang their folk songs in the Khayal format. Khayal form of music has historically attracted numerous South Asian music artists, and is sometimes referred to as Qawwali.[54]\\r\\nDhrupada (or Dhruvapada), the ancient form and described in the Hindu text Natyashastra,[55] is one of the core forms of classical music found all over the Indian subcontinent. The word comes from Dhruva which means immovable and permanent. It is spiritual, heroic, thoughtful, virtuous, embedding moral wisdom or solemn form of song-music combination.[56][52]\\r\\nA Dhrupada has at least four stanzas, called Sthayi (or Asthayi), Antara, Sancari and Abhoga. The Sthayi part is a melody that uses the middle octave's first tetrachord and the lower octave notes.[52] The Antara part uses the middle octave's second tetrachord and the higher octave notes.[52] The Samcari part is the development phase, which holistically builds using parts of Sthayi and Antara already played, and it uses melodic material built with all the three octave notes.[52] The Abhoga is the concluding section, that brings the listener back to the familiar starting point of Sthayi, albeit with rhythmic variations, with diminished notes like a gentle goodbye, that are ideally mathematical fractions such as dagun (half), tigun (third) or caugun (fourth).[57] Sometimes a fifth stanza called Bhoga is included. Though usually related to philosophical or Bhakti (emotional devotion to a god or goddess) themes, some Dhrupadas were composed to praise kings.[56][57]\\r\\nImprovisation is of central importance to Hindustani music, and a complex topic. Each school tradition or gharana has developed its own techniques. At its core, it starts with a standard composition (gat), then expands it in a process called gat vistar. The improvisation methods have ancient roots, and one of the more common techniques is called Alap, Jor and Jhala. The Alap explores possible tonal combinations among other things, Jor explores speed or tempo (faster), while Jhala explores complex combinations like a fishnet of strokes while keeping the beat patterns.[58] As with Carnatic music, Hindustani music has assimilated various folk tunes. For example, ragas such as Kafi and Jaijaiwanti are based on folk tunes.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe Hindustani music has had Arab and Persian music influences.[12] The nature of these influences are unclear. Scholars have attempted to study Arabic maqam (also spelled makam) of Arabian peninsula, Turkey and northern Africa, and dastgah of Iran, to discern the nature and extent.[59][60] Through the colonial era and until the 1960s, the attempt was to theoretically study ragas and maqams and suggested commonalities. Later comparative musicology studies, states Bruno Nettl ÿ a professor of Music, have found the similarities between classical Indian music and European music as well, raising the question about the point of similarities and of departures between the different world music systems.[59][60]\\r\\nOne of the earliest known discussions of Persian maqam and Indian ragas is by the late 16th century scholar Pundarika Vittala. He states that Persian maqams in use in his times had been derived from older Indian ragas (or mela), and he specifically maps over a dozen maqam. For example, Vittala states that the Hijaz maqam was derived from the Asaveri raga, and Jangula was derived from the Bangal.[61][62] In 1941, Haidar Rizvi questioned this and stated that influence was in the other direction, Middle Eastern maqams were turned into Indian ragas, such as Zangulah maqam becoming Jangla raga.[63] According to John Baily ÿ a professor of Ethnomusicology, there is evidence that the traffic of musical ideas were both ways, because Persian records confirm that Indian musicians were a part of the Qajar court in Tehran,[64] an interaction that continued through the 20th century with import of Indian musical instruments in cities such as Herat near Afghanistan-Iran border.[65]\\r\\nClassical Indian music is a genre of South Asian music, the other being film, various varieties of pop, regional folk, religious and devotional music.[1]\\r\\nIn Indian classical music, the raga and the tala are two foundational elements. The raga forms the fabric of a melodic structure, and the tala keeps the time cycle.[8] Both raga and tala are open frameworks for creativity and allow theoretically infinite number of possibilities, however, the tradition considers a few hundred ragas and talas as basic.[66] Raga is intimately related to tala or guidance about \\"division of time\\", with each unit called a matra (beat, and duration between beats).[67]\\r\\nA raga is a central concept of Indian music, predominant in its expression. According to Walter Kaufmann, though a remarkable and prominent feature of Indian music, a definition of raga cannot be offered in one or two sentences.[68] Raga may be roughly described as a musical entity that includes note intonation, relative duration and order, in a manner similar to how words flexibly form phrases to create an atmosphere of expression.[69] In some cases, certain rules are considered obligatory, in others optional. The raga allows flexibility, where the artist may rely on simple expression, or may add ornamentations yet express the same essential message but evoke a different intensity of mood.[69]\\r\\nA raga has a given set of notes, on a scale, ordered in melodies with musical motifs.[9] A musician playing a raga, states Bruno Nettl, may traditionally use just these notes, but is free to emphasize or improvise certain degrees of the scale.[9] The Indian tradition suggests a certain sequencing of how the musician moves from note to note for each raga, in order for the performance to create a rasa (mood, atmosphere, essence, inner feeling) that is unique to each raga. A raga can be written on a scale. Theoretically, thousands of raga are possible given 5 or more notes, but in practical use, the classical Indian tradition has refined and typically relies on several hundred.[9] For most artists, their basic perfected repertoire has some forty to fifty ragas.[70] Raga in Indian classic music is intimately related to tala or guidance about \\"division of time\\", with each unit called a matra (beat, and duration between beats).[67]\\r\\nA raga is not a tune, because the same raga can yield infinite number of tunes.[71] A raga is not a scale, because many ragas can be based on the same scale.[71][72] A raga, state Bruno Nettl and other music scholars, is a concept similar to mode, something between the domains of tune and scale, and it is best conceptualized as a \\"unique array of melodic features, mapped to and organized for a unique aesthetic sentiment in the listener\\".[71] The goal of a raga and its artist is to create rasa (essence, feeling, atmosphere) with music, as classical Indian dance does with performance arts. In the Indian tradition, classical dances are performed with music set to various ragas.[73]\\r\\nAccording to David Nelson ÿ an Ethnomusicology scholar specializing in Carnatic music, a tala in Indian music covers \\"the whole subject of musical meter\\".[74] Indian music is composed and performed in a metrical framework, a structure of beats that is a tala. A tala measures musical time in Indian music. However, it does not imply a regular repeating accent pattern, instead its hierarchical arrangement depends on how the musical piece is supposed to performed.[74]\\r\\nThe tala forms the metrical structure that repeats, in a cyclical harmony, from the start to end of any particular song or dance segment, making it conceptually analogous to meters in Western music.[74] However, talas have certain qualitative features that classical European musical meters do not. For example, some talas are much longer than any classical Western meter, such as a framework based on 29 beats whose cycle takes about 45 seconds to complete when performed. Another sophistication in talas is the lack of \\"strong, weak\\" beat composition typical of the traditional European meter. In classical Indian traditions, the tala is not restricted to permutations of strong and weak beats, but its flexibility permits the accent of a beat to be decided by the shape of musical phrase.[74]\\r\\nThe most widely used tala in the South Indian system is adi tala.[75] In the North Indian system, the most common tala is teental.[76] In the two major systems of classical Indian music, the first count of any tala is called sam.[76]\\r\\nInstruments typically used in Hindustani music include the sitar, sarod, surbahar, esraj, veena, tanpura, bansuri, shehnai, sarangi, violin, santoor, pakhavaj and tabla. Instruments typically used in Carnatic music include veena, venu, gottuvadyam, harmonium, mridangam, kanjira, ghatam, nadaswaram and violin.[citation needed]\\r\\nPlayers of the tabla, a type of drum, usually keep the rhythm, an indicator of time in Hindustani music. Another common instrument is the stringed tanpura, which is played at a steady tone (a drone) throughout the performance of the raga, and which provides both a point of reference for the musician and a background against which the music stands out. The task of playing the tanpura traditionally falls to a student of the soloist. Other instruments for accompaniment include the sarangi and the harmonium.[citation needed]\\r\\nIndian classical music is both elaborate and expressive. Like Western classical music, it divides the octave into 12 semitones of which the 7 basic notes are, in ascending tonal order, Sa Re Ga Ma Pa Dha Ni for Hindustani music and Sa Ri Ga Ma Pa Dha Ni for Carnatic music, similar to Western music's Do Re Mi Fa So La Ti . However, Indian music uses just-intonation tuning, unlike most modern Western classical music, which uses the equal-temperament tuning system. Also, unlike modern Western classical music, Indian classical music places great emphasis on improvisation.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe underlying scale may have four, five, six or seven tones, called swaras (sometimes spelled as svaras). The svara concept is found in the ancient Natya Shastra in Chapter 28. It calls the unit of tonal measurement or audible unit as ?ruti,[78] with verse 28.21 introducing the musical scale as follows,[79]\\r\\n???? ?????? ÿ\\r\\n????????? ????????? ???????? ?????????? ?\\r\\n??????? ?????????? ???????? ????????? ? ???\\r\\nThese seven degrees are shared by both major raga system, that is the North Indian (Hindustani) and South Indian (Carnatic).[82] The solfege (sargam) is learnt in abbreviated form: sa, ri (Carnatic) or re (Hindustani), ga, ma, pa, dha, ni, sa. Of these, the first that is \\"sa\\", and the fifth that is \\"pa\\", are considered anchors that are unalterable, while the remaining have flavors that differs between the two major systems.[82]\\r\\nContemporary Indian music schools follow notations and classifications (see melakarta and thaat). These are generally based on a notation system created by Vishnu Narayan Bhatkhande.[citation needed]\\r\\nAccording to Yukteshwar Kumar, elements of Indian music arrived in China in the 3rd century, such as in the works of Chinese lyrist Li Yannian.[83]\\r\\nAn emergent trend of the past few decades has been that of fusion music, where genres such as khyal and western music are intermixed to appeal to a wider audience.[citation needed]\\r\\nA few of the organizations that promote classical music include Saptak, Sangeet Sankalp established in 1989.[84][85] SPIC MACAY, established in 1977, has more than 500 chapters in India and abroad. SPIC MACAY claims to hold around 5000 events every year related to Indian classical music and dance.[86]","input":"Who is the father of indian classical music?"},{"output":"The epidermis","context":"The epidermis is the outermost of the three layers that make up the skin, the inner layers being the dermis and hypodermis.[1] The epidermis layer provides a barrier to infection from environmental pathogens[2] and regulates the amount of water released from the body into the atmosphere through transepidermal water loss.[3] The epidermis is composed of multiple layers of flattened cells[4] that overlie a base layer (stratum basale) composed of columnar cells arranged perpendicularly.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe rows of cells develop from stem cells in the basal layer. Cellular mechanisms for regulating water and sodium levels (ENaCs) are found in all layers of the epidermis.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe word epidermis is derived through Latin from Ancient Greek  epidermis, itself from Ancient Greek  epi, meaning 'over, upon' and from Ancient Greek  dermis, meaning 'skin'.

The junctions between the epidermal cells are of the adherens junction type, formed by transmembrane proteins called cadherins. Inside the cell, the cadherins are linked to actin filaments. In immunofluorescence microscopy, the actin filament network appears as a thick border surrounding the cells[5], although the actin filaments are actually located inside the cell and run parallel to the cell membrane. Because of the proximity of the neighboring cells and tightness of the junctions, the actin immunofluorescence appears as a border between cells.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe epidermis is composed of 4 or 5 layers, depending on the region of skin being considered.[9]  Those layers in descending order are:[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Malpighian layer (stratum malpighi) is both the stratum basale and stratum spinosum.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe epidermis is separated from the dermis, its underlying tissue, by a basement membrane.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs a stratified squamous epithelium, the epidermis is maintained by cell division within the stratum basale. Differentiating cell delaminate from the basement membrane and are displaced outwards through the epidermal layers, undergoing multiple stages of differentiation until, in the stratum corneum, losing their nucleus and fusing to squamous sheets, which are eventually shed from the surface (desquamation). Differentiated keratinocytes secrete keratin proteins, which contribute to the formation of an extracellular matrix that is an integral part of the skin barrier function. In normal skin, the rate of keratinocyte production equals the rate of loss,[4] taking about two weeks for a cell to journey from the stratum basale to the top of the stratum granulosum, and an additional four weeks to cross the stratum corneum.[2]  The entire epidermis is replaced by new cell growth over a period of about 48 days.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nKeratinocyte differentiation throughout the epidermis is in part mediated by a calcium gradient, increasing from the stratum basale until the outer stratum granulosum, where it reaches its maximum, and decreasing in the stratum corneum. Calcium concentration in the stratum corneum is very low in part because those relatively dry cells are not able to dissolve the ions. This calcium gradient parallels keratinocyte differentiation and as such is considered a key regulator in the formation of the epidermal layers.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nElevation of extracellular calcium concentrations induces an increase in intracellular free calcium concentrations.[13] Part of that intracellular increase comes from calcium released from intracellular stores[14] and another part comes from transmembrane calcium influx,[15] through both calcium-sensitive chloride channels[16] and voltage-independent cation channels permeable to calcium.[17] Moreover, it has been suggested that an extracellular calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR) also contributes to the rise in intracellular calcium concentration.[18]\\r\\n\\r\\nEpidermal organogenesis, the formation of the epidermis, begins in the cells covering the embryo after neurulation, the formation of the central nervous system.  In most vertebrates, this original one-layered structure quickly transforms into a two-layered tissue; a temporary outer layer, the periderm, which is disposed once the inner basal layer or stratum germinativum has formed.[19]\\r\\n\\r\\nThis inner layer is a germinal epithelium that gives rise to all epidermal cells.  It divides to form the outer spinous layer (stratum spinosum).  The cells of these two layers, together called the Malpighian layer(s) after Marcello Malpighi, divide to form the superficial granular layer (Stratum granulosum) of the epidermis.[19]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe cells in the stratum granulosum do not divide, but instead form skin cells called keratinocytes from the granules of keratin.  These skin cells finally become the cornified layer (stratum corneum), the outermost epidermal layer, where the cells become flattened sacks with their nuclei located at one end of the cell.  After birth these outermost cells are replaced by new cells from the stratum granulosum and throughout life they are shed at a rate of 0.001 - 0.003 ounces of skin flakes every hour, or 0.024-0.072 ounces per day.[20]\\r\\n\\r\\nEpidermal development is a product of several growth factors, two of which are:[19]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe epidermis serves as a barrier to protect the body against microbial pathogens, oxidant stress (UV light), and chemical compounds, and provides mechanical resistance to minor injury. Most of this barrier role is played by the stratum corneum.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe ability of the skin to hold water is primarily due to the stratum corneum and is critical for maintaining healthy skin.[23] Lipids arranged through a gradient and in an organized manner between the cells of the stratum corneum form a barrier to transepidermal water loss.[24][25]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe amount and distribution of melanin pigment in the epidermis is the main reason for variation in skin color in Homo sapiens.  Melanin is found in the small melanosomes, particles formed in melanocytes from where they are transferred to the surrounding keratinocytes.  The size, number, and arrangement of the melanosomes vary between racial groups, but while the number of melanocytes can vary between different body regions, their numbers remain the same in individual body regions in all human beings.  In white and Asian skin the melanosomes are packed in \\"aggregates\\", but in black skin they are larger and distributed more evenly.  The number of melanosomes in the keratinocytes increases with UV radiation exposure, while their distribution remain largely unaffected.[26]\\r\\n\\r\\nLaboratory culture of keratinocytes to form a 3D structure (artificial skin) recapitulating most of the properties of the epidermis is routinely used as a tool for drug development and testing.","input":"What is the upper most layer of skin?"},{"output":"a market economy","context":"WTO\\r\\n\\r\\nThe economy of Madagascar is a market economy and is supported by Madagascar's well-established agricultural industry and emerging tourism, textile and mining industries. Malagasy agriculture produces tropical staple crops such as rice and cassava, as well as cash crops such as vanilla and coffee. Madagascar's wealth of natural resources  supports its sizable mining industry. Additionally, Madagascar's status as a developing nation exempts Malagasy exports from customs protocol in some areas, notably the United States and European Union. These exemptions have supported the growth of the Malagasy textile industry. Despite Madagascar's natural resources and developing industries, the 2009 Malagasy political crisisconsidered by the international community to be an illegal coup[6]deterred foreign investments in Madagascar and caused the Malagasy economy to decline.[7] Foreign investments have resumed following the resumption of elections in early 2014.[citation needed] At 2016, Madagascar is one of the world's fastest-growing economies.\\r\\n\\r\\nAgriculture, including fishing and forestry, is Madagascar's largest industry and employs 82% of its labor force.[4] Madagascar's varied climate, ranging from tropical along the coasts, moderate in the highlands and arid in the south, allows for the cultivation of tropical crops such as rice, cassava, beans and bananas.[4] In 2011, agricultural productsespecially cloves, vanilla, cacao, sugar, pepper, and coffeeaccounted for Madagascar's top twelve exports by value.[8] Madagascar produces the second largest vanilla harvest in the world and Malagasy vanilla accounts for about a quarter of the global vanilla market.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nExports from Madagascars' Export Processing Zones, located around  Antananarivo and Antsirabe, account for the majority of garment exports[10] and are largely exempt from customs restrictions in the United States under the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA)[11] and in the European Union under the Everything But Arms (EBA) agreement.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nA small but growing part of the economy is based on mining of ilmenite, with investments emerging in recent years, particularly near Tulear and Fort Dauphin.[13] Mining corporation Rio Tinto Group started production at its Fort Dauphin mine in January 2009,[14] following several years of preparation. The mining project is highly controversial, with Friends of the Earth and other environmental organizations filing reports to detail their concerns about the mine's effect on the environment and local communities.[15] Gemstone mining is also an important part of Madagascar's economy.\\r\\n\\r\\nSeveral major projects are underway in the mining and oil and gas sectors that, if successful, will give a significant boost. In the mining sector, these include the development of coal at Sakoa and nickel near Tamatave. The Ambatovy nickel mine (Sherrit International 40%, Sumitomo 27.5%, Korea Resources 27.5%, SNC-Lavalin 5%) is a huge operation and has cost USD $4.76 million to date [16] and is due to start production in 2011. In oil, Madagascar Oil is developing the massive onshore heavy oil field at Tsimiroro and ultra heavy oil field at Bemolanga.\\r\\n\\r\\nFollowing the 2002 political crisis, the government attempted to set a new course and build confidence, in coordination with international financial institutions and donors. Madagascar developed a recovery plan in collaboration with the private sector and donors and presented it at a \\"Friends of Madagascar\\" conference organized by the World Bank in Paris in July 2002.  Donor countries demonstrated their confidence in the new government by pledging $1 billion in assistance over five years. The Malagasy Government identified road infrastructure as its principle priority and underlined its commitment to public-private partnership by establishing a joint public-private sector steering committee.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Madagascar-U.S. Business Council was formed as a collaboration between the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) and Malagasian artisan producers in Madagascar in 2002.[17] The U.S.-Madagascar Business Council was formed in the United States in May 2003, and the two organisations continue to explore ways to work for the benefit of both groups.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe government of former President Marc Ravalomanana was aggressively seeking foreign investment and had planned to tackle many of the obstacles to such investment, including combating corruption, reforming land-ownership laws, encouraging study of American and European business techniques, and active pursuit of foreign investors. President Ravalomanana rose to prominence through his agro-foods TIKO company, and is known for attempting to apply many of the lessons learned in the world of business to running the government. Prior to Ravalomanana's resignation, concerns had arisen about the conflict of interest between his policies and the activities of his firms. Most notable among them the preferential treatment for rice imports initiated by the government in late 2004 when responding to a production shortfall in the country.\\r\\n\\r\\nMadagascars appeal to investors stems from its competitive, trainable work force. More than 200 investors, particularly garment manufacturers, were organized under the countrys export processing zone (EPZ) system since it was established in 1989. The absence of quota limits on textile imports to the European market under the Lome Convention helped stimulate this growth.\\r\\n\\r\\nGrowth in output in 1992ÿ97 averaged less than the growth rate of the population. Growth has been held back by a decline in world coffee demand, and the erratic commitment of the government to economic reform.[18][19]\\r\\nDuring a period of solid growth from 1997 to 2001, poverty levels remained stubbornly high, especially in rural areas. A six-month political crisis triggered by a dispute over the outcome of the presidential elections held in December 2001 virtually halted economic activity in much of the country in the first half of 2002. Real GDP dropped 12.7% in 2002, inflows of foreign investment dropped sharply, and the crisis tarnished Madagascar's budding reputation as an AGOA standout and a promising place to invest. After the crisis, the economy rebounded with GDP growth of over 10% in 2003. Currency depreciation and rising inflation in 2004 hampered economic performance, but growth for the year reached 5.3%, with inflation reaching around 25% at the end of the year. In 2005 inflation was brought under control by tight monetary policy of raising the Taux Directeur (central bank rate) to 16% and tightening reserve requirements for banks. Thus growth was expected to reach around 6.5% in 2005.\\r\\n\\r\\nDespite a wealth of abundant and diverse natural resources, Madagascar is one of the worlds poorest countries. Madagascar holds great potential for agricultural development, mainly due to the large variety of soil types and climatic diversity. Nevertheless, natural hazards (cyclones, drought, locust invasions) combined with old-fashioned farming practices limit production.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe standard of living of the Malagasy population has been declining dramatically over the past 25 years. The country has gone from being a net exporter of agricultural products in the 1960s to a net importer since 1971. Inappropriate traditional agricultural methods cause soil to erode and soil quality to decline, and the basis of survival for Madagascars people is under serious threat.[20]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2000, Madagascar embarked on the preparation of a Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) under the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative. The boards of the IMF and of the World Bank concurred in December 2000 that the country was eligible under the HIPC Initiative, and Madagascar reached the decision point for debt relief. On March 1, 2001, the IMF Board granted the country $103 million for 2001ÿ03 under the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGR). Resources were intended for improving access to health, education, rural roads, water, and direct support to communities. In addition, on March 7, 2001, the Paris Club approved a debt cancellation of $161 million. On February 28, 2001, the African Development Bank (ADB) approved under the HIPC a debt cancellation of $71.46 million and granted in June 2001 an additional credit of $20 million to fight against AIDS and poverty.\\r\\n\\r\\nPartly as a result of these credits but also as a result of previous reforms, average GDP growth exceeded the population growth rate of 2.8% in 1997 (3.5%), 1998 (3.9%), 1999 (4.7%) and 2000 (4.8%).\\r\\n\\r\\nIn October 2004, the boards of the IMF and the World Bank determined that Madagascar had reached the completion point under the enhanced HIPC Initiative.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe following table shows the main economic indicators in 1980ÿ2017.[21]\\r\\n\\r\\nHousehold income or consumption by percentage share:\\r\\nlowest 10%:\\r\\n2.3%\\r\\nhighest 10%:\\r\\n34.9% (1993)\\r\\n\\r\\nIndustrial production growth rate:\\r\\n5% (1999 est.)\\r\\n\\r\\nElectricity?ÿ production:\\r\\n1.35 billion kWh (2009 est.)\\r\\n\\r\\nElectricity?ÿ production by source:\\r\\nfossil fuel:\\r\\n69.5%\\r\\nhydro:\\r\\n30.5%\\r\\nnuclear:\\r\\n0%\\r\\nother:\\r\\n0% (2009)\\r\\n\\r\\nElectricity?ÿ consumption:\\r\\n1.256 billion kWh (2009 est.)\\r\\n\\r\\nElectricity?ÿ exports:\\r\\n0 kWh (2010)\\r\\n\\r\\nElectricity?ÿ imports:\\r\\n0 kWh (2010)\\r\\n\\r\\nExchange rates:\\r\\nMalagasy ariary (MGA) per US dollar -\\r\\n2,195 (2012 est.)\\r\\n2,025.1 (2011 est.)\\r\\n2,090 (2010 est.)\\r\\n1,956.2 (2009)\\r\\n1,654.78 (2008)\\r\\n\\r\\nThe population below the provety line is 50 percent","input":"What type of economic system does madagascar have?"},{"output":"Greater Miami, Florida","context":"Florida International University (FIU) is a metropolitan public research university in Greater Miami, Florida. FIU has two major campuses in Miami-Dade County, with its main campus in University Park.[4][5] Florida International University is classified as a research university with highest research activity by the Carnegie Foundation[6] and a research university by the Florida Legislature.[citation needed]\\r\\nFIU belongs to the 12-campus State University System of Florida and is one of Florida's primary graduate research universities, awarding over 3,400 graduate and professional degrees annually.[7] The university offers 191 programs of study with more than 280 majors in 23 colleges and schools. FIU offers many graduate programs, including architecture, business administration, engineering, law, and medicine, offering 81 master's degrees, 34 doctoral degrees, and 3 professional degrees.[8]\\r\\nFIU is the largest university in South Florida, the second-largest in Florida, and the fourth-largest in the United States by enrollment.[9][10] Total enrollment in Fall 2016 was 55,112 students, including 8,770 graduate students.[2] According to U.S. News college rankings and reviews, 92% of FIU students live off-campus while only 8% of students live in \\"college-owned, college-operated or college-affiliated\\" housing.[11]\\r\\nIt is home to the National Hurricane Center.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe story of Florida International University's founding began in 1943, when state Senator Ernest 'Cap' Graham (father of future Florida governor and U.S. senator Bob Graham) presented the state legislature with the initial proposal for the establishment of a public university in South Florida. While his bill did not pass, Graham persisted in presenting his proposal to colleagues, advising them of Miami's need for a state university. He felt the establishment of a public university was necessary to serve the city's growing population.[12]\\r\\nIn 1964, Senate Bill 711 was introduced by Florida Senator Robert M. Haverfield. It instructed the state Board of Education and the Board of Regents (BOR), to begin planning for the development of a state university in Miami. The bill was signed into law by then-governor W. Haydon Burns in June 1965, marking FIU's official founding.\\r\\nFIU's founding president Charles \\"Chuck\\" Perry was appointed by the Board of Regents in July 1969 after a nationwide search. At 32 years old, the new president was the youngest in the history of the State University System and, at the time, the youngest university president in the country. Perry recruited three co-founders, Butler Waugh, Donald McDowell and Nick Sileo. Alvah Chapman, Jr., former Miami Herald publisher and Knight Ridder chairman, used his civic standing and media power to assist the effort. In the 1980s, Chapman became chair of the FIU Foundation Board of Trustees.[12]\\r\\nThe founders located the campus on the site of the original Tamiami Airport (not related to the later Kendall-Tamiami Airport) on the Tamiami Trail (U.S. Route 41) between Southwest 107th and 117th Avenues, just east of where the West Dade Expressway (now the Homestead Extension of Florida's Turnpike) was being planned. The abandoned airport's air traffic control tower became FIU's first building. It originally had no telephones, no drinking water, and no furniture. Perry decided that the tower should never be destroyed, and it remains on campus, where it is now known variously as the \\"Veterans Office,\\" \\"Ivory Tower,\\" the \\"Tower Building,\\" or the \\"Public Safety Tower,\\" and is the former location of the FIU Police Department.\\r\\nIn September 1972, 5,667 students entered the new state university, the largest opening day enrollment at the time. Previously, Miami had been the largest city in the country lacking a public baccalaureate-granting institution. Eighty percent of the student body had just graduated from Dade County Junior College (now Miami-Dade College). A typical student entering FIU was 25 years old and attending school full-time while holding down a full-time job. Forty-three percent were married. Negotiations with the University of Miami and Dade County Junior College led FIU to open as an upper-division only school. It would be nine years before lower-division classes were added.[12]\\r\\nThe first commencement, held in June 1973, took place in the reading room of the ground floor of Primera Casa ÿ the only place large enough on campus for the ceremony. More than 1,500 family members and friends watched FIU's first class of 191 graduates receive their diplomas.[12]\\r\\nBy late 1975, after seven years at the helm, Charles Perry felt he had accomplished his goal and left the university to become president and publisher of the Sunday newspaper magazine Family Weekly (later USA Weekend), one of the country's largest magazines. When he left, there were more than 10,000 students attending classes and a campus with five major buildings and a sixth being planned.[12]\\r\\nHarold Crosby, the university's second president and the founding president of the University of West Florida in Pensacola, agreed in 1976 to serve a three-year \\"interim\\" term. Under his leadership, FIU's North Miami Campus (which was officially renamed the Bay Vista Campus in 1980, the North Miami Campus in 1987, the North Campus in 1994, and the Biscayne Bay Campus in 2000) ÿ located on the former Interama site on Biscayne Bay ÿ was opened in 1977. State Senator Jack Gordon was instrumental in securing funding for the development of the campus. President Crosby emphasized the university's international character, prompting the launching of new programs with an international focus and the recruitment of faculty from the Caribbean and Latin America. President Crosby's resignation in January 1979 triggered the search for a \\"permanent\\" president.[14]\\r\\nGregory Baker Wolfe, a former United States diplomat and then-president of Portland State University became FIU's third president, from 1979 to 1986. After stepping down as president, Wolfe taught in the university's international relations department. The student union on the Biscayne Bay Campus is named in his honor.[14]\\r\\nModesto A. Maidique assumed the presidency at FIU in 1986, becoming the fourth in the university's history. Maidique graduated with a Bachelor of Science, Master of Science, and PhD in Electrical Engineering from Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), before joining the private sector. He held academic appointments from MIT, Harvard and Stanford Universities, and has been named to several US Presidential boards and committees.[15]\\r\\nUnder his leadership, FIU heralded in an era of unprecedented growth and prestige with all facets of university undergoing major transformations. Physically, the university tripled in size and its enrollment grew to nearly 40,000. During his 23 years as president, the school established the Herbert Wertheim College of Medicine, the FIU College of Law, the FIU School of Architecture and the Robert Stempel School of Public Health. Also during his tenure, endowment grew from less than $2 million to over $100 million.[16]\\r\\nDuring Maidique's tenure, the university added 22 new doctoral programs. Research expenditures grew from about $6 million to nearly $110 million as defined by the National Science Foundation.[17] In 2000, FIU attained the highest ranking in the Carnegie Foundation classification system, that of \\"Doctoral/Research University-Extensive.\\"[18] FIU's faculty has engaged in research and holds far-reaching expertise in reducing morbidity and mortality from cancer, HIV/AIDS, substance abuse, diabetes and other diseases, and change the approaches to the delivery of health care by medical, public health, nursing and other healthcare professionals, hurricane mitigation, climate change, nano-technologies, forensic sciences, and the development of biomedical devices.\\r\\nThe arts also flourished while Maidique was at the helm, with the university acquiring The Wolfsonian-FIU Museum on Miami Beach and building the Patricia and Phillip Frost Art Museum on its main campus. In athletics, FIU made inroads in becoming a powerhouse athletic university during Maidique's time as president and he championed the eventual establishment of a NCAA football program. Finally, the school earned membership into Phi Beta Kappa, the nation's oldest honor society.[19]\\r\\nMaidique was the second longest-serving research university president in the nation.[17] Now President Emeritus, he currently serves as the Alvah H. Chapman, Jr., Eminent Scholar Chair in Leadership and Executive Director of the Center for Leadership and Professor of Management at FIU.\\r\\nOn November 14, 2008, Maidique announced that he would be stepping down and asked FIU's Board of Trustees to begin the search of a new president. He said he would remain president until a new one was found.[20] On April 25, 2009, Mark B. Rosenberg was selected to become FIU's fifth president. He signed a five-year contract with the Board of Trustees.[21] On August 29, 2009, Rosenberg became FIU's fifth president.[22]\\r\\nHaving started as a two-year upper division university serving the Miami area, FIU has grown into a much larger traditional university and serves international students. More than $600 million has been invested in campus construction, with the addition of new residence halls, the FIU Stadium, recreation center, student center, and Greek life mansions, as well as the fielding of the Division I-A Golden Panthers football team in 2002.[23]\\r\\nSince 1986, the university established its School of Architecture, College of Law and College of Medicine (named the Herbert Wertheim College of Medicine in 1999 after Herbert Wertheim donated $20 million to the college, which was matched by state funds and is the largest donation in the university's history),[24] and acquired the historic Wolfsonian-FIU Museum in Miami Beach.[25][26]\\r\\nFIU now emphasizes research as a major component of its mission and is now classed as a \\"very high research activity\\" university under the Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education. Sponsored research funding (grants and contracts) from external sources for the year 2007ÿ2008 totaled some $110 million. FIU has a budget of over $649 million[10]\\r\\nFIU's School of Hospitality & Tourism Management collaborated with China's Ministry of Education to work on preparations for the 2008 Summer Olympics. FIU was the only university in the United States invited to do so.[27][28] Royal Caribbean is building a $20 million 130,000 sq. ft. training facility for its performers at the school. It is scheduled to open in 2015. The buildings will serve architecture, art, and hospitality students including lighting, set design, marketing, and other internship and training opportunities.[29]\\r\\nOn October 2, 2014, it was announced that Florida International University would play host to the Miss Universe 2014 pageant on January 25, 2015.[30] FIU also hosted a talk from President Barack Obama in February 2015.\\r\\nOn March 15, 2018, a newly-constructed pedestrian bridge collapsed outside the university, resulting in several fatalities.[31]\\r\\nFor the 2015-2016 academic year, tuition costs are:\\r\\nIn 2008, 7% of FIU students were international students.

The Biscayne Bay Campus accounted for about 13% of the student population, mostly of lower-division undergraduates and students of the School of Hospitality & Tourism Management. Fall 2009, the average age for undergraduates was 23 and 31 for graduate students.[39][40]\\r\\nEnrollment for Fall 2014 consisted of 54,099 students, 45,359 undergraduates and 7,814 graduate students, including students enrolled in professional programs.[35] Women accounted for 56.2% of student enrollment and minorities made up 88% of total enrollment. Enrollment included students from all 50 U.S. states and more than 119 countries.[38][42] The most popular College by enrollment is the College of Arts and Sciences.[43] The freshman retention rate for 2009 was 83%. The fall 2011 incoming freshman class had an average 3.7 GPA, 1139 SAT score, and a 25 ACT score.[44]\\r\\nFor Fall 2014, 8,762 students applied for graduate admissions throughout the university. Of those, 43.2% were accepted.[41] The Wertheim College of Medicine admitted 4.6% of its applicants, and the College of Law admitted 19%.[45] Admission to the Wertheim College of Medicine is competitive, and the college has one of the highest number of applicants in the state, greater than the University of Florida. For Fall 2010, 3,606 students applied for 43 spots.[46]\\r\\nThe FIU School of Architecture is the most competitive in Florida, with the lowest admission rate in the state at 14% (2011).[47] For Fall 2009, the School of Architecture received over 1,000 applications for the first-year Master of Architecture program, with 60 being accepted, giving the School of Architecture a 6% admissions rate. The average high school GPA for the freshman class in the School of Architecture was 3.98, also making it one of the most selective schools at FIU.[48]\\r\\nFIU offers 191 academic programs, 60 baccalaureate programs, 81 master's programs, 3 specialist programs, 34 doctoral programs, and 4 professional program in 23 colleges and schools.

The FIU College of Law was also ranked 3rd amongst Florida schools for the scholarly impact of its faculty, behind University of Florida and Florida State University. According to the Leiter Rankings, the College of Law has already made a scholarly impact that dramatically outpaces its academic reputation.[75]\\r\\nFIU graduates have consistently performed well on the Florida Bar Exam. Graduates achieved the highest passage rate among all Florida law schools on the July 2015, February 2016, and July 2016 exams. In 2007, the College of Law was ranked 1st in Florida in the Multistate Professional Responsibility Exam at 96%.[77][78][79] In July 2008, the College of Law achieved a 90.6% passing rate, which placed it 2nd among Florida's ten law schools.[77] In February 2009, the College of Law achieved an 81.5% passing rate, which placed it 1st among Florida's ten law schools.[79]\\r\\nThe FIU Model United Nations Program is one of FIU's premier academic programs. FIU MUN is a program of the School of International and Public Affairs and is housed within the Jack D. Gordon Institute for Public Policy and Citizenship Studies. Each year between 24 and 32 delegates participate in FIU MUN. The acceptance rate for new delegates is usually between 8 and 10 percent. FIU MUN is currently ranked as the 2nd best Model UN Team in North America and is the top ranked team in the State of Florida.[80]\\r\\nFIU MUN also hosts an annual high school conference: Florida International Model United Nations (FIMUN). The conference traditionally hosts over 400 high school students from 20, or more, high schools from Miami-Dade, Broward, and Palm Beach Counties.\\r\\nThe Journal of Criminal Justice ranks the Criminal Justice program 10th in the U.S. (November 2007).[81]\\r\\nFaculty of the PhD program in social welfare rank 4th in the United States in their scholarly accomplishment, according to Academic Analytics. FIU faculty were the only social work faculty in Florida to rank in the Top 10 (December 2007).[82]\\r\\nFlorida International University has two major campuses in Miami, the main campus, University Park and its regional campus, the Biscayne Bay Campus, as well as several branch campuses and research facilities throughout South Florida, in Tianjin, China, and in Nervi and Genoa, Italy.[25]\\r\\nThe main campus, University Park, renamed Modesto Maidique Campus in 2009,[83] encompasses 344?acres (1.4?km2) in the Miami neighborhood of University Park, (from which the area derives its name).\\r\\nUniversity Park houses almost all of the university's colleges and schools as well as all the administrative offices and main university facilities. University Park is also home to the Ronald Reagan Presidential House, the home of FIU's president, the Wertheim Performing Arts Center, the Frost Art Museum, the International Hurricane Research Center, and the university's athletic facilities such as FIU Stadium, FIU Arena, and the FIU Baseball Stadium.\\r\\nLocated five blocks north of University Park, is the 38-acre (145,000?m2) Engineering Center which houses a part of the College of Engineering and Computing and is the home of FIU's Motorola Nanofabrication Research Facility. The Engineering Center is serviced by the CATS Shuttle, FIU's student buses, which run throughout the day on weekdays connecting the two parts of campus.[84]\\r\\nThe site of the campus was originally used for a general aviation airport called Tamiami Airport (not to be confused with Kendall-Tamiami Airport), which was in operation from the 1940s until 1967. The airport had three runways and was used for pilot training, among other purposes.[85] Construction on the FIU campus began in 1965, and the airport closed in 1969. At the time, very little was located around FIU, and the campus was called University Park. As Miami grew west, the area came to be known as University Park after the university's campus name.\\r\\nUntil the early 1990s, the runways, parking ramp and other features of Tamiami Airport were still visible on campus and clearly discernible in aerial photos.[85] Construction has removed all of these features, and only the University Tower remains as a memory of the university's past.[86] University Park is a lush, heavily vegetated campus, with many lakes and a 15-acre nature preserve, as well as a palm arboretum and has over 90 buildings. As of late 2009, current construction at University Park includes the Nursing and Health Sciences Building, the School of International and Public Affairs Building, and a fifth parking garage.[87]\\r\\nOn June 12, 2009, FIU's Board of Trustees voted unanimously to rename the University Park campus to the Modesto Maidique Campus. However, the change created a large backlash from the FIU community, as many felt it unfitting to name the campus after him. A campaign by FIU students and alumni was created to revert the name change, and to keep the name University Park. A Facebook group, \\"No to Maidique's Campus\\" with over 2,000 supporters has made national news, in many newspapers, TV news stations, and collegiate magazines, supporting to keep the name \\"University Park\\".[88]\\r\\nThe Biscayne Bay Campus in North Miami is FIU's second-largest campus. It was opened in 1977 by Harold Crosby and occupies about 200?acres (809,000?m2), directly on the bay and adjacent to the Oleta River State Park, with which FIU has a research partnership. Access to these resources inspired the creation of a marine biology program on the Biscayne Bay Campus, which has become one of the university's most recognized programs. The Biscayne Bay Campus also houses the School of Hospitality & Tourism Management,[90] the School of Journalism and Mass Communication, the Aquatic Center, and the Kovens Conference Center. The Golden Panther Express, FIU's student buses, connect the main campus and the Biscayne Bay Campus throughout the day on weekdays.[91]\\r\\nAfter closing Bay Visa Housing to students and long-term leasing the facility to RCL for employee training, FIU is developing BayView Student Housing on the BBC campus. BBC's first on-campus new housing in 30+ years will house 408 students in a high rise overlooking Biscayne Bay.[92]\\r\\nFIU also has other smaller regional centers located throughout South Florida in both Miami-Dade County and Broward County, serving the local communities in research, continuing studies, and in culture. In Broward County, there is the FIU Pines Center in Pembroke Pines, opened to satisfy the demand from Broward County residents. This center serves mostly night students in programs within the College of Business Administration. In Miami-Dade County, there are four regional FIU facilities, the Downtown Miami Center, the Wolfsonian-FIU Museum in Miami Beach (Washington Avenue and 10th St), the FIU-Florida Memorial research center in Miami Gardens, and a research site in Homestead.\\r\\nFIU has a center on Brickell Avenue in Downtown Miami at 1101 Brickell Avenue dubbed \\"FIU Downtown on Brickell\\". FIU's College of Business Administration has had classes at the Burdines Building on Flagler Street and the Metropolitan Center had offices at 150 SE 2nd Ave since 2004. In August 2011, FIU expanded its Downtown center to 1101 Brickell with the expansion of course offerings for the College of Business Administration and the School of International and Public Affairs, as well as with FIU's research center, the Metropolitan Center. Most programs in Downtown are graduate-level evening courses geared for Downtown professionals and residents.[93] As of Spring 2011, there were approximately 500 students enrolled at the Downtown center, with plans to grow the center to over 2,000 students by 2021.[94]\\r\\nFIU also has international campuses in Asia and Europe. The Wolfsonian-FIU Museum has a regional facility in Nervi, Italy, the School of Architecture has facilities in Genoa, Italy for FIU's upper-division and graduate Architecture students, and the Florida International University Tianjin Center in China, from which a branch of the School of Hospitality & Tourism Management operates. The Tianjin Center was constructed as a cooperative venture with the local municipal government and was opened in the Summer of 2006.[28] FIU has also exchanged agreements with the American University in Dubai so that FIU students can now take a semester abroad in Dubai.[95]\\r\\nFIU students can also study abroad in Paris, France via MICEFA.[96]\\r\\nFlorida International University's student housing facilities are managed by the Office of Housing and Residential Life and are available on both the main campus and the Biscayne Bay Campus. Currently, there are 3,009 beds distributed throughout 10 apartment buildings and 6 residence halls. At University Park, these are the University Park Apartments, Panther Hall, the University Park Towers, Everglades Hall, Lakeview Hall North, and Lakeview Hall South. On the Biscayne Bay Campus, after closing Bay Visa Housing to students and long-term leasing the facility to RCL for employee training, FIU is developing BayView Student Housing on the BBC campus. BBC's first on-campus new housing in 30+ years will house 408 students in a high rise overlooking Biscayne Bay.[25][99] Together, approximately 7% of FIU's student population lives on-campus in student housing (not including Greek housing).\\r\\nThe Office of Housing and Residential Life also offers optional communities in the residence halls. These communities include the Architecture and Arts Community, for students majoring in Architecture or art-related majors, Honors Place for Honors College students, F.Y.R.S.T. (First Year Residents Succeeding Together) for all freshmen in any major, F.Y.R.S.T. Explore, for undecided freshmen, Leader's in Residence for students interested in civic service and leadership opportunities and the Law Community for College of Law students.[100]\\r\\nAs of 2011, plans are underway for two new residence halls for 1,240 students, called Parkview Hall to be built on the Panther Hall parking lot, north of FIU Stadium. Parkview Hall will be built in two phases in two separate buildings, each housing 620 and 600 students respectively, to be completed by Fall 2013 and Fall 2016.[101]\\r\\nFIU has six libraries, Green Library, FIU's main library; the Glenn Hubert Library (Biscayne Bay Campus), the Wolfsonian Library, the Engineering Library, the Law Library, and the Medical Library. The Green Library, Hubert Library, and Engineering Library Service Center are under the direction of the Dean of University Libraries. Other libraries are overseen by their appropriate schools or organizations.\\r\\nThe Green Library is FIU's main library, is the largest building on campus, and one of the largest library buildings in the Southeastern United States.[102] Originally designed by Architect David M. Harper in 1973,[103] the Green Library was expanded by the architecture firm M. C. Harry & Associates, Inc. in the early 1990s to its current eight floors, with a capacity to expand to a total of 15 floors, if necessary. The eight-floor structure was built over, through, and around the original three-story library while it was still in use.[104]\\r\\nThe first floor has numerous classrooms, auditorium spaces, and support services for students, such as tutoring, the writing center, and technology assistance. Also on the first floor is a snack stop and a Starbucks.[105] The second floor has the reference section, cartography (GIS Center), circulation, and numerous computer and printing labs. The third floor is the home of the Medical Library, and includes study lounges as well as a resource center for students of the Honors College. The fourth floor houses the special collections department and university archives. The fifth floor is the home of the School of Architecture Library, as well as the music and audiovisual collections. The sixth and seventh floors are strictly quiet floors, and contain the general book collection plus numerous student study lounges. The eighth floor contains the library's administration offices and technical services departments.[106][107]\\r\\nThe Engineering Library is located on the second floor of the main building of the Engineering Center.[108]\\r\\nThe Law Library opened in 2002, and has three floors, with all three holding the library's general collection. The third floor has a two-story, quiet reading room, as well as numerous study lounges. Although the Law Library is restricted to Law students, other students may use the library for research purposes.[109]\\r\\nThe FIU Medical Library opened in August 2009 at the same time as the opening of the Herbert Wertheim College of Medicine. The Medical Library offers a rich array of resources, services, and instructional support to advance the teaching and learning, discovery, and healthcare programs of the Herbert Wertheim College of Medicine and is currently located on the third floor of Green Library building. Future construction of buildings for the College of Medicine will include a new space for the Medical Library outside of Green Library, based upon funding and space availability.[110]\\r\\nThe Glenn Hubert Library, previously named the 'Biscayne Bay Library', is the library for the Biscayne Bay Campus. Although a smaller structure, three stories, the Hubert Library is nonetheless important to the research and information needs of the BBC Campus students and faculty. All services at the Green Library are available in the Hubert Library.\\r\\nThe Wolfsonian Library is located at the Wolfsonian-FIU Museum in South Beach, on the corner of Washington Avenue and 10th Street.[111] The collection focuses exclusively on architecture, art, design, and history of the Western World from 1885 to 1945. The library serves mostly as a research library with an extensive collection of primary sources. For students, prior approval from the staff is needed to enter the library.\\r\\nTogether, the entire FIU university-wide Library holdings include over 2,097,207 volumes, 52,511 current serials, 3,587,663 microform units, and 163,715 audio visual units.[112]\\r\\nThe International Hurricane Research Center (IHRC) is the nation's only university-based research facility dedicated to mitigating the damage tropical storms inflict on people, the economy, and the environment. The IHRC is home to four institutes: the Laboratory for Coastal Research; the Laboratory for Social Science Research; the Laboratory for Insurance, Financial & Economic Research; and the Laboratory for Wind Engineering Research, as well as the FIU Wall of Wind.[113] The 12-fan Wall of Wind (WOW) at FIU is the largest and most powerful university research facility of its kind and is capable of simulating a Category 5 hurricane ÿ the highest rating on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale. In 2015 the National Science Foundation selected the 12-fan WOW as one of the nation's major \\"Experimental Facilities\\" under the Natural Hazards Engineering Research Infrastructure (NHERI) competition.[114] Not to be confused with the National Hurricane Center (also located at University Park), the IHRC is located on the western side of the campus.\\r\\nIn the early 2000s (decade), emphasis at FIU was placed on growth in degree programs and student enrollment. Since 2005 however, student enrollment has been capped and emphasis is now being placed on improving the quality of the existing academic programs. With the addition of the College of Medicine, the demand for facilities and classroom space has greatly increased.[115] Future projects and/or buildings under construction include:\\r\\nThe main campus is located on the south side of the Tamiami Trail (U.S. Route 41/SW 8th Street) between SW 107th and SW 117th Avenue next to Florida's Turnpike and near the western terminus of the Dolphin Expressway.\\r\\nMiami-Dade Transit serves University Park with Metrobus lines 8, 11, 24, and 71. Metrobus lines 75 and 135 serve the Biscayne Bay Campus.[116] Bus lines 8, 11 and the 24 directly connect FIU with Downtown Miami.\\r\\nTwo distinct FIU-operated bus lines are available. The CATS Shuttle runs between University Park and the Engineering Center, and the Golden Panther Express, from University Park to the Biscayne Bay Campus.\\r\\nThe CATS Shuttle connects University Park from the Graham Center bus stop and the Engineering and Computer Sciences Building, to the Engineering Center on Flagler Street and 107th Avenue. The CATS Shuttle is free and runs roughly every 15 minutes between 6?a.m. to 11?p.m. Monday through Friday. The Golden Panther Express connects the Biscayne Bay Campus to University Park. It runs from 6?a.m. to 11?p.m. Monday through Friday, and costs $2.50 each way. The Golden Panther Express departs from the Graham Center bus stop at the main campus, and the Academic 1 bus stop at the Biscayne Bay Campus.[117]\\r\\nThere has long been plans for Metrorail, the local heavy rail rapid transit system to be extended west, with two proposed lines terminating at Florida International University's main campus.[118][119] This would ease traffic and parking problems at and around the main campus.\\r\\nFIU has over 30 fraternities and sororities divided into four governing councils: the Interfraternity Council (IFC), the Panhellenic Council (PC), the National Pan-Hellenic Council (NPHC), and the Multicultural Greek Council (MGC). The Order of Omega, a Greek honor society, has had a chapter at the university since 1991 and represents the academic top 3% of FIU Greeks.[120]\\r\\nThe Interfraternity Council (IFC) comprises 13 fraternities. The Panhellenic Council (PC) is made up of 7 sororities. The National Pan-Hellenic Council (NPHC) comprises 6 historically black organizations, (4 fraternities and 2 sororities). The Multicultural Greek Council (MGC) consists of 9 cultural organizations for Latinos, Asians, and South Asians, (5 fraternities and 4 sororities).[121][122][123]\\r\\nFIUSM is the umbrella organization for The Beacon, the student-run newspaper; FIUSM.com, the student-run news and media website; and WRGP Radiate FM, the student-run radio station. Each organization's directors are selected by the Student Media board on a yearly basis.\\r\\nThe Beacon is the FIU student newspaper since 1965. The Beacon is published thrice weekly in a compact format during the Fall and Spring semesters (Monday, Wednesday and Friday) and once a week on Wednesday during the Summer.The Beacon is available free campus-wide in the residence halls, the Graham Center and all campus buildings.[124]\\r\\nFIUSM.com is the FIU student-run media website since 2008. FIUSM.com publishes content generated by the Student Media team, including text, audio, and video.[125]\\r\\nWRGP Radiate FM is FIU's student-run radio station since 1984.[126] It broadcasts on 95.3?MHz at the University Park Campus and on 96.9?MHz at the Biscayne Bay Campus. The signal originates in Homestead on 88.1?MHz and a broadcast translator rebroadcasts WRGP's signal to the University Park Campus and later again translated to the Biscayne Bay Campus.[127]\\r\\nFIU has three museums, the Frost Art Museum, the Wolfsonian-FIU Museum and the Jewish Museum of Florida. The Frost Art Museum is located on Modesto A. Maidique campus and was opened in 1977 as The Art Museum at Florida International University. The Frost Art Museum's Permanent Collection consists of a broad array of art objects from ancient cultural artifacts to contemporary works of art.[128] The Wolfsonian-FIU Museum is located in Miami Beach and promotes the collection, preservation and understanding of decorative art and design from the period from 1885 to 1945.[129][130] FIU also has a large sculpture collection, named the Sculpture Park at FIU, with sculptures from such prominent artists as Anthony Caro, Jacques Lipchitz, Daniel Joseph Martinez, and Tony Rosenthal.[131] Many different art structures, statues, paintings and mosaics can be seen throughout campus in gardens, buildings, walkways, and on walls.[132]\\r\\nThe School of Music presents an annual series of concerts that showcase talent in a variety of genres. School of Music at FIU offers a dynamic learning environment for informed, creative musicians. Students are fully involved in their chosen fields, where they can recognize clearly what they need to learn in order to become contributors to those fields. FIU's School of Music embraces an evolving world for its possibilities and the new opportunities and challenges that it affords, while providing the tools necessary to empower young musicians in their quest to carve out careers. FIU School of Music's concert season incorporates music of all styles including jazz, early music, chamber music, choral/vocal, contemporary music, wind, and opera theater performed by world class musicians and ensembles. Many masterclasses and lectures are also open to the public and offered at no charge. The season runs from August through April each year.\\r\\nThe Department Theatre presents a season of four professionally designed, produced and directed productions each year that serve as a laboratory for students to put their learning into practice. This Main Stage season is presented at the Herbert and Nicole Wertheim Performing Arts Center. In addition to Main Stage productions students write, direct and perform productions in the Student Theatre Lab Studio, the annual New Plays Festival, and the summer Alternative Theatre Festival. The summer Alternative Theatre Festival includes a development project of a new work by an established playwright, a faculty directed piece, one student directed piece, and may include Alumni showcase and reunion productions.\\r\\nFIU annually hosts the Food Network South Beach Wine & Food Festival in South Beach through the School of Hospitality & Tourism Management, a major national culinary event.[133]\\r\\nThe Student Government Association presides over and funds the over 300 student clubs and organizations and honor societies at the university and has an operating budget of over $14?million.[134] The Student Government Association is split into three branches, with the Executive, a Legislative Student Senate, and Judicial Supreme Court. Due to the unique nature of a multi-campus university, the President of Modesto Maidique Campus (University Park) serves as the Student Representative on the University's Board of Trustees, while the President for the Biscayne Bay Campus serves as a member of the Foundation Board.\\r\\nThe Student Government contains five separate governing councils- the Student Programming Council, the Council for Student Organizations, which represents the over 200 or more student clubs and organizations, the Homecoming Council, Black Student Union, and Panther Power, the student spirit group.[135] The Panther Power group can be seen in all Golden Panthers athletic events along with the Golden Panthers Band, the Golden Dazzlers dance team and the Golden Panthers cheerleaders.[136] In 2004, MTV's Campus Invasion Tour was held at FIU, bringing numerous bands such as Hoobastank to FIU.[137]\\r\\nThe Order of the Torch is a semi-secret honorary leadership society akin to other secret societies in the state such as Florida Blue Key at the University of Florida, and the Iron Arrow Honor Society at the University of Miami. The organization is rumored to have been founded in 2003 as a way of organizing student leadership to restructure student life to mirror that of a traditional university. Members now include students, faculty, staff and community members, including FIU alumni Miami-Dade County Mayor Carlos Alvarez (class of 1974). Top leadership in Student Government, Homecoming, and the most elite campus fraternal organizations, rank among its members.\\r\\nFIU has many traditions from student spirit groups, alumni association events and student spirit events. Panther Rage, one of FIU's largest student spirit groups are seen at all the athletics events.[138]\\r\\nFIU also holds many Golden Panther spirit events throughout the year. Some of these include, Panther Camp held in the Summer prior to the Fall term for incoming freshmen, where students spend a weekend in a retreat center learning all the traditional Golden Panther cheers, chants, traditions meeting other incoming students. Started in 2006, Panther Camp has grown quickly in popularity from only 25 participants in 2006 to over 120 participants in 2007. In 2008, Panther Camp expanded to two camps with a combined total of 240 freshman participants.[139] Panther Camp is expected to grow in size for Summer 2010, as the waiting list has continued to double from year to year. Freshmen who participate are more likely to get involved in Student Life than other students.[140]\\r\\nWeek of Welcome, usually held the first or second week of the Fall semester holds many spirit events, such as Trail of the Torch. Trail of the Torch is another university tradition that has continued to grow annually, where a pep rally is held in the Housing Quad with music, food, giveaways and dancing. After the pep rally, the torch of knowledge is lit and blue and gold candles are distributed to the crowd for the procession around the campus, trailing the torch from the Housing Quad to the torch in front of the Primera Casa building. Rage Week and Homecoming Week are other major back-to-back spirit weeks held in the Fall semester. They include the Homecoming Parade, Greek Row parties, Homecoming football game, Blue/Gold Party, pep rallies and other Panther Rage events.[141]\\r\\nFlorida International University has seventeen varsity sports teams, named the Panthers. The Panthers' athletic colors are blue and gold, and compete in the NCAA Division I as part of Conference USA in all sports. Three main sports facilities serve as home venues for Panther athletics. The Panthers football team plays at FIU Stadium (\\"The Cage\\"), the men and women's basketball and volleyball teams play at the FIU Arena, and the men's baseball team plays at FIU Baseball Stadium. Other athletics venues include the Aquatic Center, Tennis Complex, softball fields, and various other recreational fields.[142] FIU Arena underwent expansion to add more seating and a modernization of the exterior that was completed in late 2011. On July 1, 2013, FIU became a member of Conference USA.\\r\\nTraditional rivals of the FIU Panthers include Florida Atlantic University and the University of Miami. The Panthers football team competes in the annual Shula Bowl, a yearly football game played for the Don Shula Award against in-state rival Florida Atlantic University. Due to this competition in the Shula Bowl, the rivalry between the two schools has grown, with the rivalry extending into the men's baseball and basketball teams as well.[143]\\r\\nThe Panthers football team plays home games at Riccardo Silva Stadium nicknamed \\"The Cage\\" and are currently coached by Butch Davis. In 2005, the Panthers moved to the Sun Belt Conference, making their transition from Division I-FCS to Division I-FBS complete. In their first season in the conference, the Panthers began by finishing 5ÿ6.[144] FIU's athletics department has produced many professional and Olympic athletes, including current players in Major League Baseball, Major League Soccer, National Basketball Association, National Football League and the Women's National Basketball Association. Notable alumni include Mike Lowell (Boston Red Sox), Raja Bell (Utah Jazz), and Carlos Arroyo (Boston Celtics).\\r\\nDuring his pro career in the 1970s, NFL offensive lineman Ed Newman worked as an assistant coach of the Florida International University wrestling team in the off-season.[145]\\r\\nIn 2009, FIU hired NBA Hall of Famer Isiah Thomas as head coach of the men's basketball team.[146][147]\\r\\nIn 2010, the Panthers football team finished the season #1 as Sun Belt Conference champions, and went on to the Little Caesars Pizza Bowl against Toledo on December 26, 2010.

The park covers a 35-mile-long (56?km) stretch of Lake Michigan's eastern coastline, as well as North and South Manitou islands. This Northern Michigan park was established primarily because of its outstanding natural features, including forests, beaches, dune formations, and ancient glacial phenomena. The lakeshore also contains many cultural features including the 1871 South Manitou Island Lighthouse, three former stations of the Coast Guard (formerly the Life-Saving Service) and an extensive rural historic farm district. In 2011, the area won the title of \\"The Most Beautiful Place in America\\" from Good Morning America.[3] In 2014, a section of the park was named the Sleeping Bear Dunes Wilderness by the United States Congress.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe park was authorized on October 21, 1970. The park's creation was highly controversial because it involved the transfer of private property to public. The federal government's stance at the time was that the Great Lakes were the \\"third coast\\" and had to be preserved much like Cape Hatteras or Big Sur, which are National Seashores. The residents living in what is now Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lake shore believed they were stewards of the land and did not want it to be overrun by tourists. The government eventually won out in part by supporting the local schools to offset the lost property tax revenue and by adding North Manitou Island to be included in the park.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe park is named after an Ojibwe legend of the sleeping bear. According to the legend, an enormous forest fire on the western shore of Lake Michigan drove a mother bear and her two cubs into the lake for shelter, determined to reach the opposite shore. After many miles of swimming, the two cubs lagged behind. When the mother bear reached the shore, she waited on the top of a high bluff. The exhausted cubs drowned in the lake, but the mother bear stayed and waited in hopes that her cubs would finally appear. Impressed by the mother bear's determination and faith, the Great Spirit created two islands (North and South Manitou islands) to commemorate the cubs, and the winds buried the sleeping bear under the sands of the dunes where she waits to this day.[5] The \\"bear\\" was a small tree-covered knoll at the top edge of the bluff that, from the water, had the appearance of a sleeping bear. Wind and erosion have caused the \\"bear\\" to be greatly reduced in size over the years.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2014, 32,500 acres (13,200?ha; 50.8?sq?mi) of the park were formally designated as the Sleeping Bear Dunes Wilderness by the Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore Conservation and Recreation Act. This was the first wilderness protection bill to be passed by the United States Congress in five years.[6][7]\\r\\n\\r\\nGlen Haven existed as a company town from 1865 to 1931. Originally a dock for Glen Arbor (1855-date), the site soon became a fuel supply point for ships traveling up and down the lake. Here, Charles McCarty decided to open his own business and built a dock to supply the ships with wood. In 1863, McCarty built the Sleeping Bear House. It was expanded a few years later to accommodate travelers. In 1928, it was remodeled into the inn for summer vacationers. The General Store was established to supply the workers. Like most company towns, the workers were paid in company coupons, redeemable only at the company store. The Blacksmith Shop is where tools were repaired. In 1878, David Henry Day arrived in the community. By this time, coal from the Appalachian coal fields was replacing wood on the steamships. Day was looking for another future to this small community.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1860, Port Oneida had a population of 87?people. Thomas Kelderhouse had built a dock to sell wood to the passing steamships. He was also able to sell fresh produce and maple sugar in season. A local story says that the name comes from the first ship to stop, the SS Oneida of New York State. The area covers 3,000 acres (12?km2) and includes 16 historic farms. The farming community was gradually abandoned due to hard farming conditions and declining timber sales.\\r\\n[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nSleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore is one of Michigan's most popular destinations for camping vacations, possibly the most popular.[11] This popularity may be due to the fact it was named the \\"Most Beautiful Place in America\\" by Good Morning America in 2011.[3] There are a few campgrounds in the national lakeshore and they are grouped into D.H. Day Campground, Platte River Campground, a few camping areas on the Manitou Islands within, and some other sites for backcountry or group camping.\\r\\n\\r\\nD.H. Day Campground is part of Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore and offers a moderate level of privacy and a beach on Lake Michigan. Campsites are rustic, wooded, and more far apart than campsites at most campgrounds. Nearby points of interest include Empire Bluffs, the \\"dune climb\\", and North Bar Lake. It is extremely popular and does not accept reservations; all sites are \\"first-come, first-served.\\" Because of the campground's popularity it's recommended that campers arrive early to obtain a first-come, first-served campsite during summer months. Campsites 1-31 allow the use of a generator, the remaining sites forbid generator use.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nPlatte River Campground is part of Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore and offers a variety of campsites, some of which are reservable and some of which are set aside as first-come first-served. Some campsites are modern (with electrical hookups), some are \\"hike-in,\\" and others are more rustic. Nearby points of interest include Platte River Point, the Platte River, and Big Platte Lake. The north section of Sleeping Bear Dunes National Park is a short drive from Platte River Campground. Kayaking is a popular activity at the campground, especially the kayak trail leading from the campground to Platte River Point[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nSleeping Bear Dunes also has three main campgrounds on South Manitou Island, including the Weather Station Campground located on the south side of the island,[14] the Bay Campground on the west shore of the island[15] and the Popple Campground on the north shore.[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn addition to federal campgrounds within the national lakeshore itself, there are many other camping areas nearby, which cater to the large number of tourists visiting Sleeping Bear Dunes each year. There are at least 20?distinct camping areas in the region immediately surrounding Sleeping Bear Dunes.[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nLooking south from Sleeping Bear Dunes toward Empire Bluffs and the southern portion of the National Lakeshore in Benzie County\\r\\n\\r\\nHistoric D.H.

The 25 least populous states contain less than one-sixth of the total population. California, the most populous state, contains more people than the 21 least populous states combined, and Wyoming is the least populous state, with a population less than 31 most populous U.S. cities.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe United States Census counts most persons residing in the United States including citizens, non-citizen permanent residents, and non-citizen long-term visitors.[1] Civilian and military federal employees serving abroad and their dependents are counted in their home state.[2]\\r\\nBased on data from the decennial census, each state is allocated a proportion of the 435 seats in the United States House of Representatives, although each state is guaranteed a minimum of one seat, regardless of population. This apportionment is based on the proportion of each state's population to that of the Fifty States together (without regard to the populations of the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico or other U.S. dependencies). The Electoral College is the body that, every four years, elects the President and Vice President of the United States. Each state's representation in the Electoral College is equal to that state's total number of members in both houses of the United States Congress. The Twenty-third Amendment to the United States Constitution effectively grants the District of Columbia, which is separate from any state, three votes. More precisely, the district gets as many votes in the Electoral College as it would have if it were a state, with the caveat that the district can have no more votes than the least populous state (which is currently Wyoming). Currently, this caveat is a moot point since the District would only be entitled to one Representative if it were a state, and is more populous than only two of the seven states with a single member in the House since 2013. Since the Constitution guarantees every state at least one Representative and guarantees every state two Senators, it effectively guarantees every state (and, since the ratification of the 23rd Amendment, the District of Columbia) at least three electoral votes. Thus, the total representation in the College is 538 members (equal to 100 senators plus 435 representatives, plus 3 members for the District of Columbia).[3]","input":"What is the least populated state in the union?"},{"output":"the 1820s","context":"","input":"When were residential schools first established in canada?"},{"output":"Headline News","context":"HLN (Headline News) is an American pay television news channel that is owned by CNN. Originally branded as CNN2, and later CNN Headline News, the channel was originally structured to broadcast a tightly-formatted 30-minute newswheel 24 hours a day, with freshly updated information that briefly covered various areas of interest (such as national news, sports, entertainment, weather and business). Since 2005, however, its format has increasingly shifted to long-form tabloid-, opinion-, crime-, and entertainment news-related programming. In 2014, the network further re-focused with an emphasis on social media, but this practice was dropped by 2016 in favor of focusing more towards traditional news programming, with the remainder of its lineup dedicated to true crime programming (drawing heavily from the archives of defunct sister network Court TV).\\r\\n\\r\\nAs of July 2015, HLN is available to approximately 97 million American households (83.4% of households with at least one television set) in the United States making it the most distributed American subscription network.[1] Since the mid-2000s, HLN has been available internationally on pay television providers in parts of Asia, the Caribbean, Latin America, Middle East, North Africa and in Canada.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe channel was launched at midnight Eastern Time on January 1, 1982, as CNN2. The channel's launch was simulcast nationwide on sister networks CNN and Superstation WTBS (now simply TBS), starting at 11:45?p.m. on December 31, 1981, as a preview for cable providers that had not yet reached agreements to carry CNN2. Following a preview reel by original CNN anchor Lou Waters and an introduction by founder and then-Turner Broadcasting CEO Ted Turner, Chuck Roberts (who would become the channel's longest-serving news anchor, with a 28-year career with CNN2/Headline News that lasted until his retirement on July 30, 2010)[2] and Denise LeClair ÿ anchored the channel's first newscast.[3][4]\\r\\n\\r\\nOriginally, the channel's programming was formatted around the idea that a viewer could tune in at any time of day or night (instead of having to wait for the merely once- or twice-daily national news segments in local newscasts, or morning or evening network news programs), and receive up-to-date information on the top national and international stories in just 30 minutes. This \\"Headline News Wheel\\" format featured: :00 - national and world news; :15 - business and personal finance reports (\\"Dollars and Sense\\"); :20 - sports scores and headlines (\\"Headline Sports\\"); and :25 - lifestyle reports (from :30, this news wheel was repeated all over again). The :25/:55 lifestyle segment was designed to allow local cable systems the option of pre-empting it with a local headline \\"capsule\\" from an associated regional cable news channel or a local television station. Another regular feature, the \\"Hollywood Minute\\", was often fitted-in after the \\"Headline Sports\\" segment. In the channel's early years, a two-minute recap of the hour's top stories, the \\"CNN Headlines,\\" would run after the sports segment.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn January of the following year, it was renamed Headline News. From around that point until 1992, the channel was often abbreviated as \\"HN\\" (the channel would later incorporate a die-cut \\"HN\\" block design within the original variant of its third logo when it was introduced in 1989, before it was fully supplanted by the wordmark that accompanied it in 1992, which was later italicized). During its first year, Headline News had a competitor in the form of ABC/Group W's Satellite News Channel, which operated from June 21, 1982 to October 27, 1983. SNC's satellite slot was then purchased by Ted Turner to expand Headline News' reach further into additional homes.\\r\\n\\r\\nJon Petrovich was hired in the mid-1980s by Turner to lead Headline News.[5] In 1990, Headline News developed Local Edition, a six-minute-long local newscast, whose content was produced by a local broadcast station in the participating market, airing at the end of each half-hour of Headline News' rolling news block.[6] The channel included the \\"CNN\\" branding in its name intermittently for most of its history, before being incorporated on a regular basis from 1997 to 2007 (though an alternate logo without the CNN logo was used for news broadcasts through 2001).\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1989, Headline News introduced a ticker that appeared at the lower one-third of the screen ÿ except during commercial breaks, which initially showed stock market data with indexes of the major stock exchanges (including the Dow Jones Industrial Average, NASDAQ and the S&P 500) and quotes for major companies during trading hours, which were updated on a 15-minute delay. In 1992, the channel added the \\"Headline News SportsTicker\\", which showed sports scores and schedules for the day's upcoming games, creating the first continuous news ticker on television. The redesign resulted in video of the rolling newscasts becoming pillarboxed with blue bars on the left and right wings of the screen (matching the ticker's original coloring), before it returned to a full-screen format, with the ticker becoming a translucent black background overlaid on the lower third of the video, as part of a 1994 update to the channel's graphics package that also added weather forecasts for select major U.S. cities to the ticker; the ticker itself would add the Headline News logo, and as such, would no longer be seen alongside the copyright date in the closing.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn January 8, 1992, Headline News almost became the victim of a hoax. When President George H. W. Bush fainted at a state dinner in Tokyo, Japan, a person claiming to be the president's physician called into the channel's Atlanta headquarters and claimed that Bush had died. At 9:45?a.m., anchor Don Harrison prepared to break the story, stating \\"This just in to CNN Headline News, and we say right off the bat, we have not confirmed this through any other sources...\\" Executive producer Roger Bahre, who was off-camera, immediately yelled \\"No! Stop!\\"[7] After glancing away momentarily, Harrison continued, \\"We are now getting a correction. We will not give you that story. It was regarding some rather tragic news involving President Bush, but updating that story, President Bush is reported to be resting comfortably.\\" It turned out that an Idaho man, James Edward Smith, called CNN posing as the president's physician. A CNN employee entered the information into a centralized computer used by both CNN and Headline News, and it nearly got out on the air before it could be verified. Smith was subsequently questioned by the Secret Service and hospitalized at a private medical facility for evaluation.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1992, Headline News pioneered the use of a digital video \\"jukebox\\" to recycle segments of one newscast seamlessly into another. The new technology reduced the number of staffers needed by enabling news segments to be re-used throughout an entire day (previously, anchors read the same stories repeatedly, hour after hour, with the second 15 minutes of each half-hour in the \\"wheel\\" being broadcast on videotape every third and fourth hour). This resulted in the layoffs of part of its staff, including such stalwart anchors as Lyn Vaughn, David Goodnow and Bob Losure, all of whom had been with Headline News for over 10 years.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn June 15, 1999, the network underwent a complete visual revamp, including an updated ticker (now dubbed the \\"Superticker\\"), a brand-new newsroom and studio, and a sectioning of the channel's schedule into four distinct dayparts, to convey the idea that, unlike CNN, which aired long-form programming such as discussion shows and documentaries, Headline News never stopped offering straight news coverage. The daypart blocks each ran for six hours and utilized their own special branding and color-coding (which extended to the graphics and segment introductions): First Watch (from 6:00?a.m.-12:00?p.m. Eastern Time, colored yellow), Second Watch (12:00-6:00?p.m. ET, colored red), Third Watch (6:00?p.m.-12:00?a.m. ET, colored green), and Late Watch (12:00-6:00?a.m. ET, colored blue). Additional segments were also added prior to commercial breaks: Best Bets On..., which provided top picks in categories such as films (with information supplied by publications owned by then-sister company Time Inc.), and Week-At-A-Glance, which provided summaries of important events occurring that week. To promote the change, two new slogans were introduced: Get-To-The-Point News and 24-Hour Non-Stop Headlines (the latter frequently used in ident bumpers).[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn August 6, 2001, CNN Headline News unveiled a revamp of the network's on-air format, promoted with a new slogan, Real news, real fast. The centrepiece of the new format was the replacement of the network's ticker with a large pane across the bottom of the screen, which displayed headlines and other information (such as weather updates and sports news). The network also introduced another new studio and multi-anchor format, and announced plans to add more live rolling news coverage. The network characterized the new design and format as being an attempt to appeal to younger viewers, citing inspiration from the internet; the Chicago Tribune noted that the channel's viewership had been dropping, and skewing towards viewers over 50, which are not desirable to most advertisers.[10][11][11]\\r\\n\\r\\nUpon its launch, the new format received mixed reviews, with critics arguing that the new screen format conveyed too much information at once, distracting viewers from its main video programming. Critics also drew comparisons to financial news channels, as well as a similar increase in on-screen information announced by ESPNews. Steve Johnson of the Chicago Tribune explained that \\"the video portion of Headline News' subdivided screen occupies only about a third of the total real estate. My 27-inch set shrinks, in effect, to a 14-incher when tuned to Headline News. Never mind the old-school problem of trying to spot the hockey puck; people with smaller sets watching sports highlights here will have trouble finding a basketball.\\"[10][11][12]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn February 2005, the network launched a new primetime block known as Headline Prime; the block was designed to feature opinion-driven and personality-based programs (in contrast to the \\"hard news\\" programming of CNN), which network executive Ken Jautz described as a shift from \\"news to views\\" and The New York Times compared to Fox News Channel.[13] Its launch lineup featured Prime News Tonight, Showbiz Tonight, a daily entertainment news show hosted by A. J. Hammer, and an eponymous current affairs program hosted by legal commentator Nancy Grace, which featured news and analysis related to crime and court cases.[14][15] In May 2006, Headline Prime added a eponymous program hosted by conservative talk radio host Glenn Beck. Both Nancy Grace and Glenn Beck brought major ratings gains to Headline News, especially within the key demographics, although its daytime programming only saw modest increases. Exposed: The Extremist Agenda, a Glenn Beck special aired in November 2006, broke a million viewers and was the network's most-watched program of the year.[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn December 15, 2008, in conjunction with CNN's own graphics changes, which resembled the graphics of its sister channel CNN International, Headline News replaced its news ticker with a \\"flipper\\", which featured an RSS feed of the current headlines on its parent network's website, CNN.com.[16] The same day, a new square logo with a triangular appendage (making it resemble a speech bubble) overlaid by an \\"HLN\\" acronym was introduced, initially alongside the channel's full name. Two days later, the \\"Headline News\\" name was removed from on-air use with the HLN acronym becoming the channel's name full-time, and a new slogan, \\"News and Views\\", was introduced[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn March 28, 2011, HLN switched its primary standard definition feed from full-screen to a letterboxed 4:3 format, which is a downconversion from the 16:9 high definition feed; however, video footage broadcast in standard definition on either feed is not pillarboxed (as such with parent channel CNN, since its SD feed switched from full-screen to letterbox in January 2011), leaving black bars on the right and left sides of the screen, in addition to on the top and bottom of the screen. However HLN Saturday Night Mysteries, which features repurposed versions of sister channel TruTV's crime story programming, is broadcast in 4:3 full-screen on the HLN SD feed.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the spring of 2011, HLN devoted a significant amount of its broadcast day to the Casey Anthony murder trial, dedicating multiple daily and primetime slots to live coverage of the proceedings followed by commentary during the evening. The saturated coverage of the trial led to increased ratings for the network, including a doubling in regular viewership during daytime hours and nearly triple that in primetime.[18] HLN executive vice president Scot Safon called the trial \\"a gigantic deal\\" for the network.[19] HLN also devoted a significant amount of time to the trial of Dr. Conrad Murray (who was accused of prescribing the drugs that caused the death of Michael Jackson) during the fall of 2011.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn July 18, 2011, CNN began offering live streams of HLN for mobile devices to subscribers of certain pay television services.[20] On November 4, 2011, HLN launched its own website at hlntv.com. By contrast to CNN.com, the site is run by HLN's own editorial staff, emphasizing \\"must see and must share\\" stories, and content tying into its television programs.[21]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn May 2012, HLN acquired the rights to broadcast the Daytime Emmy Awards, beginning with the 39th annual event on June 23, 2012; this marked the first time that the awards ceremony was aired on pay television, instead of terrestrial television.[22] With 912,000 viewers (not counting four repeat broadcasts, which brought the total to two million), the broadcast was \\"the most watched regularly scheduled, non-news telecast\\" ever on HLN.[23]\\r\\n\\r\\nAlbie Hecht joined HLN as Executive Vice President and GM in September 2013.[24] In November 2013, consumer advocate Clark Howard ended his five-year relationship with HLN, including his appearances on Morning Express with Robin Meade and Evening Express as well as his own eponymous weekend afternoon program. The move came in response to planned changes occurring at HLN, which sought to re-position the network as the \\"first TV home for the social media generation.\\"[25]\\r\\n\\r\\nThroughout 2014, HLN's news content began to skew towards millennials, with an increasing focus on content popular on social networks alongside major headlines. For a period, HLN also aired RightThisMinute, a syndicated program focusing on viral videos. In June 2014, Time Warner attempted to, but failed to, acquire a stake in Vice Media: Time Warner had planned to give Vice control of HLN so it could re-launch the channel around its original content.[26][27] Vice subsequently partnered with A&E Networks to launch its channel, Viceland, in 2016.[28]\\r\\n\\r\\nThese plans culminated on January 13, 2015, when HLN underwent a major revamp in its programming and on-air presentation; the network introduced several new social media-themed programs, including the new afternoon block The Daily Share, Jack Vale: Offline ÿ a docusoap following YouTube comedian Jack Vale, Ali Nejad's The Social Life, and Keywords, a social media-themed game show hosted by Summer Sanders. HLN also adopted an updated logo, and introduced a new set at Studio 7 of the CNN Center, used by Morning Express and The Daily Share. The new studio has a \\"coffee house\\"-styled design with no traditional anchor desk, and a \\"Social Circle\\" designed to encourage interaction between hosts and guests. T-Mobile US also signed on to serve as a sponsor for The Daily Share, allowing on-set branding and sponsored segments during the program.[29][30]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn late-May 2015, The Daily Share was cut from five hours to two, with the remainder of its timeslot filled by CNN original series and specials, followed by next-day encores of Nancy Grace and Dr. Drew On Call.[31]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn November 24, 2015, CNN Worldwide president Jeff Zucker announced, in a memo to network staff, that Hecht would depart HLN; Ken Jautz, who oversaw the network as its president prior to Hecht's appointment in 2013, would head the network in the interim. The memo outlined plans to restructure its daytime and overnight programming to more closely resemble CNN, including a focus on documentary films.[32][33][34][35]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn June 2016, HLN announced that Erica Hill would re-join the network to host a new, afternoon program from New York later in the year.[36] Later that month, HLN also announced that Michaela Pereira, a former anchor of CNN's New Day, would host a new morning show from CNN's Los Angeles bureau, known as MichaeLA, beginning on July 11, 2016. The new program was positioned as a sister to HLN's main morning show Morning Express, airing from 10:00?a.m. to 1:00?p.m. ET; the network emphasized in promotion that Michaela would be the only nationally televised morning show to be broadcast live in the west coast (where it airs from 7:00?a.m. to 10:00?a.m. PT), contrasting other national morning shows that are tape-delayed from airings for the east coast.[37]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn June 30, 2016, Nancy Grace announced that she would end her show and leave HLN in October 2016, after nearly a decade with the network.[38] It was replaced by a new program, Primetime Justice with Ashleigh Banfield.[39] Erica Hill's new program, On the Story, premiered on October 10, 2016.[40]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn October 22, 2016, AT&T announced an offer to acquire Time Warner for $108.7 billion, including debt it would assume from the latter; the merger would bring Time Warner's various media properties, including HLN and CNN, under the same corporate umbrella as AT&T's telecommunications holdings, including satellite provider DirecTV.[41][42][43][44] Time Warner shareholders approved the merger on February 15, 2017; however on February 28, FCC Chairman Ajit Pai announced that his agency will not review the deal, leaving the review to the U.S. Department of Justice.[45][46] On November 20, 2017, the Justice Department filed a lawsuit against AT&T and Time Warner in an attempt to block the merger, citing antitrust concerns surrounding the transaction.[47] The proposed merger ÿ which had already been approved by the European Commission and Mexican, Chilean and Brazilian regulatory authorities ÿ was affirmed by court ruling on June 12, 2018, after District of Columbia U.S. District Court Judge Richard J. Leon ruled in favor of AT&T in a lawsuit. The merger closed two days later on June 14, with the company becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of AT&T under the renamed parent company WarnerMedia.[48][49][50][51][52][53][54]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn January 2017, HLN announced the January 27 premiere of How it Really Happened, a new documentary series hosted by Hill Harper reporting on the \\"most notorious crimes, mysteries, trials, and celebrity tragedies of our time\\". The series is the first production of CNN's Original Series Development staff that was developed specifically for HLN.[55] On January 30, 2017, it was announced that CNN anchor Carol Costello would return to HLN to host a new program from Los Angeles.[56] In March 2017, HLN announced that S.E. Cupp would host a new early-evening program on HLN, S. E. Cupp Unfiltered, beginning in June 2017.[57]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn May 8, 2017, HLN underwent a rebranding, adopting a new logo and slogan, \\"News that hits home\\". The network will position its news content towards regional headlines, crime, and entertainment stories  leaving CNN to focus upon \\"in-depth\\" political coverage and world affairs.[58] In January 2018, HLN began to reintroduce the Headline News brand during its news programming (although HLN remains the network's primary name), and also introduced Headline Nowa recap of top stories airing every half-hour during its daytime lineup.[59]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn August 2018, S.E. Cupp Unfiltered was quietly cancelled, and moved to CNN as a weekly program on Saturday evenings.[60] On October 16, 2018, HLN cancelled Across America with Carol Costello, Michaela, and Crime & Justice with Ashleigh Banfield. With the cancelling of these shows, Morning Express with Robin Meade expands until noon and On the Story will air noon until 3:00 pm.[61]\\r\\n\\r\\nDue to the channel's tradition of airing rolling news coverage, HLN had become popular with people who may not have time to watch lengthy news reports, and as a fast source of news for public locations like airports, bars, and many other places. Supermarkets that carried the discontinued CNN Checkout Channel service were offered a feed of Headline News to broadcast on its televisions.[62]\\r\\n\\r\\nSince its inception, many broadcast television stations in various markets carried Headline News programming during the overnight hours in lieu of signing off (particularly as stations began to adopt 24-hour-a-day program schedules during the late 1980s and 1990s), or scheduling movies, infomercials or other syndicated programming to fill overnight timeslots. Beginning in the early 1990s, as NBC, ABC and CBS launched their own overnight news programs (NBC Nightside, World News Now and Up to the Minute, respectively), network-affiliated stations that carried the channel's programming ÿ which typically aired in half-hour or hour-long blocks ÿ continued to air Headline News broadcasts as a complement to these programs and also to provide news programming in weekend time periods when the networks did not provide Saturday and/or Sunday editions of their overnight newscasts.\\r\\n\\r\\nUntil 1995, much of Headline News' programming was simulcast on sister channel CNN International; the channel's news ticker was not displayed on CNN International during its simulcasts of Headline News programming. The channel's program audio was also simulcast on AM radio stations across the country via Westwood One; all of CNN's U.S. radio operations (including the HLN simulcast) were discontinued on April 1, 2012 as part of Westwood One's dissolution into Dial Global. The audio feed is also carried on XM Satellite Radio channel 123 and Sirius Satellite Radio channel 116.\\r\\n\\r\\nBeginning in the mid-2000s, the channel has been available in certain countries outside the United States, particularly in Asia, Latin America, Middle East and North Africa.\\r\\nWhile the international feed's program lineup is exactly the same as that seen in the U.S., weather forecasts for Asian and Latin American, Middle East and North African Cities in the cities are used as break fillers in lieu of commercials.\\r\\n\\r\\nHLN broadcasts in high definition 1080i resolution format. It is available nationally on nearly all pay-TV providers within the United States, and in Canada on satellite provider Bell TV, which downconverts the HD feed's picture resolution to 720p.\\r\\n\\r\\nHLN's weekday lineup consists primarily of rolling news programming during the daytime hours, consisting of Morning Express, a morning news program hosted by Robin Meade, joined by Bob Van Dillen, Jennifer Westhoven and Coy Wire, followed by Across America, which is broadcast from Los Angeles and hosted by Carol Costello, midday program On the Story, and afternoon show MichaeLA hosted by Michaela Pereira from Los Angeles. During the evenings (beginning at 6:00?p.m. ET), HLN broadcasts Crime & Justice, a news program hosted by Ashleigh Banfield which focuses on legal and social issues.[63]\\r\\n\\r\\nHLN's remaining dayparts primarily feature a focus on true crime programming. The network has extensively aired reruns of the former CourtTV series Forensic Files; as of April 2016, the program took up about 58% of the channel's weekly schedule.[64] In March 2017, HLN executive Ken Jautz stated that the network was making an effort to produce more original series; some of the new series that were slated to premiere in 2017, including Beyond Reasonable Doubt, Something's Killing Me, Inside with Chris Cuomo (which premiered October 20),[65] and the second season of How it Really Happened (whose first season premiered January 27, 2017), were designed to complement the popularity of Forensic Files and other true crime programs, as well as HLN's renewed focus on crime coverage as part of its news programming.[57][55][58] After airing new episodes in simulcast with CNN in 2016,[66] The Hunt with John Walsh moved to HLN for its fourth season.[67]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn February 12, 2015, HLN aired the film Glory as part of a new anthology known as News and a Moviewhich consisted of airings of feature films accompanied by panel discussions on their cultural relevance in the present day.[68] Alongside TruTV, HLN also aired encores of special episodes of TBS's late night talk show Conan set in Cuba and Armenia.[69][70]\\r\\n\\r\\nAt 4:00?a.m. ET on weekdays, HLN used to broadcast CNN Student News (formerly known as CNN Newsroom from its 1989 debut, not to be confused with the current CNN program of the same name), a 10-minute news program designed for broadcast in schools that is produced as part of the Cable in the Classroom initiative; the program is anchored by Carl Azuz, with reports on the day's news presented in a simplified format (and with stories featuring graphic imagery or adult themes usually left out from the program). It no longer airs on HLN as of 2014, but is still available as a free podcast on CNN's website and iTunes. On December 16, 2016, the program was renamed to CNN 10.","input":"What does the tv station hln stand for?"},{"output":"Nebraska","context":"Tornadoes are more common in the United States than in any other country.[1][2] The United States receives more than 1,200 tornadoes annuallyfour times the amount seen in Europe.[3][4] Violent tornadoesthose rated EF4 or EF5 on the Enhanced Fujita Scaleoccur more often in the United States than in any other country.[3]\\r\\nMost tornadoes in the United States occur east of the Rocky Mountains. The Great Plains, the Midwest, the Mississippi Valley and the southern United States are all areas that are vulnerable to tornadoes. They are relatively rare west of the Rockies and are also less frequent in the northeastern states. Tornado Alley is a colloquial term for an area particularly prone to tornadoes. There is no officially defined 'Tornado Alley' - at its broadest this area stretches from North Texas to Canada with its core centered on Oklahoma, Kansas and northern Texas. Another highly significant region - colloquially known as Dixie Alley - is the southern United States and particularly the northern and central parts of Alabama and Mississippi. Florida is one of the most tornado prone states. However, Florida tornadoes only rarely approach the strength of those that occur elsewhere.\\r\\nAlthough favorable conditions for tornadoes in the United States can occur at any time, they are most common in spring and least common in winter.[5][6] Because spring is a transitional period for the climate, there are more chances of cooler air meeting with warmer air, resulting in more thunderstorms. Tornadoes can also be spawned by landfalling tropical cyclones, which usually occur in late summer and autumn. In the United States, thunderstorms capable of producing tornadoes usually form when the temperature is at its highest, typically from 4:00?p.m. to 7:00?p.m.[6][7]\\r\\nAlthough the period in which most tornadoes strike (\\"tornado season\\") is March through June, tornadoes - including violent tornadoes and major tornado outbreaks - have been documented in the United States during every month of the year.[8] Two examples of this are when a series of tornadoes hit the state of Indiana on November 22, 1992, and injured at least nine people.[8] Another notable non-season tornado was where a tornado struck the area of McLean County, Illinois. Even though the tornado was during a winter month, it blew 20 railroad cars off their tracks, and hauled a camper over 100 yards (91 m).[8]\\r\\nDuring the winter months of the year, tornadoes have been known to hit the Southern United States and Southeastern United States the most, but have hit other areas as well.[8] One notable recent example of a winter tornado outbreak was the 2008 Super Tuesday tornado outbreak on February 5 and February 6, 2008. 84 tornadoes occurred over the course of the outbreak. The storm system produced several destructive tornadoes in heavily populated areas, most notably in the Memphis metropolitan area, in Jackson, Tennessee, and the northeastern end of the Nashville metropolitan area. At least 57?people were killed across four states and 18?counties, with hundreds of others injured.[9] The outbreak was the deadliest of the modern NEXRAD doppler radar era, until the 2011 Super Outbreak killed over 348 people (324 of which were tornado-related). It was the deadliest single outbreak since the May 31, 1985 outbreak, which killed 76 across Ohio and Pennsylvania, as well claiming 12?victims in Ontario, Canada. It was also the deadliest outbreak in both Tennessee and Kentucky since the 1974 Super Outbreak.[10]\\r\\nUsually, tornadoes hit specific areas of the United States in specific seasons. During the winter months, tornadoes are usually spotted in the Southern area of the country, as well as states near the Gulf of Mexico.[11] This is due to cold air moving southward reaching its southern limit of expansion, and stopping over the Gulf Coast.[11] As spring comes, hot air progressively moves back into the Gulf Coast. This pushes the mass of colder air forward out of the Gulf States and into the Southeastern states, where tornado frequency is highest in April.[11]\\r\\nAs spring passes and summer begins, the mass of warm moist air moves northwest into the Great Plains and Midwestern states.[11] During the months of May and June, tornado activity is as its peak in the southern Great Plains. The air mass then moves northward into the Northern Great Plains and the Great Lakes area, causing a tornado activity peak in these areas during the summer months.[11] During the late summer and early fall months, tornado activity in the United States tapers off.[11] This is due to the relatively small difference between the temperature at the boundary of the hot air mass and the cool air mass at that time and an extension of the Bermuda High sitting over parts of the United States.[11] Though there may be some thunderstorms, they don't often become severe enough to spawn tornadoes.[11]\\r\\nTornadoes may be formed out of season, especially during the months of hurricane season in the Gulf Coast states and Southeastern states. Because these areas are prone to hurricanes, they may be struck with tornadoes that are spawned from hurricanes.[12] Tornadoes are most likely to form in the right-front quadrant of the hurricane, but can also form in rain bands associated with the storm.[12] This is caused by the large amount of vertical wind shear to the right of the storm.[13] Tornadoes are also spawned from U.S. hurricanes due to the moistness of the air at the landfall of the storm, which makes conditions favorable for a supercell storm to develop within the hurricane.[14]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTornadoes have been documented in every U.S. state (not including the non-state territories of Guam, the Virgin Islands, American Samoa, and Puerto Rico) at least once since 1950, although some regions and states are hit by tornadoes far more than others.[15] For example, the average number of tornadoes to hit the states of Alaska, Rhode Island, and Vermont is less than one, while the state of Oklahoma receives an average of 52 tornadoes per year, and the state of Texas is hit with 126 tornadoes in an average year.[16] The state with the most tornadoes per unit area is Florida, though most are weak tornadoes of EF0 or EF1 intensity.[17] A number of Florida's tornadoes occur along the edge of hurricanes that strike the state.[18] The state with the highest number of strong tornadoes per unit area is Oklahoma.[19] States such as Oklahoma and Kansas have much lower population densities than Florida, so tornadoes may go unreported.[20]\\r\\nThe Midwestern states are very prone to tornado activity, as it is part of \\"Tornado Alley.\\"[21] States included in the area that are hit by tornadoes the most are Kansas, Missouri, Nebraska, Iowa, and South Dakota.[21] The Midwestern States are often hit by tornadoes during the late spring and early summer months, especially the months of May and June.[11] This is due to the aforementioned air mass moving northward into the Midwest and combining with another air mass that move southward from Canada.[11] This creates unstable air, creating the potential for storms to strike the most during these months.[11] The frequency begins to decrease in the middle of the summer, as the air mass moves northward into the Great Lakes states.[11]\\r\\nA very notable recent storm that has hit this area was the Northwood, Kansas tornado, in the May 2007 Tornado Outbreak. The tornado apparently strengthened as it neared Northwood, and at 9:38 pm CDT (0238 UTC), storm chasers reported that it had grown to over 1?2 mile (0.8?km) in diameter.[22] Several satellite tornadoes were observed as the very large wedge approached the town of Greensburg, Kansas. It was an estimated 1.7 miles (2.7?km) in diameter and was later confirmed to have been an EF5 on the Enhanced Fujita Scale (the highest possible rating). Based on the damage produced, winds inside the tornado were estimated to have been in excess of 205?mph (330?km/h).[23]\\r\\nNebraska is fifth overall for sheer numbers of tornadoes, while Indiana has had 88 violent tornado reports from the 1950ÿ2006 period, more than any state except Oklahoma.[15] Iowa reported 3'900 almost as many as Texas.[15] The deadliest tornado in US history, the Tri-State Tornado, struck Missouri, Illinois, and Indiana in March 1925.[24] St. Louis, Missouri and neighboring East St. Louis, Illinois have been hit more than once by violent tornadoes, the most notorious of which was the St. Louis Tornado of May 1896.[25] The New Richmond Tornado of May 1899 and the Flint, Michigan tornado of June 1953 also rank amongst the deadliest tornadoes in US history.[26] The region was badly hit by the Palm Sunday Tornado Outbreak in April 1965 and by the Super Outbreak of April 1974. According to NCDC figures for the 1950 to 2006 period, Nebraska reported 2,440 tornadoes followed by Iowa (2,185), Illinois (2,086), Missouri (1,922), South Dakota (1,487), Minnesota (1,477), Indiana (1,327), North Dakota (1,216), Wisconsin (1,185), Michigan (981), and Ohio (916).[15]\\r\\nThe Southern United States has suffered more tornado fatalities than any other part of the country.[27] Some areas experience repeated damaging tornado events, such as the Tennessee Valley and in northern Alabama. The state of Alabama is tied for the most reported F5 tornadoes.[28] For the period 1950 to 2006, three hundred and fifty eight people were killed by tornadoes in Alabama, ranking the state third nationwide behind Texas (521) and neighboring Mississippi (404).[15] Fourth is Arkansas (336) and fifth is Tennessee with 271 fatalities.[15]\\r\\nTornado disasters to affect the southern USA include the Great Natchez Tornado of May 1840 - second deadliest on record in the US, behind only the Tri-State Tornado.[26] Other outbreaks included the Tupelo-Gainesville tornado outbreak of April 1936, the 1908 Southeast tornado outbreak of April 1908 and the Candlestick Park Tornado of 1966. Alabama and Kentucky were very badly affected by the Super Outbreak of 1974. The 2008 Super Tuesday tornado outbreak was the deadliest tornado outbreak in the USA in 23 years.[26] 58?people lost their lives with Tennessee, Arkansas, and Kentucky particularly badly affected. The 2011 Super Outbreak devastated much of the South, leaving 348 people dead.\\r\\nHurricanes and other tropical storms can also generate tornadoes. Louisiana and the coastal regions of Mississippi and Alabama are most at risk from these storms. The Atlantic seaboard states can be affected too. According to NCDC figures for the 1950 to 2006 period, Mississippi reported 1,787 tornadoes, followed by Arkansas (1,644), Louisiana (1,608), Alabama (1,579), Georgia (1,324), North Carolina (1,042), Tennessee (892), South Carolina (819), Kentucky (710) and Virginia (565).[15] West Virginia, by contrast, is one of the least vulnerable states of all with just 120 tornadoes reported over the period.[15]\\r\\nThe Northeastern U.S. to the east of the Appalachian Mountains is much less vulnerable to violent tornadoes but is by no means immune. One of the most extraordinary tornadoes in history struck Worcester, Massachusetts. This F4 tornado struck the city on 9 June 1953 and killed 90?people.[29] The tornado was generated by the same storm system that delivered a devastating tornado to the town of Flint, Michigan.[29]\\r\\nAreas further south - notably Pennsylvania and Maryland - and areas to the west of the Appalachians are more vulnerable to tornadoes. NCDC figures for the period 1950 to 2006 show that Pennsylvania reported 697 tornadoes, followed by New York State (358), Maryland (269), Massachusetts (153), New Jersey (144), Maine (101), New Hampshire (86), Connecticut (82), Delaware (58), Vermont (37), Rhode Island (9), and the District of Columbia (1).[15] The worst tornado outbreak in the Northeast occurred in Pennsylvania on May 31, 1985, and produced the only F5 tornado in the region to date.[30]\\r\\nFlorida is one of the most tornado prone states, with only Texas, Kansas and Oklahoma reporting more storms.[15] During the period 1950 to 2006, Florida reported 2,884 tornadoes according to NCDC figures.[15] However, Florida tornadoes are usually weak in comparison with those that strike the Plains and the Southern states - there have been only four reports of F4 strength tornadoes since 1950 and none of F5 strength.[16] Florida experiences more thunderstorms than any other state but fewer supercell storms.[16] Florida tornadoes are more often spawned by the frequent ordinary thunderstorms that occur over the state. Hurricanes and other tropical storms can generate large numbers of tornadoes.[31] Non-supercell tornadoes are rarely as strong as supercell-generated storms.[32]\\r\\nFlorida's most violent tornadoes generally occur during the winter months, when the state is most vulnerable to invasions of cold air that help generate such storms.[11] In recent years there have been some particularly disastrous tornado events. During the night of February 22 and 23, 1998, an F3 tornado struck Kissimmee and killed 25?people. Later that night, another F3 tornado struck Seminole and Volusia counties and killed 13?people (see Kissimmee Tornado Outbreak).[33] On February 2, 2007, an EF3 tornado struck Lake County with 21 fatalities resulting - see 2007 Central Florida Tornadoes.[34]\\r\\nOf the states around the Rocky Mountains, Colorado reports by far the greatest numbers of tornadoes. Eastern Colorado, both climatically and physically, has much more in common with the neighboring Plains states of Kansas and Nebraska than with the mountainous areas further west. Small cities such as Limon, Kit Carson, Thurman, and Flagler are some places in Eastern Colorado that have experienced dangerous tornadoes.[35] The same can be said, to a lesser extent, of eastern Wyoming. Tornadoes are less frequent in mountainous areas.[36] Of the states in this region - according to NCDC figures for the 1950 to 2006 period - Colorado reported 1,617 tornadoes, followed by Wyoming with 560, Montana (345), Idaho (175), and Utah (114).[15]\\r\\nIn the Southwestern United States, New Mexico reported 485 tornadoes during the 1950 to 2006 period (NCDC figures), California reported 355, Arizona reported 209, and Nevada reported 75.[15] New Mexico borders the notoriously tornado prone states of Texas and Oklahoma, hence the noticeably higher figures. Most of the tornadoes here happen in the very eastern part of the state. New Mexico's region and the desert landscape of the state help prevent the amount of twisters that happen in Oklahoma and Texas.[15] Arizona and New Mexico experience regular summer thunderstorms during their monsoon season. These are sometimes tornadic but rarely produce violent tornadoes.\\r\\nThe Pacific Northwest is perhaps the least vulnerable region. NCDC figures for the 1950 to 2006 period show that Washington reported just 96 tornadoes for the entire period and that Oregon reported 91.[15] However, Portland, Oregon and neighboring Vancouver, Washington were hit by a deadly tornado on 5 April 1972. This storm was the deadliest to hit the United States that year.[37]\\r\\nAlaska has only been hit by 2 tornadoes between 1950 and 2006 (the first being November 4, 1959[38] and the other was August 2, 2005[39]); both were only F0. Hawaii has only been hit by 49 tornadoes since 1950.\\r\\nTornadoes creates different damage depending how fast its wind speeds it is. The Fujita Scale classifies a tornado by its wind speeds. For example, if the tornado's wind speeds are low, then it is classified as a F0 tornado. If the tornado's wind speeds are about 200 miles per hour or at 200 miles per hour, then it is classified as a F5 tornado. In the United States, tornadoes have been known to form at high and low intensities. The probability of a high intensity or violent tornado differs by location across the country.[40] For example, due to the high frequency of tornadoes in the \\"Tornado Alley\\" area mentioned before, a more violent tornado would be more likely to form there due to the strength of the thunderstorms produced by the two bordering air masses.[41] The states with the highest number of F5 and EF5 rated tornadoes since data was available in 1950 are Alabama and Oklahoma, each with seven tornadoes. Iowa, Kansas, and Texas each are tied for second most with six.[28] The state with the highest number of F5 and EF5 tornadoes per square mile, however, was Iowa.[42] The state with the most number of tornadoes classified as \\"violent\\", or F4 and F5, is Kentucky, and the state with the highest average intensity ranking for tornadoes is Alabama.[42]\\r\\nTornadoes that are classified as EF4 and EF5 (or \\"violent tornadoes\\") on the Enhanced Fujita Scale only account for an average of two percent of all tornadoes in the United States each year.[43] However, these high intensity storms do account for an average of seventy percent of all tornado-related deaths in the United States each year.[44] These storms can have winds of over 200 miles per hour (320?km/h) and stay on the ground for over an hour.[45]\\r\\nThe United States has seen 58 F5 and EF5 (the highest intensity and damage ranking) tornadoes since records began in 1950.[28] No tornadoes prior to 1950 were officially ranked F5, due to inadequate engineering data and other information on the historical tornadoes. From 1950ÿ1970 tornadoes were assessed retrogressively, primarily using information recorded in government databases, and newspaper photographs and descriptions. Beginning in 1971, tornadoes were rated by the NWS using on-site damage surveys.[46]\\r\\nOn May 3, 1999, a storm produced a violent tornado in the vicinity of Oklahoma City and was a part of the 1999 Oklahoma tornado outbreak, which also brought many violent storms to the states of Kansas, Arkansas, and Tennessee.[47] In total, the storm produced 66 tornadoes over four states.[47] The strong F5 storm took place near the town of Bridge Creek, Oklahoma, located in Grady County.[47] During the storm, a group of students in meteorology from the University of Oklahoma had chased the storm on a Doppler on Wheels (or DOW), which scans storms while attached to a car.[47] Doppler on Wheels data from the nearby storm revealed winds of 301?I?20 miles per hour (484?I?32?km/h), which was over the wind speed in the F5 classification of that time.[47] Though the wind speed was over the F5 maximum, the tornado was not named the first ever F6 storm, as there was no F6 classification.[47] Other scientists reviewed the DOW data taken by the students, and concluded that the estimated wind speed may have been inaccurate, but still over 300 miles per hour (130?m/s).[47] Also, the wind speed recorded was taken from over 200 feet (61?m) above ground level.[47] The National Weather Service also did a damage check, and found that the damage was that of an average F5 tornado.[47]\\r\\nThe United States receives over 80 deaths and 1,500 injuries associated with tornadoes each year.[3][48] According to the National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration, most tornado deaths are caused by people not following instructions on what to do the right way.[3] They also mention that some people are not even warned that a tornadic storm is coming, while others get a warning, but do not believe that a tornado will hit their area.[3] In 2012, 68?people were killed by tornadoes in the United States.[49] Kentucky was the state with the most fatalities, having 22.[49] Kentucky was followed by Indiana (13), Illinois (9), Missouri and Oklahoma (6), Ohio (4), Alabama and Tennessee (3), and Florida and Kansas (1).[49]\\r\\nOver 39 percent of all tornado-related deaths and many injuries come from residents of mobile homes.[50] It is a widespread myth that tornadoes are \\"attracted\\" to mobile home parks, and cause the most fatalities there because they hit there the most.[50] This is not true. However, mobile homes do often have poor construction and do not provide adequate protection during a tornado event.[50] An example to confirm this occurred in April 1991, when a very powerful tornado struck the town of Andover, Kansas. When the town was hit, eighty-four homes and fourteen businesses were destroyed by the tornado, but with no fatalities and only minor injuries.[51] After the tornado hit Andover, it swept through a mobile home park consisting of 223 trailers.[51] The park did have a tornado shelter, to which over 200 residents fled and survived without injuries.[51] Others that did not take shelter in the tornado shelter stayed in their mobile homes, and thirteen of them were killed by the tornado.[51]\\r\\nThe Enhanced Fujita Scale is a scale ll that classifies tornado strength from weakest, an EF0 tornado, to strongest, an EF5 tornado, by the damage the tornado caused to property and infrastructure. An EF0 tornado has winds from 65-85 MPH (105-137 KPH), may take off a roof or damage gutters, and can bring down tree limbs. If a tornado causes no damage because it did not occur in a populated area, it is always classed as EFO. An EF5 tornado has winds over 200 MPH (322 KPH) and can totally destroy reinforced concrete structures, even throwing rail cars a considerable distance.\\r\\nUntil recently there was little hope of forecasting these systems. Meteorologists could identify those conditions that were likely to produce severe weather and generate a watch. If a tornado was spotted a warning was issued. More recently Doppler radar allows investigators to see a circulation develop in the storm. Because of their size and intensity, there are few storm observations. Increasing information has been gathered in the field from those chasing the storm.","input":"What state gets hit by the most tornadoes?"},{"output":"Broderick Crawford","context":"Highway Patrol is a 156-episode action crime drama series produced for syndication from 1955 to 1959.\\r\\n\\r\\nHighway Patrol stars Broderick Crawford as Dan Mathews, the gruff and dedicated head of a police force in an unidentified Western state.  A signature shot of the series is fedora-wearing Mathews barking rapid-fire dialogue into a radio microphone as he leans against the door of his black and white patrol car. Mathews growls \\"21-50 to headquarters\\" and the invariable response is \\"Headquarters by\\" (as in, standing by).\\r\\n\\r\\nZiv Television Programs was founded by Frederick Ziv in 1948. Ten years later Ziv TV was a major producer of 1950s and early 1960s first-run syndicated series, including Bat Masterson, The Cisco Kid, Science Fiction Theater, Lock-Up, Sea Hunt and Ripcord.\\r\\n\\r\\nHighway Patrol was created by Ziv in response to the California Highway Patrol (CHP) wanting to be featured in a TV series. However, because Ziv thought that the show needed to have a broader police scope than the real CHP, the generic show name was adopted.  In the four years of its run, Highway Patrol would feature many actors who would later become successful stars in their own right, among them Stuart Whitman, Clint Eastwood, Robert Conrad, Larry Hagman, Barbara Eden, Paul Burke and Leonard Nimoy.\\r\\n\\r\\nHighway Patrol premiered October 3, 1955 with \\"Prison Break\\", an episode filmed April 11ÿ13, 1955. Ziv Television Programs produced 156 episodes spanning four TV seasons, 1955ÿ1959. Episodes are generally fast-pacednotable considering how a typical episode was filmed: two days on location and one day at the studio. The budget for an episode ranged from $20,000 to $25,000, somewhat higher when a Bell 47 helicopter was used. Producer Frederic W. Ziv said the show moved fast to match Broderick Crawford's acting pace. Ziv said Highway Patrol introduced quick cutting to television, which started a new trend.\\r\\n\\r\\nHighway Patrol is famous for its location shooting around the San Fernando Valley and Simi Valley, then mostly rural. Other notable Los Angeles area locations include Griffith Park, and Bronson Canyon just above Hollywood.[1] The show also filmed at railroad stations at Glendale, California, identified by a large sign, Santa Susana, California, and Chatsworth, California.\\r\\n\\r\\nUnlike the California Highway Patrol, the agency featured in the TV series was more concerned with chasing criminals than enforcing driving laws.  Local and county police officers were seldom if ever in evidence, only the Highway Patrol. With such a limited budget, there were very few car chases, crashes, and other motor mayhem that is more common in modern police dramas; scenes were often filmed on rural two-lane paved or dirt roads to save money and because Crawford's own driver's license was suspended for drunk driving.  Excitement was mainly generated by Crawford's own rapid-fire, staccato delivery of his lines, frequent shootouts, and numerous plot contrivances in which time was a critical factor, such as a hostage death threat, the escape of a violent criminal, a train derailment, or other imminent catastrophe.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the first two seasons the series received technical assistance from the California Highway Patrol.  The patrol cars in early episodes are actual CHP vehicles with the show's car door emblem covering the CHP emblem (sometimes a real CHP star is briefly visible). For instance, the 1955 Buick Century two-door patrol car seen in early episodes was built exclusively for CHP. Eventually the California Highway Patrol dropped its support, reportedly dissatisfied with how the show had evolved. At that point the show had to create its own patrol cars using non-police models, but still outfitted in CHP-style, distinctly subdued compared with many police agencies. \\r\\n\\r\\nOfficer uniforms are the CHP style of the day. In seasons one to three, the shoulder patch is essentially the CHP patch with \\"California\\" and \\"Eureka\\" (state motto) removed; the California bear and other California state seal elements are retained. In season four the show adopted a uniform patch that matches its patrol car emblem. Highway Patrol chief Dan Mathews usually wears a suit and fedora, but not to be undercoverhe generally drives a black-and-white patrol car.\\r\\n\\r\\nArt Gilmore's narration gives Highway Patrol a documentary feel, but several details are never mentioned. While described as a state police agency, the actual state is never stated. It is said to be a western state, and borders on Mexico, but only eastern state Rhode Island is small enough to allow Dan Mathews to regularly drive from headquarters to every crime scene in just minutes. Towns have simple names like \\"Midvale\\", though sometimes a real place name is used because of a prominent sign. In some episodes Mathews uses an unlabeled wall map that appears to be central-east Oregon, with the towns of Bend and Redmond on the map's left. Cars in the show are always described by color and body style, but never by brand name: \\"blue coupe\\", \\"gray sedan\\". Cars have the black-on-yellow California license plate of the time, but with a piece of tape covering the name of the state (usually, but sometimes \\"California\\" is briefly visible). Episode \\"Mistaken Identity\\" did show a 1957 Illinois license plate in the opening scene.\\r\\n\\r\\nA key element of the show is two-way radio communication among patrol cars and headquarters, with heavy use of police code \\"10-4\\" (meaning \\"acknowledged\\"). While 10-4 adds a feeling of authenticity, real police use many radio codes for brevity and clarity. The Highway Patrol show radio call signs are CHP-style, except California Highway Patrol uses the first part to indicate the geographic region/office. Dan Mathews unit \\"21-50\\" would be a CHP unit at office 21, which is in Napa County, California. \\r\\n\\r\\nStar Trek creator Gene Roddenberry wrote five episodes, sometimes using the pseudonym \\"Robert Wesley\\". Future producer Quinn Martin is sound supervisor in the show's early years; style elements of \\"Highway Patrol\\" are evident in his later productions: (The Untouchables, The Fugitive, Barnaby Jones, The Invaders, The FBI and The Streets of San Francisco).\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen asked why the popular show ended, Crawford said, \\"We ran out of crimes\\". Crawford reportedly had had his fill of the show's hectic TV schedule (two shows per week), which had caused him to drink more heavily than ever, and he had decided to leave Highway Patrol to make films in Europe.[2] Ziv held up Crawford's ten percent share of the show's gross (some $2 million) until Crawford agreed to sign for a new Ziv pilot and TV show, King of Diamonds. After returning from Europe, Crawford signed his new contract with Ziv and would later star in King of Diamonds playing diamond insurance investigator John King.[2] King of Diamonds lasted only one season before being canceled in 1962. Like most Ziv series, Highway Patrol repeats were syndicated for many years, sometimes with name Ten-4. In 2010, ThisTV began airing the series. In 2017 it was added to the line-up on MeTV.\\r\\n\\r\\nSimilar to the contemporary Ziv Television action/adventure series, Sea Hunt, each episode ended with a gratitude from Broderick Crawford himself for watching and an invitation to view again next week. Highway Patrol's style was different, however; he would deliver an aphoristic comment on traffic safety, including these:\\r\\n\\r\\nThe style of these closings evolved slightly over time. In early episodes, Crawford promised next week's viewers a \\"different\\", \\"unusual\\", or \\"exciting\\" case; toward the end of the series this verbiage was dropped.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe only constant regular on Highway Patrol is star Broderick Crawford as Dan Mathews. Crawford won an Academy Award for Best Actor in 1949 for All the King's Men. William Boyett became a regular in the fourth season as Sgt. Ken Williams. Boyett went on to play Sgt. MacDonald in Adam-12.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother constant is the voice of Art Gilmore as the heard but unseen narrator.

An entry in the longrunning The Legend of Zelda series, it was released for the Nintendo Switch and Wii U consoles on March 3, 2017. Breath of the Wild takes place at the end of the Zelda timeline; the player controls Link, who awakens from a hundred-year slumber to defeat Calamity Ganon before it can destroy the kingdom of Hyrule.\\r\\n\\r\\nSimilarly to the original Legend of Zelda (1986), players are given little instruction and can explore the open world freely. Tasks include collecting multipurpose items to aid in objectives or solving puzzles and side quests for rewards. Breath of the Wild's world is unstructured and designed to reward experimentation, and the story can be completed in a nonlinear fashion. Development of Breath of the Wild lasted five years. Wanting to reinvent the series, Nintendo introduced elements such as a detailed physics engine, high-definition visuals, and voice acting. Monolith Soft assisted in designing landscapes. The game was planned for release in 2015 as a Wii U exclusive, but was delayed twice due to problems with the physics engine. Breath of the Wild was a launch game for Switch and the final Nintendo game for Wii U. Two downloadable content packs were released later in 2017.\\r\\n\\r\\nBreath of the Wild received acclaim for its open-ended gameplay and attention to detail, with many publications describing it as one of the greatest video games of all time. Critics called it a landmark in open-world design, despite minor criticism for its technical performance at launch. It won numerous awards, including several game of the year awards. By September 2018, Breath of the Wild had sold over 11.7 million copies worldwide, making it the bestselling Zelda game.\\r\\n\\r\\nBreath of the Wild is an action-adventure game set in an open world environment where players are tasked with exploring the kingdom of Hyrule while controlling Link. In terms of structure, Breath of the Wild encourages nonlinear gameplay, which is illustrated by the game's lack of defined entrances or exits to areas,[1] scant instruction given to the player, and encouragement to explore freely.[2] Breath of the Wild introduces a consistent physics engine to the Zelda series, letting players approach problems in different ways rather than trying to find a single solution.[3] The game also integrates a \\"chemistry engine\\" that defines the physical properties of most objects and governs how they interact with the player and one another.[4] For example, players may take advantage of the game's dynamic weather by throwing metal objects at enemies during thunderstorms to attract a lightning strike.[5] These design approaches result in a generally unstructured and interactive world that rewards experimentation and allows for nonlinear completion of the story.[6][7]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs Link, players can perform actions such as running, climbing, swimming, and gliding with a paraglider, although Link is limited by his stamina.[5] Link can procure items from the environment, including weapons, food, and other resources. Unlike previous Zelda games, weapons and shields will degrade over time.[5] Many items have multiple uses; for example, wooden weapons and armor can be set to light fires or collect incoming enemy arrows, and shields can be used as makeshift snowboards.[5] Players can obtain food from hunting animals, gathering wild fruit, or collecting parts of deceased enemies.[6] By cooking combinations of food or materials, the player can create meals and elixirs that can replenish Link's health and stamina, or provide temporary status bonuses such as increased strength or weather resistance.[6] An important tool in Link's arsenal is the \\"Sheikah Slate\\", which can be used to mark waypoints on a map. Over the course of the game, Link can collect powers to add to the Slate, including remote bombs, the ability to manipulate metal objects, form ice blocks on watery surfaces, and temporarily stopping objects in time.[8][9][10] In combat, players can lock onto targets for more precise attacks, while certain button combinations allow for advanced offensive and defensive moves.[11] Players may also defeat enemies without weapons, such as rolling boulders off cliffs into enemy camps.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nBesides exploration, players can undergo quests or challenges to obtain certain benefits. Activating towers and shrines adds waypoints that the player may warp to at any time.[13] Activating towers also adds territories to the map, although location names are not added until the player explores that area. Dotted throughout Hyrule are shrines that contain challenges ranging from puzzles to battles against robotic opponents. Clearing shrines earns Spirit Orbs, which can be traded for additional health or stamina points.[13] Scattered across Hyrule are small puzzles that reveal Korok Seeds, which can be traded to expand inventory size for weapons, shields, and bows.[14] Towns serve as hotspots for quests, sidequests and shops selling materials and clothing. Hikers and other travelers offer sidequests, hints, or conversation.[5][11] Additionally, players can scan Amiibo figures against their console to summon items or call Link's horse Epona from previous Zelda games and Wolf Link from Twilight Princess.[15][16]\\r\\n\\r\\nBreath of the Wild takes place at the end of the Zelda timeline in the kingdom of Hyrule.[17] When the evil Calamity Ganon threatens Hyrule, he is defeated by Princess Zelda, descendant of the Goddess Hylia, with the help of her knight, Link.[18]\\r\\n\\r\\nHyrule matured into an advanced civilization, protected by four Divine Beasts enormous animalistic machines and an army of Guardians, autonomous weapons.[19] Upon Ganon's return, four great warriors were given the title of Champion and piloted one of the Divine Beasts to weaken him, protected by Zelda, Link, and the Guardians. Link struck Ganon down with the Master Sword, allowing Zelda to seal Ganon away.[20]\\r\\n\\r\\n10,000 years later, the kingdom of Hyrule regressed to a medieval state.[21] Reading their ancestors' prophecies, the Hyrulians recognized the signs of Ganon's return and excavated the Divine Beasts and Guardians.[22] The champions of Hyrule's racesDaruk, warrior of the mountainous Goron; Mipha, princess of the aquatic Zora; Revali, archer of the birdlike Rito; and Urbosa, chief of the desert-dwelling Gerudoassembled to pilot the Divine Beasts, while Zelda and Link battled Ganon.[23] However, Ganon possessed the Guardians and Divine Beasts, turning them against Hyrule. King Rhoam and the Champions were killed, the castle town was destroyed, and Link was gravely wounded.[24] Zelda took Link to safety, hid the Master Sword, and used her magic to trap Ganon in Hyrule Castle.[25]\\r\\n\\r\\n100 years later, an amnesiac Link awakens in Hyrule. He meets an old man, who reveals himself as the spirit of King Rhoam. Rhoam explains that Ganon, sealed in Hyrule Castle, has grown strong; he pleads for Link to defeat Ganon before he breaks free and destroys the world.[26]\\r\\n\\r\\nLink travels Hyrule, returning to locations from his past and regaining his memories. With the help of the Hyrulian races, he boards the four Divine Beasts and purges them of Ganon's monsters, releasing the spirits of Hyrule's former champions. After obtaining the Master Sword from the Lost Woods, Link enters Hyrule Castle and defeats Ganon with the help of the Divine Beasts and Zelda's Bow of Light. Zelda seals Ganon away, restoring peace and allowing the spirits of King Rhoam and the champions to depart. Zelda realizes that Hyrule must be rebuilt and that she and Link must begin the process themselves.[27] If the player fulfills certain conditions, they unlock an alternative ending where Link and Zelda survey Hyrule and talk about rebuilding the world.[28]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild was developed by Nintendo EPD for the Wii U and Nintendo Switch consoles. According to series producer Eiji Aonuma, the development team aimed to \\"rethink the conventions of Zelda\\".[29][30] Following the release of The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword in 2011, Aonuma received comments from players who wished to see a more interconnected map to explore the locales between the gameplay areas.[3] In 2013, Nintendo experimented with nonlinear, open-world gameplay in The Legend of Zelda: A Link Between Worlds.[31] At the 2014 Electronic Entertainment Expo, Aonuma said he planned to reform dungeons and puzzles, two of the series' major gameplay elements,[32] and redesign the game to allow players to reach the end without progressing through the story.[33] As Nintendo had never worked on a modern open-world game before, they took influence from the development of The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim.[34]\\r\\n\\r\\nPrior to full development, the developers designed a playable 2D prototype similar to the original Zelda to experiment with physics-based puzzles. The final game uses a modified version of the Havok physics engine.[35] At the 2017 Game Developers Conference, Director Hidemaro Fujibayashi, technical director Takuhiro Dohta, and art director Satoru Takizawa held a presentation titled \\"Change and Constant?ÿ Breaking Conventions with The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild\\", during which they demoed the prototype.[35][36] Aonuma called the physics engine in Breath of the Wild a major development for the Zelda series, saying that it \\"underpins everything in the world\\" and makes things operate in a \\"logical and realistic way\\", allowing players to approach puzzles and problems in different ways. He expanded on the difficulty in developing this system, recalling how one day during development he entered an area in the game and found that all the objects had been blown away by the wind.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nEiji Aonuma, producer[29]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe game was built and demonstrated with touchscreen features for the Wii U, but the developers found that looking away from the main screen distracted from the game. The features were removed when the game moved to tandem development across the Wii U and Nintendo Switch.[37] The Wii U GamePad also affected animation; although Link is canonically left-handed, he is right-handed in the game to match the GamePad's control scheme, which has its sword-swinging buttons on its right side.[38] The Switch version performs better than the Wii U release when docked to a television, although when undocked, both run at the same resolution. The Switch version also has higher-quality environmental sounds.[39][40] Aonuma stated that the art design was inspired by gouache and en plein air art to help identify the vast world.[41] The game's landscape was based on locations in and around Kyoto, the hometown of game director Hidemaro Fujibayashi, and was partially designed by Monolith Soft, who assisted with topographical level design.[42][43][44]\\r\\n\\r\\nEiji Aonuma, producer[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nBreath of the Wild was the first main Zelda game to use voice acting in cutscenes, although Link remains a silent protagonist. Aonuma was affected by the first time he heard a character with a human voice in-game, and wanted to leave a similar impression on players.[45] The team decided to record voice-overs for all cutscenes instead of only the key scenes, as originally planned.[46][47] Nintendo provided voice-overs and subtitles in eight languages.[b] Initially, players were not able to mix and match the languages of voices and subtitles;[48] however, Nintendo released an update in May 2017 that allowed players to choose the voice-over language.[49] The game went gold on February 3, 2017, with Nintendo holding a wrap party to celebrate.[50] Coinciding with the game's launch in Taiwan and South Korea in early 2018, Nintendo introduced a patch worldwide adding traditional and simplified Chinese and Korean translations for the Nintendo Switch version.[c][51][52][53]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe original score was composed by Manaka Kataoka, Yasuaki Iwata, and Hajime Wakai. Kataoka and Wakai had previously worked on the Zelda games Spirit Tracks[54] and The Wind Waker respectively.[55] The soundtrack was primarily written and performed on a piano, with a focus on ambient music and sounds rather than the melodic and upbeat music in previous Zelda games. According to Wakai, this helped add \\"authenticity\\" to the environments, and was taken on as a challenge by the rest of the sound team.[56]\\r\\n\\r\\nAonuma announced a new entry for Nintendo's Wii U console in January 2013 during the company's regular online presentation. The game, he continued, would challenge the series' conventions, such as the requirement that players complete dungeons in a set order.[2][57] The next year, Nintendo introduced the game's high-definition, cel-shaded visual style with in-game footage at its June 2014 Electronic Entertainment Expo press event.[58][59] Once planned for release in 2015, the game was delayed early in the year and did not show at that year's E3.[60][61] Zelda series creator Shigeru Miyamoto reaffirmed that the game was still set for release on the Wii U, despite the development of Nintendo's next console, the Nintendo Switch.[62] The game was delayed again in April 2016 due to problems with its physics engine. Nintendo let attendees play the game's Wii U version at E3 2016,[63] where they also announced its subtitle, Breath of the Wild.[64] CNET said that the showing would \\"take your breath away\\",[65] and Breath of the Wild was the most talked-about E3 2016 game on social media according to Brandwatch, a social media monitoring platform.[66] It was also listed among the best games at E3 by Eurogamer,[67] GameSpot,[68] and GamesRadar+.[69][70] At a Nintendo presentation in January 2017, Nintendo showed a new trailer announcing that the game would be released as a launch game for the Switch.[71]\\r\\n\\r\\nBreath of the Wild launched for both the Wii U and Switch on March 3, 2017.[72] It was the last Nintendo game released for the Wii U.[73] The Switch version was available in limited \\"Special Edition\\" and \\"Master Edition\\" bundles, which both included a Sheikah Eye coin, a Calamity Ganon tapestry with world map, a soundtrack CD, and a themed carrying case for the Switch. The Master Edition also included a figurine based on the Master Sword.[74][75][76] An \\"Explorer's Edition\\" was released for the Switch on November 23, 2017, containing a two-sided map and a 100-page book of story information.[77] In Europe, the game used unique packing artwork.[78] A five-disc, 211-track soundtrack was released in Japan on April 25, 2018.[79]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn June 30, 2017, Nintendo released a \\"season pass\\" for two bundled downloadable content (DLC): The Master Trials and The Champions' Ballad.[80][81] The Master Trials adds gameplay modes, features, and items. In the Trial of the Sword challenge, Link fights through around 45 rooms of enemies and must finish each room before proceeding. Link begins with no equipment, but is rewarded with a glowing Master Sword that has greater durability and possesses a doubled damage stat if the player completes the challenge. The pack also adds an option to play the game at a higher difficulty level, which adds ranks and raises the ranks of enemies. The enemies are more perceptive when Link sneaks near them and slowly regenerate health in battle. New floating platforms throughout the land offer enemies to battle and treasure as a reward. The Hero's Path feature draws the player's path on the game's map, designed to help players determine places they have not visited. The player can also find the hidden Travel Medallion to save Link's current position as a single waypoint to which the player can transport Link at any time. New items include the Korok Mask, which helps the player find Korok locations, and other themed cosmetics related to previous Zelda games.[82]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Champions' Ballad was released on December 7, 2017, with a trailer presented at The Game Awards 2017 exhibiting the new content. The expansion pack adds a new dungeon, original story, gear, and additional challenges.[81][83][84] It also introduces the Master Cycle Zero, a motorcycle-like vehicle that Link can ride after players complete the pack's additional content.[85]\\r\\n\\r\\nBreath of the Wild was released to critical acclaim, with some calling the game a masterpiece[106] and one of the greatest video games of all time.[107][108] On the review aggregator Metacritic, Breath of the Wild was the highest-rated game of 2017[109] and holds the largest number of perfect reviews of any game from any year.[110][111][112] Industry publications including IGN,[113] GameSpot,[114] Polygon,[115][116] Entertainment Weekly,[117] Eurogamer,[118] Electronic Gaming Monthly,[119] GamesRadar+,[120] and Game Informer[121] ranked Breath of the Wild the best game of 2017. It was the 29th game (including retrospective perfect scores) to earn a 10/10 score from Edge[89] and the 24th game to receive a 40/40 score from Famitsu.[122]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe open-world gameplay received praise. Jose Otero of IGN described it as \\"a masterclass in open-world design\\" and \\"a wonderful sandbox full of mystery, dangling dozens upon dozens of tantalizing things in front of you that just beg to be explored\\".[6] GameSpot called it the most impressive game Nintendo had made, writing that it \\"takes designs and mechanics perfected in other games and reworks them for its own purposes to create something wholly new, but also something that still feels quintessentially like a Zelda game ... It's both a return to form and a leap into uncharted territory, and it exceeds expectations on both fronts.\\"[5] Edge wrote that the game world was \\"an absolute, and unremitting, pleasure to get lost in\\" and that \\"the magic of being given all the tools in the opening hour is the knowledge that the solution to any problem is already at your disposal, and you can always change tack\\".[89]\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to Kyle Orland of Ars Technica, \\"after spending a week utterly immersed in Nintendo's open-world reimagining of the tried-and-true Zelda formula, it's hard to return to the more formulaic entries of the franchise's past\\".[123] Journalists commented on unexpected results not intended by the developers,[124][125][126] with serendipitous moments proving popular on social media.[127] Chris Plante of The Verge predicted that whereas prior open-world games tended to feature prescribed challenges, Zelda would influence a new generation of games with open-ended problem-solving.[127]\\r\\n\\r\\nReviewers lauded the sense of detail and immersion.[128][124] Kotaku recommended turning off UI elements in praise of the indirect cues that contextually indicate the same information, such as Link shivering in the cold or waypoints appearing when using the scope.[128] Reviewers also commented on the unexpected permutations of interactions between Link, villagers, pets, and enemies,[124][125][126], many of which were shared widely on social media.[127] A tribute to former Nintendo president Satoru Iwata, who died during development, also attracted praise.[124][129]\\r\\n\\r\\nJim Sterling was more critical than most, giving Breath of the Wild a 7/10 score. He criticized the difficulty, weapon durability, and level design, but praised the open world and variety of content.[130] Other criticism focused on the unstable frame rate and the low resolution of 900p;[128][124] updates addressed some of these problems.[131][132]\\r\\n\\r\\nBreath of the Wild broke sales records for a Nintendo launch game in multiple regions.[133][134] In Japan, the Switch and Wii U versions sold a combined 230,000 copies in the first week of release, with the Switch version becoming the top-selling game released that week.[135] In the UK, Breath of the Wild was the second-bestselling retail game its week of release behind Horizon Zero Dawn, and became the third-bestselling Zelda game behind Wind Waker and Twilight Princess.[136][137] In the United States, Breath of the Wild was the second-bestselling video game during its month of release behind Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Wildlands.[138] Nintendo reported that Breath of the Wild sold more than one million copies in the US that month, 925,000 of which were for Switch - a 100% attach rate.[139][140][141][142] That month, Nintendo reported it had sold 3.84 million copies of Breath of the Wild worldwide, 1.08 million for Wii U and 2.76 million for Switch, surpassing the Switch's global sales of 2.74 million for the same period.[143] Nintendo president Tatsumi Kimishima said that the attach rate of Breath of the Wild to the Switch was \\"unprecedented\\".[144] By June 2018, the Switch version had sold 9.32?million copies,[145] and the Wii U version 1.5?million, for a total of 10.82?million, making Breath of the Wild the best-selling Zelda game.[146] By September 2018, the Switch version reached 10.28 million copies sold.[147]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe game's success sparked increased interest in the Wii U emulator Cemu, as the Cemu developers rapidly updated the software to run the game at a smooth frame rate within weeks of release.[148][149][150]\\r\\n\\r\\nFollowing its demonstration at E3 2016, Breath of the Wild received several accolades from the Game Critics Awards[151] and from publications such as IGN and Destructoid.[152][153] It was listed among the best games at E3 by Eurogamer,[67] GameSpot,[68] and GamesRadar+.[69][70] In late 2016, Breath of the Wild received two awards at Gamescom,[154] and won the award for Most Anticipated Game at The Game Awards 2016.[155]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter its release, Breath of the Wild won multiple awards at The Game Awards 2017, including Game of the Year, Best Game Direction, and Best Action/Adventure Game, and was nominated for Best Art Direction, Best Score/Music, and Best Audio Design.[156] At the 2018 DICE Awards, it won Game of the Year among other awards.[157]\\r\\n\\r\\nNotes\\r\\n\\r\\nCitations","input":"What engine was used for breath of the wild?"},{"output":"twenty six","context":"This is a list of the most common U.S. county names, specifically the names with five or more counties sharing the name.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAll of the Washington Counties in the United States are named for George Washington, first President of the United States.\\r\\nTwenty three of the twenty six Jefferson Counties in the United States are directly named for Thomas Jefferson, the third President, and the remaining three are indirectly named for him.\\r\\nTwenty three of the twenty five Franklin Counties in the United States are named for Benjamin Franklin, the famous Founding Father, printer, scientist, philosopher, and diplomat.\\r\\nTwenty one of the twenty four Jackson Counties in the United States are named for Andrew Jackson, the seventh President.\\r\\nSixteen (possibly seventeen) of the twenty four Lincoln Counties in the United States are named for Abraham Lincoln, the sixteenth President; five other Lincoln counties are named for Benjamin Lincoln, a leading general in the American Revolutionary War and distant relative of Abraham.\\r\\nEighteen of the twenty Madison Counties in the United States are named for James Madison, the fourth President, and one of the two exceptions is indirectly named for him.\\r\\nFifteen of the eighteen Clay Counties in the United States are named for Henry Clay, the Kentucky statesman.

Hutton's work was later refined by scientist John Playfair and popularised by geologist Charles Lyell's Principles of Geology in 1830.[9] Today, Earth's history is considered to have been a slow, gradual process, punctuated by occasional natural catastrophic events.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe earlier conceptions[which?] likely[original research?] had little influence on 18th-century European geological explanations for the formation of Earth. Abraham Gottlob Werner (1749ÿ1817) proposed Neptunism, where strata represented deposits from shrinking seas precipitated onto primordial rocks such as granite. In 1785 James Hutton proposed an opposing, self-maintaining infinite cycle based on natural history and not on the Biblical account.[10][11]\\r\\nThe solid parts of the present land appear in general, to have been composed of the productions of the sea, and of other materials similar to those now found upon the shores. Hence we find reason to conclude:\\r\\nHence we are led to conclude, that the greater part of our land, if not the whole had been produced by operations natural to this globe; but that in order to make this land a permanent body, resisting the operations of the waters, two things had been required;\\r\\nHutton then sought evidence to support his idea that there must have been repeated cycles, each involving deposition on the seabed, uplift with tilting and erosion, and then moving undersea again for further layers to be deposited. At Glen Tilt in the Cairngorm mountains he found granite penetrating metamorphic schists, in a way which indicated to him that the presumed primordial rock had been molten after the strata had formed.[13][14] He had read about angular unconformities as interpreted by Neptunists, and found an unconformity at Jedburgh where layers of greywacke in the lower layers of the cliff face have been tilted almost vertically before being eroded to form a level plane, under horizontal layers of Old Red Sandstone.[15] In the spring of 1788 he took a boat trip along the Berwickshire coast with John Playfair and the geologist Sir James Hall, and found a dramatic unconformity showing the same sequence at Siccar Point.[16] Playfair later recalled that \\"the mind seemed to grow giddy by looking so far into the abyss of time\\",[17] and Hutton concluded a 1788 paper he presented at the Royal Society of Edinburgh, later rewritten as a book, with the phrase \\"we find no vestige of a beginning, no prospect of an end\\".[18]\\r\\nBoth Playfair and Hall wrote their own books on the theory, and for decades robust debate continued between Hutton's supporters and the Neptunists. Georges Cuvier's paleontological work in the 1790s, which established the reality of extinction, explained this by local catastrophes, after which other fixed species repopulated the affected areas. In Britain, geologists adapted this idea into \\"diluvial theory\\" which proposed repeated worldwide annihilation and creation of new fixed species adapted to a changed environment, initially identifying the most recent catastrophe as the biblical flood.[19]\\r\\nFrom 1830 to 1833 Charles Lyell's multi-volume Principles of Geology was published. The work's subtitle was \\"An attempt to explain the former changes of the Earth's surface by reference to causes now in operation\\". He drew his explanations from field studies conducted directly before he went to work on the founding geology text,[20] and developed Hutton's idea that the earth was shaped entirely by slow-moving forces still in operation today, acting over a very long period of time. The terms uniformitarianism for this idea, and catastrophism for the opposing viewpoint, were coined by William Whewell in a review of Lyell's book. Principles of Geology was the most influential geological work in the middle of the 19th century.\\r\\nGeoscientists support diverse systems of Earth history, the nature of which rest on a certain mixture of views about process, control, rate, and state which are preferred. Because geologists and geomorphologists tend to adopt opposite views over process, rate and state in the inorganic world, there are eight different systems of beliefs in the development of the terrestrial sphere.[21] All geoscientists stand by the principle of uniformity of law. Most, but not all, are directed by the principle of simplicity. All make definite assertions about the quality of rate and state in the inorganic realm.[22]\\r\\nAccording to Reijer Hooykaas (1963), Lyell's uniformitarianism is a family of four related propositions, not a single idea:[24]\\r\\nNone of these connotations requires another, and they are not all equally inferred by uniformitarians.[25]\\r\\nGould explained Lyell's propositions in Time's Arrow, Time's Cycle (1987), stating that Lyell conflated two different types of propositions: a pair of methodological assumptions with a pair of substantive hypotheses. The four together make up Lyell's uniformitarianism.[26]\\r\\nThe two methodological assumptions below are accepted to be true by the majority of scientists and geologists. Gould claims that these philosophical propositions must be assumed before you can proceed as a scientist doing science. \\"You cannot go to a rocky outcrop and observe either the constancy of nature's laws or the working of unknown processes. It works the other way around.\\" You first assume these propositions and \\"then you go to the outcrop.\\"[27]\\r\\nThe substantive hypotheses were controversial and, in some cases, accepted by few.[26] These hypotheses are judged true or false on empirical grounds through scientific observation and repeated experimental data. This is in contrast with the previous two philosophical assumptions[27] that come before one can do science and so cannot be tested or falsified by science.\\r\\nStephen Jay Gould's first scientific paper, Is uniformitarianism necessary? (1965), reduced these four assumptions to two.[36] He dismissed the first principle, which asserted spatial and temporal invariance of natural laws, as no longer an issue of debate. He rejected the third (uniformity of rate) as an unjustified limitation on scientific inquiry, as it constrains past geologic rates and conditions to those of the present. So, Lyellian uniformitarianism was unnecessary.\\r\\nUniformitarianism was proposed in contrast to catastrophism, which states that the distant past \\"consisted of epochs of paroxysmal and catastrophic action interposed between periods of comparative tranquility\\"[37] Especially in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, most geologists took this interpretation to mean that catastrophic events are not important in geologic time; one example of this is the debate of the formation of the Channeled Scablands due to the catastrophic Missoula glacial outburst floods. An important result of this debate and others was the re-clarification that, while the same principles operate in geologic time, catastrophic events that are infrequent on human time-scales can have important consequences in geologic history.[38] Derek Ager has noted that \\"geologists do not deny uniformitarianism in its true sense, that is to say, of interpreting the past by means of the processes that are seen going on at the present day, so long as we remember that the periodic catastrophe is one of those processes. Those periodic catastrophes make more showing in the stratigraphical record than we have hitherto assumed.\\"[39]\\r\\nEven Charles Lyell thought that ordinary geological processes would cause Niagara Falls to move upstream to Lake Erie within 10,000 years, leading to catastrophic flooding of a large part of North America.\\r\\nModern geologists do not apply uniformitarianism in the same way as Lyell. They question if rates of processes were uniform through time and only those values measured during the history of geology are to be accepted.[40] The present may not be a long enough key to penetrate the deep lock of the past.[41] Geologic processes may have been active at different rates in the past that humans have not observed. \\"By force of popularity, uniformity of rate has persisted to our present day. For more than a century, Lyell's rhetoric conflating axiom with hypotheses has descended in unmodified form. Many geologists have been stifled by the belief that proper methodology includes an a priori commitment to gradual change, and by a preference for explaining large-scale phenomena as the concatenation of innumerable tiny changes.\\"[42]\\r\\nThe current consensus is that Earth's history is a slow, gradual process punctuated by occasional natural catastrophic events that have affected Earth and its inhabitants.[43] In practice it is reduced from Lyell's conflation, or blending, to simply the two philosophical assumptions. This is also known as the principle of geological actualism, which states that all past geological action was like all present geological action. The principle of actualism is the cornerstone of paleoecology.","input":"What scientists is credited with proposing the principle of uniformitarianism?"},{"output":"20 June 1941","context":"The United States Air Force became a separate military service on 18 September 1947 with the implementation of the National Security Act of 1947.[1][2] The Act created the National Military Establishment, later renamed the United States Department of Defense, which was composed of four of the five branches, the Army, Marine Corps, Navy, and a newly created Air Force.[3] Prior to 1947, the responsibility for military aviation was divided between the Army (for land-based operations) and the Navy, and Marine Corps, for sea-based operations from aircraft carrier and amphibious aircraft. The Army created the first antecedent of the Air Force on 1 August 1907, which through a succession of changes of organization, titles, and missions advanced toward eventual separation 40 years later. The predecessor organizations leading up to today's U.S. Air Force are:\\r\\n* The Air Corps became a subordinate element of the Army Air Forces on 20 June 1941, and was abolished as an administrative organization on 9 March 1942. It continued to exist as a branch of the Army (similar to the infantry, quartermaster, or artillery) until reorganization provisions of the National Security Act of 1947 (61 Stat. 495), 26 July 1947.[4]\\r\\n**The Army Air Forces were abolished by Transfer Order 1, Office of the Secretary of Defense, 26 September 1947, implementing the same provisions. Transfer Order 1 was the first of 200 Army-Air Force transfer agreements drawn up in June and July 1947, and ordered the transfer of all military and civilian personnel of the Army Air Forces to the Department of the Air Force and the USAF.[4] The final transfer order was signed 22 June 1949.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1917, upon the United States' entry into World War I, the first major U.S. aviation combat force was created when an Air Service was formed as part of the American Expeditionary Force (AEF). Major General Mason Patrick commanded the Air Service of the AEF; his deputy was Brigadier General Billy Mitchell. These aviation units, some of which were trained in France, provided tactical support for the U.S. Army, especially during the Battle of Saint-Mihiel and the Meuse-Argonne offensives. Among the aces of the AEF Air Service were Captain Eddie Rickenbacker and 2nd Lieutenant Frank Luke. Concurrent with the creation of this combat force, the U.S. Army's aviation establishment in the United States was removed from control of the Signal Corps and placed directly under the United States Secretary of War. An assistant secretary was created to direct the Army Air Service, which had dual responsibilities for development and procurement of aircraft, and raising and training of air units. With the end of the First World War, the AEF's Air Service was dissolved and the Army Air Service in the United States largely demobilized.\\r\\nIn 1920, the Air Service became a branch of the Army and in 1926 was renamed the Army Air Corps. During this period, the Air Corps began experimenting with new techniques, including air-to-air refueling and the development of the B-9 and the Martin B-10, the first all-metal monoplane bombers, and new fighters.\\r\\nAmericans were fascinated with aviation in the 1920s and 1930s and refused to allow War Department conservatism to block innovation. General Billy Mitchell, the deputy director of the Air Service sought to wrest control of coastal defense away from the Navy. He went public insisting that his planes could sink battleships any day, a claim proven with a series of tests that culminated in the sinking of the Ostfriesland. Mitchell lost his self-control in 1925 when he accused the Navy in a press release of \\"incompetency, criminal negligence and almost treasonable administration of the national defense.\\"[5] He received the highly publicized court martial he wanted, and was allowed to expound his theory that air power alone would suffice to win the next big war. He was convicted, and resigned. He became a popular hero and public opinion forced the War Department to strengthen the Air Corps. Mitchell's main argument was air power had to be autonomoushad to be controlled by fliers who understood the new technology, new tactics, new strategies, and who would not waste precious air assets in trying to assist old-fashioned armies and navies. Until his death in 1936 Mitchell, as a civilian, was a tireless prophet of airpower before numerous civilian audiences, but he lost touch with aviation developments and ceased to be influential inside the services.[6] Indeed, his almost hysterical attacks made many generals hostile. The Air Corps managed a few publicity stunts, but always seemed to be overshadowed by glamorous civilians like Charles Lindbergh, Howard Hughes or Amelia Earhart. In 1934 President Franklin Roosevelt, feuding with the airline industry, suddenly turned the delivery of air mail over to the Air Corps. Multiple crashes by inexperienced Air Corps pilots in mediocre planes with poor navigation gear emphasized the fragility of the new service, and undercut its claims that in wartime it could perform miracles. Roosevelt, however, had become a firm believer in air power and had behind him both public opinion and Congress. When mobilization began in spring 1940 Roosevelt was as energetic as anyone in expanding the Air Corps role, calling for 50,000 planes a year, and sending the best new models to Britain for its war against the Luftwaffe.[7]\\r\\nIn 1935, as a result of recommendations from two civilian review boards, the next advancement toward independence for the Air Force occurred when all flying units, which heretofore had been distributed to various ground commands, were grouped together as an aerial task force under one air commander as the General Headquarters Air Force. The Air Corps, headed by the Chief of the Air Corps, continued as before but now held responsibility only for supply, airfields, and training, in effect splitting the Air Force into two parts. Both were commanded by major generals (Frank Andrews and Oscar Westover, followed by Henry H. (\\"Hap\\") Arnold).\\r\\nIn 1937, the B-17 Flying Fortress made its first appearance. In a feat of navigation impressive for the time, three B-17s intercepted the Italian passenger liner Rex at sea. Though intended to demonstrate the ability of the Air Corps to defend the nation's coasts, the mission also indicated the emerging doctrine within the Air Corps of the supremacy of strategic bombing.\\r\\nDuring World War I, aviation technology developed rapidly; however, the Army's reluctance to use the new technology began to make airmen think that as long as the Army controlled aviation, development would be stunted and a potentially valuable force neglected. Air Service senior officer Billy Mitchell began to campaign for an independent Air Force, co-equal to the Army and Navy. But his campaign offended many and resulted in a court martial in 1925 that effectively ended his career. His followers, including future aviation leaders \\"Hap\\" Arnold and Carl Spaatz, saw the lack of public, congressional, and military support that Mitchell received and decided that America was not ready for an independent air force. Under the leadership of its chief of staff Mason Patrick and, later, Arnold, the Air Corps waited until the time to fight for independence arose again.\\r\\nThe Air Force came of age in World War II. President Franklin D. Roosevelt took the lead, calling for a vastly enlarged air force based on long-range strategic bombing. Organizationally it became largely independent from the Army in 1941, when the Army Air Corps became a part of the new U.S. Army Air Forces (AAF), and the GHQ Air Force was redesignated the subordinate Combat Command. In the major reorganization of the Army by War Department Circular 59, effective March 9, 1942, the newly created Army Air Forces gained equal voice with the Army and Navy on the Joint Chiefs of Staff and complete autonomy from the Army Ground Forces and the Services of Supply, serving as a separate service in all but name. The reorganization also eliminated both Combat Command and the Air Corps as organizations (the latter remained a combat branch of the Army until 1947) in favor of a streamlined system of commands and numbered air forces for decentralized management of the burgeoning Army Air Forces.\\r\\nThe reorganization merged all aviation elements of the former Air Corps into the Army Air Forces. Although the Air Corps still legally existed as an Army branch, the position and Office of the Chief of the Air Corps was dissolved.\\r\\nMajor General Carl A. Spaatz took command of the Eighth Air Force in London in 1942; with Brigadier General Ira Eaker as second in command, he supervised the strategic bombing campaign. In late 1943, Spaatz was made commander of the new U.S. Strategic Air Forces, reporting directly to the Combined Chiefs of Staff. Spaatz began daylight bombing operations using the prewar doctrine of flying bombers in close formations, relying on their combined defensive firepower for protection from attacking enemy aircraft rather than supporting fighter escorts. The doctrine proved flawed when deep-penetration missions beyond the range of escort fighters were attempted, because German fighter planes overwhelmed U.S. formations, shooting down bombers in excess of \\"acceptable\\" loss rates, especially in combination with the vast number of flak anti-aircraft batteries defending Germany's major targets. American fliers took heavy casualties during raids on the oil refineries of Ploie?ti, Romania, and the ball-bearing factories at Schweinfurt and Regensburg, Germany, and it was the loss rate in crews and not materiel that brought about a pullback from the strategic offensive in the autumn of 1943.\\r\\nThe Eighth Air Force had attempted to use both the P-47 and P-38 as escorts, but while the Thunderbolt was a capable dog-fighter it lacked the range, even with the addition of drop tanks to extend its range, and the Lightning proved mechanically unreliable in the frigid altitudes at which the missions were fought. Bomber protection was greatly improved after the introduction of North American P-51 Mustang fighters in Europe. With its built-in extended range and competitive or superior performance characteristics in comparison to all existing German piston-engined fighters, the Mustang was an immediately available solution to the crisis. In January 1944 the Eighth Air Force obtained priority in equipping its groups, so that ultimately 14 of its 15 groups fielded Mustangs. P-51 escorts began operations in February 1944 and increased their numbers rapidly, so that the Luftwaffe suffered increasing fighter losses in aerial engagements beginning with Big Week in early 1944. Allied fighters were also granted free rein in attacking German fighter airfields, both in pre-planned missions and while returning to base from escort duties, and the major Luftwaffe threat against Allied bombers was severely diminished by D-Day.\\r\\nIn the Pacific Theater of Operations, the AAF provided major tactical support under General George Kenney to Douglas MacArthur in the Southwest Pacific theater. Kenney's pilots invented the skip-bombing technique against Japanese ships. Kenney's forces claimed destruction of 11,900 Japanese planes and 1.7 million tons of shipping. The first development and sustained implementation of airlift by American air forces occurred between May 1942 and November 1945 as hundreds of transports flew more than half a million tons of supplies from India to China over the Hump.\\r\\nThe AAF created the Twentieth Air Force to employ long-range B-29 Superfortress bombers in strategic attacks on Japanese cities. The use of forward bases in China (needed to be able to reach Japan by the heavily laden B-29's) was ineffective because of the difficulty in logistically supporting the bases entirely by air from its main bases in India, and because of a persistent threat against the Chinese airfields by the Japanese army. After the Mariana Islands were captured in mid-1944, providing locations for air bases that could be supplied by sea, Arnold moved all B-29 operations there by April 1945 and made General Curtis LeMay his bomber commander (reporting directly to Arnold, who personally commanded Twentieth Air Force until July). LeMay reasoned that the Japanese economy, much of which was cottage industry in dense urban areas where manufacturing and assembly plants were also located, was particularly vulnerable to area attack and abandoned inefficient high-altitude precision bombing in favor of low-level incendiary bombings aimed at destroying large urban areas. On the night of March 9ÿ10, 1945, the bombing of Tokyo and the resulting conflagration resulted in the death of over 100,000 persons. 350,000 people died in 66 other Japanese cities as a result of this shift to incendiary bombing. At the same time, the B-29 was also employed in widespread mining of Japanese harbors and sea lanes. In early August 1945, the Twentieth Air Force conducted atomic bomb attacks on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in response to Japan's rejection of the Potsdam Declaration which outlined the terms of surrender for Japan.[8][9] Both cities were destroyed with enormous loss of life and psychological shock. On August 15, Emperor Hirohito announced the surrender of Japan, stating:\\r\\nMoreover, the enemy has begun to employ a new and most cruel bomb, the power of which to do damage is indeed incalculable, taking the toll of many innocent lives. Should We continue to fight, it would not only result in an ultimate collapse and obliteration of the Japanese nation, but also it would lead to the total extinction of human civilization. Such being the case, how are We to save the millions of Our subjects; or to atone Ourselves before the hallowed spirits of Our Imperial Ancestors? This is the reason why We have ordered the acceptance of the provisions of the Joint Declaration of the Powers.\\r\\nIn practice, the Army Air Forces became virtually independent of the Army during World War II, but its leaders wanted formal independence. In November 1945, General Dwight D. Eisenhower became Army Chief of Staff, while General Carl Spaatz began to assume the duties of Commanding General, Army Air Forces, in anticipation of General Arnolds announced retirement. One of General Eisenhowers first actions was to appoint a board of officers, headed by Lieutenant General William H. Simpson, to prepare a definitive plan for the reorganization of the Army and the Air Force that could be effected without enabling legislation and would provide for the separation of the Air Force from the Army. On 29 January 1946 \\"Generals Eisenhower and Spaatz agreed on an Air Force organization composed of Strategic Air Command, Air Defense Command, Tactical Air Command, Air Transport Command, Air Technical Service Command, Air Training Command, the Air University, and the Air Force Center.\\"[10]\\r\\nOver the continuing objections of the Navy, which feared losing its air arm and strategic role to the new service, the United States Department of the Air Force was created by the National Security Act of 1947. That act became effective 18 September 1947 when the first secretary of the Air Force, Stuart Symington, took office. In 1948, the service chiefs agreed on usage of air assets under the Key West Agreement.\\r\\n\\"In 1947 President Truman signed the National Security Act which established this new defense organization, and along with it the creation of the US Air Force as an independent service, equal to the US Army and US Navy. The official birthday of the US Air Force is 18 September 1947.\\"[11]\\r\\nOn 18 September 1947, the Army Air Forces became the United States Air Force as a separate and equal element of the United States Armed Forces. The fledgling Air Force quickly established its own identity. Army Air Fields were renamed Air Force Bases and personnel were soon being issued new uniforms with new rank insignia. Once the new Air Force was free of army domination, its first job was to discard the old and inadequate ground army organizational structure. This was the \\"Base Plan\\" where the combat group commander reported to the base commander, who was often regular army, with no flying experience.\\r\\nGeneral Carl A. Spaatz established a new policy, \\"No tactical commander should be subordinate to the station commander.\\" This resulted in a search for a better arrangement. The commander of the 15th Air Force, Major General Charles Born,[12] proposed the Provisional Wing Plan, which basically reversed the situation and put the wing commander over the base commander. The USAF basic organizational unit became the Base-Wing.\\r\\nUnder this plan, the base support functions ÿ supply, base operations, transportation, security, and medical were assigned to squadrons, usually commanded by a Major or Lieutenant Colonel. All of these squadrons were assigned to a Combat Support Group, commanded by a Base Commander, usually a Colonel. Combat fighter or bomber squadrons were assigned to the Combat Group, a retention of the USAAF Group. All of these groups, both combat and combat support, were in turn assigned to the Wing, commanded by a Wing Commander. This way the Wing Commander commanded both the combat operational elements on the base as well as the non-operational elements. The Wing Commander was an experienced air combat leader, usually a Colonel or Brigadier General. All of the hierarchical organizations carried the same numerical designation. In this manner, for example, the 28th became the designation for the Wing and all the subordinate groups and squadrons beneath it. As a result, the base and the wing became one and the same unit. On 16 June 1952, the legacy combat groups were inactivated and the operational Combat Squadrons were assigned directly to the Wing. The World War II history, lineage and honors of the combat group were bestowed on the Wing upon its inactivation.\\r\\nThe USAAF Wing then was redesignated as an Air Division, which was commanded Brigadier General or higher, who commanded two or more wings usually, but not always, on a single base. Numbered Air Forces (NAF) commanded both Air Divisions or Wings directly, and the NAF was under the Major Command (SAC, TAC, ADC, etc.).\\r\\nAfter World War II, relations between the United States and the Soviet Union began to deteriorate, and the period in history known as the Cold War began. The United States entered an arms race with the Soviet Union and competition aimed at increasing each nation's influence throughout the world. In response, the United States expanded its military presence throughout the world. The USAF opened air bases throughout Europe, and later in Japan and South Korea. The United States also built air bases on the British overseas territories of British Indian Ocean Territory and Ascension Island in the South Atlantic.\\r\\nThe first test for the USAF during the Cold War came in 1948, when Communist authorities in East Germany cut off road and air transportation to West Berlin. The USAF, along with the Royal Air Force (RAF) and Commonwealth air forces, supplied the city during the Berlin airlift under Operation Vittles, using C-54 Skymasters. The efforts of these air forces saved the city from starvation and forced the Soviets to back down in their blockade.\\r\\nConflict over post-war military administration, especially with regard to the roles and missions to be assigned to the Air Force and the U.S. Navy, led to an episode called the \\"Revolt of the Admirals\\" in the late 1940s, in which high-ranking Navy officers argued unsuccessfully for the case for carrier-based aircraft rather than strategic bombers.\\r\\nIn 1947, the USAF began Project Sign, a study of unidentified flying objects what would be twice revived (first as Project Grudge and finally as Project Blue Book) and which would last until 1969.[13]\\r\\nIn 1948 the Women's Armed Services Integration Act gave women permanent status in the Regular and Reserve forces of the Air Force.[14] On 8 July 1948, Esther McGowin Blake became the first woman in the Air Force, enlisting the first minute of the first hour of the first day regular Air Force duty was authorized for women.[14][15][16]\\r\\nDuring the Korean War, which began in June 1950, the Far East Air Forces (FEAF) were among the first units to respond to the invasion by North Korea, but quickly lost its main airbase at Kimpo, South Korea. Designated to provide close air support to the defenders of the Pusan pocket from bases in Japan, the FEAF also conducted a strategic bombing campaign against North Korea's war-making potential simultaneously. General Douglas MacArthur's landing at Inchon in September 1950 enabled the FEAF to return to Korea and develop bases from which they supported MacArthur's drive to the Korean-Chinese border.\\r\\nWhen the Chinese People's Liberation Army attacked in December 1950, the USAF provided tactical air support. The introduction of Soviet-made MiG-15 jet fighters caused problems for the B-29s used to bomb North Korea, but the USAF countered the MiGs with its new F-86 Sabre jet fighters. Although both air superiority and close air support missions were successful, a lengthy attempt to interdict communist supply lines by air attack was not as successful and was replaced by a systematic campaign to inflict as much economic cost to North Korea and the Chinese forces as long as war persisted, including attacks on the capital city of Pyongyang and against the North Korean hydroelectric system.\\r\\nThe USAF was heavily deployed during the Vietnam War. The first bombing raids against North Vietnam occurred in 1964, following the Gulf of Tonkin Incident. In March 1965, a sustained bombing campaign began, code-named Operation Rolling Thunder. This campaign's purpose was to destroy the will of the North Vietnamese to fight, destroy industrial bases and air defenses, and to stop the flow of men and supplies down the Ho Chi Minh Trail, while forcing North Vietnam into peace negotiations. The USAF dropped more bombs in all combat operations in Vietnam during the period 1965ÿ68 than it did during World War II,[17] and the Rolling Thunder campaign lasted until the U.S. presidential election of 1968. Except for heavily damaging the North Vietnamese economy and infrastructure, Rolling Thunder failed in its political and strategic goals.\\r\\nThe USAF also played a critical role in defeating the Easter Offensive of 1972. The rapid redeployment of fighters, bombers, and attack aircraft help the South Vietnamese Army repel the invasion. Operation Linebacker demonstrated to both the North and South Vietnamese that even without significant U.S. Army ground forces, the United States could still influence the war. The air war for the United States ended with Operation Linebacker II, also known as the \\"Christmas Bombings.\\" These helped to finalize the Paris peace negotiations.\\r\\nThe insurgent nature of combat operations early in the war, and the necessity of interdicting the North Vietnamese regular army and its supply lines in third-party countries of Southeast Asia led to the development of a significant special operations capability within the USAF. Provisional and experimental concepts such as air commandos and aerial gunships, tactical missions such as the partially successful Operation Ivory Coast deep inside enemy territory, and a dedicated Combat Search and Rescue mission resulted in development of operational doctrines, units, and equipment.\\r\\nThe USAF modernized its tactical air forces in the late 1970s with the introduction of the F-15, A-10, and F-16 fighters, and the implementation of realistic training scenarios under the aegis of Red Flag. In turn, it also upgraded the equipment and capabilities of its Air Reserve Components (ARC) by the equipping of both the Air National Guard and Air Force Reserve with first-line aircraft.\\r\\nExpanding its force structure in the 1980s to 40 fighter wings and drawing further on the lessons of the Vietnam War, the USAF also dedicated units and aircraft to Electronic Warfare (EW) and the Suppression of Enemy Air Defenses (SEAD). The humiliating failure in April 1980 of the Operation Eagle Claw rescue mission in Iran resulted directly in an increased USAF emphasis on participation in the doctrine, equipment, personnel, and planning of Joint Special Operations.\\r\\nThe USAF provided attack, airlift, and combat support capability for operations in Grenada in 1983 (Operation Urgent Fury), Libya in 1986 (Operation El Dorado Canyon), and Panama in 1989 (Operation Just Cause). Lessons learned in these operations were applied to its force structure and doctrine, and became the basis for successful air operations in the 1990s and after September 11, 2001.\\r\\nThe development of satellite reconnaissance during the Cold War, the extensive use of both tactical and strategic aerial reconnaissance during numerous combat operations, and the nuclear war deterrent role of the USAF resulted in the recognition of space as a possible combat arena. An emphasis on \\"aerospace\\" operations and doctrine grew in the 1980s. Missile warning and space operations were combined to form Air Force Space Command in 1982. In 1991, Operation Desert Storm provided emphasis for the command's new focus on supporting combat operations.\\r\\nThe creation of the internet and the universality of computer technology as a basic warfighting tool resulted in the priority development of cyber warfare techniques and defenses by the USAF.\\r\\nThe USAF provided the bulk of the Allied air power during the Gulf War in 1991, flying alongside aircraft of the U.S. Navy and the RAF. The F-117 Nighthawk stealth fighter's capabilities were shown on the first night of the air war when it was able to bomb central Baghdad and avoid the sophisticated Iraqi anti-aircraft defenses. The USAF, along with the U.S. Navy and the RAF, later patrolled the skies of northern and southern Iraq after the war to ensure that Iraq's air defense capability could not be rebuilt. Operation Provide Comfort 1991-96 and Operation Northern Watch 1997-2003 - no-fly zones north of the 36th parallel north and Operation Southern Watch - no-fly zone south of the 33rd parallel north.\\r\\nFaced with declining budgets for personnel and resources in the late 1990s, the Air Force realized that it had to change the way it did business if it was to remain in business providing air power in support of America's national and international interests.\\r\\nIn the mid-1990s, the Air Force was carrying out the \\"deny-flight\\" patrols of Operations Northern and Southern Watch over Iraq. These air patrols were tedious and placed additional burdens on an Air Force that had been significantly downsized after the end of the Cold War and Operation Desert Storm.\\r\\nAs the mission continued into one of multi-year duration, the drain on equipment and manpower forced the Air Force to reconsider how it was going to meet its future worldwide commitments. The Air Expeditionary Force (AEF) concept was developed that would mix Active-Duty, Reserve and Air National Guard into a combined force. Instead of entire permanent units deploying for years on end, units composed of \\"aviation packages\\" from several wings, including active-duty Air Force, the Air Force Reserve Command and the Air National Guard, would be married together to carry out the assigned deployment rotation.\\r\\nIn this way, the Air Force and its reserve components did not have to provide complete units of their own to meet the requirements placed before it by the Air Staff and the combatant commanders. Unlike the overseas major commands already established such as PACAF or USAFE, CENTAF (later AFCENT) would not consist of permanently assigned units. Instead of the \\"Provisional\\" deployed units attached to the command during the 1991 (Persian) Gulf War, \\"Air Expeditionary\\" units would be the force projection components of CENTAF.\\r\\nAir Expeditionary Force units are composed primarily of Air Combat Command or ACC gained components, but also components deployed from other major commands as necessary to meet mission requirements. AEF organizations are defined as temporary in nature, organized to meet a specific mission or national commitment. As such, they are activated and inactivated as necessary and do not carry any official lineage or history.\\r\\nKnowing that overseas basing was not something that could always be counted on due to the volatility of U.S. relations with host nations, the Air Force decided that keeping units fixed in static locations was no longer a viable option. Instead of using the Cold War model of a large number of permanent bases with units assigned, the Air Force modified its war plans to include the use of fewer, temporary bases that would be used by multiple AEF units rotating in for a finite amount of time then inactivating afterwards.\\r\\nAnother not-to-be-forgotten benefit of the Air Expeditionary Force concept, at least for the reserve components - is that their members are all volunteers. When an AFRC or ANG unit is assigned to the AEF rotation cycle, it is the unit's responsibility to obtain the needed personnel to fulfill the requirement. Other than units activated by presidential order, the utilization of ANG and AFRC personnel to support the AEF rotation cycles has always been accomplished on a completely voluntary basis.\\r\\nIn addition, the various Air Expeditionary Wings formed by the Air Force for the purpose of meeting the various deployment rotations allowed the deployment burden to remote combat areas of AFCENT be spread more evenly over the total force, while providing meaningful training opportunities for reserve component units that otherwise would not have had them.\\r\\nIn 1996, Operation Desert Strike and 1998 Operation Desert Fox, the USAF bombed Saddam Hussein's Iraq.\\r\\nThe USAF led NATO action in Bosnia with no-fly zones (Operation Deny Flight) 1993-96 and in 1995 with air strikes against the Bosnian Serbs (Operation Deliberate Force). This was the first time that USAF aircraft took part in military action as part of a NATO mission. The USAF led the strike forces as the NATO Air Force (otherwise mainly composed of RAF and Luftwaffe aircraft) with the greatest capability to launch air strikes over a long period of time. In 1999, the USAF led NATO air strikes against Serbia during the Kosovo War (Operation Allied Force).\\r\\nIn 2001, the USAF was deployed against the Taliban forces in Afghanistan. Operating from Diego Garcia, B-52 Stratofortress and B-1 Lancer bombers attacked Taliban positions. The USAF deployed daisy cutter bombs, dropped from C-130 Hercules cargo planes, for the first time since the Vietnam War. During this conflict, the USAF opened up bases in Central Asia for the first time.\\r\\nThe USAF was deployed in the 2003 invasion of Iraq. Following the defeat of Saddam Husseins regime, the USAF took over Baghdad International Airport as a base. USAF aircraft are used to provide support to Coalition and Iraqi forces in major operations to eliminate insurgent centers of activity and supply in north and west Iraq. Operations in both Afghanistan and Iraq demonstrated the effective utility of Unmanned air vehicles, the most prominent of which was the MQ-1 Predator. Fifty-four USAF personnel died in the Iraq War.[18]\\r\\nThe USAF maintains a Combined Air & Space Operations Center in Qatar to direct air combat operations and Predator actions.[19][20][21]\\r\\nIn March 2011, USAF jets bombed military targets in Libya as part of the international effort to enforce a United Nations resolution that imposed no-fly zone over the country and protected its people from the civil war that occurred when its dictator, Muammar Gaddafi suppressed the protests calling for the end of his regime. Protests were inspired by the revolutions in Tunisia and Egypt.\\r\\nIn the summer of 2014 President Obama announced the return of US Forces to Iraq. The US Air Force is undertaking a significant humanitarian effort in order to assist Iraq's imperiled minority groups.[22] When permission was later granted for USAF airstrikes, it was on condition that the types of aircraft not be announced so as to obscure which countries they were based in.[23]\\r\\nToday, the United States Air Force is the largest, most capable, and most technologically advanced air force in the world, with about 5,778 manned aircraft in service, approximately 156 Unmanned Combat Air Vehicles, 2,130 Air-Launched Cruise Missiles, and 450 intercontinental ballistic missiles. The USAF has 328,439 personnel on active duty, 74,000 in the Selected and Individual Ready Reserves, and 106,000 in the Air National Guard. In addition, the Air Force employs 168,900 civilian personnel including indirect hire of foreign nationals. However, after two decades of failure to recapitalize its aircraft under Clinton and the two Bushes, the USAF has its oldest and most outdated fleet ever. Tactical aircraft purchases were put off while Fifth-generation jet fighters were facing delays, cost overruns and cutbacks and the programs to replace the 1950s bomber and tanker fleets have just been started over again after many aborted attempts.[24]\\r\\nAn Air Force fighter pilot died 20 February 2008 after two F-15C jets collided during a training exercise over the Gulf of Mexico.[25]\\r\\nThe U.S. Air Force on 29 February 2008 announced one of the largest military acquisition programs in U.S. history, saying the service had chosen Northrop Grumman over Boeing to replace its aging air refueling tanker fleet.[26]\\r\\nThe pilot of an F-16C fighter General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon#F-16C/D jet that crashed in a remote area about 80 miles northwest of Phoenix, Arizona was killed when his plane went down. The plane was spotted late 13 March 2008. Rescuers could reach the site only by helicopter and arrived at daybreak 15 March 2008. There have been 17 other crashes of Luke Air Force Base F-16s since 1998, and only one of those resulted in a fatality. That crash happened in May 2004, when a pilot with the Republic of Singapore Air Force died after his jet went down during a training mission at an Air Force bombing range in southwest Arizona. The most recent crashes came in 2006. A pilot ejected safely from an F-16 in April 2006 after the lone engine on the jet exploded just after takeoff from the base. The aircraft came down in a cornfield.[27]\\r\\nOn 5 June 2008 Robert Gates announced the results of an investigation into the misshipment of four MK-12 forward-section reentry vehicle assemblies to Taiwan. The investigation, conducted by Admiral Kirkland H. Donald, director of the US Naval Nuclear Propulsion Program, found that the Taiwan missile incident was, in Gates' words, \\"A degradation of the authority, standards of excellence and technical competence within the nation's ICBM force. Similar to the bomber-specific August 2007 Minot-Barksdale nuclear weapons transfer incident, this incident took place within the larger environment of declining Air Force nuclear mission focus and performance\\" and that \\"the investigation identified commonalities between the August 2007 Minot incident and this [the Taiwan] event.\\" In his investigation report, Donald stated that the issues identified by his investigation were, \\"Indicative of an overall decline in Air Force nuclear weapons stewardship, a problem that has been identified but not effectively addressed for over a decade. Both the Minot-Barksdale nuclear weapons transfer incident and the Taiwan misshipment, while different in specifics, have a common origin: the gradual erosion of nuclear standards and a lack of effective oversight by Air Force leadership\\"[28]\\r\\nAs a result of the investigation, Gates announced that, \\"A substantial number of Air Force general officers and colonels have been identified as potentially subject to disciplinary measures, ranging from removal from command to letters of reprimand,\\" and that he had accepted the resignations of USAF Secretary Michael Wynne and USAF Chief of Staff Michael Moseley. Gates added that he had asked James R. Schlesinger to lead a senior-level task force to recommend improvements in the stewardship and operation of nuclear weapons, delivery vehicles and sensitive components by the US DoD. Members of the task force came from the Defense Policy Board and the Defense Science Board.[29]\\r\\nIn 2012, the USAF discovered that their billion dollar investment in the Expeditionary Combat Support System \\"has not yielded any significant military capability\\" and that it would take another billion dollar investment to gain even one quarter of the planned capability.[30]\\r\\nIn 2012 the USAF received push back from the Congress over a plan to retire multiple reserve squadrons, leading to the formation of the National Commission on the Structure of the Air Force to resolve the proper balance between active and reserve air forces.[31] This was followed in 2013 by the Total Force Task Force in an attempt to handle budget disagreements between the active and reserve forces.[32]\\r\\nIn 2014, the USAF's 30 year strategy document cited a need for both low end and high end capabilities, and so called for cuts in high demand UAVs in favor of retaining \\"outdated fighter aircraft that would not be survivable in a high end conflict\\".[33]","input":"When did the army air corps become air force?"},{"output":"thin, flexible polystyrene plastic (#6) sheets","context":"Shrinky Dinks are a children's toy and activity kit consisting of large flexible sheets which, when heated in an oven, shrink to small hard plates without altering their color or shape. They reached the height of their popularity in the 1980s. Most sets are pre-printed with outline images of popular children's characters or other subjects, which are then colored in before baking.\\r\\nShrinky Dinks were invented in 1973 by two housewives (Betty Morris and Kate Bloomberg) of Brookfield, Wisconsin, as a Cub Scout project with their sons.[1] The first kits were sold at a local shopping mall and became very popular. Shrinky Dinks were soon licensed to be manufactured by the major toy companies of the time such as Milton Bradley, Colorforms, Western Publishing and Skyline Toys. The shrink plastic is still available from many retailers and can be used for anything from charms to pins.\\r\\nThe base material consists of thin, flexible polystyrene plastic (#6) sheets.[2] Prior to heating, the plastic sheets can be colored with felt-tip pens, acrylic paint, colored pencils, etc. and cut into shapes. However, oily or waxy substances (such as cheap colored pencils, crayons, or oil paint) are not suitable because they melt or burn in high heat. When heated with the Easy-Bake Oven, a conventional oven, or a heat gun, the plastic shrinks by about five-eighths and becomes thicker and more rigid, while retaining the colored design.\\r\\nAlthough Shrinky Dinks are primarily an arts and crafts product marketed for children, many adult crafters and artists find the product to be suitable for jewelry making and other projects. Blank sheets are available in bulk for this purpose, and Shrinky Dinks have, rather unexpectedly, become a serious artistic medium.[3]\\r\\nIn 2008, University of California, Irvine Professor Michelle Khine applied Shrinky Dinks to create tiny structures for the application of microfluidics to topics such as stem cell research.[4]\\r\\nIn 2009, an art therapy supervision class at Emporia State University explored the use of Shrinky Dinks in art therapy.[5] In 2014, Shrinky Dinks were presented as an art therapy media in a workshop at the American Art Therapy Association Conference.[6]\\r\\nIn 2014, a team from Harvard University and MIT used Shrinky Dinks to create self-assembling robots.[7]\\r\\nIn 1992, the California rock band Sugar Ray formed with the name \\"Shrinky Dinx\\", but later changed it upon threat of lawsuit from Milton Bradley.[8]","input":"What kind of plastic are shrinky-dinks made of?"},{"output":"the Tiv language","context":"Benue State is a state in the mid-belt region of Nigeria with a population of about 4,253,641 in 2006 census. It is inhabited predominantly by the Tiv and Idoma peoples, who speak the Tiv language and Idoma, respectively. The Tiv's comprises the Etulo's while the Idoma's comprises the Ufia's (Utonkon), the Igede's, and the Agatu's. There are other ethnic groups, including the Igede, Etulo, Abakwa,[2] Jukun, Hausa, Igbo, Akweya and Nyifon. With its capital at Makurdi, Benue is a rich agricultural region; some of the crops grown there are potatoes, cassava, soya bean, guinea corn, flax, yams, sesame, rice, and groundnuts.\\r\\nBenue State is named after the Benue River and was formed from the former Benue-Plateau State in 1976, along with Igala and some part of Kwara State. In 1991 some areas of Benue state (mostly Igala area), along with areas in Kwara State, were carved out to become part of the new Kogi State. Igbo people are found in the boundary areas of Ebonyi State and Enugu State in local government areas like the Obi, Oju etc.\\r\\nSamuel Ortom is the governor and Benson Abounu is the deputy governor. Both are All Progressives Congress (APC) members.[3]\\r\\nBenue state has three universities: Federal University of Agriculture, Makurdi, Benue State University, Makurdi, and University of Mkar, Mkar, Gboko. It has two polytechnics: Benue State Polytechnic, Ugbokolo and Fidei polytechnic, Gboko as well as the Akperan Orshi college of Agriculture Yandev. There are about four colleges of education which are Federal College of Education Agasha, College of Education Oju, College of Education Kastina Ala. Benue State as it exists today is a surviving legacy of an administrative entity which was carved out of the protectorate of northern Nigeria at the beginning of the twentieth century. The territory was initially known as Munshi Province until 1918 when the name of its dominant geographical feature, the 'Benue River' was adopted.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe State has a total population of 4,253,641 in 2006 census, with an average population density of 99 persons per km2. This makes Benue the 9th most populous state in Nigeria. However, the distribution of the population according to Local government areas shows marked duality.\\r\\nThere are areas of low population density . such as Guma, Gwer East, Ohimini, Katsina-Ala, Apa, Logo and Agatu, each with less than seventy persons per km2, while Vandeikya, Okpokwu, Ogbadibo, Obi and Gboko have densities ranging from 140 persons to 200 persons per km2. Makurdi LGA has over 380 person per km2. The males are 49.8 percent of the total population while females constitute 50.2 per cent.\\r\\nBenue State region was depleted of its human population during the slave trade. It is largely rural, with scattered settlements mainly in tiny compounds or homesteads, whose population range from 630 people, most of whom are farmers.\\r\\nUrbanization in Benue State did not predate the colonial era. The few towns established during colonial rule remained very small(less than 30,000 people) up to the creation of Benue State in 1976.\\r\\nBenue towns can be categorised into three groups. The first group consists of those with a population of 80,000 to 500,000 people. These include Makurdi, the State Capital, Gboko and Otukpo the \\"headquarters\\" of the two dominant ethnic groups (125,944 and 88,958 people respectively). The second group comprises towns with a population of between 20,000 and 50,000 people and includes Katsina-Ala, Zaki-Biam, Ukum and Adikpo, Kwande. These are all local government headquarters. The third category comprises towns with a population of 10,000 to 19,000 people and includes Vandeikya, Lessel, lhugh, Naka, Adoka, Aliade, Okpoga, lgumale, Oju, Utonkon, Ugbokolo, Wannune, Ugbokpo, Otukpa, Ugba and Korinya. Most of these towns are headquarters of recently created Local Government Areas and/or district headquarters or major market areas. Some of the headquarters of the newly created LGAs have populations of less than 10,000 people. Such places include Tse-Agberaba, Gbajimba, Buruku, Idekpa, Obagaji and Obarikeito. Apart from earth roads, schools, periodic markets and chemists(local drug stores), the rural areas are largely used for farming, relying on the urban centres for most of their urban needs. Benue State has no problem of capital city primacy. Rather, three towns stand out very clearly as important urban centres which together account for more than 70 per cent of the social amenities provided in the state and almost all the industrial establishments. These centres are Makurdi, Gboko and Otukpo. They are amongst the oldest towns in the state and are growing at a much faster rate than the smaller younger towns.\\r\\nMakurdi doubles as the capital of the state and the headquarters of Makurdi LGA, while Gboko and Otukpo double as local government and ethnic headquarters (i.e. for Tiv and Idoma tribes respectively). All the roads in the state radiate from these three centres. As an administrative unit, Benue State was first created on 3 February 1976. It was one of the seven states created by the military administration headed by General Murtala Mohammed, which increased the number of states in the country from 13 to 19. In 1991, its boundaries were re-adjusted with the creation of Kogi State. The new Benue State of today has twenty (23) local government areas, which are administered by local government councils.\\r\\nBenue State lies within the lower river Benue trough in the middle belt region of Nigeria. Its geographic coordinates are longitude 7 47' and 10 0' East. Latitude 6 25' and 8 8' North; and shares boundaries with five other states namely: Nasarawa State to the north, Taraba State to the east, Cross-River State to the south, Enugu State to the south-west and Kogi State to the west. The state also shares a common boundary with the Republic of Cameroon on the south-east. Benue occupies a landmass of 34,059 square kilometres.\\r\\nBased on K?ppen climate classification, Benue State lies within the AW climate and experiences two distinct seasons, the Wet season and the Dry season. The rainy season lasts from April to October with annual rainfall in the range of 100-200mm. The dry season begins in November and ends in March. Temperatures fluctuate between 21 ÿ 37 degrees Celsius in the year. The south-eastern part of the state adjoining the Obudu-Cameroun mountain range, however, has a cooler climate similar to that of the Jos Plateau.\\r\\nMuch of Benue State falls within the Benue Valley/trough which is believed to be structurally developed. During the Tertiary and possibly the Interglacial periods of the Quaternary glaciation, the Benue and Niger Valleys, otherwise known as the Niger/Benue trough, were transgressed by the waters of the Atlantic Ocean. As a result, marine sediments form the dominant surface geology of much of Benue State.\\r\\nBenue State is blessed with abundant mineral resources. These resources are distributed in the Local Government Areas of the state. Of these mineral resources, only Limestone at Tse-Kucha near Gboko and Kaolinite at Otukpo are being commercially exploited. Other mineral deposits include Baryte, Gypsum, Feldspar, Wolframite, Kaolinite, mineral salts and Gemstone etc.\\r\\nBenue State is the nations acclaimed food basket because of its rich agricultural produce which include Yam, Rice, Beans, Cassava, Sweet-potato, Maize, Soybean, Sorghum, Millet, Sesame, cocoyam etc. The state accounts for over 70% of Nigeria's Soybean production.\\r\\nAgriculture is the mainstay of the economy, engaging over 75% of the state farming population. The State also boasts of one of the longest stretches of river systems in the country with great potential for a viable fishing industry, dry season farming through irrigation and for an inland water highway.\\r\\nThe vegetation of the southern parts of the state is characterised by forests, which yield trees for timber and provide a suitable habitat for rare animals types and species. The state thus possesses potential for the development of viable forest and wildlife reserves.\\r\\nThe land is generally low lying (averaging 100m-250m) and gently undulating with occasional inselbergs, Knoll, Laterite etc. It is only at the boundary area with Cameroon, also Kwande and Oju Local Government Areas that hilly terrain with appreciable local relief is encountered. Here, the terrain is characterised by steep slopes, deep incised valleys and generally rugged relief. Elsewhere, gradients average less than 4. River Benue is the dominant geographical feature in the state. It is one of the few large rivers in Nigeria. The Katsina-Ala is the largest tributary, while the smaller rivers include Mkomon, Amile, Duru, Loko Konshisha, Kpa, Okpokwu, Mu, Be, Aya, Apa Ogede and Ombi. The flood plains which are characterised by extensive swamps and ponds are good for dry season irrigated farming.\\r\\nThough Benue State has high drainage density many of the streams are seasonal. Hence, there is an acute water shortage in the dry season in Local Government Areas such as Guma, Okpokwu, Ogbadibo, Gwer West (Naka, Nigeria) and Oju.\\r\\nThe state is populated by several ethnic groups: Tiv, Idoma, Igede, Etulo, Abakpa, Jukun, Hausa, Igbo, Akweya and Nyifon. The Tiv are the dominant ethnic group, occupying 14 local government areas with the Etulo and Jukun , while the Idoma, Igede, Igbo, Akweya and Nyifon occupy the remaining nine local government areas.\\r\\nMost of the people are farmers while the inhabitants of the river areas engage in fishing as their primary or important secondary occupation. The people of the state are famous for their cheerful and hospitable disposition as well as rich cultural heritage.\\r\\nThe Benue State Government accords high respect to traditional rulers in recognition of their role as custodians of culture and as agents of development. Also, their roles in enhancing peace and order at the grassroots level are also recognised. To enhance their contribution to the affairs of the state, government has established a three-tier traditional council system made up of Local Government Area Traditional Councils, Area Traditional Councils and the State Council of Chiefs with the Tor Tiv (Tiv king) as chairman.\\r\\nThe two Area Councils are the Tiv Traditional Council and the Idoma Traditional Council. The former has the Tor Tiv(Tiv King) as chairman of all the traditional rulers from the Tiv dominant Local Government Areas, while the latter has the Och' Idoma (Idoma king) as the chairman of all the traditional rulers from the Idoma dominant Local Government Areas.\\r\\nThe State Council of Chiefs had the Tor Tiv, Orchivirigh Professor James Ortese Iorzua Ayatse (Tor Tiv V) ([4]), with Och'Idoma and all second class Chiefs/Chairmen of the Local Government Traditional Council as members.\\r\\nBenue State possesses a rich and diverse cultural heritage which finds expression in colourful cloths, exotic masquerades, supplicated music and dances. Traditional dances from Benue State have won acclaim at national and international cultural festivals. The most popular of these dances include Ingyough, Ange, Anchanakupa, Swange and Ogirinya among others.\\r\\nThe socio-religious festivals of the people, colourful dances, dresses and songs are also of tourist value. The Alekwu ancestral festival of the Idoma people, for instance, is an occasion when the local people believe their ancestors re-established contact with the living in the form of masquerades.\\r\\nThe lgede-Agba is a Yam Festival, marked every year in September by the lgede people of Oju and Obi local government areas. Among the Tiv, the Tiv Day, marriage ceremonies and dance competitions (e.g. Swange dance) are often very colourful. Kwagh-hir is a very entertaining Tiv puppet show.\\r\\nSocial life in Benue State is also enriched by the availability of diverse recreational facilities. Apart from parks, beaches, dancing and masquerades mentioned above, the big hotels in Makurdi, Gboko and Otukpo are equipped with several indoor sporting facilities. There are golf clubs, the Makurdi Club, Railway Club, Police Club and Air Force Club, where, apart from the sale of drinks and snacks, various types of games are played.\\r\\nThere is a standard Arts Theatre, a modern Sports Complex which includes the Aper Aku Stadium, which has provisions for such games as tennis, basketball, volleyball and handball, an indoor sports hall and Olympic size swimming pool in Makurdi. A Smaller stadia exist in Gboko (J. S. Tarka Stadium), Katsina-Ala, Adikpo, Vandeikya and Otukpo. The BCC Lawn Tennis tournament attracts players from all over the country. Benue State has three teams in the professional soccer ranks, Lobi Stars F.C. in Division One, BCC Lions FC in Division Two, Mark mentors as the basketball premier league team.\\r\\nMakurdi, the state capital was established in the early twenties and gained prominence in 1927 when it became the headquarters of the then Benue Province. Being a river port, it attracted the establishment of trading depots by companies such as United Africa Company of Nigeria and John Holt plc. Its commercial status was further enhanced when the Railway Bridge was completed and opened in 1932. In 1976, the town became the capital of Benue State and today, doubles as the headquarters of Makurdi Local Government Area.\\r\\nThe town is divided by the River Benue into the north and south banks, which are connected by two bridges: the railway bridge, which was built in 1932, and the new dual carriage bridge commissioned in 1978.\\r\\nThe southern part of the town is made up of several wards, including Central Ward, Old GRA, Ankpa Ward, Wadata Ward, High Level, Wurukum (Low Level), New GRA etc. Important establishments and offices located here include the Government House, The State Secretariat, The Federal Secretariat, The Central Bank of Nigeria Regional headquarters, Commercial Banks, Telecommunication companies, Police Headquarters, Nigeria Prisons Service, Aper Aku Stadium, Nigeria Air force Base, Makurdi, The Makurdi Modern Market, the Federal Medical Centre, Nigeria Railway Station, Benue Printing and Publishing Company Limited, Radio Benue, Nigerian Television Authority (NTA), Nigerian Postal service, Benue Hotels Makurdi, Benue Plaza hotel, Benue State University, Benue State Breweries.\\r\\nThe North bank area of the town houses among other establishments, the Federal University of Agriculture, the Nigerian Army School of Military Engineering, the headquarters of the 72 Airborne Battalion and the State Headquarters of the Department of Customs and Excise.\\r\\nOwing to its location in the valley of River Benue, Makurdi experiences warm temperatures most of the year. The period from November to January, when the harmattan weather is experienced is, however, relatively cool.\\r\\nMakurdi can be reached by air, rail, road and water. The major northern route is the Makurdi ÿ Lafia ÿ Jos road. The southern routes are Makurdi ÿ Otukpo ÿ Enugu and Makurdi ÿ Yandev ÿ Adikpo ÿ Calabar roads. Traffic from the west comes through Makurdi ÿ (3) Naka ÿ Adoka Ankpa (3) ÿ Okene (1) roads and from the east through Makurdi ÿ Yandev ÿ Katsina Ala ÿ Wukari roads. These Makurdi Rail Bridge provides the only rail link between the northern and eastern parts of Nigeria.\\r\\nMakurdi Airport has the Nigerian Airways and other private airlines provide air links between Makurdi and the rest of the country. The beautiful beaches of River Benue can be exploited to provide good sites for relaxation. The river itself provides tourist opportunities for boating angling and swimming. The Makurdi Moratorium that houses a variety of animals including some rare species also serves as another feature of tourist attraction.\\r\\nBenu State consists of twenty-three (23) Local Government Areas. They are:\\r\\nAgriculture forms the backbone of the Benue State economy, engaging more than 70 per cent of the working population. This has made Benue the major source of food production in the Nation. It can still be developed because most of the modern techniques are not yet popular to 98% of Nigeria. Mechanization and plantation agriculture/agro-forestry are still at its infancy. Farm inputs such as fertilizers, improved seed, insecticides and other foreign methods are being increasingly used. However, cost and availability is still a challenge. Important cash crops include Soy-beans, Rice, Peanuts, mango varieties, Citrus etc. Other cash crops include Palm oil, Melon, African pear, Chili pepper, Tomatoes etc. Food crops indude Yam, Cassava, Sweet potato, Beans, Maize, Millet, Guinea corn, Vegetables etc. There is very little irrigation agriculture and techniques.\\r\\nAnimal production include, Cattle, Pork, Poultry and Goat but no dairy and dairy products yet.\\r\\nBanking services are available as all the banks in Nigeria have branches in the state with the Central Bank of Nigeria having its regional headquarters in Makurdi. Dangote Cement Company is a private company that operates within the state and provides a little employment to the people.\\r\\nThis is a rough estimated employment percentage in the state: 75% are farmers, 10% traders, 6% civil servants, 9% private.\\r\\nBenue State has the capacity to support a wide range of industries using local agricultural and mineral resources although potentials are yet to be exploited. Private initiatives in commerce and industry, particularly by indigenes, is as also on a small scale and is limited to carpentry, shoe repairs and manufacturing, small scale rice mills, leather and plastic industries, weaving, printing, catering, block making, food processing etc. Industry and commerce have been greatly retarded by the absence of capital funds, basic infrastructure and the frequent political changes.\\r\\nThe location of Benue State in the centre of the country plus the presence of bridges on two large rivers, the Benue River and Katsina-Ala River, make the state a major cross-roads centre. Two major highways connect the Eastern States to the North and North East. The present government has shown commitment to the construction of roads within the state capital Makurdi and other major roads leading in and out of the state. The roads are in an excellent condition.\\r\\nThe Federal government is also remodelling and expanding the Makurdi Airport to become the largest agricultural cargo airport in the country.\\r\\nThe rivers Benue and Katsina-Ala only needs to be dredged and a modern river port built at Makurdi, Turan, Buruku and Katsina-Ala to transport goods all over the nation since the state is at the middle of the country. Ships are sighted very occasionally offloading cargo for Benue company at the Abinsi jetty.\\r\\nThe eastern rail line connects Makurdi, Otukpo, Taraku, Utonkon and lgumale with the rest of the country. Altogether, about 180?km of rail line traverses the state.\\r\\nElectricity is not yet stable but industrialists use private power plants.\\r\\nBenue has facilities for the GSM service companies operating in the Country The state also has 4 radio stations and 2 television stations.\\r\\nBenue State possesses immense tourism potentials which are yet to be exploited. Since some of the tourist attractions are best selected by the tourist, Benue State in her bid to develop tourism embarked on infrastructural development necessary for the overall well being of the tourist. The options are still opened to foreign investors.\\r\\nThe programme of road development, hotels, postal, telephone and Email services, electricity, potable water, recreational facilities and the general hospitality of the people will eventually open up the state to tourists. An amusement park and Zoo have been developed at Makurdi. There is a wild life park at lkwe where a conference hall and chalets have been built to serve tourists. Tourist attractions in the state may be grouped into natural scenic, historical monuments and festivals.\\r\\nNatural Attractions in Benue State include hills and ranges such as Ikyogen, Abande, Ngokur, Mkar, Ushongo and Harga. There is a heavily wooded natural trench at Tse-Mker which is believed to be inhabited by dangerous creatures including Pythons. Gurgul is a waterfall on Katsina Ala River. The border stretch adjoining the Obudu/South Cameroon Plateau ranges features a beautiful scenery of forests, dissected hills, Dykes, dozens of fast flowing streams and incised valleys. In the Dry season, the water level in both the Benue River and Katsina-Ala River falls, giving rise to beautiful sandy river beaches and clean shallow waters. The waters are excellent for recreational boating and swimming. At Orokam in Ogbadibo Local government areas, occurs the Enumabia Warm Spring.\\r\\nHistorical monuments in the state include the Royal Niger Company Trading Stores at Makurdi and Gbileve near Katsina-Ala; the tombs of the first Dutch missionaries at Harga and Sai in Katsina-Ala Local Government Areas; the tombs of the legendary politician, Mr. J. S. Tarka and past three Tor Tiv in Gboko town; and the trench fortifications in Turan district of Kwande local government areas which were dug by the Tiv to ward off Chamba invasions in the 19th century.\\r\\nAt Utonkon, is a thick forest with tall giant trees, the centre of which used to serve as a slave trade market, but is now the site of shrines and a periodic market. Swem is a shrine site at the foot of the Cameroon range in Kwande local government area from where the Tivs were said to have originated.","input":"How many languages are there in benue state?"},{"output":"electronic music","context":"Robert Arthur Moog (/?mo?/ \\"mogue\\"; May 23, 1934 ÿ August 21, 2005), founder of Moog Music, was an American engineer and pioneer of electronic music, best known as the inventor of the Moog synthesizer. During his lifetime, Moog founded two companies for manufacturing electronic musical instruments. His innovative electronic design is employed in numerous synthesizers including the Minimoog, Minimoog Voyager, Little Phatty, Moog Taurus, and the Moogerfooger line of effects pedals.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA native of New York City, Moog attended the Bronx High School of Science in New York, graduating in 1952.[2] For his undergraduate education, Moog earned a B.S. in physics from Queens College and a Masters from the Columbia University School of Engineering and Applied Science in 1957. He received his Ph.D. in engineering physics from Cornell University in 1965.[3]\\r\\nIn 1953 at age 19, Moog founded his first company, R.A. Moog Co., to manufacture theremin kits. During the 1950s, composer and electronic music pioneer Raymond Scott approached Moog, asking him to design circuits for him. Moog later acknowledged Scott as an important influence. Later, in the 1960s, the company was employed to build modular synthesizers based on Moog's designs. In 1972 Moog changed the company's name to Moog Music. Throughout the 1970s, Moog Music went through various changes of ownership, eventually being bought out by musical instrument manufacturer Norlin. Poor management and marketing led to Moog's departure from his own company in 1977.\\r\\nIn 1978 after leaving his namesake firm, Moog started making electronic musical instruments again with a new company, Big Briar. Their first specialty was theremins, but by 1999 the company expanded to produce a line of analog effects pedals called moogerfoogers. In 1999, Moog partnered with Bomb Factory to co-develop the first digital effects based on Moog technology in the form of plugins for Pro Tools software.\\r\\nDespite Moog Music's closing in 1993, Moog did not have the rights to market products using his own name throughout the 1990s. Big Briar acquired the rights to use the Moog Music name in 2002 after a legal battle with Don Martin who had previously bought the rights to the name Moog Music. At the same time, Moog designed a new version of the Minimoog called the Minimoog Voyager. The Voyager includes nearly all of the features of the original Model D in addition to numerous modern features.[4]\\r\\nThe Moog synthesizer was one of the first widely used electronic musical instruments. Early developmental work on the components of the synthesizer occurred at the Columbia-Princeton Electronic Music Center, now the Computer Music Center. While there, Moog developed the voltage controlled oscillators, ADSR envelope generators, and other synthesizer modules with composer Herbert Deutsch.\\r\\nMoog created the first voltage-controlled subtractive synthesizer to utilize a keyboard as a controller and demonstrated it at the AES convention in 1964. In 1966, Moog filed a patent application for his unique low-pass filter U.S. Patent 3,475,623, issued in October, 1969. He is a listed inventor on ten US patents.[5][6]\\r\\nMoog had his theremin company (R. A. Moog Co., which later became Moog Music) manufacture and market his synthesizers. Unlike the few other 1960s synthesizer manufacturers, Moog shipped a piano-style keyboard as the standard user interface. Moog also established standards for analog synthesizer control interfacing, with a logarithmic one volt-per-octave pitch control and a separate pulse triggering signal.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe first Moog instruments were modular synthesizers. In 1971 Moog Music began production of the Minimoog Model D, which was among the first synthesizers that was widely available, portable, and relatively affordable. The first prototype of the minimoog only had about two filters, two envelope generators, and a very small keyboard. Robert knew that this wouldnt be good enough for the average musician, so he kept working on the synthesizer and was able to add more filters, oscillators, and a wider key range.[7]\\r\\nOne of Moog's earliest musical customers was Wendy Carlos, whom he credits with providing feedback valuable to further development. Through his involvement in electronic music, Moog developed close professional relationships with artists such as Don Buchla, Keith Emerson, Rick Wakeman, John Cage, Gershon Kingsley, Clara Rockmore, Jean Jacques Perrey, and Pamelia Kurstin. In a 2000 interview, Moog said, \\"I'm an engineer. I see myself as a toolmaker and the musicians are my customers. They use my tools.\\"[citation needed]\\r\\nMoog constructed his own theremin as early as 1948. Later he described a theremin in the hobbyist magazine Electronics World and offered a kit of parts for the construction of the Electronic World's Theremin, which became very successful. In the late 1980s Moog repaired the original theremin of Clara Rockmore, an accomplishment he considered a high point of his professional career.[8] He also produced, in collaboration with first wife Shirleigh Moog, Mrs. Rockmore's album, The Art of the Theremin.\\r\\nMoog was a principal interview subject in the award-winning documentary film, Theremin: An Electronic Odyssey, the success of which revived interest in the theremin. Moog wrote the foreword to Theremin: Ether Music and Espionage[9]\\r\\nHe also worked as a consultant and vice president for new product research at Kurzweil Music Systems from 1984-88, helping to develop the Kurzweil K2000.[10] He spent the early 1990s as a research professor of music at the University of North Carolina at Asheville.[11]\\r\\nMoog's first wife was Shirleigh Moog (ne Leigh), a grammar school teacher whom he married in 1958. The couple had three daughters (Laura Moog Lanier, Michelle Moog-Koussa, Renee Moog) and one son (Matthew Moog) before their divorce. Moog was married to his second wife Ileana Grams, a philosophy professor, for nine years until his death. Moog's stepdaughter, Miranda Richmond, is Grams's daughter from a previous marriage. Moog also had five grandchildren.\\r\\nMoog was diagnosed with a glioblastoma multiforme brain tumor on April 28, 2005, and died at the age of 71 in Asheville, North Carolina on August 21, 2005.[12][13]\\r\\nMoog's awards include honorary doctorates from Polytechnic Institute of New York University (New York City), Lycoming College (Williamsport, Pennsylvania), and Berklee College of Music.[14] Moog received a Grammy Trustees Award for lifetime achievement in 1970.

Moog contributed the Foreword to Glinsky's first book, Theremin: Ether Music and Espionage, which has become the standard biography of Leon Theremin.\\r\\nIn 2013, Moog was inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame.[18]\\r\\nOn July 18, 2013, Ileana Grams-Moog said she planned to give her late husband's archives, maintained by Bob Moog Foundation, to Cornell University. The foundation offered her $100,000, but Grams-Moog said she would not sell them. She said Cornell could provide better access for researchers, and that the foundation had not made enough progress toward a planned museum to indicate it would be worthy of keeping the collection. The foundation responded that it had sufficiently preserved the collection and made efforts to improve storage, though it could not afford to build the museum yet.[19]\\r\\nThe surname Moog is often mispronounced. The following interview excerpt reveals Robert Moog's preferred pronunciation:\\r\\nIn a deleted scene from the DVD version of the documentary Moog, Moog describes the three pronunciations of the name Moog: the Dutch /mo??/, which he believes would be too demanding of English speakers; the preferred Anglo-German pronunciation, /mo?/; and a more anglicized pronunciation, /mu?/. Moog reveals that some of his family members prefer the anglicized pronunciation, while others, including himself (and his wife) prefer the Anglo-German pronunciation.","input":"What did robert moog contribute to the music industry in the 1960s?"},{"output":"Junko Tabei","context":"Junko Tabei ( b, Tabei Junko, 22 September 1939 ÿ 20 October 2016)[1] was a Japanese mountaineer. She was the first woman to reach the summit of Mount Everest, and the first woman to ascend all Seven Summits by climbing the highest peak on every continent.[2][3][4]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTabei was born in Miharu Fukushima, the fifth daughter in a family of seven children.[5][6] She was considered a frail, weak child, but nevertheless she began mountain climbing at the age of 10, going on a class climbing trip to Mount Nasu.[5][7] Although she was interested in doing more climbing, her family did not have enough money for such an expensive hobby, and Tabei made only a few climbs during her high school years.[6]\\r\\nFrom 1958 to 1962, Tabei studied English literature and education at Showa Women's University, where she was a member of the mountain climbing club.[6] After graduating, Tabei formed the Ladies Climbing Club: Japan (LCC) in 1969. The club's slogan was \\"Let's go on an overseas expedition by ourselves\\", and was the first of its kind in Japan. Tabei later stated that she founded the club as a result of how she was treated by male mountaineers of the time; some men, for example, refused to climb with her, while others thought she was only interested in climbing as a way to find a husband.[6][7]\\r\\nDuring this time, she climbed mountains such as Mount Fuji in Japan and the Matterhorn in the Swiss Alps. By 1972, Tabei was a recognized mountain climber in Japan.[citation needed]\\r\\nTabei's LCC contained a team known as the Japanese Women's Everest Expedition (JWEE), headed by Eiko Hisano, that would attempt to summit Mount Everest. JWEE contained 15 members, mostly working women, including teachers, a computer programmer and a juvenile counselor. Two of them, including Tabei, were mothers.[8] After Tabei and Hiroko Hirakawa successfully summited Annapurna III on 19 May 1970,[9] LCC decided to tackle Mount Everest.\\r\\nTabei helped to find sponsors for the expedition, although she was frequently told that the women \\"should be raising children instead.\\"[7] She was able to obtain last-minute funding from the Yomiuri Shimbun newspaper and Nippon Television, however all the group members still had to pay an amount that was almost equal to Japans average salary. To save money, they would use recycled car seats to sew up waterproof pouches and over-gloves. They also purchased goose feather from China and made their own sleeping bags. Students at school collected unused packets of jam for their teachers.[10]\\r\\nAfter a long training period, the team began the expedition early in 1975 when they traveled to Kathmandu. They used the same route to ascend the mountain that Sir Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay had taken in 1953.[11] In early May, the group was camping at 6,300 meters when an avalanche struck their camp. The women and their guides were buried under the snow. Tabei lost consciousness for approximately six minutes until her sherpa guide dug her out. Twelve days after the avalanche, on 16 May 1975, with her sherpa guide, Ang Tsering, Tabei became the first woman to reach the summit of Everest.[11][3]\\r\\nAs a result of her achievement, Tabei was showered with attention: she received messages from the King of Nepal and the Japanese government, a television miniseries was made about the expedition and she toured Japan making personal appearances. However, Tabei was uncomfortable with this level of fame.[6]\\r\\nIn the 1990ÿ91 season, Tabei reached the summit of Mount Vinson, Antarctica's highest mountain.[12] On 28 June 1992, she summited Puncak Jaya and thus became the first woman to complete the Seven Summits.[2][4]\\r\\nIn addition to her climbing, Tabei worked on ecological concerns; in 2000, she completed postgraduate studies at Kyushu University focusing on the environmental degradation of Everest caused by the waste left behind by climbing groups.[5] Tabei was also the director of the Himalayan Adventure Trust of Japan, an organization working at a global level to preserve mountain environments.[3] One of the trust's projects was to build an incinerator to burn climbers' rubbish. She also led and participated in \\"clean-up\\" climbs in Japan and the Himalayas.[6]\\r\\nTabei was married to Masanobu Tabei, a climber she met while climbing in Japan in 1965. The couple had two children: a daughter, Noriko, and a son, Shinya.[6]\\r\\nTabei was diagnosed with cancer in 2012, however she continued with many of her mountaineering activities. She died in a hospital in Kawagoe on 20 October 2016.[7]","input":"Who was the first woman to climb mount everst?"},{"output":"May 25, 1977","context":"","input":"When did the first star wars movie air?"},{"output":"9 September 2011","context":"Edward Christopher Sheeran, MBE (born 17 February 1991)[5] is an English singer-songwriter, guitarist, and record producer.

I feel like people would expect me to be in a rom-com or something, so I wanted to be in something people dont expect me to\\".[143]\\r\\nSheeran also appeared as himself in the 2016 film Bridget Jones's Baby in a scene where Bridget Jones, played by Rene Zellweger, encounters the singer at the Glastonbury Festival where he is performing.[144]\\r\\nIn July 2017, Sheeran appeared in a longer cameo on Game of Thrones in a scene together with actress Maisie Williams, who plays the character Arya Stark.[145] David Benioff explained that since Williams was a big fan of the singer, they wanted to have Sheeran appear on the show to surprise Williams, and that they had tried to get him on for years.[146] It received a mix of positive and very critical reviews.[147][148]\\r\\nIn early 2011, after securing recording and publishing deals, Sheeran purchased a farm near Framlingham, Suffolk, and had it renovated. He has stated that he hopes to raise a family there.[74][149] He also bought a house in south London in 2014.[74] Sheeran lived between Hendersonville, Tennessee and Los Angeles for the duration of 2013.[150]\\r\\nSheeran was in a relationship with Scottish singer-songwriter Nina Nesbitt (who was in his music video for \\"Drunk\\") in 2012, before breaking up.[151] Nesbitt is the subject of Sheeran's songs, \\"Nina\\" and \\"Photograph\\", while most of Nesbitt's album, Peroxide, is about Sheeran.[151] In January 2014, Sheeran was in a relationship with Athina Andrelos, who works for British chef Jamie Oliver.[152] She is the inspiration of Sheeran's song, \\"Thinking Out Loud\\".[153] They broke up in February 2015.[153]\\r\\nIn June 2015, Forbes listed his earnings at $57 million for the previous 12 months, and ranked him the 27th-highest-earning celebrity in the world.[154] On 19 October 2015, Sheeran received an honorary degree from the University of Suffolk in Ipswich for his \\"outstanding contribution to music\\".[155] Sheeran commented: \\"Suffolk is very much where I call home. Receiving this recognition is a real privilege.\\"[155]\\r\\nIn November 2016, it was reported that Sheeran had to have stitches on his right cheek after an accident at a party held at the home of Princess Beatrice of York at Royal Lodge, in Windsor, Berkshire. According to this account, singer-songwriter James Blunt was also at the party and joked that he would love a knighthood, at which point Beatrice jokingly said she could arrange it and fetched a ceremonial sword. Blunt got down on one knee while Beatrice held the sword above him and said 'arise Sir James', before she swung the sword over her shoulder unaware that Sheeran was standing behind her.[156] However, Blunt later said that the story was made up, and that Sheeran had cut himself while drunk.[157]\\r\\nOn 16 October 2017 Sheeran suffered a broken wrist, elbow and rib in a cycling accident, although he was able to cycle to the pub afterwards.[158][159]\\r\\nSheeran was appointed Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the 2017 Birthday Honours for services to music and charity.[160]","input":"When did ed sheeran's first album come out?"},{"output":"Tom Mulcair","context":"Thomas Mulcair\\r\\n\\r\\nNew Democratic Party leadership elections\\r\\nThe 2017 New Democratic Party leadership election will take place between September 18 and October 15, 2017 due to incumbent Tom Mulcair having lost a vote on a leadership review at the New Democratic Party (NDP)'s federal convention held in Edmonton, Alberta on April 10, 2016.[1] 52% of delegates voted in favour of holding a new leadership election, compared to 48% who voted for Mulcair's leadership to continue. Under the party's constitution, the leadership election was to be held by April 10, 2017; however, the delegates present passed a motion to give the party up to 24 months to organize a leadership election.[2][3] Mulcair is expected to remain leader until his successor is elected.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe result at the 2016 convention was the first time a leader of any Canadian federal political party has failed to receive at least 50% in a leadership review vote.[3] In the months since the 2015 federal election, Mulcair's leadership had been a point of conflict within the party because of the election campaign, in which the NDP fell to third place from the Official Opposition status it gained in the 2011 election. The New Democrats had led public opinion polls since May 2015 and appeared to be poised to win their first federal election in history. However, they fell back behind the Liberals and Conservatives in the last month. The election thus resulted in a Liberal majority government. The party lost more than half of its seats and fell to third place. Mulcair's leadership faced criticism following the election, particularly due to his moderate platform that the party was running on. In contrast, Liberal leader Justin Trudeau had promised to run a budget deficit in order to fund stimulus programs and higher social spending, a position which was perceived as allowing the Liberals to outflank the NDP.[4][5]\\r\\nUnder rules set out in the party's constitution, every member is entitled to cast a secret ballot for the selection of the Leader.[6] The new leader will be chosen some time between October 1 and October 15, 2017, with rounds of voting through a preferential, ranked choice ballot taking place once a week until a candidate hits the 50 per cent plus one mark to be declared leader (with eligible voters choosing to vote with an internet ballot being allowed to change their vote at any time before the closure of the polls, including between each round of balloting).[7][8][9] Candidates are required to pay an entry fee of $30,000 and may spend no more than $1.5 million. 25% of all donations to candidates will be paid to the party.[1] To be nominated, candidates require at least 500 signatures from party members, at least half of which must be from female-identified members and at least 100 from \\"other equity-seeking groups\\" including indigenous people, LGBT people, persons with disabilities and visible minorities. At least 50 signatures will be required from each of five regions: \\"Atlantic\\", \\"Quebec\\", \\"Ontario\\", \\"the Prairies\\" and \\"B.C. and the North\\".\\r\\nCharlie Angus, 54, has been the MP for TimminsJames Bay since 2004 and was elected NDP Caucus Chair in January 2016.

The plot revolves around three androids: Kara, who escapes the owner she was serving to explore her newfound sentience and protect a young girl; Connor, whose job it is to hunt down sentient androids; and Markus, who devotes himself to releasing other androids from servitude. They may survive or perish depending on dialogue choices that shape the story as customised by the player.\\r\\nDetroit: Become Human is based on Quantic Dream's 2012 tech demo Kara; Valorie Curry returned to reprise the title role. To research the setting, the developers visited Detroit, Michigan. The script took writer and director David Cage, who consulted artificial intelligence experts, over two years to complete. They built a new engine to complement the game and cast hundreds of actors before commencing the process of shooting and animation. Philip Sheppard, Nima Fakhrara, and John Paesano served as composers for Kara, Connor, and Markus, respectively.\\r\\nDetroit: Become Human was met with generally favourable reviews from critics, who praised the setting, visuals, smaller moments in the story, main characters, their voice actors, the impact choices had on the narrative, and flowchart feature, but criticised the motion controls, mishandling of historical and thematic allegories, and aspects of the plot and characters. The game has sold one million copies.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nDetroit: Become Human is an adventure game[1] played from a third-person view,[2][3] which is subject to a set and controllable perspective.[4] There are multiple playable characters[5] who can die as the story continues without them;[6] as a result, there is no \\"game over\\" message following a character's death.[7] The right analogue stick on the DualShock controller is used to interact with objects and observe one's surroundings, the left analogue stick is for movement, and R2 scans an environment for possible actions; the motion controls and touchpad are also employed. Via quick time events and dialogue decisions,[8][9][10] the story will branch out depending on which choices are made.[11] These can be viewed in a flowchart during and immediately after a given chapter;[12] the player can rewind to certain points in the story to reshape decisions in the event of regret.[13] Certain scenes feature countdowns, which force the player to think and act quickly.[14] Magazines abound the levels for players to read.[15] The playable characters are:\\r\\nObtaining clues by highlighting and analysing the environment with augmented vision allows Connor to reconstruct and replay events that occurred before.[3][19] The more information Connor collects within an allotted time,[20] the greater the chance of success will be in deciding a course of action.[21] Markus has the power to grant androids free will and calculate the outcomes of certain acts.[10][22][23]\\r\\nCaretaker android Markus and his owner return home and alert the police of a suspected burglary. In confronting the perpetrator, Markus bypasses his programming, thereby becoming a deviant android with full autonomy, leading the police to shoot him at arrival.[24] Markus awakes in a landfill of broken androids and, after escaping, discovers Jericho,[25][26] a wrecked ship and safe haven for deviants. There, Markus rallies the others to fight for their rights.[27][28] They perform several acts of civil disobedience, which catches the public's attention and gets more androids to join.[29][30][31] This culminates in the FBI attacking Jericho.[32] If he survives, Markus and the others set up a final march, resulting in either all of the deviants being killed or the president opening peace talks.[33]\\r\\nPolice investigator android Connor is sent by the CyberLife corporation to assist Lieutenant Hank Anderson, an alcoholic who hates androids.[34] In the course of their investigation into an outbreak of deviants,[35][36] they either bond or fall apart,[37][38][39] potentially resulting in Hank committing suicide.[40] During his hunt for Markus' group, he starts to doubt himself, though he can stay firm in his beliefs.[32][41] He eventually locates Jericho,[41][42] where he can become a deviant himself.[32] If he defects, Connor infiltrates CyberLife Tower and converts everyone there into deviants. If not, he attempts to snipe Markus during the final protest, but is stopped by a SWAT team or Hank. In the end, if peace is achieved, Connor can choose whether or not to shoot Markus during a speech.[33]\\r\\nKara, a housekeeper android for Todd Williams and his daughter Alice,[43] escapes with her after he attacks them and leaves Kara a deviant.[44] The two travel across Detroit, intending to make it to Canada, which has no specific laws involving androids and where they will be safe. Kara and Alice befriend another android named Luther along the way, who joins them on their journey.[45][46][47] They seek the aid of an android sympathiser, who points them to Jericho to obtain passports.[48] They get caught up in the attack there, which may result in Luther, Kara, and Alice's deaths. Kara also learns that Alice is in fact an android, replacing the daughter taken away by Todd's wife.[32] They can make it to Canada by bus or boat, survive a recycling centre, or in either case die trying.[33]\\r\\nDetroit: Become Human had a development budget of ?30 million.[49] The game is based on Quantic Dream's 2012 PlayStation 3 technology demonstration Kara,[50][51][52] which received strong reactions and an award at the LA Shorts Fest.[15] It starred Valorie Curry, who would later reprise the title role.[53] Writer and director David Cage wanted to make the demo into a full game, despite not originally having planned to, because he was curious as to what would happen next.[54][55] He took inspiration from Ray Kurzweil's The Singularity Is Near, which explains that the rate at which human intelligence develops pales in comparison to that of a machine. Therefore, Cage proposes that machines may one day have emotions.[56] Androids were designed with reference to artificial organs, how their energy would be generated, and human eye movement. An android's abilities were determined by each of their given profession.[57] Experts in artificial intelligence were consulted to discern which technological advancements were the most feasible.[58] Detroit was chosen as the setting to revitalise a city that had succumbed to economic decline after a historical contribution to American industry.[59] The developers travelled to Detroit to conduct field research,[60] taking pictures, visiting abandoned buildings, and meeting people.[61]\\r\\nIn late 2013, Cage was in preproduction on Detroit: Become Human[62] which he said would build upon his work on Heavy Rain and Beyond: Two Souls.[63] Cage's script ÿ between 2,000 and 3,000 pages[64] ÿ was first relayed to the design team whilst the programmers created the graphics[65] as well as a new game engine with advancements in features like rendering, dynamic lighting, shading, bokeh, and physical cameras.[2][66] Quantic Dream improved their game engine's depth of field after Mark Cerny, lead architect of PlayStation 4, came to evaluate it.[67] In October 2016, the screenplay was completed after more than two years.[68] Cage used charts and diagrams while writing the choices, to see where they would end up;[69] penning \\"five or six thousand pages of notes\\", he likened the story to a Rubik's Cube.[70] Two scenes were cancelled over their lack of clarity in how violence was portrayed.[71] The casting extended to Los Angeles, London, and Paris in search for more than 250 actors to portray 513 roles. The actors were scanned in 3D, whose models were then made into characters. Shooting and animation followed, and on 8 September 2017, the performance capture was finished after 324 days.[64][65][72][73] Detroit: Become Human was worked on by the 180 staff members at Quantic Dream and also outsourced to the Philippines, China, Vietnam, and India.[74] The game has 35,000 camera shots, 74,000 unique animations, and 5.1 million lines of code.[64]\\r\\nThe characters Connor and Markus are played by Bryan Dechart and Jesse Williams, respectively.[20][75] Clancy Brown, Lance Henriksen, and Minka Kelly portray supporting characters Lieutenant Hank Anderson, Carl Manfred, and North, respectively.[10][76][77] There are three different composers, one for each playable character:[78] Philip Sheppard for Kara, Nima Fakhrara for Connor, and John Paesano for Markus. Sheppard's cello sequence in Kara's theme was inspired by the flames of a log fire, whereas the motif layered over it came from the two syllables in her name. Fakhrara created custom instruments and used vintage synthesizers in order that the sound could represent the robotic nature of Connor. Paesano's music was made with the idea that it would be \\"like a church hymn\\", personifying Markus' transformation into a leader.[79] Sheppard recorded at Abbey Road Studios with the English Session Orchestra;[80] Paesano was at Synchron Stage Vienna with the Synchron Stage Orchestra.[81] Director of photography Aymeric Montouchet used \\"thick grain and shaky long lens\\" with shallow depth of field for Kara, \\"small, tight grain\\" and a blue palette for Connor, and orange and white colours for Markus.[67] The game was released to manufacturing on 23 April 2018, after four years of production.[82]\\r\\nDetroit: Become Human was announced on 27 October 2015 at a Sony press conference during Paris Games Week.[83] It appeared at E3 2016 and E3 2017, showing trailers of additional playable characters and gameplay.[5][18] Following E3 2017, Cage confirmed that the game would be released in 2018,[84] later specified as the first or second quarter therein.[85] The game was released on 25 May 2018 for PlayStation 4.[86] If pre-ordered, Detroit: Become Human would come with a dynamic theme and digital soundtrack, while the digital deluxe edition included a copy of Heavy Rain, a digital art book, digital soundtrack, two dynamic themes, and ten avatars.[87]\\r\\nAfter the 2017 Paris Games Week, a new trailer was criticised for its portrayal of child abuse, specifically a scene in which a 10-year-old girl is attacked by her father.[88] Dechart defended the trailer, saying the story \\"elicits empathy\\".[89] A demo of the first scene, \\"Hostage\\", was made available on the PlayStation Store on 24 April 2018, accompanied by an Amazon Alexa skill that guides the player through the demo.[82] The game was promoted in Japan with the live action short film, Tokyo: Become Human.[90] This was followed by a launch trailer and two animated English-language shorts introducing Elijah Kamski, the creator of the androids, and Chloe, the first android to pass the Turing test.[91][92]\\r\\nDetroit: Become Human received \\"generally favorable reviews\\", according to review aggregator Metacritic.[93][nb 1] Destructoid's Chris Carter said that, despite tiring of Quantic Dream's penchant for detective stories, he enjoyed its execution and Connor's \\"calm demeanor and android origin\\". Carter praised the setting, calling it \\"believable\\" and \\"captivating\\", while also noting that the \\"smaller moments\\" were among its strengths.[8] Michael Goroff of Electronic Gaming Monthly favoured the fact that the playable characters were androids because their second-class citizenship status created an \\"effective viewpoint\\". The controls and quick-time events were also subject to approval. Goroff lauded the \\"incredibly satisfying and sometimes unexpected\\" impact of the collective decisions and declared this the game's \\"biggest accomplishment\\".[9] Writing for Game Informer, Kimberley Wallace agreed with Carter's assessment of the \\"little moments\\" and said the character development was \\"fun to watch\\", well-handled, and the \\"highlight of the game\\". She appreciated how the branching narratives affected the latter parts and complimented Quantic Dream for the \\"impressive\\" achievement.[22] Paul Tamburro at Game Revolution wrote that Detroit: Become Human boasted a \\"compelling world ... enriched by fantastic performances and state-of-the-art motion-capturing\\". He commended Curry, Dechart, and Williams for their \\"engrossing performances\\" and said the game was among \\"the most well-acted\\" around. He also felt the choices \\"drastically\\" changed the story.[94] Peter Brown of GameSpot welcomed the variety of cycling between characters for ensuring player engagement. The game's \\"most dreadful and horrific scenes\\" made a considerable impression on Brown, some of which he found to be \\"truly unforgettable\\". Additionally, he remarked that the visuals were beautiful and \\"captivating to behold\\".[12] GamesRadar+'s Andy Hartup praised Quantic Dream for making \\"an interactive story capable of provoking genuine, honest, and varied emotions\\". He thought the consequences of the decisions were \\"utterly delightful\\", albeit rarely, and saw the setting as \\"beautiful\\". Hartup liked the character models, calling them \\"the most remarkable youll see in gaming\\", and favoured the eyes in particular. On the decision-making aspects, he proclaimed Detroit: Become Human \\"the new gold standard ... for meaningful choice in gaming\\".[14] Lucy O'Brien at IGN wrote that the game \\"manages to be a frequently moving melodrama that bends to your choices with meaningful results\\". She also praised the acting of Curry, Dechart, and Williams, observing different benefits to each character. O'Brien appraised the general plot as \\"big, ambitious fun\\" and the environments as \\"beautifully detailed\\". Like Goroff, Wallace, Tamburro, and Hartup, O'Brien found the \\"branching paths to be multiple and deep\\", while also complimenting the flowcharts,[95] a feature Colm Ahern of VideoGamer.com singled out as one of the game's few redeeming qualities.[96]\\r\\nConversely, Carter criticised the game's \\"surface level exploration\\" of the Ship of Theseus, questioning the director's subtlety. He blamed the weakness of Kara's story on Cage's writing, called the portrayal of domestic and substance abusers \\"cartoonish\\", and complained about occasional \\"wooden acting\\".[8] Goroff's only annoyance with the controls concerned its motion-sensitive feature, especially disparaging its use in quick-time events.[9] Wallace thought Markus' story was the worst of the three, citing \\"predictable speeches\\" and \\"black-and-white decisions\\" as the primary problems. She suggested that the narrative suffered \\"heavy-handed\\" attempts at historical parallels, and noted, as Carter did, that its representation of abuse seemed \\"exploitive due to the over-the-top antics\\". She felt the use of the motion controls and touchpad was \\"unintuitive\\" and wanted more variety from the gameplay.[22] Tamburro faulted the opening act for its \\"slow\\" and \\"dull\\" interactions, the quick-time events for their abundance, and occasional story paths for being \\"highly questionable\\".[94] Brown viewed Markus as \\"remarkably lacking in nuance\\" and the allegories to actual history as \\"on-the-nose\\" and \\"distracting\\". He commented that the flowchart exposition was \\"ultimately detrimental\\" to player immersion and wished there was a way of disabling it.[12] Hartup disliked the moments in which themes were either \\"fumble[d]\\" or \\"pushed too far\\".[14] O'Brien observed multiple plotholes and found a considerable amount of \\"clumsy\\" exposition and dialogue.[95] Ahern wrote in his verdict, \\"Detroit: Become Human wants to move you ...

It is usually made from dairy products, such as milk and cream, and often combined with fruits or other ingredients and flavors. It is typically sweetened with sugar or sugar substitutes. Typically, flavourings and colourings are added in addition to stabilizers. The mixture is stirred to incorporate air spaces and cooled below the freezing point of water to prevent detectable ice crystals from forming. The result is a smooth, semi-solid foam that is solid at very low temperatures (<?2?C or 35?F). It becomes more malleable as its temperature increases.\\r\\nThe meaning of the phrase \\"ice cream\\" varies from one country to another. Phrases such as \\"frozen custard\\", \\"frozen yogurt\\", \\"sorbet\\", \\"gelato\\" and others are used to distinguish different varieties and styles. In some countries, such as the United States, the phrase \\"ice cream\\" applies only to a specific variety, and most governments regulate the commercial use of the various terms according to the relative quantities of the main ingredients, notably the amount of cream.[2] Products that do not meet the criteria to be called ice cream are labelled \\"frozen dairy dessert\\" instead.[3] In other countries, such as Italy and Argentina, one word is used for all variants. Analogues made from dairy alternatives, such as goat's or sheep's milk, or milk substitutes (e.g., soy milk or tofu), are available for those who are lactose intolerant, allergic to dairy protein, or vegan.\\r\\nIce cream may be served in dishes, for eating with a spoon, or in cones, which are licked. Ice cream may be served with other desserts, such as apple pie. Ice cream is used to prepare other desserts, including ice cream floats, sundaes, milkshakes, ice cream cakes and even baked items, such as Baked Alaska.\\r\\nIn many of those flavours, spicy ice creams are also available in some specific countries.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the 5th century BC, ancient Greeks ate snow mixed with honey and fruit in the markets of Athens. The father of modern medicine, Hippocrates, encouraged his Ancient Greek patients to eat ice \\"as it livens the life-juices and increases the well-being.\\"[4]\\r\\nIn 400 BC, the Persians invented a special chilled food, made of rose water and vermicelli, which was served to royalty during summers.[5] The ice was mixed with saffron, fruits, and various other flavours.\\r\\nA frozen mixture of milk and rice was used in China around 200 BC.[6] \\"They poured a mixture of snow and saltpetre over the exteriors of containers filled with syrup, for, in the same way as salt raises the boiling point of water, it lowers the freezing point to below zero.\\"[7][8]\\r\\nThe Roman Emperor Nero (37ÿ68 AD) had ice brought from the mountains and combined it with fruit toppings to create chilled delicacies.[9]\\r\\nIn the sixteenth century, the Mughal emperors used relays of horsemen to bring ice from the Hindu Kush to Delhi, where it was used in fruit sorbets.[10] Kulfi is a popular frozen dairy dessert from the Indian subcontinent and is often described as \\"traditional Indian ice cream.\\" It originated in the sixteenth century in the Mughal Empire.\\r\\nWhen Italian duchess Catherine de' Medici married the Duke of Orlans (Henry II of France) in 1533, she is said to have brought with her to France some Italian chefs who had recipes for flavoured ices or sorbets.[11] One hundred years later, Charles I of England was, it was reported, so impressed by the \\"frozen snow\\" that he offered his own ice cream maker a lifetime pension in return for keeping the formula secret, so that ice cream could be a royal prerogative.[12] There is no historical evidence to support these legends, which first appeared during the 19th century.\\r\\nThe first recipe in French for flavoured ices appears in 1674, in Nicholas Lemerys Recueil de curiositz rares et nouvelles de plus admirables effets de la nature.[11] Recipes for sorbetti saw publication in the 1694 edition of Antonio Latini's Lo Scalco alla Moderna (The Modern Steward).[11] Recipes for flavoured ices begin to appear in Fran?ois Massialot's Nouvelle Instruction pour les Confitures, les Liqueurs, et les Fruits, starting with the 1692 edition. Massialot's recipes result in a coarse, pebbly texture. Latini claims that the results of his recipes should have the fine consistency of sugar and snow.[11]\\r\\nIce cream recipes first appeared in England in the 18th century. The recipe for ice cream was published in Mrs. Mary Eales's Receipts in London in 1718.[13][14]\\r\\nTo ice cream.\\r\\nTake Tin Ice-Pots, fill them with any Sort of Cream you like, either plain or sweetend, or Fruit in it; shut your Pots very close; to six Pots you must allow eighteen or twenty Pound of Ice, breaking the Ice very small; there will be some great Pieces, which lay at the Bottom and Top: You must have a Pail, and lay some Straw at the Bottom; then lay in your Ice, and put in amongst it a Pound of Bay-Salt; set in your Pots of Cream, and lay Ice and Salt between every Pot, that they may not touch; but the Ice must lie round them on every Side; lay a good deal of Ice on the Top, cover the Pail with Straw, set it in a Cellar where no Sun or Light comes, it will be froze in four Hours, but it may stand longer; then take it out just as you use it; hold it in your Hand and it will slip out. When you woud freeze any Sort of Fruit, either Cherries, Raspberries, Currants, or Strawberries, fill your Tin-Pots with the Fruit, but as hollow as you can; put to them Lemmonade, made with Spring-Water and Lemmon-Juice sweetend; put enough in the Pots to make the Fruit hang together, and put them in Ice as you do Cream.\\r\\nAn early reference to ice cream given by the Oxford English Dictionary is from 1744, reprinted in a magazine in 1877. \\"1744 in Pennsylvania Mag. Hist. & Biogr. (1877) I. 126 Among the rarities..was some fine ice cream, which, with the strawberries and milk, eat most deliciously.\\"[15]\\r\\nThe 1751 edition of The Art of Cookery made Plain and Easy by Hannah Glasse features a recipe for ice cream. OED gives her recipe: \\"H. GLASSE Art of Cookery (ed. 4) 333 (heading) To make Ice Cream..set it [sc. the cream] into the larger Bason. Fill it with Ice, and a Handful of Salt.\\"[15] The year 1768 saw the publication of L'Art de Bien Faire les Glaces d'Office by M. Emy, a cookbook devoted entirely to recipes for flavoured ices and ice cream.[11]\\r\\nQuaker colonists introduced ice cream to the United States, bringing their ice cream recipes with them. Confectioners sold ice cream at their shops in New York and other cities during the colonial era. Ben Franklin, George Washington, and Thomas Jefferson were known to have regularly eaten and served ice cream. Records, kept by a merchant from Catham street, New York, show George Washington spending approximately $200 on ice cream in the summer of 1790. The same records show president Thomas Jefferson having an 18 step recipe for ice cream.[16] First Lady Dolley Madison, wife of U.S. President James Madison, served ice cream at her husband's Inaugural Ball in 1813.[17]\\r\\nSmall-scale hand-cranked ice cream freezers were invented in England by Agnes Marshall and in America by Nancy Johnson in the 1840s.[18]\\r\\nThe most popular flavours of ice cream in North America (based on consumer surveys) are vanilla and chocolate.[19]\\r\\nIn the Mediterranean, ice cream appears to have been accessible to ordinary people by the mid-eighteenth century.[20] Ice cream became popular and inexpensive in England in the mid-nineteenth century, when Swiss migr Carlo Gatti set up the first stand outside Charing Cross station in 1851. He sold scoops in shells for one penny. Prior to this, ice cream was an expensive treat confined to those with access to an ice house.[21] Gatti built an 'ice well' to store ice that he cut from Regent's Canal under a contract with the Regent's Canal Company. By 1860, he expanded the business and began importing ice on a large scale from Norway.\\r\\nAgnes Marshall, regarded as the \\"queen of ices\\" in England, did much to popularize ice cream recipes and make its consumption into a fashionable middle-class pursuit. She wrote four books: Ices Plain and Fancy: The Book of Ices (1885), Mrs. A.B. Marshall's Book of Cookery (1888), Mrs. A.B. Marshall's Larger Cookery Book of Extra Recipes (1891) and Fancy Ices (1894) and gave public lectures on cooking. She even suggested using liquid nitrogen to make ice cream.\\r\\nIce cream soda was invented in the 1870s, adding to ice cream's popularity. The invention of this cold treat is attributed to American Robert Green in 1874, although there is no conclusive evidence to prove his claim. The ice cream sundae originated in the late 19th century. Several men claimed to have created the first sundae, but there is no conclusive evidence to support any of their stories. Some sources say that the sundae was invented to circumvent blue laws, which forbade serving sodas on Sunday. Towns claiming to be the birthplace of the sundae include Buffalo, Two Rivers, Ithaca, and Evanston. Both the ice cream cone and banana split became popular in the early 20th century.\\r\\nThe first mention of the cone being used as an edible receptacle for the ice cream is in Mrs. A.B. Marshall's Book of Cookery of 1888. Her recipe for \\"Cornet with Cream\\" said that \\"the cornets were made with almonds and baked in the oven, not pressed between irons\\".[22][23][24][25] The ice cream cone was popularized in the USA at the 1904 World's Fair in St. Louis, MO.[26]\\r\\nThe history of ice cream in the 20th century is one of great change and increases in availability and popularity. In the United States in the early 20th century, the ice cream soda was a popular treat at the soda shop, the soda fountain, and the ice cream parlor. During the American Prohibition, the soda fountain to some extent replaced the outlawed alcohol establishments such as bars and saloons.\\r\\nIce cream became popular throughout the world in the second half of the 20th century after cheap refrigeration became common. There was an explosion of ice cream stores and of flavours and types. Vendors often competed on the basis of variety. Howard Johnson's restaurants advertised \\"a world of 28 flavors\\". Baskin-Robbins made its 31 flavours (\\"one for every day of the month\\") the cornerstone of its marketing strategy. The company now boasts that it has developed over 1000 varieties.\\r\\nOne important development in the 20th century was the introduction of soft ice cream, which has more air mixed in thereby reducing costs. It made possible the soft ice cream machine in which a cone is filled beneath a spigot on order. In the United States, Dairy Queen, Carvel, and Tastee-Freez pioneered in establishing chains of soft-serve ice cream outlets while Baskin-Robbins became worldwide chain later.\\r\\nTechnological innovations such as these have introduced various food additives into ice cream, the notable one being the stabilizing agent gluten,[27] to which some people have an intolerance. Recent awareness of this issue has prompted a number of manufacturers to start producing gluten-free ice cream.[28]\\r\\nThe 1980s saw thicker ice creams being sold as \\"premium\\" and \\"super-premium\\" varieties under brands such as Ben & Jerry's, Chocolate Shoppe Ice Cream Company and H?agen-Dazs.\\r\\nIce cream is a colloidal emulsion having dispersed phase as fat globules. It is an emulsion which is in the end made into foam by incorporating air cells which is frozen to form dispersed ice cells. In the composition of ice cream ice crystals are of most importance as they give a desirable mouth feel. Ice cream is composed of water, ice, milk fat, milk protein, sugar and air. Water and fat have highest proportions by weight creating an emulsion. The triacylglycerols in far are non polar and will adhere to itself by van der Waals interactions. Water is polar thus, emulsifiers are needed for dispersion of fat. Also ice cream has a colloidal phase of foam which helps in light texture. Milk proteins such as casein and whey protein present in ice cream are amphiphilic, can adsorb water and form micelles which will contribute to consistency. Sucrose which is disaccharide is usually used as a sweetening agent. Lactose which is sugar present in milk will cause freezing point depression. Thus, on freezing some water will be unfrozen and will not give hard texture.[29]\\r\\nBefore the development of modern refrigeration, ice cream was a luxury reserved for special occasions. Making it was quite laborious; ice was cut from lakes and ponds during the winter and stored in holes in the ground, or in wood-frame or brick ice houses, insulated by straw. Many farmers and plantation owners, including U.S. Presidents George Washington and Thomas Jefferson, cut and stored ice in the winter for use in the summer. Frederic Tudor of Boston turned ice harvesting and shipping into a big business, cutting ice in New England and shipping it around the world.\\r\\nIce cream was made by hand in a large bowl placed inside a tub filled with ice and salt. This was called the pot-freezer method. French confectioners refined the pot-freezer method, making ice cream in a sorbetire (a covered pail with a handle attached to the lid). In the pot-freezer method, the temperature of the ingredients is reduced by the mixture of crushed ice and salt. The salt water is cooled by the ice, and the action of the salt on the ice causes it to (partially) melt, absorbing latent heat and bringing the mixture below the freezing point of pure water. The immersed container can also make better thermal contact with the salty water and ice mixture than it could with ice alone.\\r\\nThe hand-cranked churn, which also uses ice and salt for cooling, replaced the pot-freezer method. The exact origin of the hand-cranked freezer is unknown, but the first U.S. patent for one was #3254 issued to Nancy Johnson on 9 September 1843. The hand-cranked churn produced smoother ice cream than the pot freezer and did it quicker. Many inventors patented improvements on Johnson's design.\\r\\nIn Europe and early America, ice cream was made and sold by small businesses, mostly confectioners and caterers. Jacob Fussell of Baltimore, Maryland was the first to manufacture ice cream on a large scale. Fussell bought fresh dairy products from farmers in York County, Pennsylvania, and sold them in Baltimore. An unstable demand for his dairy products often left him with a surplus of cream, which he made into ice cream. He built his first ice cream factory in Seven Valleys, Pennsylvania, in 1851. Two years later, he moved his factory to Baltimore. Later, he opened factories in several other cities and taught the business to others, who operated their own plants. Mass production reduced the cost of ice cream and added to its popularity.\\r\\nThe development of industrial refrigeration by German engineer Carl von Linde during the 1870s eliminated the need to cut and store natural ice, and, when the continuous-process freezer was perfected in 1926, commercial mass production of ice cream and the birth of the modern ice cream industry was underway.\\r\\nIn modern times, a common method for producing ice cream at home is to use an ice cream maker, an electrical device that churns the ice cream mixture while cooled inside a household freezer. Some more expensive models have an inbuilt freezing element. A newer method is to add liquid nitrogen to the mixture while stirring it using a spoon or spatula for a few seconds; a similar technique, advocated by Heston Blumenthal as ideal for home cooks, is to add dry ice to the mixture while stirring for a few minutes.[30] Some ice cream recipes call for making a custard, folding in whipped cream, and immediately freezing the mixture.[31] Another method is to use a pre-frozen solution of salt and water, which gradually melts as the ice cream freezes.\\r\\nAn unusual method of making ice-cream was done during World War II by American fighter pilots based in the South Pacific. They attached pairs of 5-US-gallon (19?l) cans to their aircraft. The cans were fitted with a small propeller, this was spun by the slipstream and drove a stirrer, which agitated the mixture while the intense cold of high altitude froze it.[32]\\r\\nIce cream can be mass-produced and thus is widely available in developed parts of the world. Ice cream can be purchased in large cartons (vats and squrounds) from supermarkets and grocery stores, in smaller quantities from ice cream shops, convenience stores, and milk bars, and in individual servings from small carts or vans at public events. In 2015, US produced nearly 900 million gallons of ice cream.[33]\\r\\nToday, jobs specialize in the selling of ice cream. The title of a person who works in this speciality is often called an 'ice cream man', however women also specialize in the selling of ice cream. People in this line of work often sell ice cream on beaches. On beaches, ice cream is either sold by a person who carries a box full of ice cream and is called over by people who want the purchase ice cream, or by a person who drives up to the top of the beach and rings a bell. In the second method, people go up to the top of the beach and purchase ice cream straight from the ice cream seller, who is often in an ice cream van. In Turkey and Australia, ice cream is sometimes sold to beach-goers from small powerboats equipped with chest freezers.\\r\\nSome ice cream distributors sell ice cream products from traveling refrigerated vans or carts (commonly referred to in the US as \\"ice cream trucks\\"), sometimes equipped with speakers playing children's music or folk melodies (such as \\"Turkey in the Straw\\"). The driver of an ice cream van drives throughout neighborhoods and stops every so often, usually every block. The seller on the ice cream van sells the ice cream through a large window; this window is also where the customer asks for ice cream and pays. Ice cream vans in the United Kingdom make a music box noise rather than actual music.\\r\\nIn the U.S., ice cream may have the following composition:[34]\\r\\nThese compositions are percentage by weight. Since ice cream can contain as much as half air by volume, these numbers may be reduced by as much as half if cited by volume. In terms of dietary considerations, the percentages by weight are more relevant. Even the low-fat products have high caloric content: Ben and Jerry's No-Fat Vanilla Fudge contains 150 calories (630?kJ) per half-cup due to its high sugar content.[35]\\r\\nAccording to Canadian Food and Drug Regulations, ice cream in Canada must be at least 10 percent milk fat, and must contain at least 180 grams of solids per liter. When cocoa, chocolate syrup, fruit, nuts, or confections are added, the percentage of milk fat can be 8 percent.[36]\\r\\nIce cream is considered as a colloidal system. It is composed by ice cream crystals and aggregates, air that does not mixes with the ice cream by forming small bubbles in the bulk and partially coalesced fat globules. This dispersed phase made from all the small particles is surrounded by an unfrozen continuous phase composed by sugars, proteins, salts, polysaccharides and water. Their interactions determine the properties of ice cream, whether soft and whippy or hard.[37]\\r\\nOstwald ripening is the explanation for the growth of large crystals at the expense of small ones in the dispersion phase. This process is also called migratory recrystallization. It involves the formation of sharp crystals. Theories about Ostwald recrystallization admit that after a period of time, the recrystallization process can be described by the following equation:\\r\\nr = r (0) + Rt exp(1/n)\\r\\nWhere r (0) is the initial size, n the order of recrystallization, t a time constant for recrystallization that depends on the rate R (in units of size/ time).\\r\\nTo make ice cream smooth, recrystallization must occur as slowly as possible, because small crystals create smoothness, meaning that r must decrease.[38]\\r\\nAround the world, different cultures have developed unique versions of ice cream, suiting the product to local tastes and preferences.\\r\\nThe most traditional Argentine helado (ice cream) is very similar to Italian gelato, in large part due to the historical influence of Italian immigrants on Argentinian customs.\\r\\nPer capita, Australians and New Zealanders are among the leading ice cream consumers in the world, eating 18 litres and 20 litres each per year respectively, behind the United States where people eat 23 litres each per year.[39]\\r\\nIn China, besides the popular flavour such as vanilla, chocolate, coffee, mango and strawberry, many Chinese ice-cream manufacturers also introduced other traditional Chineses flavours such as black sesame and red beans.\\r\\nIn 1651, Italian Francesco dei Coltelli opened an ice cream caf in Paris and the product became so popular that during the next 50 years another 250 cafs opened in Paris.[40][41]\\r\\nIn Greece, ice cream in its modern form, or pagot܇ (Greek: ϫ߶?), was introduced in the beginning of the 20th century.\\r\\nIndia is one of the largest producers of ice cream in the world, but most of its ice cream is consumed domestically.\\r\\nIn Indonesia, a type traditional ice cream called \\"Es Puter\\" or \\"stirred ice cream is made from coconut milk, pandanus leaves, sugarand flavors that include avocado, jackfruit, durian, palm sugar, chocolate, red bean, and mung bean.\\r\\nIn Iran, Flde (Persian: ??????) or Plde (Persian: ??????) is a Persian sorbet made of thin vermicelli noodles, frozen with sugar syrup and rose water. The dessert is often served with lime juice and sometimes ground pistachios.\\r\\nItalian ice cream or Gelato as it is known, is a traditional and a popular dessert in Italy. Much of the production is still hand-made and flavoured by each individual shop in \\"produzione propria\\" gelaterias. Gelato is made from whole milk, sugar, sometimes eggs, and natural flavourings. Gelato typically contains 7ÿ8% fat, less than ice cream's minimum of 10%.\\r\\nSorbetes is a Philippine version for common ice cream usually peddled from carts by pedlars who roam streets in the Philippines. Despite the similarities between the name \\"sorbetes\\" and sorbet, \\"sorbetes\\" is not a type of sorbet.\\r\\nIn Spain, ice cream is often in the style of Italian gelato. Spanish gelato can be found in many cafes or specialty ice cream stores. While many traditional flavours are sold, cafes may also sell unique flavouurs like nata, crema catalana, or tiramisu.\\r\\nDondurma is the name given to ice cream in Turkey. Dondurma typically includes milk, sugar, salep, and mastic.\\r\\nIn the United Kingdom, 14 million adults buy ice cream as a treat, in a market worth S1.3 billion (according to a report produced in September 2009).[42]\\r\\nIn the United States, ice cream made with just cream, sugar, and a flavouring (usually fruit) is sometimes referred to as \\"Philadelphia style\\"[43] ice cream. Ice cream that uses eggs to make a custard is sometimes called \\"French ice cream\\". American federal labeling standards require ice cream to contain a minimum of 10% milk fat. Americans consume about 23 liters of ice cream per person per year? the most in the world.\\r\\nMrs Marshall's Cookery Book, published in 1888, endorsed serving ice cream in cones,[44] but the idea definitely predated that. Agnes Marshall was a celebrated cookery writer of her day and helped to popularise ice cream. She patented and manufactured an ice cream maker and was the first person to suggest using liquefied gases to freeze ice cream after seeing a demonstration at the Royal Institution.\\r\\nReliable evidence proves that ice cream cones were served in the 19th century, and their popularity increased greatly during the St. Louis World's Fair in 1904. According to legend, at the World's Fair an ice cream seller had run out of the cardboard dishes used to put ice cream scoops in, so they could not sell any more produce. Next door to the ice cream booth was a Syrian waffle booth, unsuccessful due to intense heat; the waffle maker offered to make cones by rolling up his waffles and the new product sold well, and was widely copied by other vendors.[45][46]\\r\\nThe following is a partial list of ice cream-like frozen desserts and snacks:\\r\\nIn 2006, some commercial ice cream makers began to use liquid nitrogen in the primary freezing of ice cream, thus eliminating the need for a conventional ice cream freezer.[49] Brands are Dippin' Dots. The preparation results in a column of white condensed water vapour cloud. The ice cream, dangerous to eat while still \\"steaming\\" with liquid nitrogen, is allowed to rest until the liquid nitrogen is completely vapourised. Sometimes ice cream is frozen to the sides of the container, and must be allowed to thaw. Good results can also be achieved with the more readily available dry ice, and authors such as Heston Blumenthal have published recipes to produce ice cream and sorbet using a simple blender.[50]\\r\\nAnother vendor, Creamistry, creates ice cream from liquid ingredients as customers watch. It has a softer texture than regular ice cream, because ice crystals have less time to form.[51]","input":"What kind of fat is in ice cream?"},{"output":"Harrison Ford","context":"Blade Runner is a 1982 American neo-noir science fiction film directed by Ridley Scott and starring Harrison Ford, Rutger Hauer, Sean Young, and Edward James Olmos. The script was written by Hampton Fancher and David Peoples. It is a loose adaptation of the 1968 novel Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? by Philip K. Dick.[6][7] Set in a dystopian Los Angeles in 2019, the story depicts a future in which synthetic humans known as replicants are bioengineered by the powerful Tyrell Corporation to work on off-world colonies. When a fugitive group of replicants led by Roy Batty (Hauer) escape back to Earth, burnt-out Los Angeles cop Rick Deckard (Ford) reluctantly accepts one last assignment to hunt them down. During his investigations, Deckard meets Rachael (Young), an advanced replicant who causes him to question his mission.\\r\\nBlade Runner initially underperformed in North American theaters, and polarized critics; some praised its thematic complexity and visuals, while others were displeased with its unconventional pacing and plot. However, it has subsequently become an acclaimed cult film,[8] and is now regarded by many critics as one of the all-time best science fiction movies. Hailed for its production design depicting a \\"retrofitted\\" future,[9] Blade Runner remains a leading example of neo-noir cinema,[10] and has been highly influential on many subsequent science fiction films, video games, anime, and television series. The film's soundtrack, composed by Vangelis, was critically acclaimed, and was nominated in 1983 for a BAFTA and Golden Globe as best original score.\\r\\nThe film brought the work of Philip K. Dick to the attention of Hollywood, and several later films were based on his work.[11] Ridley Scott regards Blade Runner as \\"probably\\" his most complete and personal film.[12][13] In the year after its release, the film won the prestigious Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation, and in 1993 it was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress, being deemed \\"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\\".\\r\\nSeven versions of the film have been constructed as a result of controversial changes made at the request of studio executives. A director's cut was released in 1992 after a strong response to test screenings of a workprint. This, in conjunction with the film's popularity as a video rental, made it one of the first movies to be released on DVDalbeit a basic production with mediocre video and audio quality.[14] In 2007, Warner Bros.?released The Final Cut, a 25th-anniversary digitally remastered version, the only one over which Scott retained complete editorial and artistic control.[15] This version was shown in selected theaters and subsequently released on DVD, HD DVD, and Blu-ray.[16]\\r\\nA sequel, Blade Runner 2049, was released in October 2017.[17]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2019 Los Angeles, former police officer Rick Deckard is detained by officer Gaff and brought to his former supervisor, Bryant. Deckard, whose job as a \\"blade runner\\" was to track down bioengineered beings known as replicants and \\"retire\\" (i.e. kill) them, is informed that four are on Earth illegally. Deckard starts to leave, but Bryant ambiguously threatens him and he stays. The two watch a video of a blade runner named Holden administering the \\"Voight-Kampff\\" test, which is designed to distinguish replicants from humans based on their emotional response to questions. The test subject, Leon, shoots Holden on the second question. Bryant wants Deckard to retire Leon and the other three Tyrell Corporation Nexus-6 replicants: Roy Batty, Zhora, and Pris.\\r\\nBryant has Deckard meet with Eldon Tyrell so he can administer the test on a Nexus-6 to see if it works. Tyrell expresses his interest in seeing the test fail first, and asks him to administer it on his assistant Rachael. After a much longer than normal test, Deckard concludes Rachael is a replicant who believes she is human. Tyrell explains she is an experiment who has been given false memories to provide an emotional \\"cushion\\".\\r\\nSearching Leon's hotel room, Deckard finds photos and a synthetic snake scale. Roy and Leon investigate a replicant eye-manufacturing laboratory and learn of J. F. Sebastian, a gifted genetic designer who works closely with Tyrell. Deckard returns to his apartment where Rachael is waiting. She tries to prove her humanity by showing him a family photo, but after Deckard reveals that her memories are implants from Tyrell's niece, she leaves his apartment in tears. Meanwhile, Pris locates Sebastian and manipulates him to gain his trust.\\r\\nA photograph from Leon's apartment and the snake scale lead Deckard to a strip club where Zhora works. After a confrontation and chase, Deckard kills Zhora. Bryant orders him to also retire Rachael, who has disappeared from the Tyrell Corporation. After Deckard spots Rachael in a crowd, he is attacked by Leon, who knocks Deckard's pistol from his hand and then begins to kill Deckard, but Rachael uses Deckard's pistol to kill Leon. They return to Deckard's apartment, and, during an intimate discussion, he promises not to track her down; as she abruptly tries to leave, Deckard restrains her, forcing her to kiss him.\\r\\nArriving at Sebastian's apartment, Roy tells Pris the others are dead. Sympathetic to their plight, Sebastian reveals that because of \\"Methuselah Syndrome\\", a genetic premature aging disorder, his life will also be cut short. Sebastian and Roy gain entrance into Tyrell's secure penthouse, where Roy demands more life from his maker. Tyrell tells him that it is impossible. Roy confesses that he has done \\"questionable things\\", but Tyrell dismisses this, praising Roy's advanced design and accomplishments in his short life. Roy kisses Tyrell, then kills him. Sebastian runs for the elevator, followed by Roy, who rides the elevator down alone.[nb 1]\\r\\nAt Sebastian's apartment, Deckard is ambushed by Pris, but he kills her as Roy returns. Roy's body begins to fail as the end of his lifespan approaches. He chases Deckard through the building, ending on the roof. Deckard tries to jump to an adjacent roof, but is left hanging between buildings. Roy makes the jump with ease, and as Deckard's grip loosens, Roy hoists him onto the roof, saving him. Before Roy dies, he delivers a monologue about how his memories \\"will be lost in time, like tears in rain\\". Gaff arrives and shouts to Deckard about Rachael: \\"It's too bad she won't live, but then again, who does?\\" Deckard returns to his apartment and finds Rachael asleep in his bed. As they leave, Deckard notices an origami unicorn on the floor, a calling card that recalls for him Gaff's final words. Deckard and Rachael leave the apartment block.\\r\\nSource: Blade Runner: The Final Cut[19]\\r\\nThe film operates on multiple dramatic and narrative levels. It employs some of the conventions of film noir, among them the character of a femme fatale; narration by the protagonist (in the original release); chiaroscuro cinematography; and giving the hero a questionable moral outlookextended to include reflections upon the nature of his own humanity.[20][21] It is a literate science fiction film, thematically enfolding the philosophy of religion and moral implications of human mastery of genetic engineering in the context of classical Greek drama and hubris.[22] It also draws on Biblical images, such as Noah's flood,[23] and literary sources, such as Frankenstein.[24] Linguistically, the theme of mortality is subtly reiterated in the chess game between Sebastian and Tyrell, supposedly based on the famous Immortal Game of 1851[25] (though Scott has said this was merely coincidental).[26]\\r\\nBlade Runner delves into the effects of technology on the environment and society by reaching to the past, using literature, religious symbolism, classical dramatic themes, and film noir techniques. This tension between past, present, and future is mirrored in the \\"retrofitted\\" future depicted in the film, one which is high-tech and gleaming in places but decayed and outdated elsewhere. In an interview with The Observer in 2002, director Ridley Scott described the film as \\"extremely dark, both literally and metaphorically, with an oddly masochistic feel\\". He also said that he \\"liked the idea of exploring pain\\" in the wake of his brother's death from skin cancer: \\"When he was ill, I used to go and visit him in London, and that was really traumatic for me.\\"[13]\\r\\nA sense of foreboding and paranoia pervades the world of the film: corporate power looms large; the police seem omnipresent; vehicle and warning lights probe into buildings; and the consequences of huge biomedical power over the individual are exploredespecially regarding replicants' implanted memories. Control over the environment is exercised on a vast scale, and goes hand in hand with the absence of any natural life; for example, artificial animals stand in for their extinct predecessors. This oppressive backdrop explains the frequently referenced migration of humans to \\"off-world\\" (extraterrestrial) colonies.[27] The dystopian themes explored in Blade Runner are an early example of the expansion of cyberpunk concepts into cinema. Eyes are a recurring motif, as are manipulated images, calling into question the nature of reality and our ability to accurately perceive and remember it.[28][29][30]\\r\\nThese thematic elements provide an atmosphere of uncertainty for Blade Runner's central theme of examining humanity. In order to discover replicants, an empathy test is used, with a number of its questions focused on the treatment of animalsseemingly an essential indicator of one's \\"humanity\\". The replicants appear to show compassion and concern for one another and are juxtaposed against human characters who lack empathy, while the mass of humanity on the streets is cold and impersonal. The film goes so far as to question if Deckard might be an android, in the process forcing the audience to re-evaluate what it means to be human.[31]\\r\\nThe question of whether Deckard is intended to be a human or a replicant has been an ongoing controversy since the film's release.[32] Both Michael Deeley and Harrison Ford wanted Deckard to be human, while Hampton Fancher preferred ambiguity.[33] Ridley Scott has confirmed that in his vision, Deckard is a replicant.[34][35]\\r\\nDeckard's unicorn-dream sequence, inserted into the Director's Cut and concomitant with Gaff's parting gift of an origami unicorn, is seen by many as showing that Deckard is a replicantbecause Gaff could have accessed Deckard's implanted memories.[24][36] The interpretation that Deckard is a replicant is challenged by others who believe the unicorn imagery shows that the characters, whether human or replicant, share the same dreams and recognize their affinity,[37] or that the absence of a decisive answer is crucial to the film's main theme.[38] The film's inherent ambiguity and uncertainty, as well as its textual richness, have permitted viewers to see it from multiple perspectives.[39]\\r\\nCasting the film proved troublesome, particularly for the lead role of Deckard. Screenwriter Hampton Fancher envisioned Robert Mitchum as Deckard and wrote the character's dialogue with Mitchum in mind.[40] Director Ridley Scott and the film's producers spent months meeting and discussing the role with Dustin Hoffman, who eventually departed over differences in vision.[40] Harrison Ford was ultimately chosen for several reasons, including his performance in the Star Wars films, Ford's interest in the Blade Runner story, and discussions with Steven Spielberg who was finishing Raiders of the Lost Ark at the time and strongly praised Ford's work in the film.[40] Following his success in films like Star Wars (1977) and Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981), Ford was looking for a role with dramatic depth.[41] According to production documents, several actors were considered for the role, including Gene Hackman, Sean Connery, Jack Nicholson, Paul Newman, Clint Eastwood, Tommy Lee Jones, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Al Pacino, and Burt Reynolds.[40]\\r\\nOne role that was not difficult to cast was Rutger Hauer as Roy Batty, the violent yet thoughtful leader of the replicants.[42] Scott cast Hauer without having met him, based solely on Hauer's performances in Paul Verhoeven's movies Scott had seen (Katie Tippel, Soldier of Orange and Turkish Delight).[40] Hauer's portrayal of Batty was regarded by Philip K. Dick as, \\"the perfect Battycold, Aryan, flawless\\".[43] Of the many films Hauer has made, Blade Runner is his favorite. As he explained in a live chat in 2001, \\"Blade Runner needs no explanation. It just [is]. All of the best. There is nothing like it. To be part of a real masterpiece which changed the world's thinking. It's awesome.\\"[44] Hauer rewrote his character's \\"tears in rain\\" speech himself and presented the words to Scott on set prior to filming.\\r\\nBlade Runner used a number of then-lesser-known actors: Sean Young portrays Rachael, an experimental replicant implanted with the memories of Tyrell's niece, causing her to believe she is human;[45] Nina Axelrod auditioned for the role.[40] Daryl Hannah portrays Pris, a \\"basic pleasure model\\" replicant; Stacey Nelkin auditioned for the role, but was given another part in the film, which was ultimately cut before filming.[40] Casting Pris and Rachael was challenging, requiring several screen tests, with Morgan Paull playing the role of Deckard. Paull was cast as Deckard's fellow bounty hunter Holden based on his performances in the tests.[40] Brion James portrays Leon Kowalski, a combat replicant, and Joanna Cassidy portrays Zhora, an assassin replicant.\\r\\nEdward James Olmos portrays Gaff. Olmos used his diverse ethnic background, and personal research, to help create the fictional \\"Cityspeak\\" language his character uses in the film.[46] His initial address to Deckard at the noodle bar is partly in Hungarian and means, \\"Horse dick [bullshit]! No way. You are the Blade ... Blade Runner.\\"[46] M. Emmet Walsh plays Captain Bryant, a hard-drinking, sleazy, and underhanded police veteran typical of the film noir genre. Joe Turkel portrays Dr. Eldon Tyrell, a corporate mogul who built an empire on genetically manipulated humanoid slaves. William Sanderson was cast as J. F. Sebastian, a quiet and lonely genius who provides a compassionate yet compliant portrait of humanity. J.?F. sympathizes with the replicants, whom he sees as companions,[47] and shares their shorter lifespan due to his rapid aging disease;[48] Joe Pantoliano was considered for the role.[49] James Hong portrays Hannibal Chew, an elderly geneticist specializing in synthetic eyes, and Hy Pyke portrays the sleazy bar owner Taffey Lewis with ease and in a single take, something almost unheard-of with Scott whose drive for perfection resulted at times in double-digit takes.[50]\\r\\n\\r\\nInterest in adapting Philip K. Dick's novel Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? developed shortly after its 1968 publication. Director Martin Scorsese was interested in filming the novel, but never optioned it.[51] Producer Herb Jaffe optioned it in the early 1970s, but Dick was unimpressed with the screenplay written by Herb's son Robert: \\"Jaffe's screenplay was so terribly done?... Robert flew down to Santa Ana to speak with me about the project. And the first thing I said to him when he got off the plane was, 'Shall I beat you up here at the airport, or shall I beat you up back at my apartment?'\\"[52]\\r\\nThe screenplay by Hampton Fancher was optioned in 1977.[53] Producer Michael Deeley became interested in Fancher's draft and convinced director Ridley Scott to film it. Scott had previously declined the project, but after leaving the slow production of Dune, wanted a faster-paced project to take his mind off his older brother's recent death.[54] He joined the project on February 21, 1980, and managed to push up the promised Filmways financing from US$13?million to $15?million. Fancher's script focused more on environmental issues and less on issues of humanity and religion, which are prominent in the novel and Scott wanted changes. Fancher found a cinema treatment by William S. Burroughs for Alan E. Nourse's novel The Bladerunner (1974), titled Blade Runner (a movie).[nb 2] Scott liked the name, so Deeley obtained the rights to the titles.[55] Eventually he hired David Peoples to rewrite the script and Fancher left the job over the issue on December 21, 1980, although he later returned to contribute additional rewrites.[56]\\r\\nHaving invested over $2.5 million in pre-production,[57] as the date of commencement of principal photography neared, Filmways withdrew financial backing. In ten days Deeley had secured $21.5?million in financing through a three-way deal between The Ladd Company (through Warner Bros.), the Hong Kong-based producer Sir Run Run Shaw and Tandem Productions.[58]\\r\\nDick became concerned that no one had informed him about the film's production, which added to his distrust of Hollywood.[59] After Dick criticized an early version of Fancher's script in an article written for the Los Angeles Select TV Guide, the studio sent Dick the Peoples rewrite.[60] Although Dick died shortly before the film's release, he was pleased with the rewritten script and with a 20-minute special effects test reel that was screened for him when he was invited to the studio. Despite his well-known skepticism of Hollywood in principle, Dick enthused to Scott that the world created for the film looked exactly as he had imagined it.[43] He said, \\"I saw a segment of Douglas Trumbull's special effects for Blade Runner on the KNBC-TV news. I recognized it immediately. It was my own interior world. They caught it perfectly.\\" He also approved of the film's script, saying, \\"After I finished reading the screenplay, I got the novel out and looked through it. The two reinforce each other, so that someone who started with the novel would enjoy the movie and someone who started with the movie would enjoy the novel.\\"[61] The motion picture was dedicated to Dick.[62] Principal photography of Blade Runner began on March 9, 1981, and ended four months later.[63]\\r\\nIn 1992, Ford revealed, \\"Blade Runner is not one of my favorite films. I tangled with Ridley.\\"[64] Apart from friction with the director, Ford also disliked the voiceovers: \\"When we started shooting it had been tacitly agreed that the version of the film that we had agreed upon was the version without voiceover narration. It was a f**king [sic] nightmare. I thought that the film had worked without the narration. But now I was stuck re-creating that narration. And I was obliged to do the voiceovers for people that did not represent the director's interests.\\"[41] \\"I went kicking and screaming to the studio to record it.\\"[65] The narration monologues were written by an uncredited Roland Kibbee.[66]\\r\\nIn 2006, Scott was asked \\"Who's the biggest pain in the arse you've ever worked with?\\", he replied: \\"It's got to be Harrison?... he'll forgive me because now I get on with him. Now he's become charming. But he knows a lot, that's the problem. When we worked together it was my first film up and I was the new kid on the block. But we made a good movie.\\"[67] Ford said of Scott in 2000: \\"I admire his work. We had a bad patch there, and I'm over it.\\"[68] In 2006 Ford reflected on the production of the film saying: \\"What I remember more than anything else when I see Blade Runner is not the 50 nights of shooting in the rain, but the voiceover?... I was still obliged to work for these clowns that came in writing one bad voiceover after another.\\"[69] Ridley Scott confirmed in the summer 2007 issue of Total Film that Harrison Ford contributed to the Blade Runner Special Edition DVD, and had already recorded his interviews. \\"Harrison's fully on board\\", said Scott.[70]\\r\\nThe Bradbury Building in downtown Los Angeles served as a filming location, and a Warner Bros.?backlot housed the LA 2019 streets. Other locations included the Ennis-Brown House and the 2nd Street Tunnel. Test screenings resulted in several changes including adding a voice-over, a happy ending and the removal of a Holden hospital scene. The relationship between the filmmakers and the investors was difficult, which culminated in Deeley and Scott being fired but still working on the film.[71] Crew members created T-shirts during filming saying, \\"Yes Guv'nor, My Ass\\" that mocked Scott's unfavorable comparison of U.S. and British crews; Scott responded with a T-shirt of his own, \\"Xenophobia Sucks\\" making the incident known as the T-shirt war.[72][73]\\r\\nRidley Scott credits Edward Hopper's painting Nighthawks and the French science fiction comics magazine Mtal Hurlant, to which the artist M?bius contributed, as stylistic mood sources.[74] He also drew on the landscape of \\"Hong Kong on a very bad day\\"[75] and the industrial landscape of his one-time home in northeast England.[76] The visual style of the movie is influenced by the work of futurist Italian architect Antonio Sant'Elia.[77] Scott hired Syd Mead as his concept artist who, like Scott, was influenced by Mtal Hurlant.[78] Moebius was offered the opportunity to assist in the pre-production of Blade Runner, but he declined so that he could work on Ren Laloux's animated film Les Ma?tres du temps?ÿ a decision that he later regretted.[79] Production designer Lawrence G. Paull and art director David Snyder realized Scott's and Mead's sketches. Douglas Trumbull and Richard Yuricich supervised the special effects for the film.\\r\\nBlade Runner has numerous deep similarities to Fritz Lang's Metropolis, including a built-up urban environment, in which the wealthy literally live above the workers, dominated by a huge building?ÿ the Stadtkrone Tower in Metropolis and the Tyrell Building in Blade Runner. Special effects supervisor David Dryer used stills from Metropolis when lining up Blade Runner's miniature building shots.[80]\\r\\nThe extended end scene in the original theatrical release shows Rachael and Deckard traveling into daylight with pastoral aerial shots filmed by director Stanley Kubrick. Ridley Scott contacted Kubrick about using some of his surplus helicopter aerial photography from The Shining.[81][82][83]\\r\\n\\"Spinner\\" is the generic term for the fictional flying cars used in the film. A spinner can be driven as a ground-based vehicle, and take off vertically, hover, and cruise using jet propulsion much like vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) aircraft. They are used extensively by the police to patrol and survey the population, and it is clear that despite restrictions wealthy people can acquire spinner licenses.[84] The vehicle was conceived and designed by Syd Mead who described the spinner as an \\"aerodyne\\"a vehicle which directs air downward to create lift, though press kits for the film stated that the spinner was propelled by three engines: \\"conventional internal combustion, jet, and anti-gravity\\"[85] Mead's conceptual drawings were transformed into 25 working vehicles by automobile customizer Gene Winfield.[86] A spinner is on permanent exhibit at the Science Fiction Museum and Hall of Fame in Seattle, Washington.[87]\\r\\nThe Voight-Kampff machine is a fictional interrogation tool, originating in the novel where it is spelled Voigt-Kampff. The Voight-Kampff is a polygraph-like machine used by Blade Runners to determine whether an individual is a replicant. It measures bodily functions such as respiration, blush response, heart rate and eye movement in response to questions dealing with empathy.[88] In the film two replicants take the test, Leon and Rachael, and Deckard tells Tyrell that it usually takes 20 to 30 cross-referenced questions to distinguish a replicant; in contrast with the book, where it is stated it only takes \\"six or seven\\" questions to make a determination. In the film it takes more than one hundred questions to determine that Rachael is a replicant.\\r\\nThe Blade Runner soundtrack by Vangelis is a dark melodic combination of classic composition and futuristic synthesizers which mirrors the film-noir retro-future envisioned by Ridley Scott. Vangelis, fresh from his Academy Award-winning score for Chariots of Fire,[89] composed and performed the music on his synthesizers.[90] He also made use of various chimes and the vocals of collaborator Demis Roussos.[91] Another memorable sound is the haunting tenor sax solo \\"Love Theme\\" by British saxophonist Dick Morrissey, who performed on many of Vangelis's albums. Ridley Scott also used \\"Memories of Green\\" from the Vangelis album See You Later, an orchestral version of which Scott would later use in his film Someone To Watch Over Me.[92]\\r\\nAlong with Vangelis' compositions and ambient textures, the film's soundscape also features a track by the Japanese ensemble Nipponia?ÿ \\"Ogi no Mato\\" or \\"The Folding Fan as a Target\\" from the Nonesuch Records release Traditional Vocal and Instrumental Music?ÿ and a track by harpist Gail Laughton from \\"Harps of the Ancient Temples\\" on Laurel Records.[93]\\r\\nDespite being well received by fans and critically acclaimed and nominated in 1983 for a BAFTA and Golden Globe as best original score, and the promise of a soundtrack album from Polydor Records in the end titles of the film, the release of the official soundtrack recording was delayed for over a decade. There are two official releases of the music from Blade Runner. In light of the lack of a release of an album, the New American Orchestra recorded an orchestral adaptation in 1982 which bore little resemblance to the original. Some of the film tracks would, in 1989, surface on the compilation Vangelis: Themes, but not until the 1992 release of the Director's Cut version would a substantial amount of the film's score see commercial release.[91]\\r\\nThese delays and poor reproductions led to the production of many bootleg recordings over the years. A bootleg tape surfaced in 1982 at science fiction conventions and became popular given the delay of an official release of the original recordings, and in 1993 \\"Off World Music, Ltd\\" created a bootleg CD that would prove more comprehensive than Vangelis' official CD in 1994.[91] A set with three CDs of Blade Runner-related Vangelis music was released in 2007. Titled Blade Runner Trilogy, the first disc contains the same tracks as the 1994 official soundtrack release, the second features previously unreleased music from the movie, and the third disc is all newly composed music from Vangelis, inspired by, and in the spirit of the movie.[94]\\r\\nThe film's special effects are generally recognized to be among the best of all time,[95][96][97] using the available (non-digital) technology to the fullest. In addition to matte paintings and models, the techniques employed included multipass exposures. In some scenes, the set was lit, shot, the film rewound, and then rerecorded over with different lighting. In some cases this was done 16 times in all. The cameras were frequently motion controlled using computers.[96] Many effects used techniques which had been developed during the production of Close Encounters of the Third Kind.[98]\\r\\nBlade Runner was released in 1,290 theaters on June 25, 1982. That date was chosen by producer Alan Ladd Jr. because his previous highest-grossing films (Star Wars and Alien) had a similar opening date (May 25) in 1977 and 1979, making the 25th of the month his \\"lucky day\\".[99] Blade Runner grossed reasonably good ticket sales according to contemporary reports; earning $6.1 million during its first weekend in theaters.[100] The film was released close to other major sci-fi/fantasy releases such as The Thing, Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan, Conan the Barbarian and E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial.[101]\\r\\nInitial reactions among film critics were mixed. Some wrote that the plot took a back seat to the film's special effects, and did not fit the studio's marketing as an action/adventure movie. Others acclaimed its complexity and predicted it would stand the test of time.[102] Negative criticism in the United States cited its slow pace.[103] Sheila Benson from the Los Angeles Times called it \\"Blade Crawler\\", and Pat Berman in The State and Columbia Record described it as \\"science fiction pornography\\".[104] Pauline Kael praised Blade Runner as worthy of a place in film history for its distinctive sci-fi vision, yet criticized the film's lack of development in \\"human terms\\".[105]\\r\\nAcademics began writing analyses of the film almost as soon as it was released,[106] in particular its dystopic aspects, its questions regarding \\"authentic\\" humanity, its ecofeminist aspects,[107] in genre studies[108] and in recent years, popular culture. The film has been the subject of academic interest over decades.[109]\\r\\nSince its original release, the film has become a science fiction classic.[110] Roger Ebert praised the visuals of both the original and the Director's Cut versions and recommended it for that reason; however, he found the human story clichd and a little thin.[42] He later added The Final Cut to his \\"Great Movies\\" list.[111] Critic Chris Rodley and Janet Maslin theorized that Blade Runner changed cinematic and cultural discourse through its image repertoire, and subsequent influence on films.[112] In 2012, Time film critic Richard Corliss surgically analyzed the durability, complexity, screenplay, sets and production dynamics from a personal, three-decade perspective.[113] On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, Blade Runner holds an approval rating of 90% based on 106 reviews, with an average rating of 8.5/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \\"Misunderstood when it first hit theaters, the influence of Ridley Scott's mysterious, neo-noir Blade Runner has deepened with time. A visually remarkable, achingly human sci-fi masterpiece.\\"[114] Metacritic, another review aggregator, assigned the film a weighted average score of 89 out of 100, based on 11 critics, indicating \\"universal acclaim\\".[115] Denis Villeneuve, who directed the sequel, Blade Runner 2049, cites the film as a huge influence for him and many others.[110]\\r\\nBlade Runner won or received nominations for the following awards:[116]\\r\\nSeveral versions of Blade Runner have been shown. The original workprint version (1982, 113 minutes) was shown for audience test previews in Denver and Dallas in March 1982. Negative responses to the previews led to the modifications resulting in the U.S. theatrical version.[117][118] The workprint was shown as a director's cut without Scott's approval at the Los Angeles Fairfax Theater in May 1990, at an AMPAS showing in April 1991, and in September and October 1991 at the Los Angeles NuArt Theater and the San Francisco Castro Theatre.[119] Positive responses pushed the studio to approve work on an official director's cut.[120] A San Diego Sneak Preview was shown only once, in May 1982, and was almost identical to the U.S. theatrical version but contained three extra scenes not shown in any other version, including the 2007 Final Cut.[121]\\r\\nTwo versions were shown in the film's 1982 theatrical release: the U.S. theatrical version (117 minutes),[1] known as the original version or Domestic Cut (released on Betamax, CED Videodisc and VHS in 1983, and on LaserDisc in 1987), and the International Cut (117 minutes), also known as the \\"Criterion Edition\\" or \\"uncut version\\", which included more violent action scenes than the U.S. version. Although initially unavailable in the U.S. and distributed in Europe and Asia via theatrical and local Warner Home Video Laserdisc releases, the International Cut was later released on VHS and Criterion Collection Laserdisc in North America, and re-released in 1992 as a \\"10th Anniversary Edition\\".[122]\\r\\nRidley Scott's Director's Cut (1991, 116 minutes)[123] was made available on VHS and Laserdisc in 1993, and on DVD in 1997. Significant changes from the theatrical version include the removal of Deckard's voice-over; the re-insertion of the unicorn sequence, and the removal of the studio-imposed happy ending. Scott provided extensive notes and consultation to Warner Bros. through film preservationist Michael Arick, who was put in charge of creating the Director's Cut.[15] Scott's The Final Cut (2007, 117 minutes)[124] was released by Warner Bros. theatrically on October 5, 2007, and subsequently released on DVD, HD DVD, and Blu-ray Disc in December 2007.[16] This is the only version over which Scott had complete artistic and editorial control.[15]\\r\\nWhile not initially a success with North American audiences, Blade Runner was popular internationally and garnered a cult following.[125] The film's dark style and futuristic designs have served as a benchmark and its influence can be seen in many subsequent science fiction films, video games, anime, and television programs.[20] For example, Ronald D. Moore and David Eick, the producers of the re-imagining of Battlestar Galactica, have both cited Blade Runner as one of the major influences for the show.[126]\\r\\nThe film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry in 1993 and is frequently taught in university courses.[127] In 2007, it was named the second-most visually influential film of all time by the Visual Effects Society.[128] The film has also been the subject of parody, such as the comics Blade Bummer by Crazy comics,[129] Bad Rubber by Steve Gallacci,[130] and the Red Dwarf 2009 three-part miniseries \\"Back to Earth\\".[131][132]\\r\\nBlade Runner continues to reflect modern trends and concerns, and an increasing number of critics consider it one of the greatest science fiction films of all time.[133] It was voted the best science fiction film ever made in a 2004 poll of 60 eminent world scientists.[134] Blade Runner is also cited as an important influence to both the style and story of the Ghost in the Shell film series, which itself has been highly influential to the future-noir genre.[135][136] Blade Runner has been very influential to the cyberpunk movement.[137][138][139][140] It also influenced the cyberpunk derivative biopunk, which revolves around biotechnology and genetic engineering.[141][142]\\r\\nThe dialog and music in Blade Runner has been sampled in music more than any other film of the 20th century.[143][nb 3]\\r\\nThe 2009 album I, Human by Singaporean band Deus Ex Machina makes numerous references to the genetic engineering and cloning themes from the film, and even features a track titled \\"Replicant\\".[144]\\r\\nBlade Runner is cited as a major influence on Warren Spector,[145] designer of the video game Deus Ex, which displays evidence of the film's influence in both its visual rendering and plot. Indeed, the film's lookand in particular its overall darkness, preponderance of neon lights, and opaque visualsare easier to render than complicated backdrops, making it a popular reference point for video game designers.[146][147] It has influenced adventure games such as the 2012 graphical text adventure Cypher;[148] Rise of the Dragon;[149][150] Snatcher;[150][151] the Tex Murphy series;[152] Beneath a Steel Sky;[153] Flashback: The Quest for Identity;[150] Bubblegum Crisis (and its original anime films);[154][155] the role-playing game Shadowrun;[150] the first-person shooter Perfect Dark,[156] and the Syndicate series of video games.[157][158]\\r\\nAmong the folklore that has developed around the film over the years, there is a belief that Blade Runner cursed the companies whose logos were displayed prominently as product placement.[159] While they were market leaders at the time, Atari, Bell, Cuisinart, and Pan Am all experienced setbacks after the film's release. The Coca-Cola Company suffered losses when it introduced New Coke in 1985, but soon regained market share.[25]\\r\\nMedia recognitions for Blade Runner include:\\r\\nBefore filming began, Cinefantastique magazine commissioned Paul M. Sammon to write an article about Blade Runner's production which became the book Future Noir: The Making of Blade Runner.[181] The book chronicles Blade Runner's evolution, focusing on film-set politics, especially the British director's experiences with his first American film crew; of which producer Alan Ladd, Jr. has said, \\"Harrison wouldn't speak to Ridley and Ridley wouldn't speak to Harrison. By the end of the shoot Ford was 'ready to kill Ridley', said one colleague. He really would have taken him on if he hadn't been talked out of it.\\"[182] Future Noir has short cast biographies and quotations about their experiences, and photographs of the film's production and preliminary sketches. A second edition of Future Noir was published in 2007.[183]\\r\\nPhilip K. Dick refused a $400,000 offer to write a Blade Runner novelization, saying: \\"[I was] told the cheapo novelization would have to appeal to the twelve-year-old audience\\" and it \\"would have probably been disastrous to me artistically\\".

The 1997 video game featured new characters and branching storylines based on the Blade Runner world. Eldon Tyrell, Gaff, Leon, Rachael, Chew, and J.F.

The team began play in the 2017ÿ18 NHL season, and is a member of the Pacific Division of the Western Conference of the National Hockey League (NHL). The team is owned by Black Knight Sports & Entertainment, a consortium led by Bill Foley,[4] and plays its home games at T-Mobile Arena on the Las Vegas Strip in Paradise, Nevada.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe NHL has had a presence in Las Vegas since 1991, when an outdoor game was held in Las Vegas, with the Los Angeles Kings facing the New York Rangers outside Caesars Palace in a preseason exhibition game. The city has since hosted the Frozen Fury, a pre-season competition between the Los Angeles Kings and the Colorado Avalanche, and the NHL Awards ceremonies have been held in Las Vegas since 2009.[6] In 2009, the media speculated about a plan involving Hollywood producer Jerry Bruckheimer to move the Phoenix Coyotes to Nevada.[7]\\r\\nRumors of a Las Vegas expansion team surfaced again in August 2014, pointing to a new indoor arena on the Strip (built as a joint venture between Anschutz Entertainment Group, owners of the Los Angeles Kings, and MGM Resorts International) as the potential home arena, although these rumors were denied by the league.[8][9][10] In November 2014, an unconfirmed report stated that the league had selected billionaire businessman Bill Foley and the Maloof family (former owners of the National Basketball Association's Sacramento Kings, and founders of the Palms Casino Resort) to lead the ownership group for a Las Vegas expansion team.[11][12] In December 2014, the NHL's board of governors decided to allow Foley to hold a season ticket drive to gauge interest in a Las Vegas team, though league commissioner Gary Bettman also warned the media to \\"[not] make more out of this than it is\\".[13][14] The season ticket drive began in February 2015, with interested parties placing ten percent deposits for the 2016ÿ17 season.[15] The drive drew 5,000 deposits in its first day and a half, and reached its goal of 10,000 deposits by April 2015.[15][16]\\r\\nIn June 2015, the league officially opened the window for prospective owners to bid on expansion teams. By this point, Foley had secured more than 13,200 season-ticket deposits. Two expansion applications were submitted: Foley's application for a Las Vegas team, and a bid from Quebecor to revive the Quebec Nordiques at a new arena in Quebec City. Both Las Vegas and Quebec were invited to move into Phase II of the league expansion bid in August 2015,[17] and subsequently advanced to Phase III.\\r\\nAt the league owners' meeting on June 22, 2016, in Las Vegas, the Las Vegas expansion bid was approved by a unanimous vote, with play to begin in the 2017ÿ18 NHL season.[18] The team became the first major professional sports franchise to be based in Las Vegas, and the first NHL expansion team since 2000.[19] Foley committed to pay the league's $500 million expansion fee[20] and began the process of hiring the team's principal staff and determining its official identity. Foley announced that former Washington Capitals general manager George McPhee would be the franchise's first general manager.[21] On November 22, 2016, the name was revealed as the Vegas Golden Knights.\\r\\nOn March 1, 2017 (coinciding with the league's trade deadline), the team completed its expansion fee payments and filings, making it eligible to formally begin operations such as free agent acquisition, and participation in league meetings.[22] Five days later, the Golden Knights made its first personnel move by signing Reid Duke to a three-year entry-level contract.[23][24]\\r\\nThe team announced inaugural head coach Gerard Gallant on April 13, 2017.[25] Over the next two months, the Golden Knights developed their farm system, announcing affiliations with the Chicago Wolves of the American Hockey League and the Quad City Mallards of the ECHL.[26][27]\\r\\nThe team participated in the 2017 NHL Expansion Draft on June 21, 2017, selecting an available player from all 30 teams in the NHL. The draft picks were announced at T-Mobile Arena during the NHL Awards ceremony. Some notable selections included goalie Marc-Andre Fleury from the Pittsburgh Penguins and winger James Neal from the Nashville Predators. At the 2017 NHL Entry Draft, Cody Glass was the first player selected by the Golden Knights. The Golden Knights played their first game on October 6 against the Dallas Stars with Neal scoring the franchise's first two goals en route to their first victory.[28]\\r\\nThe team's inaugural home game was played on October 10, 2017, hosting the Arizona Coyotes as the second game of a home-and-home series. In the aftermath of the October 1 mass shooting, the pre-game ceremonies honored the victims of the attack, and the team issued an appeal for donations to its charitable arm.[29] With their 5ÿ2 win, the Golden Knights increased their unbeaten streak to start the season to 3ÿ0, an NHL record for an expansion team.[30][31][32] The Golden Knights are the first team in NHL history to have started their inaugural season winning eight of their first nine games. During their tenth game, goaltender Oscar Dansk was injured becoming third Golden Knights' goaltender to be injured during the season after losing starters Fleury and the recently acquired Malcolm Subban, forcing the team to start a fourth goaltender in 11 games with Maxime Lagace.[33] Fifteen games into the season, Vadim Shipachyov became the first player to retire from the NHL as a Golden Knight when he decided to return to the Kontinental Hockey League. In December, the Golden Knights set another NHL expansion team record of six straight wins, a record they had previously missed when they lost their tenth game of the season, and established a new NHL record with eight straight wins.[34][35][36] On February 1, 2018, the Golden Knights set the expansion team record for wins in a debut season with 34 wins after only 50 games,[37] and then on February 21, 2018, set a record for most points by an expansion team in the inaugural season with 84.[38] On March 26, the Golden Knights became the first team since the Edmonton Oilers and Hartford Whalers in the 1979ÿ80 season to make the playoffs in their inaugural season in the league.[39] On March 31, the Knights clinched the Pacific Division title, becoming the first true expansion team in the four major sports to win its division in its inaugural season (not counting all-expansion divisions, as was the case in the 1967ÿ68 season).[40] They had led the Pacific since December 23.\\r\\nThe team's name includes \\"Knights\\" as a homage to the Black Knights of the United States Military Academy, Foley's alma mater, and because knights were, according to Foley, \\"the epitome of the warrior class\\".[41][42] Foley had hoped to name his team the Black Knights, but dropped that plan after encountering resistance from federal officials. Foley was unable call the team the \\"Vegas Knights\\" due to the London Knights owning the \\"Knights\\" name in Canada.[42][43][44]\\r\\n\\"Golden\\" was included in the name because gold is, as Foley stated, the \\"No. 1 precious metal\\", and because Nevada is the largest gold-producing state in the country.[42][45]\\r\\n\\"Las\\" was omitted from the team's name because, according to Foley, residents tend to refer to the city simply as \\"Vegas\\", and because a four-word name would have been too long.[45]\\r\\nThe United States Army initially expressed concern after the Golden Knights' name was announced, because their parachute team uses the same nickname.[43] The Army later disputed the trademark and colors of the team during its first season, to which the team responded: \\"We are not aware of a single complaint from anyone attending our games that they were expecting to see the parachute team and not a professional hockey game.\\"[46] An objection was also raised by the College of Saint Rose because its sports teams use the same name; the Vegas team's initial trademark application was denied as a result, but was later approved on appeal.[47] The team did clear the name with Clarkson University, which also uses the name Golden Knights.[48]\\r\\nThe team's primary logo is a barbute helmet, superimposed on a black and gold seal, with a V-shaped opening.[41][45]\\r\\nThe secondary logo is two crossing swords behind a red star, designed to resemble a star found on the landmark Welcome to Fabulous Las Vegas sign.[45]\\r\\nThe team's primary color is steel gray, which is said to represent \\"strength and durability\\".[45][1] The other team colors are gold, red (found in the Las Vegas skyline and at Red Rock Canyon), and black (for \\"power and intensity\\").[1]\\r\\nThe Golden Knights' mascot is a Gila monster named Chance. He was unveiled at the team's second home game on October 13, 2017.[49][50] The team opted against using a knight for a mascot because it found that knight mascots used by other teams were not very child-friendly.[51]\\r\\nUpdated March 22, 2018.[52][53]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe #58 was retired by the team on March 31, 2018 in honor of the 58 victims killed in the 2017 Las Vegas shooting.[54]\\r\\nThe team is also not able to issue the jersey number #99 to any of its players as that number was retired league-wide in honor of Wayne Gretzky at the 2000 NHL All-Star Game.[55]\\r\\nAT&T SportsNet Rocky Mountain (formerly Root Sports) is the regional television rightsholder for all Golden Knights games not broadcast nationally by NBCSN or NBC.

They were considered the source of the knowledge embodied in the poetry, lyric songs, and myths that were related orally for centuries in these ancient cultures. They were later adopted by the Romans as a part of their pantheon.\\r\\nIn current English usage, \\"muse\\" can refer in general to a person who inspires an artist, musician, or writer.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe word \\"Muses\\" (/?mju?z?z/; Ancient Greek: ?ϫ, Mo?sai) perhaps came from the o-grade of the Proto-Indo-European root *men- (\\"to think\\")[2] or from root *men- (\\"to tower, mountain\\") since all the most important cult-centres of the Muses were on mountains or hills.[3] R. S. P. Beekes rejects both etymologies and suggests a Pre-Greek origin.[4]\\r\\nThe earliest known records of the Nine Muses are from Boeotia, the homeland of Hesiod.\\r\\nSome ancient authorities thought that the Nine Muses were of Thracian origin.[5]\\r\\nThere, a tradition persisted that the Muses had once been three in number.[6]\\r\\nIn the first century BC, Diodorus Siculus quotes Hesiod to the contrary, observing:\\r\\nWriters similarly disagree also concerning the number of the Muses; for some say that there are three, and others that there are nine, but the number nine has prevailed since it rests upon the authority of the most distinguished men, such as Homer and Hesiod and others like them.[7]\\r\\nDiodorus also states (Book I.18) that Osiris first recruited the nine Muses, along with the Satyrs, while passing through Ethiopia, before embarking on a tour of all Asia and Europe, teaching the arts of cultivation wherever he went.\\r\\nAccording to Hesiod's account (c. 600 BC), generally followed by the writers of antiquity, the Nine Muses were the nine daughters of Zeus and Mnemosyne (i.?e. \\"Memory\\" personified), figuring as personifications of knowledge and the arts, especially literature, dance and music.\\r\\nThe Roman scholar Varro (116ÿ27 BC) relates that there are only three Muses: one born from the movement of water, another who makes sound by striking the air, and a third who is embodied only in the human voice. They were called Melete or \\"Practice\\", Mneme or \\"Memory\\" and Aoide or \\"Song\\". Three ancient Muses were also reported in Plutarch's (46ÿ120 AD) Quaestiones Convivales[8] (9.I4.2ÿ4).[9]\\r\\nHowever, the classical understanding of the Muses tripled their triad and established a set of nine goddesses, who embody the arts and inspire creation with their graces through remembered and improvised song and mime, writing, traditional music, and dance. It was not until Hellenistic times that the following systematic set of functions was assigned to them, and even then there was some variation in both their names and their attributes: Calliope (epic poetry), Clio (history), Euterpe (flutes and lyric poetry), Thalia (comedy and pastoral poetry), Melpomene (tragedy), Terpsichore (dance), Erato (love poetry), Polyhymnia (sacred poetry), Urania (astronomy).\\r\\nAccording to Pausanias in the later second century AD,[10] there were originally three Muses, worshipped on Mount Helicon in Boeotia: Aoid? (\\"song\\" or \\"tune\\"), Melt (\\"practice\\" or \\"occasion\\"), and Mn?m (\\"memory\\"). Together, these three form the complete picture of the preconditions of poetic art in cult practice.\\r\\nIn Delphi three Muses were worshiped as well, but with other names: N?t, Ms, and Hypat, which are assigned as the names of the three cords of the ancient musical instrument, the lyre.\\r\\nAlternatively, later they were called Kphis?, Apollns, and Borysthens, which names characterize them as daughters of Apollo.\\r\\nIn a later tradition, a set of four Muses were recognized: Thelxin܇, Aoid? Arch, and Melt, said to be daughters of Zeus and Plusia or of Ouranos.\\r\\nOne of the people frequently associated with the Muses was Pierus. By some he was called the father (by a Pimpleian nymph, called Antiope by Cicero) of a total of seven Muses, called Neil? (?), Trit?n (?), Asp? (??), Heptpora (??ϫ), Achels, Tipopl? (?), and Rhoda (?Ѵ?ϫ).[11]\\r\\nAccording to Hesiod's Theogony (seventh century BC), they were daughters of Zeus, king of the gods, and Mnemosyne, Titan goddess of memory. For Alcman and Mimnermus, they were even more primordial, springing from the early deities Ouranos and Gaia. Gaia is Mother Earth, an early mother goddess who was worshipped at Delphi from prehistoric times, long before the site was rededicated to Apollo, possibly indicating a transfer to association with him after that time.\\r\\nSometimes the Muses are referred to as water nymphs, associated with the springs of Helicon and with Pieris. It was said that the winged horse Pegasus touched his hooves to the ground on Helicon, causing four sacred springs to burst forth, from which the Muses were born.[12] Athena later tamed the horse and presented him to the Muses (compare the Roman inspiring nymphs of springs, the Camenae, the V?lva of Norse Mythology and also the apsaras in the mythology of classical India).\\r\\nClassical writers set Apollo as their leader, Apollon Mousagets (\\"Apollo Muse-leader\\").[13] In one myth, the Muses judged a contest between Apollo and Marsyas. They also gathered the pieces of the dead body of Orpheus, son of Calliope, and buried them in Leivithra. In a later myth, Thamyris challenged them to a singing contest. They won and punished Thamyris by blinding him and robbing him of his singing ability.\\r\\nAccording to a myth from Ovid's Metamorphosesalluding to the connection of the Muses with Pieria  Pierus, king of Macedon, had nine daughters he named after the nine Muses, believing that their skills were a great match to the Muses. He thus challenged the Muses to a match, resulting in his daughters, the Pierides, being turned into chattering magpies for their presumption.[14]\\r\\nPausanias records a tradition of two generations of Muses; the first are the daughters of Ouranos and Gaia, the second of Zeus and Mnemosyne. Another, rarer genealogy is that they are daughters of Harmonia (the daughter of Aphrodite and Ares), which contradicts the myth in which they were dancing at the wedding of Harmonia and Cadmus.\\r\\nSome Greek writers give the names of the nine Muses as Kallichore, Helike, Eunike, Thelxino?, Terpsichore, Euterpe, Eukelade, Dia, and Enope.[15]\\r\\nIn Renaissance and Neoclassical art, the dissemination of emblem books such as Cesare Ripa's Iconologia (1593 and many further editions) helped standardize the depiction of the Muses in sculpture and painting, so they could be distinguished by certain props. These props, or emblems, became readily identifiable by the viewer, enabling one immediately to recognize the Muse and the art with which she had become associated. Here again, Calliope (epic poetry) carries a writing tablet; Clio (history) carries a scroll and books; Euterpe (song and elegiac poetry) carries a flute, the aulos; Erato (lyric poetry) is often seen with a lyre and a crown of roses; Melpomene (tragedy) is often seen with a tragic mask; Polyhymnia (sacred poetry) is often seen with a pensive expression; Terpsichore (choral dance and song) is often seen dancing and carrying a lyre; Thalia (comedy) is often seen with a comic mask; and Urania (astronomy) carries a pair of compasses and the celestial globe.\\r\\nGreek mousa is a common noun as well as a type of goddess: it literally means \\"art\\" or \\"poetry\\". According to Pindar, to \\"carry a mousa\\" is \\"to excel in the arts\\". The word derives from the Indo-European root men-, which is also the source of Greek Mnemosyne and mania, English \\"mind\\", \\"mental\\" and \\"monitor\\", Sanskrit mantra and Avestan Mazda.[16]\\r\\nThe Muses, therefore, were both the embodiments and sponsors of performed metrical speech: mousike (whence the English term \\"music\\") was just \\"one of the arts of the Muses\\". Others included Science, Geography, Mathematics, Philosophy, and especially Art, Drama, and inspiration. In the archaic period, before the widespread availability of books (scrolls), this included nearly all of learning. The first Greek book on astronomy, by Thales, took the form of dactylic hexameters, as did many works of pre-Socratic philosophy. Both Plato and the Pythagoreans explicitly included philosophy as a sub-species of mousike.[17] The Histories of Herodotus, whose primary medium of delivery was public recitation, were divided by Alexandrian editors into nine books, named after the nine Muses.\\r\\nFor poet and \\"law-giver\\" Solon,[18] the Muses were \\"the key to the good life\\"; since they brought both prosperity and friendship. Solon sought to perpetuate his political reforms by establishing recitations of his poetrycomplete with invocations to his practical-minded Musesby Athenian boys at festivals each year. He believed that the Muses would help inspire people to do their best.\\r\\nAncient authors and their imitators invoke Muses when writing poetry, hymns or epic history. The invocation occurs near the beginning of their work. It asks for help or inspiration from the Muses, or simply invites the Muse to sing directly through the author.\\r\\nOriginally, the invocation of the Muse was an indication that the speaker was working inside the poetic tradition, according to the established formulas. For example:\\r\\nSing to me of the man, Muse, the man of twists and turns\\r\\ndriven time and again off course, once he had plundered the hallowed heights of Troy.\\r\\nO Muse! the causes and the crimes relate;\\r\\nWhat goddess was provok'd, and whence her hate; For what offense the Queen of Heav'n began To persecute so brave, so just a man; [...]\\r\\nBesides Homer and Virgil, other famous works that included an invocation of the Muse are the first of the carmina by Catullus, Ovid's Metamorphoses and Amores, Dante's Inferno (Canto II), Chaucer's Troilus and Criseyde (Book II), Shakespeare's Henry V (Act 1, Prologue), his 38th sonnet, and Milton's Paradise Lost (opening of Book 1).\\r\\nWhen Pythagoras arrived at Croton, his first advice to the Crotoniates was to build a shrine to the Muses at the center of the city, to promote civic harmony and learning. Local cults of the Muses often became associated with springs or with fountains. The Muses themselves were sometimes called Aganippids because of their association with a fountain called Aganippe. Other fountains, Hippocrene and Pirene, were also important locations associated with the Muses. Some sources occasionally referred to the Muses as \\"Corycides\\" (or \\"Corycian nymphs\\") after a cave on Mount Parnassos, called the Corycian Cave. Pausanias referred to the Muses by the surnames \\"Ardalides\\" or \\"Ardaliotides\\", because of a sanctuary to them at Troezen said to have been built by the mythical Ardalus.\\r\\nThe Muses were venerated especially in Boeotia, in the Valley of the Muses near Helicon, and in Delphi and the Parnassus, where Apollo became known as Mousagetes (\\"Muse-leader\\") after the sites were rededicated to his cult.\\r\\nOften Muse-worship was associated with the hero-cults of poets: the tombs of Archilochus on Thasos and of Hesiod and Thamyris in Boeotia all played host to festivals in which poetic recitations accompanied sacrifices to the Muses. The Library of Alexandria and its circle of scholars formed around a mousaion (i.?e. \\"museum\\" or shrine of the Muses) close to the tomb of Alexander the Great. Many Enlightenment figures sought to re-establish a \\"Cult of the Muses\\" in the 18th century. A famous Masonic lodge in pre-Revolutionary Paris was called Les Neuf Soeurs (\\"The Nine Sisters\\", that is, the Nine Muses); Voltaire, Benjamin Franklin, Danton, and other influential Enlightenment figures attended it. As a side-effect of this movement the word \\"museum\\" (originally, \\"cult place of the Muses\\") came to refer to a place for the public display of knowledge.\\r\\nNot only are the Muses explicitly used in modern English to refer to an artistic inspiration, as when one cites one's own artistic muse, but they also are implicit in words and phrases such as \\"amuse\\", \\"museum\\" (Latinised from mouseiona place where the Muses were worshipped), \\"music\\", and \\"musing upon\\".[19] In current literature, the influential role that the Muse plays has been extended to the political sphere.[20] Along with a majority of the Greek Gods, five of the Muses (Thalia, Clio, Calliope, Melpomene and Terpsicore) appeared in the Walt Disney animated film Hercules (based on Hercules), where they narrate the film through gospel-inspired song and dance. These versions of the Muses are modeled after African American Gospel singers. All nine muses appear in the 1980 film Xanadu, with actress Olivia Newton-John as Terpsicore. All nine Muses appeared in several paintings in the 72-piece art collection of Dante's Inferno by Dino Di Durante, which is printed in books titled Inferno: The Art Collection and available in 33 languages. This said collection was also featured in the medium length film Dante's Hell Animated by Boris Acosta.

A lower dose should be used in people with liver disease.[2] While there is no evidence of harm if used during pregnancy it has not been studied for this use.[3] It is unclear if it is safe for use during breastfeeding.[2] It is in the antihelmintic family of medications. It works by paralyzing worms.[4]\\r\\nPyrantel was initially described in 1965.[5] It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, the most effective and safe medicines needed in a health system.[6] Pyrantel is available as a generic medication.[4] It costs less than 25 USD per course of treatment in the United States.[1] It may also be used to treat worms in a number of other animals.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPyrantel pamoate is considered a Pregnancy category C drug for use during pregnancy for humans, but is in category A for canines and felines. Pyrantel is considered safe to use in nursing animals.[7]\\r\\nPyrantel pamoate acts as a depolarizing neuromuscular blocking agent, thereby causing sudden contraction, followed by paralysis, of the helminths. This has the result of causing the worm to \\"lose its grip\\" on the intestinal wall and be passed out of the system by natural process. Since Pyrantel is poorly absorbed by the host's intestine, the host is unaffected by the small dosage of medication used. Spastic (tetanic) paralyzing agents, in particular pyrantel pamoate, may induce complete intestinal obstruction in a heavy worm load.[8] This obstruction is usually in the form of a worm impaction and happens when a very small, but heavily parasitized animal is treated and tries to pass a large number of dislodged worms at once.

Flyorov wrote a letter to Stalin urging him to start this program in 1942.[9]:78-79 Initial efforts were slowed due to the German invasion of the Soviet Union and remained largely composed of the intelligence knowledge gained from the spy rings working in the U.S.' Manhattan Project in 1943.[2]\\r\\nAfter learning of the atomic bombings of Japanese cities that officially ended World War II in 1945, the program was aggressively pursued, mainly through effective intelligence gathering about the German weapon project and the American Manhattan Project.[10] The Russian efforts also rounded up captured German scientists to join their program, and relied heavily on knowledge passed by the spy ring to the Russian intelligence agencies .[11]:242-243\\r\\nOn 29 August 1949, the Soviet Union secretly conducted its first successful weapon test (First Lightning), based on the U.S. design at the Semipalatinsk in Kazakhstan.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAs early as 1910 in Russia, independent research was being conducted on radioactive elements by several Russian scientists.:44[12]:24-25[13] Despite the hardship faced by the Russian academy of sciences during the national revolution in 1917, followed by the violent civil war in 1922, the Russian scientists had made remarkable efforts towards the advancement of physics research in the Soviet Union in the 1930s.[14]:35-36 Before the first revolution in 1905, the mineralogist Vladimir Vernadsky had made a number of public calls for a survey of Russia's uranium deposits but none were heeded.[14]:37\\r\\nHowever, such early efforts were independently and privately funded by various organizations until 1922 when the Radium Institute in Petrograd (now Saint Petersburg) opened and industrialized the research.:44[12]\\r\\nFrom the 1920s until the late 1930s, Russian physicists had been conducting joint research with their European counterparts on the advancement of atomic physics at the Cavendish Laboratory run by a British physicist, Ernest Rutherford, where Georgi Gamov and Pyotr Kapitsa had studied and researched.[14]:36\\r\\nInfluential research towards the advancement of nuclear physics was guided by Abram Ioffe, who was the director at the Leningrad Physical-Technical Institute (LPTI), having sponsored various research program at various technical schools in the Soviet Union.[14]:36 The discovery of the neutron by the British physicist James Chadwick further provided promising expansion of the LPTI's program, with the operation of the first cyclotron to energies of over 1 MeV, and the first \\"splitting\\" of the atomic nucleus by John Cockcroft and Ernest Walton.[14]:36-37 Russian physicists began pushing the government, lobbying in the interest of the development of science in the Soviet Union, which had received little interest due to the upheavals created during the Russian revolution and the February Revolution.[14]:36-37 Earlier research was directed towards the medical and scientific exploration of radium, that could be retrieved from borehole water from the Ukhta oilfields.[14]:37\\r\\nIn 1939, German chemist Otto Hahn reported his discovery of fission, achieved by the splitting of uranium with neutrons that produced the much lighter element barium. This eventually led to the realization among Russian scientists, and their American counterparts, that such reaction could have military significance.:20[15] The discovery excited the Russian physicists, and they began conducting their independent investigations on nuclear fission, mainly aiming towards power generation, as many were skeptical of possibility of creating an atomic bomb anytime soon.:25[16] Early efforts were led by Yakov Frenkel (a physicist specialised on condensed matter), who did the first theoretical calculations on continuum mechanics directly relating the kinematics of binding energy in fission process in 1940.:99[15] Georgy Flyorov's and Lev Rusinov's collaborative work on thermal reactions concluded that 3-1 neutrons were emitted per fission only days after similar conclusions had been reached by the team of Frdric Joliot-Curie.:63[15]:200[17]\\r\\nAfter a strong lobbying of Russian scientists, the Soviet government did initially set up a commission that was to address the \\"uranium problem\\" and investigate the possibility of chain reaction and Isotope separation.:33[18] The Uranium Problem Commission was ineffective due to the German invasion of Soviet Union that eventually limited the focus on research as Russia became engaged in a bloody conflict along the Eastern Front for next four years.:114-115[19]:200[20] The Soviet atomic weapons program had no significance and most work was unclassified as the papers were continuously published as public domain on academic journals.:33[18]\\r\\nJoseph Stalin, the Soviet leader, had mostly disregarded the atomic knowledge possessed by the Russian scientists and had most of the scientists working in the metallurgy and mining industry or serving in the Soviet Armed Forces technical branches during the World War II's eastern front in 1940ÿ42.:xx[21]\\r\\nIn 1940ÿ42, Georgy Flyorov, a Russian physicist serving as an officer in the Soviet Air Force, suspected that despite of the progress made in advancement of physics, the German, British, and American scientists, had ceased publishing papers on nuclear science.:230[22]\\r\\nIn April 1942, Flyorov directed two classified letters to Stalin, citing that lack of response he had himself encountered trying to generate interest in similar research, and warned Stalin of the consequences of the development of atomic weapons: \\"...the results will be so overriding [that] it won't be necessary to determine who is to blame for the fact that this work has been neglected in our country.\\":xxx[23] The second letter, by Flyorov and Konstantin Petrzhak, highly emphasized the making of a \\"uranium bomb\\": \\"it is [sic] essential to manufacture [sic] a uranium bomb without a delay.\\":230[22]\\r\\nUpon reading the Flyorov letters, Stalin immediately pulled out the Russian physicists from their respective military services and authorized an atomic bomb project set-up under Anatoly Alexandrov, an engineering physicist, and Igor V. Kurchatov, a nuclear physicist.:230[22]:xx[21] For this purpose, the Laboratory No. 2 near Moscow was established under Kurchatov.:230[22] During the same time, Flyorov was moved to Dubna where he established the Laboratory of Nuclear Reactions, which focused on researching synthetic elements and thermal reactions.:xx[21] In late 1942, the State Defense Committee officially delegated the program to the Soviet Army, with major war time logistical efforts later being supervised by Lavrentiy Beria, the head of NKVD.:115:114-115[19]\\r\\nIn 1945, the Arzamas 16 site near Moscow was established under Yakov Zel'dovich and Yuli Khariton who performed calculations on nuclear combustion theory, alongside Isaak Pomeranchuk.:117-118[24] Despite early and accelerated efforts, it was reported by historians that efforts on building a bomb using weapon-grade uranium seemed hopeless to Russian scientists.:117-118[24] Igor Kurchatov had harboured doubts working towards the uranium bomb, made progress on a bomb using weapon-grade plutonium after British data was provided by the NKVD.:117-118[24]\\r\\nThe situation dramatically changed when the Soviet Union learned of the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945, which eventually led to the unilateral surrender of Japan to the United States, ending the war in Asia.:2-5[25]\\r\\nImmediately after the atomic bombing, the Soviet Politburo took control of the atomic bomb project by establishing a special committee to oversee the development of nuclear weapons as soon as possible.:2-5[25] On 9 April 1946, the Council of Ministers created the KBÿ11 Design Bureau that worked towards mapping the first nuclear weapon design, primarily based on American approach and detonated with weapon-grade plutonium.:2-5[25] From this point, the work on the program was carried out quickly, resulting in the first nuclear reactor near Moscow on 25 October 1946.:2-5[25]\\r\\nFrom 1941ÿ46, the Soviet Union's Ministry of Foreign Affairs handled the logistics matters relating to the atomic bomb project with Foreign Minister Vyacheslav Molotov controlling the direction of the program.:33[26] However, Molotov was seen as weak administrator, and the program stagnated through its completion.[27] Contrary to American military administration in their atomic bomb project, the Russians had their program's direction ran political dignitaries such as Molotov, Lavrentiy Beria, Georgii Malenkov, and Mikhail Pervukhin, there were no military members..[28]\\r\\nAfter the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the program's leadership changed when Stalin appointed Lavrentiy Beria on 22 August 1945.[27] Beria is noted for leadership that helped the program to its final implementation.[27]\\r\\nBeria understood the necessary scope and dynamics of research. This man, who was the personification of evil modern Russian history, also possessed the great energy and capacity to work. The scientists who met him could not fail to recognize his intelligence, his will power, and his purposefullness. They found him first-class administrator who could carry a job through to completion...\\r\\nThe new Committee, under Beria, had retained Georgii Malenkov while also including Nikolai Voznesensky and Boris Vannikov, People's Commissar for Armament.[27] Under the administration of Beria, the NKVD aided atomic spies of the Soviet Atomic Spy Ring and infiltrated the German nuclear program.[27]\\r\\nThe atomic and industrial espionages in the United States by American sympathisers of communism who were controlled by their rezident Russian officials in North America greatly aided the speed of the Soviet atomic project from 1942ÿ54.:105-106[29]:287-305[30] Willingness of sharing classified information to Soviet Union by recruited American communist sympathizers increased when the Soviet Union faced possible defeat during the German invasion in World War II.:287-289[30] The Russian intelligence network in the United Kingdom also played a vital role in setting up the spy rings in the United States when the Russian State Defense Committee approved resolution 2352[clarification needed], in September of 1942.:105-106[29]\\r\\nFor this purpose, the spy Harry Gold, controlled by Semyon Semyonov, was used for a wide range of espionage that included industrial espionage in the American chemical industry and obtaining sensitive atomic information that were handed over to him by the British physicist Klaus Fuchs.:289-290[30] Knowledge and further technical information that were passed by the American Theodore Hall, a theoretical physicist, and Klaus Fuchs had a significant impact on the direction of Russian development of nuclear weapons.:105[29]\\r\\nLeonid Kvasnikov, a Russian chemical engineer turned KGB officer, was assigned for this special purpose and moved to New York City to coordinate such activities.[31] Anatoli Yatzkov, another NKVD official in New York, was also involved in obtaining sensitive information gathered by Sergei Kournakov from Saville Sax.[31]\\r\\nThe existence of Russian spies were exposed by the U.S. Army's secretive Venona project in 1943.:54[32]\\r\\nFor example, Soviet work on methods of uranium isotope separation was altered when it was reported, to Kurchatov's surprise, that the Americans had opted for the Gaseous diffusion method. While research on other separation methods continued throughout the war years, the emphasis was placed on replicating U.S. success with gaseous diffusion. Another important breakthrough, attributed to intelligence, was the possibility of using plutonium instead of uranium in a fission weapon. Extraction of plutonium in the so-called \\"uranium pile\\" allowed bypassing of the difficult process of uranium separation altogether, something that Kurchatov had learned from intelligence from the Manhattan project.[citation needed]\\r\\nIn 1945, the Soviet intelligence obtained rough blueprints of the first U.S. atomic device.[33][34] Alexei Kojevnikov has estimated, based on newly released Soviet documents, that the primary way in which the espionage may have sped up the Soviet project was that it allowed Khariton to avoid dangerous tests to determine the size of the critical mass: \\"tickling the dragon's tail,\\" as it was called in the U.S., consumed a good deal of time and claimed at least two lives; see Harry Daghlian and Louis Slotin.\\r\\nThe published Smyth Report of 1945 on the Manhattan Project was translated into Russian, and the translators noted that a sentence on the effect of \\"poisoning\\" of Plutonium-239 in the first (lithograph) edition had been deleted from the next (Princeton) edition by Groves. This change was noted by the Russian translators, and alerted the Soviet Union to the problem (which had meant that reactor-bred plutonium could not be used in a simple gun-type bomb like the proposed Thin Man).\\r\\nOne of the key pieces of information, which Soviet intelligence obtained from Fuchs, was a cross-section for D-T fusion. This data was available to top Soviet officials roughly three years before it was openly published in the Physical Review in 1949. However, this data was not forwarded to Vitaly Ginzburg or Andrei Sakharov until very late, practically months before publication.[citation needed] Initially both Ginzburg and Sakharov estimated such a cross-section to be similar to the D-D reaction. Once the actual cross-section become known to Ginzburg and Sakharov, the Sloika design become a priority, which resulted in a successful test in 1953.\\r\\nIn the 1990s, with the declassification of Soviet intelligence materials, which showed the extent and the type of the information obtained by the Soviets from US sources, a heated debate ensued in Russia and abroad as to the relative importance of espionage, as opposed to the Soviet scientists' own efforts, in the making of the Soviet bomb. The vast majority of scholars[Like whom?] agree that whereas the Soviet atomic project was first and foremost a product of local expertise and scientific talent, it is clear that espionage efforts contributed to the project in various ways and most certainly shortened the time needed to develop the atomic bomb.[citation needed]\\r\\nComparing the timelines of H-bomb development, some researchers came to the conclusion that the Soviets had a gap in access to classified information regarding the H-bomb at least between late 1950 and some time in 1953. Earlier, e.g., in 1948, Fuchs gave the Soviets a detailed update of the classical super progress[clarification needed], including an idea to use lithium, but did not explain it was specifically lithium-6. Teller accepted the fact that \\"classical super\\" scheme was infeasible by 1951, following results obtained by various researchers (including Stanislaw Ulam) and calculations performed by John von Neumann in late 1950.\\r\\nYet the research for the Soviet analogue of \\"classical super\\" continued until December 1953, when the researchers were reallocated to a new project working on what later became a true H-bomb design, based on radiation implosion. It remains an open topic for research, whether the Soviet intelligence was able to obtain any specific data on Teller-Ulam design in 1953 or early 1954. Yet, Soviet officials directed the scientists to work on a new scheme, and the entire process took less than two years, commencing around January 1954 and producing a successful test in November 1955. It also took just several months before the idea of radiation implosion was conceived, and there is no documented evidence claiming priority. It is also possible that Soviets were able to obtain a document lost by John Wheeler on a train in 1953, which reportedly contained key information about thermonuclear weapon design.\\r\\nEarly ideas of the fusion bomb came from espionage and internal Soviet studies. Though the espionage did help Soviet studies, the early American H-bomb concepts had substantial flaws, so it may have confused, rather than assisted, the Soviet effort for a nuclear bomb.[35] The designers of early thermonuclear bombs envisioned using an atomic bomb as a trigger to provide the needed heat and compression to initiate the thermonuclear reaction in a layer of liquid deuterium between the fissile material and the surrounding chemical high explosive.[36] The group would realize that a lack of sufficient heat and compression of the deuterium would result in an insignificant fusion of the deuterium fuel.[36]\\r\\nAndrei Sakharovs study group at FIAN in 1948 came up with a second concept which was adding a shell of natural, unenriched uranium around the deuterium would increase the deuterium concentration at the uranium-deuterium boundary and the overall yield of the device, because the natural uranium would capture neutrons and itself fission as part of the thermonuclear reaction. This idea of a layered fission-fusion-fission bomb led Sakharov to call it the sloika, or layered cake.[36] It was also known as the RDS-6S, or Second Idea Bomb.[37] This second bomb idea was not a fully evolved thermonuclear bomb in the contemporary sense, but a crucial step between pure fission bombs and the thermonuclear supers.[38] Due to the three-year lag in making the key breakthrough of radiation compression from the United States the Soviet Unions development efforts followed a different course of action. In the United States they decided to skip the single-stage fusion bomb and make a two-stage fusion bomb as their main effort.[36][39] Unlike the Soviet Union, the analog RDS-7 advanced fission bomb was not further developed, and instead, the single-stage 400-kiloton RDS-6S was the Soviets bomb of choice.[36] The RDS-6S Layer Cake design was detonated on 12 August 1953, producing a yield of 400 kilotons, about ten times more powerful than any previous Soviet test. Around this time the United States detonated its first super using radiation compression on 1 November 1952, code-named Mike. Though the Mike was about twenty times greater than the RDS-6S it was not a design that was practical to use, unlike the RDS-6S.[36]\\r\\nFollowing the successful launching of the RDS-6S Sakharov proposed an upgraded version called RDS-6SD.[36] This bomb was proved to be faulty, and it was neither built nor tested. The Soviet team had been working on the RDS-6T concept, but it also proved to be a dead end. In 1954, Sakharov worked on a third concept, a two-stage thermonuclear bomb.[36] The third idea used the radiation wave of a fission bomb, not simply heat and compression, to ignite the fusion reaction, and paralleled the discovery made by Ulam and Teller. Unlike the RDS-6S boosted bomb, which placed the fusion fuel inside the primary A-bomb trigger, the thermonuclear super placed the fusion fuel in a secondary structure a small distance from the A-bomb trigger, where it was compressed and ignited by the A-bombs x-ray radiation.[36] The KB-11 Scientific-Technical Council approved plans to proceed with the design on 24 December 1954. Technical specifications for the new bomb were completed on 3 February 1955, and it was designated the RDS-37.[36]\\r\\nThe RDS-37 was successfully tested on 22 November 1955 with a yield of 1.6 megaton. The yield was almost a hundred times greater than the first Soviet atomic bomb six years before, showing that the Soviet Union could compete with the United States.[36][40]\\r\\nThe single largest problem during the early Soviet project was the procurement of uranium ore, as the USSR had no known domestic sources at the beginning of the project. The Soviet F-1 reactor, which began operation in December 1946, was fueled using uranium confiscated from the remains of the German atomic bomb project. This uranium had been mined in the Belgian Congo, and the ore in Belgium fell into the hands of the Germans after their invasion and occupation of Belgium in 1940 (although Edgar Sengier sold the rich Shinkolobwe ore from the Congo, some of which was held in America, to America). Further sources of uranium in the early years of the program were mines in East Germany (SAG Wismut), Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria, Romania (near Stei) and Poland. Boris Pregel sold 0.23 tonnes of uranium oxide to the Soviet Union during the war, with the authorisation of the U.S. Government.[41][42][43]\\r\\nEventually large domestic sources were discovered in the Soviet Union (including those now in Kazakhstan).\\r\\nThe uranium for the Soviet nuclear weapons program came from mine production in the following countries,[44]\\r\\nRDS-1, the first Soviet atomic test was internally code-named First Lightning (楿־ 񶶷, or Pervaya Molniya) August 29, 1949, and was code-named by the Americans as Joe 1. The design was very similar to the first US \\"Fat Man\\" plutonium bomb, using a TNT/hexogen implosion lens design.\\r\\nOn September 24, 1951, the 38.3 kiloton device RDS-2 was tested based on a tritium \\"boosted\\" uranium implosion device with a levitated core.[45] This test was code named Joe 2 by the CIA.\\r\\nRDS-3 was the third Soviet atomic bomb. On October 18, 1951, the 41.2 kiloton device was detonated - a boosted weapon using a composite construction of levitated plutonium core and a uranium-235 shell. Code named Joe 3 in the USA, this was the first Soviet air-dropped bomb test. Released at an altitude of 10?km, it detonated 400 meters above the ground.\\r\\nRDS-4 represented a branch of research on small tactical weapons. It was a boosted fission device using plutonium in a \\"levitated\\" core design. The first test was an air drop on August 23, 1953, yielding 28 kilotons. In 1954, the bomb was also used during Snowball exercise in Totskoye, dropped by Tu-4 bomber on the simulated battlefield, in the presence of 40,000 infantry, tanks, and jet fighters. The RDS-4 comprised the warhead of the R-5M, the first medium-range ballistic missile in the world, which was tested with a live warhead for the first and only time on February 5, 1956\\r\\nRDS-5 was a similar levitated core design as RDS-4, but with a composite plutonium core and uranium 235 shells.\\r\\nRDS-6, the first Soviet test of a hydrogen bomb, took place on August 12, 1953, and was nicknamed Joe 4 by the Americans. It used a layer-cake design of fission and fusion fuels (uranium 235 and lithium-6 deuteride) and produced a yield of 400 kilotons. This yield was about ten times more powerful than any previous Soviet test.[36] When developing higher level bombs the Soviets proceeded with the RDS-6 as their main effort instead of the analog RDS-7 advanced fission bomb. This led to the third idea bomb which is the RDS-37.[36]\\r\\nA much lower-power version of the RDS-4 with a 3-10 kiloton yield, the RDS-9 was developed for the T-5 nuclear torpedo. A 3.5 kiloton underwater test was performed with the torpedo on September 21, 1955.\\r\\nThe first Soviet test of a \\"true\\" hydrogen bomb in the megaton range was conducted on November 22, 1955. It was dubbed RDS-37 by the Soviets. It was of the multi-staged, radiation implosion thermonuclear design called Sakharov's \\"Third Idea\\" in the USSR and the Teller-Ulam design in the USA.[46]\\r\\nJoe 1, Joe 4, and RDS-37 were all tested at the Semipalatinsk Test Site in Kazakhstan.\\r\\nThe Tsar Bomba (ђ^-ɾ񼼼) was the largest, most powerful nuclear weapon ever detonated. It was a three-stage hydrogen bomb with a yield of about 50 megatons.[47] This is equivalent to ten times the amount of all the explosives used in World War II combined.[48] It was detonated on October 30, 1961, in the Novaya Zemlya archipelago, and was capable of approximately 100 megatons, but was purposely reduced shortly before the launch. Although weaponized, it was not entered into service; it was simply a demonstrative testing of the capabilities of the Soviet Union's military technology at that time. The heat of the explosion was estimated to potentially inflict third degree burns at 100?km distance of clear air.[49]\\r\\nChagan was a shot in the Nuclear Explosions for the National Economy or Project 7, the Soviet equivalent of the US Operation Plowshare to investigate peaceful uses of nuclear weapons. It was a subsurface detonation. It was fired on January 15, 1965. The site was a dry bed of the Chagan River at the edge of the Semipalatinsk Test Site, and was chosen such that the lip of the crater would dam the river during its high spring flow. The resultant crater had a diameter of 408 meters and was 100 meters deep. A major lake (10,000?m3) soon formed behind the 20ÿ35?m high upraised lip, known as Chagan Lake or Balapan Lake.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe photo is sometimes confused with RDS-1 in literature.\\r\\nDuring the Cold War the Soviet Union created at least nine closed cities, known as Atomgrads[citation needed], in which nuclear weapons-related research and development took place. After the dissolution of the Soviet Union, all of the cities changed their names (most of the original code-names were simply the oblast and a number). All are still legally \\"closed\\", though some have parts of them accessible to foreign visitors with special permits (Sarov, Snezhinsk, and Zheleznogorsk).\\r\\nThe Soviets started experimenting with nuclear technology in 1943, and first tested a nuclear weapon in August 1949. Many of the fission based devices left behind radioactive isotopes which have contaminated air, water and soil in the areas immediately surrounding, downwind and downstream of the blast site. According to the records that the Russian government released in 1991, the Soviet Union tested 969 nuclear devices between 1949 and 1990.[50]:1 Soviet scientists conducted the tests with little regard for environmental and public health consequences. The detrimental effects that the toxic waste generated by weapons testing and processing of radioactive materials are still felt to this day. Even decades later, the risk of developing various types of cancer, especially that of the thyroid and the lungs, continues to be elevated far above national averages for people in affected areas.[51]:1385 Iodine-131, a radioactive isotope that is a major byproduct of fission-based weapons, is retained in the thyroid gland, and so poisoning of this kind is commonplace in impacted populations.[51]:1386\\r\\nThe Soviets set off 214 nuclear bombs in the open air between 1949 and 1962, when the United Nations banned atmospheric tests worldwide.[50]:6 The billions of radioactive particles released into the air exposed countless people to extremely mutagenic and carcinogenic materials, resulting in a myriad of deleterious genetic maladies and deformities. The majority of these tests took place at the Semipalatinsk Test Site, or STS, located in northeast Kazakhstan.[50]:61 The testing at STS alone exposed hundreds of thousands of Kazakh citizens to the harmful effects, and the site continues to be one of the most highly irradiated places on the planet.[52]:A167 When the earliest tests were being conducted, even the scientists had only a poor understanding of the medium- and long-term effects of radiation exposure. In fact, the STS was chosen as the primary site for open-air testing precisely because the Soviets were curious about the potential for lasting harm that their weapons held.[51]:1389\\r\\nContamination of air and soil due to atmospheric testing is only part of a wider issue. Water contamination due to improper disposal of spent uranium and decay of sunken nuclear-powered submarines is a major problem in the Kola Peninsula in northwest Russia. Although the Russian government states that the radioactive power cores are stable, various scientists have come forth with serious concerns about the 32,000 spent nuclear fuel elements that remain in the sunken vessels.[52]:A166 There have been no major incidents other than the explosion and sinking of a nuclear-powered submarine in August 2000, but many international scientists are still uneasy at the prospect of the hulls eroding, releasing uranium into the sea and causing considerable contamination.[52]:A166 Although the submarines pose an environmental risk, they have yet to cause serious harm to public health. However, water contamination in the area of the Mayak test site, especially at Lake Karachay, is extreme, and has gotten to the point where radioactive byproducts have found their way into drinking water supplies. It has been an area of concern since the early 1950s, when the Soviets began disposing of tens of millions of cubic meters of radioactive waste by pumping it into the small lake.[52]:A165 Half a century later, in the 1990s, there are still hundreds of millions of curies of waste in the Lake, and at points contamination has been so severe that a mere half-hour of exposure to certain regions would deliver a dose of radiation sufficient to kill 50% of humans.[52]:A165 Although the area immediately surrounding the lake is devoid of population, the lake has the potential to dry up in times of drought. Most significantly, in 1967, it dried up and winds carried radioactive dust over thousands of square kilometers, exposing at least 500,000 citizens to a range of health risks.[52]:A165 To control dust, Soviet scientists piled concrete on top of the lake. Although this was effective in helping mediate the amount of dust, the weight of the concrete pushed radioactive materials into closer contact with standing underground groundwater.[52]:A166 It is difficult to gauge the overall health and environmental effects of the water contamination at Lake Karachay because figures on civilian exposure are unavailable, making it hard to show causation between elevated cancer rates and radioactive pollution specifically from the lake.\\r\\nContemporary efforts to manage radioactive contamination in the Soviet Union are few and far between. Public awareness of the past and present dangers, as well as the Russian government's investment in current cleanup efforts, are likely dampened by the lack of media attention STS and other sites have gotten in comparison to isolated nuclear incidents such as Hiroshima, Nagasaki, Chernobyl and Three-Mile Island.[53] The domestic government's investment in cleanup measures seems to be driven by economic concerns rather than care for public health. The most significant political legislation in this area is a bill agreeing to turn the already contaminated former weapons complex Mayak into an international radioactive waste dump, accepting cash from other countries in exchange for taking their radioactive byproducts of nuclear industry.[52]:A167 Although the bill stipulates that the revenue go towards decontaminating other test sites such as Semipalatinsk and the Kona Peninsula, experts doubt whether this will actually happen given the current political and economic climate in Russia.[52]:A168","input":"When did the soviet union detonated its first atomic bomb?"},{"output":"August 2, 1956","context":"Albert Henry Woolson (February 11, 1850 ÿ August 2, 1956) was the last surviving member of the Union Army who served in the American Civil War.

The indigenous people who inhabit the islands of Polynesia are termed Polynesians, and share many similar traits including language family, culture, and beliefs.[1] Historically, they had a strong tradition of sailing and using stars to navigate at night. The largest country in Polynesia is New Zealand.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe term Polynesia was first used in 1756 by a French writer named Charles de Brosses, and originally applied to all the islands of the Pacific. In 1831, Jules Dumont d'Urville proposed a restriction on its use during a lecture to the Geographical Society of Paris. Historically, the islands of the South Seas have been known as South Sea Islands,[2] and their inhabitants as South Sea Islanders, even though the Hawaiian Islands are located in the North Pacific. Another term, the Polynesian Triangle, explicitly includes the Hawaiian Islands, as  they form its northern vertex.\\r\\n\\r\\nPolynesia is characterized by a small amount of land spread over a very large portion of the mid and southern Pacific Ocean. Most Polynesian islands and archipelagos, including the Hawaiian Islands and Samoa, are composed of volcanic islands built by hotspots. New Zealand, Norfolk Island, and Ouva, the Polynesian outlier near New Caledonia, are the unsubmerged portions of the largely sunken continent of Zealandia. Zealandia is believed to have mostly sunk 23 million years ago and recently resurfaced geologically due to a change in the movements of the Pacific Plate in relation to the Indo-Australian plate, which served to uplift the New Zealand portion. At first, the Pacific plate was subducted under the Australian plate. The Alpine Fault that traverses the South Island is currently a transform fault while the convergent plate boundary from the North Island northwards is called the Kermadec-Tonga Subduction Zone. The volcanism associated with this subduction zone is the origin of the Kermadec and Tongan island archipelagos.\\r\\n\\r\\nOut of approximately 300,000 or 310,000 square kilometres (117,000 or 118,000?sq?mi) of land, over 270,000?km2 (103,000?sq?mi) are within New Zealand; the Hawaiian archipelago comprises about half the remainder. The Zealandia continent has approximately 3,600,000?km2 (1,400,000?sq?mi) of continental shelf. The oldest rocks in the region are found in New Zealand and are believed to be about 510 million years old. The oldest Polynesian rocks outside of Zealandia are to be found in the Hawaiian Emperor Seamount Chain and are 80 million years old.\\r\\n\\r\\nPolynesia is generally defined as the islands within the Polynesian Triangle, although there are some islands that are inhabited by Polynesian people situated outside the Polynesian Triangle. Geographically, the Polynesian Triangle is drawn by connecting the points of Hawaii, New Zealand and Easter Island. The other main island groups located within the Polynesian Triangle are Samoa, Tonga, the Cook Islands, Tuvalu, Tokelau, Niue, Wallis and Futuna and French Polynesia.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are also small Polynesian settlements in Papua New Guinea, the Solomon Islands, the Caroline Islands, and in Vanuatu. An island group with strong Polynesian cultural traits outside of this great triangle is Rotuma, situated north of Fiji. The people of Rotuma have many common Polynesian traits but speak a non-Polynesian language. Some of the Lau Islands to the southeast of Fiji have strong historic and cultural links with Tonga.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, in essence, Polynesia is a cultural term referring to one of the three parts of Oceania (the others being Micronesia and Melanesia).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe following are the islands and island groups, either nations or overseas territories of former colonial powers, that are of native Polynesian culture or where archaeological evidence indicates Polynesian settlement in the past.[3] Some islands of Polynesian origin are outside the general triangle that geographically defines the region.\\r\\n\\r\\nFijian Lau Islands\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Phoenix Islands and Line Islands, most of which are part of Kiribati, had no permanent settlements until European colonization, but are sometimes considered to be inside the Polynesian triangle[citation needed].\\r\\n\\r\\nIn pre-colonial times, Polynesian populations also existed in the Kermadec Islands, the Auckland Islands and Norfolk Island. However, when European explorers arrived, these islands were uninhabited.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Polynesian people are considered to be by linguistic, archaeological and human genetic ancestry a subset of the sea-migrating Austronesian people. Tracing Polynesian languages places their prehistoric origins in the Malay Archipelago, and ultimately, in Taiwan.\\r\\n\\r\\nBetween about 3000 and 1000 BCE speakers of Austronesian languages began spreading from Taiwan into Island Southeast Asia.[8][9][10]\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are three theories regarding the spread of humans across the Pacific to Polynesia. These are outlined well by Kayser et al. (2000)[11] and are as follows:\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the archaeological record there are well-defined traces of this expansion which allow the path it took to be followed and dated with some certainty. It is thought that by roughly 1400 BCE,[12]  \\"Lapita Peoples\\", so-named after their pottery tradition, appeared in the Bismarck Archipelago of northwest Melanesia. This culture is seen as having adapted and evolved through time and space since its emergence \\"Out of Taiwan\\". They had given up rice production, for instance, after encountering and adapting to breadfruit in the Bird's Head area of New Guinea.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe results of research at the Teouma Lapita site (Efate Island, Vanuatu) and the Talasiu Lapita site (near Nuku'alofa, Tonga) published in 2016 supports the Express Train model; although with the qualification that the migration bypassed New Guinea and Island Melanesia.  The conclusion from research published in 2016 is that the initial population of those two sites appears to come directly from Taiwan or the northern Philippines and did not mix with the AustraloPapuans of New Guinea and the Solomon Islands.[13] The preliminary analysis of skulls found at the Teouma and Talasiu Lapita sites is that they lack Australian or Papuan affinities and instead have affinities to mainland Asian populations.[14] DNA analysis of modern Polynesians indicates that there has been intermarriage resulting in a mixed Asian-Papuan ancestry of the Polynesians. Research at the Teouma and Talasiu Lapita sites implies that the migration and intermarriage, which resulted in the mixed Asian-Papuan ancestry of the Polynesians,[9] occurred after the first initial migration to Vanuatu and Tonga.[13][15]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe most eastern site for Lapita archaeological remains recovered so far is at Mulifanua on Upolu. The Mulifanua site, where 4,288 pottery shards have been found and studied, has a \\"true\\" age of c. 1000 BCE based on C14 dating.[16] A 2010 study places the beginning of the human archaeological sequences of Polynesia in Tonga at 900 BCE.[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nWithin a mere three or four centuries, between 1300 and 900 BCE, the Lapita archaeological culture spread 6,000?km further to the east from the Bismarck Archipelago, until reaching as far as Fiji, Tonga, and Samoa which were first populated around 3,000 years ago as previously mentioned.[18]  A cultural divide began to develop between Fiji to the west, and the distinctive Polynesian language and culture emerging on Tonga and Samoa to the east. Where there was once faint evidence of uniquely shared developments in Fijian and Polynesian speech, most of this is now called \\"borrowing\\" and is thought to have occurred in those and later years more than as a result of continuing unity of their earliest dialects on those far-flung lands. Contacts were mediated especially through the eastern Lau Islands of Fiji. This is where most Fijian-Polynesian linguistic interaction occurred.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nTiny populations may have been involved at first;[17][clarification needed] although Professor Matisoo-Smith of the Otago study said that the founding Mori population of New Zealand must have been in the hundreds, much larger than previously thought.[19]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Polynesians were matrilineal and matrilocal Stone Age societies upon arrival in Fiji, Tonga and Samoa, after having been through at least some time in the Bismarck Archipelago. The modern Polynesians still show human genetic results of a Melanesian culture which allowed indigenous men, but not women, to \\"marry in\\" ÿ useful evidence for matrilocality.[8][9][20][21]\\r\\n\\r\\nAtholl Anderson wrote that analysis of mtDNA (female) and Y chromosome (male) concluded that the ancestors of Polynesian women came from Taiwan while those of Polynesian men came from New Guinea. Subsequently, it was found that 96% of Polynesian mtDNA has an Asian origin, as does one-third of Polynesian Y chromosomes; the remaining two-thirds from New Guinea and nearby islands; this is consistent with matrilocal residence patterns.[22]\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough matrilocality and matrilineality receded at some early time, Polynesians and most other Austronesian speakers in the Pacific Islands, were/are still highly \\"matricentric\\" in their traditional jurisprudence.[20] The Lapita pottery for which the general archaeological complex of the earliest \\"Oceanic\\" Austronesian speakers in the Pacific Islands are named also went away in Western Polynesia. Language, social life and material culture were very distinctly \\"Polynesian\\" by the time Eastern Polynesia was being settled after a \\"pause\\" of 1000 years or more in Western Polynesia.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe dating of the settlement of Eastern Polynesia, including Hawai'i, Easter Island, and New Zealand, is not agreed upon in every instance. Most recently, a 2010 study using meta-analysis of the most reliable radiocarbon dates available suggested that the colonization of Eastern Polynesia (including Hawaii and New Zealand) proceeded in two short episodes: in the Society Islands from 1025 to 1120 AD and further afield from 1190 to 1290 AD,[23] with Easter Island being settled around 1200.[24][25] Other archeological models developed in recent decades, which are challenged by that recent set of radiocarbon dating interpretations, have pointed to dates of between 300 and 500 AD, or alternatively 800 AD (as supported by Jared Diamond) for the settlement of Easter Island, and similarly, a date of 500 AD has been suggested for Hawaii. Linguistically, there is a very distinct \\"East Polynesian\\" subgroup with many shared innovations not seen in other Polynesian languages. The Marquesas dialects are perhaps the source of the oldest Hawaiian speech which is overlaid by Tahitian variety speech, as Hawaiian oral histories would suggest. The earliest varieties of New Zealand Maori speech may have had multiple sources from around central Eastern Polynesia as Maori oral histories would suggest.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter a bloody civil war, political power in Tonga eventually fell under the Tu'i Kanokupolu dynasty in the 16th century.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1845 the ambitious young warrior, strategist, and orator Tufa?hau united Tonga into a more Western-style kingdom. He held the chiefly title of Tu?i Kanokupolu, but had been baptised with the name Jiaoji (\\"George\\") in 1831. In 1875, with the help of the missionary Shirley Waldemar Baker, he declared Tonga a constitutional monarchy, formally adopted the western royal style, emancipated the \\"serfs\\", enshrined a code of law, land tenure, and freedom of the press, and limited the power of the chiefs.\\r\\n\\r\\nTonga became a British-protected state under a Treaty of Friendship on 18 May 1900, when European settlers and rival Tongan chiefs tried to oust the second king. Within the British Empire, which posted no higher permanent representative on Tonga than a British Consul (1901ÿ1970), Tonga formed part of the British Western Pacific Territories (under a colonial High Commissioner, residing in Fiji) from 1901 until 1952. Despite being under the protectorate, Tonga retained its monarchy without interruption.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn June 4, 1970 the Kingdom of Tonga received independence from the British protectorate.\\r\\n\\r\\nSamoa has a long history of various ruling families, the oldest of which is the Tui Manu'a, and the most recent of which is the Malietoa, until its East-West division by Tripartite Convention (1899) subsequent annexation by the German Empire and the United States. The German-controlled Western portion of Samoa (consisting of the bulk of Samoan territory) was occupied by New Zealand in WWI, and administered by it under a Class C League of Nations Mandate until receiving independence on January 1, 1962. The new Independent State of Samoa was not a monarchy, though the Malietoa title-holder remained very influential. It officially ended, however with the death of Malietoa Tanumafili II on May 11, 2007.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn October 28, 1835 members of the Ngpuhi and surrounding Mori tribes (iwi) issued a \\"declaration of independence\\", as a \\"confederation of tribes\\" to resist potential French colonization efforts and to prevent the ships and cargo of Mori merchants from being seized at foreign ports. They received recognition from the British monarch in 1836. (See United Tribes of New Zealand, New Zealand Declaration of Independence, James Busby.)\\r\\n\\r\\nUsing the Treaty of Waitangi and right of discovery as a basis, the United Kingdom annexed New Zealand as a part of New South Wales in 1840.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn response to the actions of the colonial government, Mori looked to form a monarchy inclusive of all Mori tribes in order to reduce vulnerability to the British divide-and-conquer strategy. Ptatau Te Wherowhero, high priest and chief of the Ngti Mahuta tribe of the Waikato iwi, was crowned as the Mori king in 1858. The king's territory consisted primarily of the lands in the center of the North Island, and the iwi constituted the most powerful non-signatories of the Treaty of Waitangi, with Te Wherowhero also never having signed it.[26]  (See Kingitanga.)\\r\\n\\r\\nAll tribes were incorporated into rule under the colonial government by the late 19th century. Although Mori were given the privilege of being legally enfranchised subjects of the British Empire under the Treaty, Mori culture and language (te reo Mori) were actively suppressed by the colonial government and by economic and social pressures from the Pakeha society. Efforts were made to preserve indigenous culture starting in the late 1950s and culminating in the Waitangi Tribunal's interpretation of language and culture being included in the treasures set to be preserved under the Treaty of Waitangi. Moving from a low point of 15,000 speakers in the 1970s, there are now over 157,000 people who have some proficiency in the standard Mori language according to the 2006 census[27] in New Zealand, due in large part to government recognition and promotion of the language.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Lau islands were subject to periods of Tongan rulership and then Fijian control until their eventual conquest by Seru Epenisa Cakobau of the Kingdom of Fiji by 1871. In around 1855 a Tongan prince, Enele Ma'afu, proclaimed the Lau islands as his kingdom, and took the title Tui Lau.\\r\\n\\r\\nFiji had been ruled by numerous divided chieftains until Cakobau unified the landmass. The Lapita culture, the ancestors of the Polynesians, existed in Fiji from about 3500 BCE until they were displaced by the Melanesians about a thousand years later. (Both Samoans and subsequent Polynesian cultures adopted Melanesian painting and tattoo methods.)\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1873, Cakobau ceded a Fiji heavily indebted to foreign creditors to the United Kingdom. It became independent on 10 October 1970 and a republic on 28 September 1987.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Cook Islands is made up of 15 islands comprising the Northern and Southern groups. The islands are spread out across many kilometers of a vast ocean. The largest of these islands is called Rarotonga, which is also the political and economic capital of the nation.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Cook Islands were formerly known as the Hervey Islands, but this name refers only to the Northern Groups. It is unknown when this name was changed to reflect the current name. It is thought that the Cook Islands were settled in two periods: the Tahitian Period, when the country was settled between 900 - 1300 AD. The second settlement, the Maui Settlement, occurred in 1600 AD, when a large contingent from Tahiti settled in Rarotonga, in the Takitumu district.\\r\\n\\r\\nCook Islanders are ethnically Polynesians or Eastern Polynesia. They are culturally associated with Tahiti, Eastern Islands, NZ Maori and Hawaii. Early in the 17th century, became the first race to settle in New Zealand.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe reef islands and atolls of Tuvalu are identified as being part of West Polynesia. During pre-European-contact times there was frequent canoe voyaging between the islands as Polynesian navigation skills are recognised to have allowed deliberate journeys on double-hull sailing canoes or outrigger canoes.[28] Eight of the nine islands of Tuvalu were inhabited; thus the name, Tuvalu, means \\"eight standing together\\" in Tuvaluan. The pattern of settlement that is believed to have occurred is that the Polynesians spread out from Samoa and Tonga into the Tuvaluan atolls, with Tuvalu providing a stepping stone for migration into the Polynesian Outlier communities in Melanesia and Micronesia.[29][30][31]\\r\\n\\r\\nStories as to the ancestors of the Tuvaluans vary from island to island. On Niutao,[32] Funafuti and Vaitupu the founding ancestor is described as being from Samoa;[33][34] whereas on Nanumea the founding ancestor is described as being from Tonga.[33]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe extent of influence of the Tu?i Tonga line of Tongan kings, which originated in the 10th century, is understood to have extended to some of the islands of Tuvalu in the 11th to mid-13th century.[34] The oral history of Niutao recalls that in the 15th century Tongan warriors were defeated in a battle on the reef of Niutao. Tongan warriors also invaded Niutao later in the 15th century and again were repelled. A third and fourth Tongan invasion of Niutao occurred in the late 16th century, again with the Tongans being defeated.[32]\\r\\n\\r\\nFishing was the primary source of protein, with the cuisine of Tuvalu reflecting food that could be grown on low-lying atolls. Navigation between the islands of Tuvalu was carried out using outrigger canoes. The population levels of the low-lying islands of Tuvalu had to be managed because of the effects of periodic droughts and the risk of severe famine if the gardens were poisoned by salt from the storm-surge of a tropical cyclone.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe sweet potato, called kmara in Mori and kumar in Quechua, is native to the Americas and was widespread in Polynesia when Europeans first reached the Pacific. Remains of the plant in the Cook Islands have been radiocarbon-dated to 1000, and current thinking is that it was brought to central Polynesia c. 700 and spread across Polynesia from there, possibly by Polynesians who had traveled to South America and back.[35]\\r\\n\\r\\nThor Heyerdahl proposed in the mid-20th century that the Polynesians had migrated from the northwest coast of Canada by large whale-hunting dugouts, and from South America on balsa-log boats.[36][37] Many anthropologists have criticised Heyerdahl's theory, including Wade Davis in his book The Wayfinders. Davis says that Heyerdahl \\"ignored the overwhelming body of linguistic, ethnographic, and ethnobotanical evidence, augmented today by genetic and archaeological data, indicating that he was patently wrong.\\"[38]\\r\\n\\r\\nPolynesia divides into two distinct cultural groups, East Polynesia and West Polynesia. The culture of West Polynesia is conditioned to high populations. It has strong institutions of marriage and well-developed judicial, monetary and trading traditions. It comprises the groups of Tonga, Niue, Samoa and extends to the atolls of Tuvalu to the north. The pattern of settlement that is believed to have occurred is that the Polynesians spread out from the Samoan Islands into the Tuvaluan atolls, with Tuvalu providing a stepping stone to migration into the Polynesian Outlier communities in Melanesia and Micronesia.[29][30][31]\\r\\n\\r\\nEastern Polynesian cultures are highly adapted to smaller islands and atolls, principally the Cook Islands, Tahiti, the Tuamotus, the Marquesas, Hawaii, Rapa Nui and smaller central-pacific groups. The large islands of New Zealand were first settled by Eastern Polynesians who adapted their culture to a non-tropical environment.\\r\\n\\r\\nUnlike Melanesia, leaders were chosen in Polynesia based on their hereditary bloodline. Samoa, however, had another system of government that combines elements of heredity and real-world skills to choose leaders. This system is called Fa'amatai. According to Ben R. Finney and Eric M. Jones, \\"On Tahiti, for example, the 35,000 Polynesians living there at the time of European discovery were divided between high-status persons with full access to food and other resources, and low-status persons with limited access.\\"[39]\\r\\n\\r\\nReligion, farming, fishing, weather prediction, out-rigger canoe (similar to modern catamarans) construction and navigation were highly developed skills because the population of an entire island depended on them. Trading of both luxuries and mundane items was important to all groups. Periodic droughts and subsequent famines often led to war.[39] Many low-lying islands could suffer severe famine if their gardens were poisoned by the salt from the storm-surge of a tropical cyclone. In these cases fishing, the primary source of protein, would not ease loss of food energy. Navigators, in particular, were highly respected and each island maintained a house of navigation with a canoe-building area.\\r\\n\\r\\nSettlements by the Polynesians were of two categories: the hamlet and the village. The size of the island inhabited determined whether or not a hamlet would be built. The larger volcanic islands usually had hamlets because of the many zones that could be divided across the island. Food and resources were more plentiful. These settlements of four to five houses (usually with gardens) were established so that there would be no overlap between the zones. Villages, on the other hand, were built on the coasts of smaller islands and consisted of thirty or more housesin the case of atolls, on only one of the group so that food cultivation was on the others. Usually these villages were fortified with walls and palisades made of stone and wood.[40]\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, New Zealand demonstrates the opposite: large volcanic islands with fortified villages.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs well as being great navigators, these people were artists and artisans of great skill. Simple objects, such as fish-hooks would be manufactured to exacting standards for different catches and decorated even when the decoration was not part of the function. Stone and wooden weapons were considered to be more powerful the better they were made and decorated. In some island groups weaving was a strong part of the culture and gifting woven articles was an ingrained practice. Dwellings were imbued with character by the skill of their building. Body decoration and jewelry is of an international standard to this day.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe religious attributes of Polynesians were common over the whole Pacific region. While there are some differences in their spoken languages they largely have the same explanation for the creation of the earth and sky, for the gods that rule aspects of life and for the religious practices of everyday life. People traveled thousands of miles to celebrations that they all owned communally.\\r\\n\\r\\nBeginning in the 1820s large numbers of missionaries worked in the islands, converting many groups to Christianity. Polynesia, argues Ian Breward,  is now \\"one of the most strongly Christian regions in the world....Christianity was rapidly and successfully incorporated into Polynesian culture.  War and slavery disappeared.\\"[41]\\r\\n\\r\\nPolynesian languages are all members of the family of Oceanic languages, a sub-branch of the Austronesian language family. Polynesian languages show a considerable degree of similarity. The vowels are generally the samea, e, i, o, and u, pronounced as in Italian, Spanish, and Germanand the consonants are always followed by a vowel. The languages of various island groups show changes in consonants. R and v are used in central and eastern Polynesia whereas l and v are used in western Polynesia. The glottal stop is increasingly represented by an inverted comma or okina. In the Society Islands, the original Proto-Polynesian *k and *ng have merged as glottal stop; so the name for the ancestral homeland, deriving from Proto-Nuclear Polynesian *sawaiki,[42] becomes Havai'i. In New Zealand, where the original *w is used instead of v, the ancient home is Hawaiki. In the Cook Islands, where the glottal stop replaces the original *s (with a likely intermediate stage of *h), it is Avaiki. In the Hawaiian islands, where the glottal stop replaces the original k, the largest island of the group is named Hawaii. In Samoa, where the original s is used instead of h, v replaces w, and the glottal stop replaces the original k, the largest island is called Savai'i.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nWith the exception of New Zealand, the majority of independent Polynesian islands derive much of their income from foreign aid and remittances from those who live in other countries. Some encourage their young people to go where they can earn good money to remit to their stay-at-home relatives. Many Polynesian locations, such as Easter Island, supplement this with tourism income. Some have more unusual sources of income, such as Tuvalu which marketed its '.tv' internet top-level domain name or the Cooks that relied on postage stamp sales.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter several years of discussing a potential regional grouping, three sovereign states (Samoa, Tonga and Tuvalu) and five self-governing but non-sovereign territories formally launched, in November 2011, the Polynesian Leaders Group, intended to cooperate on a variety of issues including culture and language, education, responses to climate change, and trade and investment. It does not, however, constitute a political or monetary union.[43][44][45]\\r\\n\\r\\nPolynesia comprised islands diffused throughout a triangular area with sides of four thousand miles. The area from the Hawaiian Islands in the north, to Easter Island in the east and to New Zealand in the south were all settled by Polynesians.\\r\\n\\r\\nNavigators traveled to small inhabited islands using only their own senses and knowledge passed by oral tradition from navigator to apprentice. In order to locate directions at various times of day and year, navigators in Eastern Polynesia memorized important facts: the motion of specific stars, and where they would rise on the horizon of the ocean; weather; times of travel; wildlife species (which congregate at particular positions); directions of swells on the ocean, and how the crew would feel their motion; colors of the sea and sky, especially how clouds would cluster at the locations of some islands; and angles for approaching harbors.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese wayfinding techniques, along with outrigger canoe construction methods, were kept as guild secrets. Generally each island maintained a guild of navigators who had very high status; in times of famine or difficulty these navigators could trade for aid or evacuate people to neighboring islands. On his first voyage of Pacific exploration Cook had the services of a Polynesian navigator, Tupaia, who drew a hand-drawn chart of the islands within 3,200?km (2,000?mi) radius (to the north and west) of his home island of Ra'iatea. Tupaia had knowledge of 130 islands and named 74 on his chart.[46] Tupaia had navigated from Ra'iatea in short voyages to 13 islands. He had not visited western Polynesia, as since his grandfather's time the extent of voyaging by Raiateans has diminished to the islands of eastern Polynesia.  His grandfather and father had passed to Tupaia the knowledge as to the location of the major islands of western Polynesia and the navigation information necessary to voyage to Fiji, Samoa and Tonga.[47] As the Admiralty orders directed Cook to search for the Great Southern Continent, Cook ignored Tupaia's chart and his skills as a navigator. To this day, original traditional methods of Polynesian Navigation are still taught in the Polynesian outlier of Taumako Island in the Solomon Islands.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom a single chicken bone recovered from the archaeological site of El Arenal-1, on the Arauco Peninsula, Chile, a 2007 research report looking at radiocarbon dating and an ancient DNA sequence indicate that Polynesian navigators may have reached the Americas at least 100 years before Columbus (who arrived 1492 AD), introducing chickens to South America.[48][49] A later report looking at the same specimens concluded:\\r\\n\\r\\nA published, apparently pre-Columbian, Chilean specimen and six pre-European Polynesian specimens also cluster with the same European/Indian subcontinental/Southeast Asian sequences, providing no support for a Polynesian introduction of chickens to South America. In contrast, sequences from two archaeological sites on Easter Island group with an uncommon haplogroup from Indonesia, Japan, and China and may represent a genetic signature of an early Polynesian dispersal. Modeling of the potential marine carbon contribution to the Chilean archaeological specimen casts further doubt on claims for pre-Columbian chickens, and definitive proof will require further analyses of ancient DNA sequences and radiocarbon and stable isotope data from archaeological excavations within both Chile and Polynesia.[50]\\r\\n\\r\\nKnowledge of the traditional Polynesian methods of navigation were largely lost after contact with and colonization by Europeans. This left the problem of accounting for the presence of the Polynesians in such isolated and scattered parts of the Pacific. By the late 19th century to the early 20th century a more generous view of Polynesian navigation had come into favor, perhaps creating a romantic picture of their canoes, seamanship and navigational expertise.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the mid to late 1960s, scholars began testing sailing and paddling experiments related to Polynesian navigation: David Lewis sailed his catamaran from Tahiti to New Zealand using stellar navigation without instruments and Ben Finney built a 40-foot replica of a Hawaiian double canoe \\"Nalehia\\" and tested it in Hawaii.[51] Meanwhile, Micronesian ethnographic research in the Caroline Islands revealed that traditional stellar navigational methods were still in every day use. Recent re-creations of Polynesian voyaging have used methods based largely on Micronesian methods and the teachings of a Micronesian navigator, Mau Piailug.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is probable that the Polynesian navigators employed a whole range of techniques including use of the stars, the movement of ocean currents and wave patterns, the air and sea interference patterns caused by islands and atolls, the flight of birds, the winds and the weather. Scientists think that long-distance Polynesian voyaging followed the seasonal paths of birds. There are some references in their oral traditions to the flight of birds and some say that there were range marks onshore pointing to distant islands in line with these flyways. One theory is that they would have taken a frigatebird with them. These birds refuse to land on the water as their feathers will become waterlogged making it impossible to fly. When the voyagers thought they were close to land they may have released the bird, which would either fly towards land or else return to the canoe. It is likely that the Polynesians also used wave and swell formations to navigate. It is thought that the Polynesian navigators may have measured the time it took to sail between islands in \\"canoe-days or a similar type of expression.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlso, people of the Marshall Islands used special devices called stick charts, showing the places and directions of swells and wave-breaks, with tiny seashells affixed to them to mark the positions of islands along the way. Materials for these maps were readily available on beaches, and their making was simple; however, their effective use needed years and years of study.[52]","input":"How many islands are there in the polynesian triangle?"},{"output":"He is the Power (singular) over powers (plural)","context":"Elohim (Hebrew: ????????? ?lh?m) is one of the names of God in the Hebrew Bible and worshipped as part of the Western monotheistic tradition; the term is also used in the Hebrew Bible to refer to groups of other gods.\\r\\nThe notion of divinity underwent radical changes in the early period of Israelite identity. The ambiguity of the term elohim is the result of such changes, cast in terms of \\"vertical translatability\\", i.e. the re-interpretation of the gods of the earliest recalled period as the national god of monolatrism as it emerged in the 7th to 6th century BCE in the Kingdom of Judah and during the Babylonian captivity, and further in terms of monotheism by the emergence of Rabbinical Judaism in the 2nd century CE.[1]\\r\\nThe word is identical to the usual plural of el meaning gods or magistrates, and is cognate to the 'l-h-m found in Ugaritic, where it is used for the pantheon of Canaanite gods, the children of El, and conventionally vocalized as \\"Elohim\\". Most use of the term Elohim in the later Hebrew text imply a view that is at least monolatrist at the time of writing, and such usage (in the singular), as a proper title for the supreme deity, is generally not considered to be synonymous with the term elohim, \\"gods\\" (plural, simple noun). Hebrew grammar allows for this nominally plural form to mean \\"He is the Power (singular) over powers (plural)\\", or roughly, \\"God of gods\\". Rabbinic scholar Maimonides wrote that the various other usages are commonly understood to be homonyms.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nElohim is a grammatically plural noun for \\"gods\\" or \\"deity\\" in Biblical Hebrew. In Modern Hebrew, it is often referred to in the singular despite the -im ending that denotes plural masculine nouns in Hebrew.[3][4]\\r\\nIn Hebrew, the ending -im normally indicates a masculine plural. However, when referring to the Hebrew God, Elohim is usually understood to be grammatically singular (i.e. it governs a singular verb or adjective). When referring to pagan divinities, however, elohim is in the plural (i.e. taking a plural verb or adjective)  eg., Exodus 20:2, Deuteronomy 5:6, Psalms 96:5; Psalms 97:7.[citation needed] Similarly, the Quran uses alؐha as the plural of ؐlah for pagan divinities, and occasionally uses \\"Allahum\\" (O God! - plural) for the sole god (as opposed to \\"Allah\\"). The exact equivalent, in modern Arabic, of Elohim as meaning plural gods would be Ilhؐn (??????), although it is rarely used in Arabic parlance. Note that human beings can also have names with plural endings, such as Ephraim, the son of Joseph.\\r\\nIt is generally thought that Elohim is derived from eloah, the latter being an expanded form of the Northwest Semitic noun il.[5] The related nouns eloah (????) and el (???) are used as proper names or as generics, in which case they are interchangeable with elohim.[5] The term contains an added heh as third radical to the biconsonantal root. Discussions of the etymology of elohim essentially concern this expansion. An exact cognate outside of Hebrew is found in Ugaritic ?lhm, the family of El, the creator god and chief deity of the Canaanite pantheon, in Biblical Aramaic ??lh and later Syriac Alaha \\"God\\", and in Arabic ?ilh \\"god, deity\\" (or Allah as \\" The [single] God\\").\\r\\n\\"El\\" (the basis for the extended root ?lh) is usually derived from a root meaning \\"to be strong\\" and/or \\"to be in front\\".[5]\\r\\nThe word el (singular) is a standard term for \\"god\\" in Aramaic, paleo-Hebrew, and other related Semitic languages including Ugaritic. The Canaanite pantheon of gods was known as \\"'ilhm\\"[6] the Ugaritic equivalent to \\"elohim\\".[7] For instance, in the Ugaritic Baal cycle we read of \\"seventy sons of Asherah\\". Each \\"son of god\\" was held to be the originating deity for a particular people. (KTU 2 1.4.VI.46).[8]\\r\\nElohim occurs frequently throughout the Torah. In some cases (e.g. Exodus 3:4, \\"... Elohim called unto him out of the midst of the bush ...\\"), it behaves like a singular noun in Hebrew grammar, and is then generally understood to denote the single God of Israel. In other cases, Elohim acts as an ordinary plural of the word Eloah, and refers to the polytheistic notion of multiple gods (for example, Exodus 20:3, \\"You shall have no other gods before me.\\").\\r\\nThe words used for God varies in the Hebrew Bible. According to the documentary hypothesis these variations are the products of different source texts: Elohim is used as the name of God in the Elohist (E) and Priestly (P) sources, while the name Yahweh is used in the Jahwist (J) source. Form criticism postulates the differences of names may be the result of geographical origins; the P and E sources coming from the North and J from the South. There may be a theological point, that God did not reveal his name, Yahweh, before the time of Moses, though Hans Heinrich Schmid showed that the Jahwist was aware of the prophetic books from the 7th and 8th centuries BCE.[9]\\r\\nJ presents Yahweh anthropomorphically: for example, walking through the Garden of Eden looking for Adam and Eve. The Elohist often presents Elohim as more distant and frequently involves angels, as in the Elohist version of the tale of Jacob's ladder, in which there is a ladder to the clouds, with angels climbing up and down, with Elohim at the top. In the Jahwist tale, Yahweh is simply stationed in the sky, above the clouds without the ladder or angels. Likewise, the Elohist describes Jacob wrestling with an angel.\\r\\nThe classical documentary hypothesis, first developed in the late 19th century CE among literary scholars, holds that the Elohist portions of the Torah were composed in the 9th century BCE (i.e. during the early period of the Kingdom of Judah). This, however, is not universally accepted as later literary scholarship seems to show evidence of a later \\"Elohist redaction\\" (post-exilic) during the 5th century BCE which sometimes makes it difficult to determine whether a given passage is \\"Elohist\\" in origin, or the result of a later editor.\\r\\nThe word Elohim occurs more than 2500 times in the Hebrew Bible, with meanings ranging from \\"gods\\" in a general sense (as in Exodus 12:12, where it describes \\"the gods of Egypt\\"), to specific gods (e.g., 1 Kings 11:33, where it describes Chemosh \\"the god of Moab\\", or the frequent references to Yahweh (Jehovah) as the \\"elohim\\" of Israel), to demons, seraphim, and other supernatural beings, to the spirits of the dead brought up at the behest of King Saul in 1 Samuel 28:13, and even to kings and prophets (e.g., Exodus 4:16).[5] The phrase bene elohim, translated \\"sons of the Gods\\", has an exact parallel in Ugaritic and Phoenician texts, referring to the council of the gods.[5]\\r\\nElohim occupy the seventh rank of ten in the famous medieval Rabbinic scholar Maimonides' Jewish angelic hierarchy. Maimonides said: \\"I must premise that every Hebrew [now] knows that the term Elohim is a homonym, and denotes God, angels, judges, and the rulers of countries, ...\\"[2]\\r\\nIn 1 Samuel 28:13, elohim is used with a plural verb. The witch of Endor told Saul that she saw \\"elohim ascending (olim ??????, plural verb) out of the earth.[10]\\r\\nIn Genesis 20:13, Abraham, before the polytheistic Philistine king Abimelech, says that \\"Elohim (translated as God) caused (???? , plural verb) me to wander\\".[11][12][13] The Greek Septuagint (LXX) and most English versions usually translate this as \\"God caused\\" (which does not distinguish between a singular and plural verb), possibly to avoid the implication that Abraham was deferring to Abimelech's polytheistic beliefs.[14]\\r\\nElohim, when meaning the God of Israel, is mostly grammatically singular, and is commonly translated as \\"God\\", and capitalised. For example, in Genesis 1:26, it is written: \\"Then Elohim (translated as God) said (singular verb), 'Let us (plural) make (plural verb) man in our (plural) image, after our (plural) likeness'\\". Wilhelm Gesenius and other Hebrew grammarians traditionally described this as the pluralis excellentiae (plural of excellence), which is similar to the pluralis majestatis (plural of majesty, or \\"Royal we\\").[15]\\r\\nGesenius comments that Elohim singular is to be distinguished from elohim plural gods and remarks that:\\r\\nthe supposition that elohim is to be regarded as merely a remnant of earlier polytheistic views (i.e. as originally only a numerical plural) is at least highly improbable, and, moreover, would not explain the analogous plurals (below). To the same class (and probably formed on the analogy of elohim) belong the plurals kadoshim, meaning \\"the Most Holy\\" (only of Yahweh, Hosea 12:1, Proverbs 9:10, 30:3 - cf. El hiym kadoshim in Joshua 24:19 and the singular Aramaic \\"the Most High\\", Daniel 7:18, 22, 25) and probably teraphim (usually taken in the sense of penates), the image of a god, used especially for obtaining oracles. Certainly in 1 Samuel 19:13, 16 only one image is intended; in most other places a single image may be intended; in Zechariah 10:2 alone is it most naturally taken as a numerical plural.\\r\\nThere are a number of notable exceptions to the rule that Elohim is treated as singular when referring to the God of Israel, including Gen. 20:13, 35:7, 2 Sam. 7:23 and Ps. 58:11, and notably the epithet of the \\"Living God\\" (Deuteronomy 5:26 etc.), which is constructed with the plural adjective, Elohim Hayiym ????? ???? but still takes singular verbs.\\r\\nIn the Septuagint and New Testament translations Elohim has the singular ? Ĳ?? even in these cases, and modern translations follow suit in giving \\"God\\" in the singular. The Samaritan Torah has edited out some of these exceptions.[16]\\r\\nIn a few cases in the Greek Septuagint (LXX), Hebrew elohim with a plural verb, or with implied plural context, was rendered either angeloi (\\"angels\\") or to kriterion tou Theou (\\"the judgement of God\\").[17] These passages then entered first the Latin Vulgate, then the English King James Version (KJV) as \\"angels\\" and \\"judges\\", respectively. From this came the result that James Strong, for example, listed \\"angels\\" and \\"judges\\" as possible meanings for elohim with a plural verb in his Strong's Concordance, and the same is true of many other 17th-20th century reference works. Both Gesenius' Hebrew Lexicon and the Brown-Driver-Briggs Lexicon list both angels and judges as possible alternative meanings of elohim with plural verbs and adjectives.\\r\\nThe reliability of the Septuagint translation in this matter has been questioned by Gesenius and Ernst Wilhelm Hengstenberg. In the case of Gesenius, he lists the meaning without agreeing with it.[18] Hengstenberg stated that the Hebrew Bible text never uses elohim to refer to \\"angels\\", but that the Septuagint translators refused the references to \\"gods\\" in the verses they amended to \\"angels.\\"[19]\\r\\nThe Greek New Testament (NT) quotes Psalm 8:4-6 in Hebrews 2:6b-8a, where the Greek NT has \\"???\\" (angelous) in vs. 7,[20] quoting Ps. 8:5 (8:6 in the LXX), which also has \\"???\\" in a version of the Greek Septuagint.[21] In the KJV, elohim (Strong's number H430) is translated as \\"angels\\" only[22] in Psalm 8:5.\\r\\nThe KJV has elohim translated as \\"judges\\" in Exodus 21:6; Exodus 22:8; and twice in Exodus 22:9.[23]\\r\\nSometimes when elohim occurs as the referent or object (i.e. not subject) of a sentence, and without any accompanying verb or adjective to indicate plurality, it may be grammatically unclear whether gods plural or God singular is intended. An example is Psalm 8:5 where \\"Yet you have made him a little lower than the elohim\\" is ambiguous as to whether \\"lower than the gods\\" or \\"lower than God\\" is intended. The Septuagint read this as \\"gods\\" and then \\"corrected\\" the translation to \\"angels\\",[citation needed] which reading is taken up by the New Testament in Hebrews 2:9 \\"But we see Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death, crowned with glory and honour; that he by the grace of God should taste death for every man.\\" (full quote and compare)\\r\\nThe Hebrew language has several nouns with -im (masculine plural) and -oth (feminine plural) endings which nevertheless take singular verbs, adjectives and pronouns. For example, Ba'alim \\"owner\\": \\"He is lord (singular) even over any of those things that he owns that are lordly (plural).\\"[citation needed]\\r\\nIn the following verses Elohim was translated as God singular in the King James Version even though it was accompanied by plural verbs and other plural grammatical terms.\\r\\nAnd there he built an altar and called the place El-bethel, because there God had revealed [plural verb] himself to him when he fled from his brother.\\r\\nHere the Hebrew verb \\"revealed\\" is plural, hence: \\"the-gods were revealed\\". A NET Bible note claims that the Authorized Version wrongly translates: \\"God appeared unto him\\".[24] This is one of several instances where the Bible uses plural verbs with the name elohim.[25][26]\\r\\nAV Psalm 82:1 God standeth in the congregation of the mighty; he judgeth among the gods. [...]\\r\\nI have said, Ye [are] gods; and all of you [are] children of the most High.\\r\\nMarti Steussy, in Chalice Introduction to the Old Testament, discusses: The first verse of Psalm 82: Elohim has taken his place in the divine council. Here elohim has a singular verb and clearly refers to God. But in verse 6 of the Psalm, God says to the other members of the council, You [plural] are elohim. Here elohim has to mean gods.[27]\\r\\nMark Smith, referring to this same Psalm, states in God in Translation This psalm presents a scene of the gods meeting together in divine council...Elohim stands in the council of El. Among the elohim he pronounces judgment:...[28]\\r\\nIn Hulsean Lectures for..., H. M. Stephenson discussed Jesus argument in John 10:34ÿ36 concerning Psalm 82. (In answer to the charge of blasphemy Jesus replied:) \\"Is it not written in your law, I said, Ye are gods. If he called them gods, unto whom the word of God came, and the scripture cannot be broken; Say ye of him, whom the Father hath sanctified, and sent into the world, Thou blasphemest; because I said, I am the Son of God?\\" ÿ \\"Now what is the force of this quotation 'I said ye are gods.' It is from the Asaph Psalm which begins 'Elohim hath taken His place in the mighty assembly. In the midst of the Elohim He is judging.'\\"[29]\\r\\nThe Hebrew word for a son is ben; plural is bnim (with the construct state form being \\"benei\\"). The Hebrew term benei elohim (\\"sons of God\\" or \\"sons of the gods\\") in Genesis 6:2[30] compares to the use of \\"sons of gods\\" (Ugaritic b'n il) sons of El in Ugaritic mythology.[31] Karel van der Toorn states that gods can be referred to collectively as bene elim, bene elyon, or bene elohim.[5]\\r\\nIn Jewish tradition, the Torah verse, that was the battle-cry of the Maccabees (Hebrew: ??????? Machabim), \\"Mi chamocha ba'elim YHWH\\" (\\"Who is like You among the heavenly powers, YHWH\\"), is an acronym for \\"Machabi\\" as well as an acronym for \\"Matityahu Kohen ben Yochanan\\" The correlating Torah verse, The song of Moses and the Children of Israel by the Sea, makes a reference to elim, but more with a mundane notion of natural forces, might, war and governmental powers.\\r\\nIn Mormonism, Elohim is a name occasionally used to refer to God the Father. Elohim is a being that is separate from Jesus Christ or \\"the Lord\\" of the Old Testament. Elohim is the physical father of Jesus, whose name before birth is said to have been \\"Jehovah\\".[32]\\r\\nThe Book of Abraham, which faithful members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints hold to be divinely inspired scripture revealed by the prophet Joseph Smith, contains a paraphrase of the first chapter of Genesis which explicitly translates Elohim as the Gods multiple times.","input":"What does the name of god elohim mean?"},{"output":"essentially autonomous territories called satrapies","context":"","input":"What was the dominant form of political organization in the hellenistic world?"},{"output":"Quint Asper","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nGunsmoke is an American radio and television Western drama series created by director Norman Macdonnell and writer John Meston.

Robinson instructed his West Coast CBS Vice President, Harry Ackerman, who had developed the Philip Marlowe series, to take on the task.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nAckerman and his scriptwriters, Mort Fine and David Friedkin, created an audition script called \\"Mark Dillon Goes to Gouge Eye\\" based on one of their Michael Shayne radio scripts, \\"The Crooked Wheel\\". Two auditions were created in 1949. The first was very much like a hardboiled detective series and starred Michael Rye (credited as Rye Billsbury) as Dillon; the second starred Straight Arrow actor Howard Culver in a more Western, lighter version of the same script. CBS liked the Culver version better, and Ackerman was told to proceed.\\r\\n\\r\\nA complication arose, though; Culver's contract as the star of Straight Arrow would not allow him to do another Western series. The project was shelved for three years, when producer Norman Macdonnell and writer John Meston discovered it while creating an adult Western series of their own.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nMacdonnell and Meston wanted to create a radio Western for adults, in contrast to the prevailing juvenile fare such as The Lone Ranger and The Cisco Kid. Gunsmoke was set in Dodge City, Kansas, during the thriving cattle days of the 1870s. Dunning[6] notes, \\"The show drew critical acclaim for unprecedented realism.\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe radio series first aired on CBS on April 26, 1952 with the episode \\"Billy the Kid\\", written by Walter Newman, and ended on June 18, 1961. The show stars William Conrad as Marshal Matt Dillon, Howard McNear as Doc Charles Adams, Georgia Ellis as Kitty Russell, and Parley Baer as Dillon's assistant, Chester Wesley Proudfoot.\\r\\n\\r\\nMatt Dillon was played on radio by William Conrad and on TV by James Arness. Two versions of the same pilot episode titled \\"Mark Dillon Goes to Gouge Eye\\" are in the archives with two different actors, Rye Billsbury and Howard Culver, playing Marshal \\"Mark\\" Dillon as the lead, not yet played by Conrad. Conrad was one of the last actors to audition for the role of Marshal Dillon. With a resonantly powerful and distinctive voice, Conrad was already one of radio's busiest actors. Though Meston championed him, Macdonnell thought Conrad might be overexposed. During his audition, however, Conrad won over Macdonnell after reading only a few lines. Dillon, as portrayed by Conrad, was a lonely, isolated man, toughened by a hard life. Macdonnell later claimed, \\"Much of Matt Dillon's character grew out of Bill Conrad.\\"[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nMeston relished the upending of cherished Western fiction clichs and felt that few Westerns gave any inkling of how brutal the Old West was in reality. Many episodes were based on man's cruelty to man and woman, inasmuch as the prairie woman's life and the painful treatment of women as chattels were touched on well ahead of their time in most media. As originally pitched to CBS executives, this was to be an adult Western, not a grown-up Hopalong Cassidy.\\r\\n\\r\\nDunning writes that Meston was especially disgusted by the archetypal Western hero and set out \\"to destroy [that type of] character he loathed\\". In Meston's view, \\"Dillon was almost as scarred as the homicidal psychopaths who drifted into Dodge from all directions.\\"[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nChester was played by Parley Baer on radio, and by Dennis Weaver on television.\\r\\nChester's character had no surname until Baer ad libbed \\"Proudfoot\\" during an early rehearsal. Initial Gunsmoke scripts gave him no name at all; his lines were simply slugged to be spoken by \\"Townsman\\". Again, Conrad's sense of what the program would be supervened, and Chester was born. Chester's middle initial was given as \\"W\\" in the June 15, 1958 episode \\"Old Flame\\", and a few episodes later, on the July 7, 1958 episode \\"Marshal Proudfoot\\", it is revealed that his middle name, and that of his 10 siblings, is Wesley. The amiable Waco expatriate was usually described as Dillon's \\"assistant\\", but in the December 13, 1952, episode \\"Post Martin\\", Dillon described Chester as Dillon's deputy. Contradicting this description, in the July 5, 1954, episode \\"Hank Prine\\" (episode 116, minute 3:02) Dillon corrects a prisoner who describes Chester as his \\"deputy\\" stating \\"Chester is not my deputy\\", though they both agree Chester acts like he is. Whatever his title, Chester was Dillon's foil, friend, partner, and in an episode in which Chester nearly dies (\\"Never Pester Chester\\"), Dillon allows that Chester was the only person he could trust. The TV series changed the newly limping Chester's last name from Proudfoot to Goode. Chester was played by Dennis Weaver who went on to star in the NBC Mystery Movie rotating TV series entry of a police drama with a comedic touch ÿ McCloud in the early 1970s. Weaver, himself an impressive 6'2\\", often looked small alongside Arness' height at 6'7\\", this could be partly due to the character Chester having a limp. Season 2, episode 25 tells us that Chester was in the army. He would not have had the limp then, so probably got injured in the Civil War: not long ago, but long enough that he would have learned to live with the limp and virtually forget it.\\r\\n\\r\\nHoward McNear starred as Dr. Charles Adams in the radio series, with Milburn Stone portraying Dr. Galen Adams in the television version.\\r\\nIn the radio series, \\"Doc\\" Adams was initially a self-interested and somewhat dark character with a predilection for constantly attempting to increase his revenue through the procurement of autopsy fees. However, McNear's performances steadily became more warm-hearted and sympathetic. Most notably, this transformation began during (and progressed steadily following) the July 1952 episode \\"Never Pester Chester,\\" in which a physician with a more compassionate and devoted temperament is essential to the plotline when Chester is near-fatally injured by two trouble-making Texas drovers. Doc Adams' backstory evokes a varied and experienced life: In some episodes, he had educational ties to Philadelphia; in others, he spent time as ship's doctor aboard the gambling boats that plied the Mississippi River, which provided a background for his knowledge of New Orleans (and acquaintance with Mark Twain). In the January 31, 1953, episode \\"Cavalcade\\", a fuller history is offered, though subsequent programs kept close listeners' heads spinning. In \\"Cavalcade\\", his real name is Calvin Moore, educated in Boston, and he practiced as a doctor for a year in Richmond, Virginia, where he fell in love with a beautiful young woman who was also being courted by a wealthy young man named Roger Beauregard. Beauregard forced Doc into fighting a duel with him, resulting in Beauregard's being shot and killed. Though it was a fair duel, as a Yankee and an outsider Doc was forced to flee. The young woman fled after him and they were married in St. Louis, but two months later, she died of typhus. Doc wandered throughout the territories until he settled in Dodge City 17 years later under the name of \\"Charles Adams\\". The Adams moniker was another Conrad invention, borrowing the surname from cartoonist Charles Addams as a testament to Doc's initially ghoulish comportment.\\r\\n\\r\\nKitty was played by Georgia Ellis on radio, and by Amanda Blake on TV.\\r\\nGeorgia Ellis first appeared in the radio episode \\"Billy the Kid\\" (April 26, 1952) as \\"Francie Richards\\", a former girlfriend of Matt Dillon and the widow of a criminal. \\"Miss Kitty\\" did not appear until the May 10, 1952, episode \\"Jaliscoe\\". Kitty's profession was hinted at, but never explicit; in a 1953 interview with Time, Macdonnell declared, \\"Kitty is just someone Matt has to visit every once in a while\\".[8] The magazine observed that she is \\"obviously not selling chocolate bars\\".[9] An out-take from the program makes this hilariously obvious.[10] The television show first portrayed Kitty as a saloon employee (dance-hall girl/prostitute), then from season 3 as half owner of the Long Branch Saloon. Sometime in 1959, Ellis was billed as Georgia Hawkins instead of Georgia Ellis.\\r\\n\\r\\nGunsmoke was often a somber program, particularly in its early years. Dunning writes that Dillon \\"played his hand and often lost. He arrived too late to prevent a lynching. He amputated a dying man's leg and lost the patient anyway. He saved a girl from brutal rapists then found himself unable to offer her what she needed to stop her from moving into ... life as a prostitute.\\"[11] Some listeners, such as Dunning, argue the radio version was more realistic. Episodes were aimed at adults and featured some of the most explicit content of their time, including violent crimes, scalpings, massacres, and opium addicts. Many episodes ended on a somber note, and villains often got away with their crimes. Nonetheless, due to the subtle scripts and outstanding ensemble cast, over the years, the program evolved into a warm, often humorous celebration of human nature.  Despite Gunsmoke's realism in some areas, the show took liberties with accuracy in others.  The program was set after the arrival of the railroad in Dodge City (1872) and Kansas had been a state since 1861.  A U.S. Marshal (actually a deputy marshal, only the senior officer in the district holds the title \\"marshal\\") would not be based in Dodge City and would not be involved in local law enforcement.  And any peace officer, then and now, would not approach an armed individual with his side-arm holstered and give the suspect a chance to draw.\\r\\n\\r\\nApart from the doleful tone, Gunsmoke was distinct from other radio Westerns, as the dialogue was often slow and halting, and due to the outstanding sound effects, listeners had a nearly palpable sense of the prairie where the show was set. The effects were subtle but multilayered, giving the show a spacious feel. John Dunning wrote, \\"The listener heard extraneous dialogue in the background, just above the muted shouts of kids playing in an alley. He heard noises from the next block, too, where the inevitable dog was barking.\\"[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nGunsmoke was also unique from other Westerns in that it was unsponsored for the first few years of production. The program got its support from CBS for the first two years. Series producers felt that if the show were sponsored, they would have to \\"clean the show up\\".[13] The producers wanted to find a sponsor that would allow them to keep the show the way it was.[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nNot long after the radio show began, talk began of adapting it to television. Privately, Macdonnell had a guarded interest in taking the show to television, but publicly, he declared, \\"our show is perfect for radio,\\" and he feared, as Dunning writes, \\"Gunsmoke confined by a picture could not possibly be as authentic or attentive to detail.\\" \\"In the end\\", wrote Dunning, \\"CBS simply took it away from Macdonnell and began preparing for the television version.\\"[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nConrad and the others were given auditions, but they were little more than token effortsespecially in Conrad's case, due to his obesity. However, Meston was kept as the main writer. In the early years, a majority of the TV episodes were adapted from the radio scripts, often using identical scenes and dialogue. Dunning wrote, \\"That radio fans considered the TV show a sham and its players impostors should surprise no one. That the TV show was not a sham is due in no small part to the continued strength of Meston's scripts.\\" [11]\\r\\n\\r\\nMacdonnell and Meston continued the radio version of Gunsmoke until 1961, making it one of the most enduring vintage radio dramas.\\r\\n\\r\\nConrad directed two television episodes, in 1963 and 1971, while McNear appeared on six, playing characters other than Doc, including three times as storekeeper Howard Rudd.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe TV series ran from September 10, 1955, to March 31, 1975, on CBS, with 635 total episodes. It was the second Western television series written for adults,[15] premiering on September 10, 1955, four days after The Life and Legend of Wyatt Earp.[16][17] The first 12 seasons aired Saturdays at 10 pm, seasons 13 through 16 aired Mondays at 7:30?pm, and the last four seasons aired Mondays at 8 pm. During its second season in 1956, the program joined the list of the top ten television programs broadcast in the United States. It quickly moved to number one and stayed there until 1961. It remained among the top 20 programs until 1964.[18]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe television series remains the longest-running primetime live-action series of the 20th century. As of  2017[update], it had the highest number of scripted episodes for any U.S. primetime, commercial, live-action television series. On April 29, 2018, The Simpsons surpassed Gunsmoke for the most scripted episodes.[19] Some TV fans question its position as having the longest run. Some foreign-made programs, i.e. produced outside the U.S., have been broadcast in the U.S. and contend for the position as the longest-running series.[notes 1] As of  2016[update], Gunsmoke was rated fourth globally, after Doctor Who (1963ÿ89, 2005ÿpresent), Taggart (1983ÿ2010),[20] and The Bill (1984ÿ2010).\\r\\n\\r\\nJames Arness and Milburn Stone portrayed their Gunsmoke characters for 20 consecutive years, a feat later matched by Kelsey Grammer as the character Frasier Crane, but over two half-hour sitcoms (Cheers and Frasier).[21] George Walsh, the announcer for Gunsmoke, began in 1952 on radio's Gunsmoke and continued until television's Gunsmoke was canceled in 1975.[22] The first seven seasons were jointly sponsored by L&M cigarettes and Remington shaving products.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Gunsmoke was adapted for television in 1955, in spite of a campaign to persuade the network, the network was not interested in bringing either Conrad or his radio costars to the television medium. Conrad's weight was rumored to be a deciding factor. Denver Pyle was also considered for the leading role, as was Raymond Burr, who was ultimately also seen as too heavy for the part. Charles Warren, television Gunsmoke's first director, said \\"His voice was fine, but he was too big. When he stood up, his chair stood with him.\\"[23] According to Dennis Weaver's comments on the 50th Anniversary DVD, Disc One, Episode \\"Hack Prine\\", John Wayne was never considered for the role; to have done so would have been preposterous since Wayne was a top movie leading man. The belief that Wayne was asked to star is disputed by Warren. Although he agrees Wayne encouraged Arness to take the role, Warren says, \\"I hired Jim Arness on the strength of a picture he's done for me ... I never thought for a moment of offering it to Wayne.\\"[22]\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to Thomas \\"Duke\\" Miller, a TV/movie/celebrity expert, this story was told to him by legendary actor James Stewart: \\"Jimmy said he was in the office with Charles Warren when Mr. Wayne came in. Mr. Warren asked Wayne if he knew James Arness, and Mr. Wayne said yes. Mr. Warren told Mr. Wayne about the transition of the show from radio to TV, and Mr. Wayne readily agreed that James Arness would be a terrific choice for the part of Matt Dillon. I have no reason to doubt the story, because Jimmy absolutely knew everybody.\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the end, the primary roles were all recast, with Arness taking the lead role of Marshal Matt Dillon (on the recommendation of Wayne, who also introduced the pilot); Dennis Weaver playing Chester Goode; Milburn Stone being cast as Dr. G. \\"Doc\\" Adams (later Galen \\"Doc\\" Adams); and Amanda Blake taking on the role of Miss Kitty Russell. Macdonnell became the associate producer of the TV show and later the producer. Meston was named head writer.\\r\\n\\r\\nGood evening. My name's Wayne. Some of you may have seen me before; I hope so. I've been kicking around Hollywood a long time. I've made a lot of pictures out here, all kinds, and some of them have been Westerns. And that's what I'm here to tell you about tonight: a Westerna new television show called Gunsmoke. No, I'm not in it. I wish I were, though, because I think it's the best thing of its kind that's come along, and I hope you'll agree with me; it's honest, it's adult, it's realistic. When I first heard about the show Gunsmoke, I knew there was only one man to play in it: James Arness. He's a young fellow, and maybe new to some of you, but I've worked with him and I predict he'll be a big star, so you might as well get used to him, like you've had to get used to me! And now I'm proud to present my friend Jim Arness in Gunsmoke.\\r\\nChester and Festus Haggen are perhaps Dillon's most recognizable sidekicks, though others became acting deputies for ?2?1?2- to ?7?1?2-year stints: Quint Asper (Burt Reynolds) (1962ÿ65), Thad Greenwood (Roger Ewing) (1966ÿ68), and Newly O'Brien (Buck Taylor) (1967ÿ75), who served as both back-up deputy and doctor-in-training, having some studies in medicine via his uncle, which then continued under Doc Adams.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1962, Burt Reynolds was added to the show's lineup, as the \\"halfbreed\\" blacksmith Quint Asper, and performed that role from the year just before the departure of Chester Goode and to just after the appearance of Festus Haggen. Three of the actors, who played Dodge deputies, Ken Curtis, Roger Ewing, and Buck Taylor, had previous guest roles. Curtis, a big band and Western singer (Tommy Dorsey Orchestra, Shep Fields Band, Sons of the Pioneers), had five previous guest roles, including one in 1963 as a shady ladies' man named Kyle Kelly (\\"Lover Boy,\\" season 9, show two [episode 307]).[25]\\r\\n\\r\\nCurtis first appeared in the 1959 episode \\"Jayhawkers\\" (season four, episode 21 [episode 138]), where he played Phil Jacks, a Texas cowboy, with Jack Elam as his boss during a cattle drive from Texas. The second was another 1959 episode entitled \\"Change of Heart\\" (season four, episode 32 [episode 149]), where he played Brisco. The third appearance is the 1960 episode \\"The Ex-Urbanites\\" (season five, episode 30 [episode 186]), where he plays Jesse. He also had a small role as an Indian named Scout in the episode \\"Speak Me Fair\\" (season five, episode 34 [episode 190]) in 1960. Curtis was reared in Las Animas, Colorado, and for a time was a son-in-law of director John Ford.[26]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1963, Weaver left the series to pursue a broader acting career in TV series and films. In 1964, Curtis was signed as a regular to play the stubbornly illiterate hillbilly Festus Haggen. The character, heretofore a comic feature, came to town in a 1962 episode titled \\"Us Haggens,\\" to avenge the death of his twin brother Fergus, and decided to stay in Dodge when the deed was done. Initially on the fringes of Dodge society, Festus was slowly phased in as a reliable sidekick/part-time deputy to Matt Dillon when Reynolds left in 1965. In the episode \\"Alias Festus Haggen,\\" he is mistaken for a robber and killer whom he has to expose to free himself (both parts played by Curtis). In a comic relief episode (\\"Mad Dog,\\" another case of mistaken identity forces Festus to fight three sons of a man killed by his cousin. As a side note, only one episode has all three actors in it playing their respective roles. It is the 1964 episode entitled \\"Prairie Wolfer\\" (season 9, episode 16 [episode 321]), with Dennis Weaver as Chester, Burt Reynolds as Quint, and Ken Curtis as Festus.[27] The 1964 episode entitled \\"Once a Haggen\\" (season 9, episode 18 [episode 323]) is the second of only two occasions in which Chester and Festus appear in the same episode.[28]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Milburn Stone left the series for heart bypass surgery in 1971, Pat Hingle played his temporary replacement Dr. John Chapman for several episodes. His presence was at first roundly resisted by Festus, a bickersome but close friend of Doc Adams.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe back stories of some of the main characters were largely left to the imagination of the viewer. Matt Dillon spent his early years in foster care, knew the Bible, was a wayward, brawling cowboy, and was later mentored by a caring lawman. In a few episodes he mentions having spent some time in the army. Kitty Russell was born in New Orleans and reared by a flashy foster mother (who once visited Dodge), although her father visited Dodge on one occasion and wished to have her return to New Orleans.  Barkeep Sam is said to be married, but no wife is ever seen. (In the episode \\"Tafton,\\" he is seen side-by-side with a woman in a church singing). Quint Asper's white father was killed by white scavengers. Thad Greenwood's father, a storekeeper, was harassed to death by a trio of loathsome ne'er-do-well thieves. Chester Goode is known to be one of many brothers raised by an aunt and uncle, and on one occasion he mentions his mother; he refers to past service in the cavalry and years as a cattle driver in Texas. The cause of Chester's stiff right leg is never given, but it is shown as his own leg and not a prosthesis. No direct reference to his disability is ever made in the script, although some oblique moments paint the free-spirited, comic deputy with a darker tone. Newly O'Brien was named after a physician uncle who ignited his interest in medicine.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile Dillon and Miss Kitty clearly have a close personal relationship, the two never marry. In a July 2, 2002, Associated Press interview with Bob Thomas, Arness explained, \\"If they were man and wife, it would make a lot of difference. The people upstairs decided it was better to leave the show as it was, which I totally agreed with.\\" In the episode \\"Waste,\\" featuring Johnny Whitaker as a boy with a prostitute mother, her madam questions Dillon as to why the law overlooks Miss Kitty's enterprise. It appears that bordellos could exist \\"at the law's discretion,\\" (meaning the marshal's). As a historical matter, prior to the First World War, few laws criminalized prostitution in the United States.[29] The nearest that Matt and Miss Kitty have to a romantic evening together is when they try to have dinner over the Long Branch Saloon (\\"A Quiet Day In Dodge\\", 1973). Unfortunately, Marshal Dillon has been going over 30 hours without sleep, and when Kitty is distracted, he falls soundly asleep.[30] Ironically, the nearest Miss Kitty gets to being married is when she has to pretend to be married to Cavalry Sgt. Holly in order to save her from a robber gang (\\"Sergeant Holly,\\" 1970). By the time of the \\"Gold Train\\" episode Kitty remembers when she first met Matt ÿ 17 years before. Miss Kitty was written out in 1974. The actress sought more free time and reportedly missed her late co-star, Glenn Strange, who played her Long Branch barkeep, Sam. When Blake decided not to return for the show's 20th (and final) season, the character was said to have returned to New Orleans. She was replaced by the hoarse-voiced, matronly actress Fran Ryan (known to many as the second Doris Ziffel on CBS's Green Acres.)\\r\\n\\r\\nFor over a decade on television, a sign hung over Doc's office that read \\"Dr. G. Adams\\". Milburn Stone was given free rein to choose the character's first name. The actor chose the name of the ancient Greek physician and medical researcher Galen. He is first referred to in this manner by Theodore Bikel as \\"Martin Kellums\\" in the season-10 episode, \\"Song for Dying,\\" aired February 13, 1965.[31]\\r\\n\\r\\nDifferences were noted between the characters on the radio and TV versions of Gunsmoke. In the radio series, Doc was acerbic, somewhat mercenary, and borderline alcoholic, at least in the program's early years. On radio's Gunsmoke, Doc Adams's real name was Dr. Calvin Moore.[32] He came west and changed his name to escape a charge of murder. The television Doc, though still crusty, was in many ways softer and warmer.\\r\\n\\r\\nNothing in the radio series suggested that Chester Proudfoot was disabled; this merely visual feature was added to the Chester Goode character on television because of actor Dennis Weaver's athletic build, to emphasize Chester's role as a follower and not an independent agent.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nMiss Kitty, who after the radio series ended was said by some to have engaged in prostitution, began in that role in the television series, working in the Long Branch Saloon. In an earlier 1956 episode (\\"How to Cure a Friend\\" Season 2, #7), the owner of the Long Branch was named Bill Pence (a role played by at least three different actors over the years). A later episode (\\"Daddy O\\" Season 2, #36, filmed in 1956 and aired in 1957) begins with Chester pointing out to Matt (who had been out of town) a new sign under the Long Branch Saloon sign saying \\"Russell & Pence, Proprietors\\". In that same episode, John Dehner portrayed a dubious New Orleans businessman claiming to be Kitty's father, who tried to talk her into selling her half interest in the Long Branch and returning to New Orleans with him as a partner in his alleged freight business. In another 1956 episode (involving a new saloon girl named \\"Rena Decker\\" who causes four deaths by provoking men into fighting over her), Miss Kitty identifies herself as half-owner of the Long Branch with Mr. Pence (played by Judson Pratt). Subsequently, Miss Kitty transitioned to sole owner. Although early film episodes showed her descending from her second-floor rooms in the saloon with Matt, or showed her or one of her girls leading a cowboy up to those same rooms, these scenes disappeared later on, and viewers were guided to see Miss Kitty just as a kindhearted businesswoman.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom 1955 to 1961, Gunsmoke was a half-hour show (retitled Marshal Dillon in syndication). It then went to an hour-long format. The series was retitled Gun Law in the UK. The Marshal Dillon syndicated rerun lasted from 1961 until 1964 on CBS, originally on Tuesday nights within its time in reruns.\\r\\n\\r\\nGunsmoke was TV's number one-ranked show from 1957 to 1961 before slipping into a decline after expanding to an hour. In 1967, the show's 12th season, CBS planned to cancel the series, but widespread viewer reaction (including a mention in Congress and the behind-the-scenes pressure from the wife of CBS's longtime president William S. Paley) prevented its demise. On the Biography Channel's Behind The Scenes: Gilligan's Island (2002), Gilligan's Island producer Sherwood Schwartz states that the wife of CBS's president pressured her husband not to cancel Gunsmoke in 1967, so the network cut Gilligan's Island instead. The show continued in its new time slot at 8?pm on Mondays. This scheduling move led to a spike in ratings that had it once again rally to the top 10 in the Nielsen ratings, which again saved the series when CBS purged most of its rural content in 1971. The series remained in the top 10 until the 1973ÿ74 television season.[33] In September 1975, despite still ranking among the top 30 programs in the ratings, Gunsmoke was canceled after a 20-year run; it was replaced by Mary Tyler Moore spin-offs Rhoda and Phyllis (though Rhoda actually debuted while Gunsmoke was still airing first-run). Thirty TV Westerns came and went during its 20-year tenure, and Gunsmoke was the sole survivor, with Alias Smith and Jones and Bonanza both leaving the airwaves 2 1/2 years earlier in January 1973.\\r\\n\\r\\nArness and Stone remained with the show for its entire run, though Stone missed seven episodes in 1971 due to illness.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe entire cast was stunned by the cancellation, as they were unaware that CBS was considering it. According to Arness, \\"We didn't do a final, wrap-up show. We finished the 20th year, we all expected to go on for another season, or two or three. The (network) never told anybody they were thinking of canceling.\\" The cast and crew read the news in the trade papers.[34]  This seemed to have been a habit of CBS.  Three other popular shows, Gilligan's Island, Lost in Space and The Incredible Hulk met the same fate, in the same, abrupt manner.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1987, CBS commissioned a reunion movie entitled Gunsmoke: Return to Dodge. James Arness and Amanda Blake returned in their iconic roles of Matt Dillon and Miss Kitty, with Fran Ryan returning in her role as Kitty's friend/saloon-owner Hannah and Buck Taylor returning as Newly O'Brian. Doc Adams and Festus Haggen were not featured in the film. Milburn Stone had died 7 years earlier in 1980 and the role of Doc was not recast. Ken Curtis, meanwhile, balked at the salary offer he received and said that he should be paid based on Festus' importance in the character hierarchy. The screenwriters responded to Curtis' absence by making Newly the new Dodge City marshal. The film, shot in Alberta, featured a now-retired Marshal Dillon being attacked and a vengeful former rival returning to Dodge City to entrap him.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1990, the second telefilm, Gunsmoke: The Last Apache, premiered. Since Amanda Blake had died the year before, the writers decided to revisit a 1973 episode for the movie. The episode was based on \\"Matt's Love Story\\", which was noted for the marshal's first overnight visit to a female's lodgings.[citation needed] In the episode, Matt loses his memory and his heart during a brief liaison with \\"Mike\\" Yardner (played by Michael Learned).[notes 2] In the film, Learned returns as Mike, who reveals to Marshal Dillon that he is the father of their daughter.[35] Beth (played by Amy Stock-Poynton) and asks him for help in saving her. Dodge City was never again seen.\\r\\n\\r\\nOther films included Gunsmoke: To the Last Man (1992), Gunsmoke IV: The Long Ride (1993), and Gunsmoke: One Man's Justice (1994). Arness appeared in all five films.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll 635 episodes of the television series, and almost all 480 episodes of the radio show, still exist.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn syndication, the entire 20-year run of Gunsmoke is separated into three packages by CBS Television Distribution:\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2006, as part of Gunsmoke's 50th anniversary on TV, certain selected episodes were released on DVD in three different box sets. Twelve episodes, from 1955 to 1964, were selected for the Gunsmoke: Volume I box set, and another twelve episodes, from 1964 to 1975, were selected for the Gunsmoke: Volume II box set. Both sets are also available as a combined single \\"Gift Box Set\\". A third unique DVD box set, known as Gunsmoke: The Directors Collection, was also released with 10 selected episodes from certain seasons throughout the series' 20-year history.

Viral proteins are grouped according to their functions, and groups of viral proteins include structural proteins, nonstructural proteins, regulatory, and accessory proteins.[1] Viruses are non-living and they do not have the means to reproduce on their own. They depend on their host cell's metabolism for energy, enzymes, and precursors, in order to reproduce. As such, viruses do not code for many of their own viral proteins, but rather, they use the host cell's machinery to produce the viral proteins they require for replication.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMost viral structural proteins are components for the capsid and the envelope of the virus.\\r\\nThe genetic material of a virus is stored within a viral protein structure called the capsid. The capsid is a \\"shield\\" that protects the viral nucleic acids from getting degraded by host enzymes or other types of pesticides or pestilences. It also functions to attach the virion to its host, and enable the virion to penetrate the host cell membrane. Many copies of a single viral protein or a number of different viral proteins make up the capsid, and each of these viral proteins are coded for by one gene from the viral genome. The structure of the capsid allows the virus to use a small number of viral genes to make a large capsid.[3]\\r\\nSeveral protomers, oligomeric (viral) protein subunits, combine to form capsomeres, and capsomeres come together to form the capsid.[1] Capsomeres can arrange into an icosahedral, helical, or complex capsid, but in many viruses, such as the herpes simplex virus, an icosahedral capsid is assembled.[2] Three asymmetric and nonidentical viral protein units make up each of the twenty identical triangular faces in the icosahedral capsid.[2]\\r\\nThe capsid of some viruses are enclosed in a membrane called the viral envelope. In most cases, the viral envelope is obtained by the capsid from the host cell's plasma membrane when a virus leaves its host cell through a process called budding.[4] The viral envelope is made up of a lipid bilayer embedded with viral proteins, including viral glycoproteins.[1] These viral glycoproteins bind to specific receptors and coreceptors on the membrane of host cells, and they allow viruses to attach onto their target host cells.[1] Some of these glycoproteins include:\\r\\nViral glycoproteins play a critical role in virus-to-cell fusion. Virus-to-cell fusion is initiated when viral glycoproteins bind to cellular receptors.[5]\\r\\nThe fusion of the viral envelope with the cellular membrane requires high energy to occur. Viral membrane fusion proteins act as catalysts to overcome this high energy barrier.[6] Following viral glycoprotein binding to cellular receptors, viral membrane fusion proteins undergo a change in structure conformation.[6] This change in conformation then facilitates the destabilization and fusion of the viral envelope with the cellular membrane by allowing fusion loops (FLs) or hydrophobic fusion peptides (FPs) on the viral envelope to interact with the cell membrane.[6] Most viral membrane fusion proteins would end up in a hairpin-like conformation after fusion, in which FLs/FPs and the transmembrane domain are all on the same side of the protein.[6]\\r\\nViral glycoproteins and their three-dimensional structures, before and after fusion, have allowed a wide range of structural conformations to be discovered.[6] Viral membrane fusion proteins have been grouped into four different classes, and each class is identified by characteristic structural conformations:\\r\\nViral nonstructural proteins are proteins coded for by the genome of the virus and are expressed in infected cells.[1] However, these proteins are not assembled in the virion.[1] During the replication of viruses, some viral nonstructural proteins carry out important functions that affect the replication process itself.[1] Similarly, during the assembly of viruses, some of these proteins also carry out important functions that affect the assembly process.[1] Some of these viral nonstructural protein functions are replicon formation, immunomodulation, and transactivation of viral structural protein encoding genes.[1]\\r\\nViral nonstructural proteins interact with host cell proteins to form the replicon, otherwise known as the replication complex.[1] In the hepatitis C virus, viral nonstructural proteins interact with cellular vesicle membrane transport protein, hVAP-33, to assemble the replicon.[1] Viral nonstructural 4b (NS4B) protein alters the host cell's membrane and starts the formation process of the replication complex.[1][7] Other viral nonstructural proteins such as NS5A, NS5B, and NS3, are also recruited to the complex, and NS4B interacts with them and binds to viral RNA.[1][7]\\r\\nThe immune response of a host to an infected cell can be adjusted through the immunomodulatory properties of viral nonstructural proteins.[1] Viral nonstructural protein NS1 in the West Nile virus prevents complement activation through its binding to a complement control protein, factor H.[1] As a result, complement recognition of infected cells is reduced, and infected cells remain unharmed by the host's immune system.[1][8]\\r\\nViral regulatory and accessory proteins have many functions. These viral proteins control and influence viral gene expressions in the viral genome, including viral structural gene transcription rates.[1] Viral regulatory and accessory proteins also influence and adjust cellular functions of the host cell, such as the regulation of genes, and apoptosis.[1]\\r\\nIn DNA viruses and retroviruses, viral regulatory proteins can enhance viral gene transcription, likewise, these proteins can also enhance host cellular gene transcription too.[9]\\r\\nViral accessory proteins, also known as auxiliary proteins, are coded for by the genome of retroviruses.[10] Most viral accessory proteins only carry out their functions in specific types of cells.[10] Also, they do not have much influence on the replication of the virus.[10] However, in some instances, maintaining the replication of viruses would require the help (and function) of viral accessory proteins.[10]\\r\\nSyncytin is an endogenous retrovirus protein that has been captured in the mammalian genome to allow membrane fusion in placental morphogenesis.[11]","input":"What is needed for virus proteins to be made?"},{"output":"jellyfish","context":"Plankton (singular plankter) are the diverse collection of organisms that live in large bodies of water and are unable to swim against a current.[1] They provide a crucial source of food to many large aquatic organisms, such as fish and whales.\\r\\nThese organisms include bacteria, archaea, algae, protozoa and drifting or floating animals that inhabitfor examplethe pelagic zone of oceans, seas, or bodies of fresh water. Essentially, plankton are defined by their ecological niche rather than any phylogenetic or taxonomic classification.\\r\\nThough many planktonic species are microscopic in size, plankton includes organisms over a wide range of sizes, including large organisms such as jellyfish.[2] Technically the term does not include organisms on the surface of the water, which are called pleustonor those that swim actively in the water, which are called nekton.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe name plankton is derived from the Greek adjective ϫ۰ٶ?? (planktos), meaning errant, and by extension, wanderer or drifter,[3] and was coined by Victor Hensen in 1887.[4][5] While some forms are capable of independent movement and can swim hundreds of meters vertically in a single day (a behavior called diel vertical migration), their horizontal position is primarily determined by the surrounding water movement, and plankton typically flow with ocean currents. This is in contrast to nekton organisms, such as fish, squid and marine mammals, which can swim against the ambient flow and control their position in the environment.\\r\\nWithin the plankton, holoplankton spend their entire life cycle as plankton (e.g. most algae, copepods, salps, and some jellyfish). By contrast, meroplankton are only planktic for part of their lives (usually the larval stage), and then graduate to either a nektic (swimming) or benthic (sea floor) existence. Examples of meroplankton include the larvae of sea urchins, starfish, crustaceans, marine worms, and most fish.[6]\\r\\nPlankton abundance and distribution are strongly dependent on factors such as ambient nutrient concentrations, the physical state of the water column, and the abundance of other plankton.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe study of plankton is termed planktology and a planktonic individual is referred to as a plankter.[7] The adjective planktonic is widely used in both the scientific and popular literature, and is a generally accepted term. However, from the standpoint of prescriptive grammar, the less commonly used planktic is more strictly the correct adjective. When deriving English words from their Greek or Latin roots, the gender-specific ending (in this case \\"-on,\\" which indicates the word is neuter) is normally dropped, using only the root of the word in the derivation.[8]\\r\\nPlankton are primarily divided into broad functional (or trophic level) groups:\\r\\nThis scheme divides the plankton community into broad producer, consumer and recycler groups. However, determining the trophic level of many plankton is not always straightforward. For example, although most dinoflagellates are either photosynthetic producers or heterotrophic consumers, many species perform both roles. In this mixed trophic strategy  known as mixotrophy  organisms act as both producers and consumers, either at the same time or switching between modes of nutrition in response to ambient conditions. For instance, relying on photosynthesis for growth when nutrients and light are abundant, but switching to predation when growing conditions are poor. Recognition of the importance of mixotrophy as an ecological strategy is increasing,[10] as well as the wider role this may play in marine biogeochemistry.[11]\\r\\nPlankton are also often described in terms of size.[12] Usually the following divisions are used:\\r\\nHowever, some of these terms may be used with very different boundaries, especially on the larger end. The existence and importance of nano- and even smaller plankton was only discovered during the 1980s, but they are thought to make up the largest proportion of all plankton in number and diversity.\\r\\nThe microplankton and smaller groups are microorganisms and operate at low Reynolds numbers, where the viscosity of water is much more important than its mass or inertia. [13]\\r\\nPlankton inhabit oceans, seas, lakes, ponds. Local abundance varies horizontally, vertically and seasonally. The primary cause of this variability is the availability of light. All plankton ecosystems are driven by the input of solar energy (but see chemosynthesis), confining primary production to surface waters, and to geographical regions and seasons having abundant light.\\r\\nA secondary variable is nutrient availability. Although large areas of the tropical and sub-tropical oceans have abundant light, they experience relatively low primary production because they offer limited nutrients such as nitrate, phosphate and silicate. This results from large-scale ocean circulation and water column stratification. In such regions, primary production usually occurs at greater depth, although at a reduced level (because of reduced light).\\r\\nDespite significant macronutrient concentrations, some ocean regions are unproductive (so-called HNLC regions).[14] The micronutrient iron is deficient in these regions, and adding it can lead to the formation of phytoplankton blooms.[15] Iron primarily reaches the ocean through the deposition of dust on the sea surface. Paradoxically, oceanic areas adjacent to unproductive, arid land thus typically have abundant phytoplankton (e.g., the eastern Atlantic Ocean, where trade winds bring dust from the Sahara Desert in north Africa).\\r\\nWhile plankton are most abundant in surface waters, they live throughout the water column. At depths where no primary production occurs, zooplankton and bacterioplankton instead consume organic material sinking from more productive surface waters above. This flux of sinking material, so-called marine snow, can be especially high following the termination of spring blooms.\\r\\nAside from representing the bottom few levels of a food chain that supports commercially important fisheries, plankton ecosystems play a role in the biogeochemical cycles of many important chemical elements, including the ocean's carbon cycle.[16]\\r\\nPrimarily by grazing on phytoplankton, zooplankton provide carbon to the planktic foodweb, either respiring it to provide metabolic energy, or upon death as biomass or detritus. Organic material tends to be denser than seawater, so it sinks into open ocean ecosystems away from the coastlines, transporting carbon along with it. This process, called the biological pump, is one reason that oceans constitute the largest carbon sink on Earth.\\r\\nIt might be possible to increase the ocean's uptake of carbon dioxide (CO\\r\\n2) generated through human activities by increasing plankton production through seeding, primarily with the micronutrient iron. However, this technique may not be practical at a large scale. Ocean oxygen depletion and resultant methane production (caused by the excess production remineralising at depth) is one potential drawback.[17][18]\\r\\nPhytoplankton absorb energy from the Sun and nutrients from the water to produce their own nourishment or energy. In the process of photosynthesis, phytoplankton release molecular oxygen (O\\r\\n2) into the water as a waste biproduct. It is estimated that about 50% of the world's oxygen is produced via phytoplankton photosynthesis.[19] The rest is produced via photosynthesis on land by plants.[19] Furthermore, phytoplankton photosynthesis has controlled the atmospheric CO\\r\\n2/O\\r\\n2 balance since the early Precambrian Eon.[20]\\r\\nThe growth of phytoplankton populations is dependent on light levels and nutrient availability. The chief factor limiting growth varies from region to region in the world's oceans. On a broad scale, growth of phytoplankton in the oligotrophic tropical and subtropical gyres is generally limited by nutrient supply, while light often limits phytoplankton growth in subarctic gyres. Environmental variability at multiple scales influences the nutrient and light available for phytoplankton, and as these organisms form the base of the marine food web, this variability in phytoplankton growth influences higher trophic levels. For example, at interannual scales phytoplankton levels temporarily plummet during El Ni?o periods, influencing populations of zooplankton, fishes, sea birds, and marine mammals.\\r\\nThe effects of anthropogenic warming on the global population of phytoplankton is an area of active research. Changes in the vertical stratification of the water column, the rate of temperature-dependent biological reactions, and the atmospheric supply of nutrients are expected to have important impacts on future phytoplankton productivity.[21] Additionally, changes in the mortality of phytoplankton due to rates of zooplankton grazing may be significant.\\r\\nFreshly hatched fish larvae are also plankton for a few days, as long as it takes before they can swim against currents.\\r\\nAn amphipod: an exoskeletoned animal with curved body, with two long and two short antennae.\\r\\nA copepod (Calanoida sp.) from Antarctica ca. 12 mm long, photo of translucent ovoid animal with two long antennae\\r\\nAntarctic krill, probably the largest biomass of a single species on the planet\\r\\nNorthern krill: the mid gut is red.

Fish rely on the density and distribution of zooplankton to match that of new larvae, which can otherwise starve. Natural factors (e.g., current variations) and man-made factors (e.g. river dams) can strongly affect zooplankton, which can in turn strongly affect larval survival, and therefore breeding success.\\r\\nThe importance of both phytoplankton and zooplankton is also well-recognized in extensive and semi-intensive pond fish farming. Plankton population based pond management strategies for fish rearing have been practised by traditional fish farmers for decades, illustrating the importance of plankton even in man-made environments.","input":"What are the largest members of the plankton?"},{"output":"activating","context":"Tubocurarine (also known as d-tubocurarine or DTC) is a toxic alkaloid historically known for its use as an arrow poison. In the mid-1900s, it was used in conjunction with an anesthetic to provide skeletal muscle relaxation during surgery or mechanical ventilation. It is now rarely used as an adjunct for clinical anesthesia because safer alternatives, such as cisatracurium and rocuronium, are available.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTubocurarine is a naturally occurring mono-quaternary alkaloid obtained from the bark of the South American plant Chondrodendron tomentosum, a climbing vine known to the European world since the Spanish conquest of South America. Curare had been used as a source of arrow poison by South American natives to hunt animals, and they were able to eat the animals' contaminated flesh subsequently without any adverse effects because tubocurarine cannot easily cross mucous membranes.Thus, tubocurarine is effective only if given parenterally, as demonstrated by Bernard, who also showed that the site of its action was at the neuromuscular junction.[1] Virchow and Munter confirmed the paralyzing action was limited to voluntary muscles.[2]\\r\\nThe word \\"curare\\" comes from the South American Indian name for the arrow poison, ourare. Presumably, the initial syllable was pronounced with a heavy glottal stop. Tubocurarine is so-called because the plant samples containing the curare were stored and shipped to Europe in tubes.[citation needed] Likewise, curare stored in calabash containers was called calabash curare.\\r\\nGriffith and Johnson are credited with pioneering the formal clinical introduction of tubocurarine as an adjunct to anesthetic practice on 23 January 1942, at the Montreal Homeopathic Hospital.[3] In this sense, tubocurarine is the prototypical adjunctive neuromuscular non-depolarizing agent. However, others before Griffith and Johnson had attempted use of tubocurarine in several situations:[4][5][6] some under controlled study conditions[7][8] while others not quite controlled and remained unpublished.[9] Regardless, all in all some 30,000 patients had been given tubocurarine by 1941, although it was Griffith and Johnson's 1942 publication[3] that provided the impetus to the standard use of neuromuscular blocking agents in clinical anesthestic practice ÿ a revolution that rapidly metamorphosized into the standard practice of \\"balanced\\" anesthesia: the triad of barbiturate hypnosis, light inhalational anesthesia and muscle relaxation.[10] The technique as described by Gray and Halton was widely known as the \\"Liverpool technique\\",[10] and became the standard anesthetic technique in England in the 1950s and 1960s for patients of all ages and physical status. Present clinical anesthetic practice still employs the central principle of balanced anesthesia though with some differences to accommodate subsequent technological advances and introductions of new and better gaseous anesthetic, hypnotic and neuromuscular blocking agents, and tracheal intubation, as well as monitoring techniques that were nonexistent in the day of Gray and Halton: pulse oximetry, capnography, peripheral nerve stimulation, noninvasive blood pressure monitoring, etc.\\r\\nStructurally, tubocurarine is a benzylisoquinoline derivative. For many years, its structure, when first elucidated in 1948,[11] was wrongly thought to be bis-quaternary: in other words, it was thought to be an N,N-dimethylated alkaloid. In 1970, the correct structure was finally established,[12] showing one of the two nitrogens to be tertiary, actually a mono-N-methylated alkaloid.\\r\\nTubocurarine biosynthesis involves a radical coupling of the two enantiomers of N-methylcoclaurine. (R) and (S)-N-methylcoclaurine come from a Mannich-like reaction between dopamine and 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde, facilitated by norcoclaurine synthase (NCS). Both dopamine and 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde originate from L-tyrosine. Methylation of the amine and hydroxyl substituents are facilitated by S-adenosyl methionine (SAM). One methyl group is present on each nitrogen atom prior to the radical coupling. The additional methyl group is transferred to form tubocurarine, with its single quaternary N,N-dimethylamino group.[13]\\r\\nWithout intervention, acetylcholine (ACh) in the peripheral nervous system activates skeletal muscles. Acetylcholine is produced in the body of the neuron by choline acetyltransferase and transported down the axon to the synaptic gap. Tubocurarine chloride acts as an antagonist for the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChr), meaning it blocks the receptor site from ACh.[15] This may be due to the quaternary amino structural motif found on both molecules.\\r\\nUnna et al. reported the effects of tubocurarine on humans:\\r\\n\\"Forty-five seconds after the beginning of the injection, heaviness of the eyelids and transitory diplopia were perceived. At the completion of the injection, diplopia became fixed, but could be noticed only when the subjects eyelids were raised by the operator. As curarization proceeded, it seemed to the subject as if the facial muscles, those of the tongue, pharynx, and lower jaw, the muscles of the neck and back, and the muscles of the extremities became relaxed in about that order. Accompanying the paralysis of the pharynx and the jaw muscles, inability of the subject to swallow was noted  Shortly after the injection was completed the subjects experienced a sensation of increased difficulty in breathing, as if an extra effort was necessary to maintain an adequate respiratory exchange. This sensation was present even though there was no objective evidence of impaired oxygenation or of carbon dioxide retention. It reached its maximum about five minutes after the injection, coinciding with the maximum depression of the vital capacity. In the majority of the experiments the respiratory rate was increased by about 50ÿ100 per cent the first minutes after the injection of any one of the drugs while the tidal volume decreased.\\"[16]\\r\\nTubocurarine has a time of onset of around 5 minutes which is relatively slow among neuromuscular-blocking drugs, and has a duration of action of 60 to 120 minutes.[17][18] It also causes histamine release,[19] now a recognized hallmark of the tetrahydroisioquinolinium class of neuromuscular blocking agents. Histamine release is associated with bronchospasms, hypotension, salivary secretions, making it dangerous for asthmatics, children, and those who are pregnant or lactating.[20] However, the main disadvantage in the use of tubocurarine is its significant ganglion-blocking effect,[21] that manifests as hypotension,[22] in many patients; this constitutes a relative contraindication to its use in patients with myocardial ischaemia.\\r\\nBecause of the shortcomings of tubocurare, much research effort was undertaken soon after its clinical introduction to find a suitable replacement. The efforts unleashed a multitude of compounds borne from structure-activity relations developed from the tubocurare molecule. Some key compounds that have seen clinical use are identified in the muscle relaxants template box below. Of the many tried as replacements, only a few enjoyed as much popularity as tubocurarine: pancuronium, vecuronium, rocuronium, atracurium, and cisatracurium. Succinylcholine is a widely used muscle relaxant drug which acts by activating, instead of blocking, the ACh receptor.\\r\\nThe potassium channel blocker tetraethylammonium (TEA) has been shown to reverse the effects of tubocurarine. It is thought to do so by increasing ACh release, which counteracts the antagonistic effects of tubocurarine on the ACh receptor.\\r\\nSpiders of the genus Latrodectus have ϫ-latrotoxin in their venom. The most well known spider in this genus is the black widow spider. ϫ-latrotoxin causes the release of neurotransmitters into the synaptic gap, including acetylcholine.[23] Bites are usually not fatal, but do cause a significant amount of pain in addition to muscle spasms. The venom is the most damaging to nerve endings, but the introduction of d-tubocurarine chloride blocks the nAChr, alleviating pain and muscle spasms while an antivenom can be administered.[24]\\r\\nAn individual administered tubocurarine chloride will be unable to move any voluntary muscles, including the diaphragm. A large enough dose will therefore result in death from respiratory failure unless artificial ventilation is initiated. The LD50 for mice and rabbits are 0.13?mg/kg and 0.146?mg/kg intravenously, respectively.It releases histamine and cause hypotension.[25]","input":"How does d-tubocurarine act as a muscle relaxant?"},{"output":"in the 9th and 10th centuries","context":"","input":"When was the first castle built in the world?"},{"output":"Pescetarianism","context":"Pescetarianism (/?p?sk??t??ri?n?z?m/; also spelled pescatarianism)[1] is the practice of following a diet that includes fish or other seafood, but not the flesh of other animals.\\r\\nThose on pescetarian or pollotarian diets may define meat only as mammalian flesh and may identify with vegetarianism.[2][3] Most pescetarians maintain a lacto-ovo vegetarian diet with the addition of fish and shellfish, described as \\"fish but no other meat\\".[4] The common use association between such diets and vegetarianism has led groups such as the Vegetarian Society to state that diets containing these ingredients are not vegetarian.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\"Pescetarian\\" or \\"pescatarian\\" is a neologism formed as a portmanteau of the Latin word piscis (\\"fish\\") and the English word \\"vegetarian\\".[6][7][8][9][10][11][12] The English pronunciation of both \\"pescetarian\\" and \\"pescatarian\\" is /?p?sk??t??ri?n/, with the same [sk] sound present in pescato (Italian:?[pe?ska?to],[13][14] derived from piscatus, the perfect passive participle of the Latin verb piscor meaning \\"to fish\\"), though not in the word pesce (Italian:?[?pe??e]).\\r\\nPesce in turn derives from the Latin piscis,[9][10] which has the form pisci- when it serves as a prefix, as it often does in scholarly terms (e.g. \\"pisciculture\\", \\"piscivore\\"). A piscivore, a type of carnivore, subsists on a diet primarily of fish, whereas a pescetarian eats plant derivatives as well as fish. A similar term for the latter is \\"vegequarian\\".\\r\\nThe Merriam-Webster dictionary dates the origin of the term pescatarian to 1993 and defines it as: \\"one whose diet includes fish but no other meat\\".[9]\\r\\nSome pescetarians adopt their diet because of the inefficiency of other meat sources. For example, in the United States most cattle, chickens and pork were not free-range and fed with grains specifically grown for their food.[15] Therefore, the environmental impact and the amount of energy needed to feed a cow, a chicken or a pig greatly exceeds its nutritional value.[15] Such pescetarians might prefer to eat wild-caught fish, as opposed to farmed carnivorous fish that require food input of other fish. They might use guides such as the Seafood Watch to determine the sustainability of their seafood source.[15]\\r\\nOther pescetarians might regard their diet as a transition to vegetarianism, an ethical compromise (ethical pescetarianism),[16] or a practical necessity to obtain nutrients absent or not easily found in plants.[17]\\r\\nFurthermore, pescetarianism may be percived as more ethical because fish, along with certain other animals such as insects, may not associate pain and fear as more complex animals like mammals do.[18][19] Researchers find that unlike humans, fish do not have the neuro-physiological capacity for a conscious awareness of pain. Fish do not possess a neocortex, which is the first indicator of doubt regarding whether they have pain-awareness. In other words, certain nerve fibres in mammals (known as c-nociceptors) involved in the sensation of intense experiences of pain are not present in primitive cartilaginous fish. In many bony fish, some do contain traces, such as in sharks and rays, yet there is a complete lack of development in these fibres. To test this, painkillers such as morphine that are effective for humans were given to fish and were either ineffective or were only effective in astronomically high doses that would have meant immediate death from shock. In this respect, although fish do of course show reactions to injuries and other interventions, the physiological prerequisites for the conscious experience of pain is not present. This, in combination with the pharmacological data, has supported the notion that fish have absolutely no awareness of pain in human or biological terms.[18][19]\\r\\nOne commonly cited reason is that of health,[20] based on findings that red meat is detrimental to health in many cases due to non-lean red meats containing high amounts of saturated fats,[21][22] choline and carnitine.[23] Eating certain kinds of fish raises HDL levels,[24][25] and some fish are a convenient source of omega-3 fatty acids,[26] and have numerous health benefits in one food variety.[27]\\r\\nA 1999 meta-analysis of five studies comparing vegetarian and non-vegetarian mortality rates in Western countries found that in comparison with regular meat-eaters, mortality from ischemic heart disease was 34% lower in pescetarians, 34% lower in ovo-lacto vegetarians, 26% lower in vegans and 20% lower in occasional meat-eaters.[28]\\r\\nConcerns have been raised about consuming some fish varieties containing toxins such as mercury and PCBs,[29] though it is possible to select fish that contain little or no mercury and moderate the consumption of mercury-containing fish.[30][31]\\r\\nPescetarianism (provided the fish is ruled kosher ÿ i.e., fish with fins and scales, and usually caught without bloodshed, as well as having no worms or insects inside; cut with a kosher knife and cooked in kosher utensils) conforms to Jewish dietary laws, as kosher fish is \\"pareve\\" (or \\"parve\\") ÿ neither 'milk' nor 'meat'. In some Sephardic Jewish homes, fish is never served with foods made with milk products. All non-fish seafood is non-kosher.[32]. Mammalian 'fish' such as dolphins and whales, as well as Elasmobranchii such as sharks and stingrays, are not kosher because they have dermal denticles and not bony-fish scales. The definition of a fish in Judaism is broader (sea-life) than the common usage of the term 'fish' (non-mammals).\\r\\nIn 2015, a member of the Liberal Judaism synagogue in Manchester founded The Pescetarian Society.[33]\\r\\nBy tradition, most Hindu Brahmin communities follow a strict lacto-vegetarian diet. However, there are a number of Brahmin sub-groups that allow fish eating. These include the Goud Saraswat Brahmin community from Coastal South-Western India.[34] This community regards seafood in general as vegetables from the sea. They refrain from eating any land-based animals. Other Hindu communities who consume seafood in great quantity are the Maithili Brahmin and the Bengali Brahmin.[35] The latter also eat meat on special occasions. Among the northeast Indian Hindus of Assam, Tripura, and Manipur, it is common for pescatarians to include poultry in their diets.[citation needed]\\r\\nMuslims aren't vegetarians, but their meat has to be Halal, killed in a certain way. If they are taking food from somewhere that doesn't serve Halal food, they take their food on a pescetarian diet, since they are allowed to eat fish.\\r\\nPescetarianism is similar to many traditional diets emphasizing fish as well as fruits, vegetables, grains, nuts, seeds, edible fungi, legumes, bread etc. Many coastal populations tend to eat this way. In common with some vegetarians, pescetarians often eat eggs, dairy products and packaged foods in addition to fruits, vegetables and grains.[citation needed]\\r\\nPescetarians are sometimes described as vegetarian or pesco-vegetarian, but vegetarians commonly do not consider the pescetarian diet to be vegetarian. The Vegetarian Society ÿ whose members historically did not object to the consumption of \\"eggs, milk or fish\\"[36] ÿ now does not consider pescetarianism to be a vegetarian diet.[5] Despite this, definitions of vegetarian in mainstream dictionaries sometimes include fish in the diet.[37] The Pescetarian Society evolved separately from The Vegetarian Society to better represent the lifestyle and interests of pescetarians.[33]","input":"What is a person who only eats fish and vegetables?"},{"output":"to reunify China","context":"Victory for the National Revolutionary Army\\r\\n Nationalist Government\\r\\n Beiyang Government\\r\\nThe Northern Expedition was a military campaign launched by the National Revolutionary Army of the Kuomintang (KMT), also known as the Nationalists, against the Beiyang government and other regional warlords in 1926. The purpose of the campaign was to reunify China, and the expedition was divided into two phases. The first phase was interrupted by the political split in the Kuomintang following the formation of the Nanjing faction in April 1927 against the existing faction in Wuhan.[1] The split was partially motivated by the purge of the Communists within the party, which marked the end of the First United Front, and Chiang Kai-shek briefly stepped down as the commander of the National Revolutionary Army.[2]\\r\\nThe campaign was resumed in January 1928 with the return of Chiang to the commanding post, and the Nationalist forces advanced to the Yellow River by April 1928. Strings of victories by the Nationalists toward Peking, with the assistance of allied warlords including Yan Xishan and Feng Yuxiang, forced Zhang Zuolin of the Fengtian clique out of the capital city.[3] Zhang was assassinated shortly after by the Kwantung Army on his way back to Manchuria, and his son Zhang Xueliang took over as the leader of the Fengtian clique. In June 1928, Zhang Xueliang announced Manchuria would be accepting the authority of the Nationalist government in Nanjing, effectively ending the Northern Expedition.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSince the Constitutional Protection Movement ended in 1922, the Kuomintang (KMT) had been expanding in Guangdong to prepare for an expedition against the Northern warlords in Peking and reunifying China.[4] The preparation required improving both the political and military strength of the KMT. Before his death in March 1925, Sun Yat-sen was supportive of Sino-Soviet cooperation, which involved forming the First United Front with the Communist Party of China (CPC).[5] The Whampoa Military Academy was opened in 1924, with Chiang Kai-shek appointed as the commandant, having emerged as the protg of Sun since 1922.[6]\\r\\nOn 30 May 1925, Chinese students in Shanghai, supported by the KMT, gathered together and held anti-foreign demonstrations in the International Settlement.[7] The movement sparked popular unrest throughout the country. Chiang emerged from the party ranks in the KMT as the paramount leader, and consolidated his power further through the Canton Coup, in which several top Communist leaders in the KMT were arrested between 18 and 19 March 1926.[8]\\r\\nImmediately prior to the expedition, there were three major coalition of warlords across China that were hostile toward the Kuomintang. The forces of Wu Peifu occupied Hubei, Henan and northern Hunan province. The coalition of Sun Chuanfang was in control of Fujian, Zhejiang, Jiangsu, Anhui and Jiangxi province. The most powerful coalition were led by Zhang Zuolin, head of the Beiyang government and the Zhili clique, in control of Manchuria, Shandong and Hebei province.[9]\\r\\nOn 9 July 1926, the Kuomintang ceremonially appointed Chiang Kai-shek as the commander of the National Revolutionary Army (NRA), which officially launched the expedition.[10] In a military conference at Changsha on 11 August, the Nationalists decided bypass Nanchang and attack Wuchang straight away. The warlord defense led by Wu Peifu collapsed on 31 August in which Wu only narrowly fled, and the revolutionary forces reached the heavily fortified Wuchang on 31 August. The city garrison surrendered on 10 October after more than a month of military blockade, and the NRA had secured the Hubei province as Wu and his remaining troops fled to Henan.[11] The NRA then diverted their forces toward the territories of Sun Chuanfang, which included both Nanchang and Jiujiang in Jiangxi, capturing both provinces in the process. On 18 December, He Yingqin led two divisions of the NRA and captured Fuzhou, the provincial capital of Fujian.[12] In the short span of six months, the Nationalists had expanded to seven provinces, controlling a population of \\"approximately 170 million\\".[12] Sun Chuanfang retreated to Nanjing in the aftermath of major setbacks.[13] The Fengtian clique responded to the request for help from Sun by reinforcing Jiangsu and Anhui, while increasing the number of troops in Henan in support of Wu Peifu. The NRA was able to defeat the alliance, and on 23 March 1927, the Nationalist forces marched into Nanjing.[14]\\r\\nAs part of the alliance, many members of the Communist Party joined the Kuomintang and exerted significant influence over the left wing faction of the KMT. Between 12 to 14 April, hundreds of Communists in Shanghai were arrested and killed by the order of Chiang, effectively ending the alliance between the Nationalists and the Communists.[15] The purge was condemned by the left wing faction of the KMT led by Wang Jingwei in Wuhan, and this led to the internal split between the KMT based in Wuhan and the KMT based in Nanjing.[16]\\r\\nThe Northern Expedition was temporarily put on hold after the capture of Nanjing. Chiang Kai-shek proposed to several top KMT officials in Wuhan to \\"discuss party unity\\".[17] To \\"heal the rift\\" between the Nanjing and Wuhan factions, Chiang offered to voluntarily step down from his leadership role, allegedly influenced by Bai Chongxi.[18] Wang Jingwei, having recently returned to China, took the leadership role in the Wuhan faction and began purging Communist members of the KMT in Wuhan. The CPC responded by staging several successful attacks that politically and militarily weakened the KMT in Wuhan significantly, notably in Nanchang.[19]\\r\\nThe chaos in the immediate aftermath of the Communist purge in April allowed Sun to regroup and began launching new offensives with Zhang Zongchang.[20] With the Nationalists fighting the war on two fronts, Sun was able to attack and recapture Xuzhou on 24 July.[19] However, Sun's forces were decisively defeated by the NRA on 30 August in battles around Longtan, and Sun ended up having \\"escaped\\" north of the Yangtze River.[21] The Nationalist forces continued to advance northwards and recaptured Xuzhou on 16 August.[22] With the military success of Chiang's Whampoa troops, the factions within the KMT agreed to recognize the legitimacy of Chiang's leadership and the Nanjing government as long as their regional sphere of influence continues to be permitted. Consequently, Chiang soon returned to the commanding post in January 1928.[22]\\r\\nWith Chiang returning as the commander, the expedition was soon to be resumed. The Nationalist summer offensives of 1927 recaptured most of the territories lost to the warlords during the hiatus. Facing the Nationalist advance, Zhang Zuolin assembled the \\"National Pacification Army\\" known as Anguojun to defend against the National Revolutionary Army. By April 1928, the Nationalist forces have reached the Yellow River, threatening Peking directly.\\r\\nAs the NRA was passing by Shandong province in May, the Imperial Japanese Army stationed in Jinan intervened on 3 May, violently killed NRA representative Cai Gongshi and other Chinese diplomats from the KMT, while opened fire and killed \\"approximately five thousand\\" Chinese civilians. This armed conflict is what came to be known as the Jinan Incident.[23][24]\\r\\nIn the meanwhile, Shanxi warlord Yan Xishan decided to change side to form an alliance with the Nationalists and began marching toward Peking.[25] Combined with the recent announcement that Japan will recognize the legitimacy of the Nationalists as the representative of China, Zhang Zuolin decided to retreat, but he was assassinated on his way back to Manchuria by operatives from the Japanese Kwantung Army in the Huanggutun Incident.[3] Zhang Xueliang succeeded as the new leader of the Fengtian clique, and he declared his allegiance to the Nationalist government in Nanjing on June 1936, marking the official end of the Northern Expedition.[26]\\r\\nWhile the reunification of China was achieved on the surface, the country \\"remain divided alone regional lines\\". After the capture of Peking, Chiang held a conference with Feng Yuxiang, Yan Xishan, Bai Chongxi and Li Zongren in July 1928.[27] As Chiang attempted to cut back the military and centralize the power of the Nationalist government in Nanjing, the regional warlords, with their military strengths largely preserved, quickly renounced their allegiance to Chiang and formed an alliance against the Kuomintang.[26] The struggle for supremacy soon broke out into the Central Plains War in 1930.[28] Although Chiang emerged once again as the paramount leader of China with his decisive victory in the war, the problem of both regionalism and warlordism continued to persist in the KMT, and these problems played a significant role in the Chinese Civil War.\\r\\nThe Northern Expedition in China became a point of contention over foreign policy between Joseph Stalin and Leon Trotsky in the Soviet Union. Stalin was an opportunist, willing to overlook party ideology when necessary. He encouraged the CCP to cooperate with the KMT on multiple occasions, as Stalin believed the KMT was more capable of completing the Chinese revolution. Trotsky was opposed to the KMT as he believed the party was against the concept of proletarian revolution. The Comintern was in support of Stalin's decision to financially support the KMT.[29]","input":"What was the intent of the northern expedition?"},{"output":"Maxwell Air Force Base","context":"Officer Training School (OTS) is a United States Air Force commissioning program located at Maxwell Air Force Base in Montgomery, Alabama. It is the current de facto Officer Candidate School (OCS) program for the U.S. Air Force, analogous to the OCS programs operated by the other branches of the U.S. armed forces.\\r\\n\\r\\nOfficer Training School is a part of the Jeanne M. Holm Center for Officer Accession and Citizen Development, formerly the Air Force Officer Accession and Training Schools (AFOATS). Named for the late Major General Jeanne M. Holm, the Holm Center falls under Air University (AU), which, in turn, falls under the Air Education and Training Command (AETC), an Air Force major command (MAJCOM).\\r\\n\\r\\nIn addition to OTS, the Holm Center also has oversight responsibilities for the Air Force Reserve Officer Training Corps (AFROTC) pre-commissioning program on U.S. colleges and universities, the Air Force Junior Reserve Officer Training Corps (AFJROTC) citizen development program in U.S. high schools, and the entire Civil Air Patrol, both its senior member program as the U.S. Air Force Auxiliary (focused on search and rescue and other emergency services and disaster support), and its aerospace education and citizen development cadet program (similar to the AFJROTC cadet program) via its HQ CAP-USAF activity.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe current Commander of the Holm Center (Holm/CC) is Brigadier General Billy D. Thompson, USAF[1] and the current Commandant of OTS (OTS/CMDT) is Colonel Peter G. Bailey, USAF.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring peacetime, OTS is usually the smallest commissioning source in the USAF, producing fewer officers per year than AFROTC and the United States Air Force Academy (USAFA). However, it possesses the capability to surge when USAF requirements dictate and exceed the combined annual officer production of both USAFA and AFROTC. Given its shorter lead time for officer production (currently 9 weeks versus the typically 4-year pre-commissioning process for USAFA and AFROTC cadets), OTS is the commissioning source used to balance out USAF officer manning as deemed necessary by the Air Force.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe number of officers commissioned through OTS fluctuates wildly as their numbers are largely influenced by the number of graduating cadets through the USAF Academy and AFROTC, as well as being the first place the Air Force cuts when they have a surplus of cadets through the other two sources. Given this reality, OTS has often surpassed USAFA officer production during wartime periods such as during the Vietnam War in the 1960s and early 1970s or the Reagan defense buildup of the 1980s.[3] Conversely, OTS can be hard to get into during years of contraction within the national defense establishment in general and the Air Force in particular, such as the mid and late 1970s following the end of the Vietnam War and associated USAF force structure reductions or the post-Cold War era and its associated defense reductions of the early and mid-1990s.[4][5] During these periods of contractions, OTS produces few officers, making selection for the OTS program particularly difficult and competitive for college graduates, especially those with no prior enlisted service, particularly USAF enlisted service.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nOTS is divided into two parallel programs:\\r\\n\\r\\nTotal Force Officer Training (TFOT) is the more traditional 8-week pre-commissioning program. Previously a 13-week program later reduced to 10 weeks, the re-named TFOT track transitioned to a 9-week program in 2014 and the legacy system of Officer Trainees (OT) being designated as lower classmen in the early part of the program and upper classmen in the latter part, similar to their USAFA and AFROTC counterparts, was eliminated. This was further reduced to the current 8-week program in 2017 by removing the Total Force Indoctrination Training (TFIT) from the first week of the course in which Military Training Instructors (MTIs) would teach the customs and standards of the Air Force as well as the basics of marching and drill and ceremonies. Officer Trainees were also re-designated as Cadets in 2015, again on par with USAFA and AFROTC and reminiscent of the Aviation Cadet program in operation in USAF and its predecessor incarnations (e.g., USAAS, USAAC, USAAF, etc.) from 1907 until 1965. TFOT is for 4-year university and college graduates without prior military service (commonly known as non-prior service), as well as Active Component enlisted, Air Force Reserve enlisted, Air National Guard enlisted and former enlisted personnel from any of the five U.S. armed services with college degrees at the baccalaureate level degree or higher who wish to become Air Force officers. TFOT serves all Active Component and Reserve Component line officers except judge advocates.\\r\\n\\r\\nCommissioned Officer Training (COT) is a 5-week program, primarily focused on terminal-degreed professionals (e.g., medical, lawyers, chaplains, as well as undergraduate degreed nurses) directly accessed into the USAF officer ranks. COT serves all Regular Air Force, Air Force Reserve and Air National Guard non-line officers and judge advocates who did not previously serve as line officers in other career fields or who were not commissioned via USAFA or AFROTC.\\r\\n\\r\\nInterested applicants for OTS typically contact Air Force recruiters specializing in officer (versus enlisted) accessions. Recruiters will screen candidates, provide application details and schedule applicants for the Air Force Officer Qualifying Test (AFOQT). The AFOQT covers numerous test batteries assessing math, verbal, and analytical skills, as well as measuring pilot and navigator/combat systems officer potential for those applicants aspiring to be aeronautically rated officers. AFOQT scores, college GPA, previous enlisted performance evaluations if a current or former enlisted member, and, if applicable, previous pilot skills as either an FAA-certified civilian pilot and/or as a U.S. Army warrant officer / Army Aviator will all figure into the selection process, although the selection process strives to employ a composite or \\"whole person\\" approach.\\r\\n\\r\\nOTS applicants will be given an opportunity to apply for Air Force career fields that correspond with the applicants' expertise and/or desires and will be interviewed by active duty Air Force officers as well as receive a military medical examination for flying or non-flying duty as appropriate. Applicants will then be screened by a centralized, periodic, OTS Selection Board conducted by the Air Force Recruiting Service, a component of the Air Education and Training Command.[6] Applicants will be notified of acceptance or rejection by their recruiter pending release of the board results.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf not already on active duty as enlisted personnel in the armed forces, selectees for OTS will subsequently enlist in the Air Force Reserve via the Delayed Enlistment Program and will be assigned an OTS class date. Non-prior service college graduates will enlist in the rank of Airman 1st Class (E-3) while prior service enlisted personnel will be enlisted in their current or highest prior pay grade. Upon arrival at OTS, all personnel will be advanced to pay grade E-5 (unless prior enlisted already holding a higher pay grade), but will hold the rank of Cadet versus USAF Staff Sergeant.\\r\\n\\r\\nOTS is highly competitive, with selection rates varying dependent on the needs of the Air Force. For example, boards conducted circa 2010 - 2012 had selection rates in the 20% range due to budgetary reductions / force reductions being imposed on the Air Force at that time. However, by 2017, selection rates had increased to the 65% range or greater, reflecting the increased commissioned officer needs of the service.[7][8]\\r\\n\\r\\nPer Air Force Instruction (AFI) 36-2013, personnel attending Total Force Officer Training must have a baccalaureate level degree or higher[9] in either technical or non-technical fields. Technical fields may include any ABET-accredited engineering degree or other fields in high demand by the Air Force. Non-technical degrees are more common, and therefore applying with a degree in such a field is very competitive. Applicants can apply for aeronautically rated or non-rated Line Officer of the Air Force (LAF) positions. Rated positions are flying related -- Pilot, Combat Systems Officer (previously known as Navigator), Remotely-Piloted Aircraft (RPA) Pilot, or Air Battle Manager. Non-rated positions fall into two categories: non-rated operations, such as missiles, intelligence, space, cyber, or weather, and non-rated support, such as aircraft maintenance, missile maintenance, logistics, civil engineer, security forces, or communications.\\r\\n\\r\\nAreas of instruction at OTS include military customs and courtesies, military history, Air Force traditions and culture, leadership, field exercises, drill and ceremonies, small arms training, and combatives.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first few weeks of training are geared toward orienting the cadet with Air Force standards. The focus is on physical training, drill and ceremonies, and academics. Cadets will be expected to work with their fellow flight and squadron members to accomplish specific tasks as required by their Flight Commander and the Cadet Wing. They will also attend multiple classes in an academic environment. Later in the program they will attend field training exercises, projects, small arms training, and building team skills by overcoming challenges in a simulated deployment environment.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo graduate, cadets must meet or exceed physical standards, academic standards, and military bearing standards. Military bearing includes the ability to write and verbally brief, lead the flight, and perform duties within the Cadet Wing.\\r\\n\\r\\nUpon graduation, OTS graduates may receive either Regular or Reserve commissions as Second Lieutenants in the Regular United States Air Force, the Air Force Reserve, or the Air National Guard, as appropriate to their original source of entry and contract. The new second lieutenants will be appointed in either pay grade O-1, or O-1E if they have prior cumulative active service as a warrant officer or as an enlisted servicemember in any branch or component of the U.S. armed forces for at least 4 years and 1 day. If any portion of their prior service was in a reserve component and not served in an active duty status, then inactive duty reserve retirement points may be used to qualify for O-1E. If the combination of creditable active duty days and inactive duty points equals 1,460 (equivalent to exactly 4 years and 1 day of cumulative qualifying active and inactive duty), the pay grade O-1E is assigned, which is a significantly higher starting basic pay level than O-1, and remains higher until promoted to O-4.[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nCOT is a 5-week course for professionals who have received a direct commission. Typically, these officers have degrees, such as MDiv, MD, DO,  DPM, OD, DDS, DMD, PharmD, Physician Assistant PA-C PhD, PsyD, BSN or MSN, MSW, or JD, in the case of chaplains, physicians, physician assistant, podiatrists, optometrists, dentists, pharmacists, psychologists, nurses, social workers, and lawyers, respectively. They often enter at an advanced rank, such as First Lieutenant (O-2) and sometimes as Captain (O-3) in compensation for their higher levels of education, and in some cases, experience. Officers can be commissioned up to the rank of Colonel (O-6) if they possess the level of experience necessary.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith the exception of those officers previously commissioned as line officers through USAFA, AFROTC, and the BOT program of OTS, or the Air Force Nurse program of AFROTC, most chaplains, judge advocates general (i.e., lawyers), and medical personnel go through COT.\\r\\n\\r\\nCommissioned Officer Training (COT) is responsible for developing medical, legal, and chaplain personnel into professional officers by instilling character, knowledge, and motivation essential to serve in the United States Air Force. The 23rd Training Squadron (23 TRS) provides a 23-training day Commissioned Officer Training course to instill leadership and officership skills in newly commissioned medical officers, judge advocates, and chaplains. The 23 TRS also conducts a 13-training day Reserve Commissioned Officer Training (RCOT) program for hard-to-recruit medical officers in the Air Force Reserve and Air National Guard.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the Aviation Cadet (AvCad) Program proved insufficient to meet wartime commissioned officer requirements, the United States Army Air Forces established the Officer Candidate School (OCS) on 23 February 1942 at Miami Beach, Florida,[11] its mission being to train and commission members from the enlisted ranks.\\r\\n\\r\\nOCS moved to the San Antonio Aviation Cadet Center (now Lackland AFB), Texas, in 1944 and gained the additional mission of training officers directly from civilian status in September 1951.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nOTS was organized at Lackland AFB, Texas, in November 1959, with the first OTS class (60-A) composed of 89 officer trainees, including 11 women, who graduated and were commissioned as 2nd Lieutenants on 9 February 1960. The number of OTS graduates has varied over the years, from 323 the first year to a high of 7,894 officers in 1967.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nWith the establishment of OTS, Air Force OCS closed its doors and conducted its last graduation in June 1963. Concurrently, the Air Force also commenced a phaseout of its long-standing Aviation Cadet (AvCad) Program at Lackland AFB. Unlike OTS, AvCad was limited to pilot and navigator candidates. In addition, AvCads had to successfully complete either undergraduate pilot training or undergraduate navigator training before they could be commissioned as Second Lieutenants. The last AvCad pilot was commissioned in October 1961 at the former Reese AFB, Texas, and the last AvCad navigator was commissioned in March 1965, at the former James Connally AFB, Texas.[13][14] OTS then became the sole organization for training future Air Force officers at Lackland AFB.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 1 July 1993, Air Training Command (ATC) merged with Air University (AU) to form the new Air Education and Training Command (AETC), with Air University becoming a direct reporting unit (DRU) under AETC. OTS, which was formerly under ATC, and Air Force ROTC, which was formerly under AU, were then realigned under both AETC and AU.\\r\\n\\r\\nUntil 22 September 1993, Officer Training School was located on the Medina Annex of Lackland AFB, Texas, with the last OTS class, Class 93-06, graduating from that location on that date. During the spring and summer of 1993, OTS gradually relocated to Maxwell AFB, Alabama, commencing operations in interim facilities on 25 September 1993.[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nHistorically, the USAF Academy had been (and continues to be) headed by a lieutenant general and Air Force ROTC had been headed by a major general or brigadier general, while OTS had been headed by a colonel. In February 1997, in an effort to reduce duplication of effort and streamline administrative and reporting procedures within AU, AFROTC and OTS realigned under a newly created umbrella organization, Air Force Officer Accession and Training Schools (AFOATS). Under this restructuring, OTS and AFROTC were placed under the leadership of individual USAF colonels (AFJROTC and CAP were also placed under individual USAF colonels), while general officer oversight for both OTS and AFROTC, representing three-quarters of Air Force officer production, was placed under one command, the AFOATS commander, a brigadier general.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the late 1990s, a $52 million military construction (MILCON) project commenced to build a new, dedicated OTS campus at Maxwell AFB to replace the interim facilities initially occupied in late 1993. The majority of this MILCON project was completed in 2001 and all projects relating to the Maxwell AFB OTS campus were completed by 2004.[15] AFROTC, which had previously conducted its summer Field Training (FT) program for their cadets between their sophomore and junior academic years at various air force bases around the United States, also consolidated its summer FT program at the OTS facilities at Maxwell AFB circa 2008.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs part of another organizational restructuring of AU, AFOATS was later renamed the Jeanne M. Holm Center for Officer Accession and Citizen Development, while still retaining oversight of OTS, Air Force ROTC, Air Force Junior ROTC, and the Civil Air Patrol.","input":"Where is the air force officer training school?"},{"output":"September 23, 2010 and concluded on May 19, 2011","context":"The seventh season of the American television comedy The Office premiered on September 23, 2010 and concluded on May 19, 2011 on NBC.

Club commented that, while he felt that the season was uneven, it was a \\"distinct improvement over season six,\\" claiming Carell's exit gave the show a \\"sense of focus that was absent last year.\\"[34] James Poniewozik of Time called the season \\"mixed at best\\" and that the best episodes of the season \\"played almost like a series of vignettes and set pieces that allowed the characters to just be.\\"[35] He ended with saying it was an improvement over the sixth season and that he generally enjoyed the season overall.[35]\\r\\nDuring the seventh season, The Office received two award nominations at the 2011 Writers Guild of America Awards. Aaron Shure was nominated in Episodic Comedy category for writing the episode, \\"WUPHF.com\\", and the series was nominated for Best Comedy Series.[36] The series was also nominated for Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Comedy Series for the 17th Screen Actors Guild Awards.[37] Steve Carell was nominated for four comedic acting awards, at the 17th Screen Actors Guild Awards, 68th Golden Globe Awards, 37th People's Choice Awards and the 2010 Satellite Awards.[38][39][40] At the 1st Critics' Choice Television Awards, the series was nominated for Best Comedy Series, while Steve Carell was nominated for Best Actor in a Comedy Series.[41] For the 63rd Primetime Emmy Awards, the series received four nominationsfor Outstanding Comedy series, Steve Carell for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series, Greg Daniels for Outstanding Writing for a Comedy Series for \\"Goodbye, Michael\\", and for Outstanding Sound Mixing for a Comedy or Drama Series (Half-Hour) and Animation for \\"Andy's Play\\".[42][43]\\r\\nIn the following table, \\"U.S. viewers (million)\\" refers to the number of Americans who viewed the episode on the night of broadcast.

The Beauceron is also known as Berger de Beauce (sheepdog from Beauce) or  Bas Rouge (red-stockings).\\r\\n\\r\\nA French herding breed known for centuries in western Europe, the Beauceron is noted as one of the breeds used to create the Doberman Pinscher. Although quite different in appearance, the Beauceron and the long-haired sheep dog, the Briard, stem from similar ancestral stock, sharing the trait of double dewclaws on the hind legs. Both were used to herd sheep and cattle. Like the Beauceron, the Briard is found throughout northern France, and despite implications from its name, also did not come exclusively from the Brie region.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1809, Abb Rozier wrote an article on these French herding dogs, in which he described the differences in type and used the terms Berger de Brie and Berger de Beauce.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1893, the veterinarian Paul Megnin differentiated between the long-haired Berger de la Brie and the short-haired Berger de Beauce. He defined the standard of the breed, with the assistance of M. Emmanuel Ball. In 1922, the Club des Amis du Beauceron was formed under the guidance of Dr. Megnin.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2008, the Beauceron made its debut in the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show.\\r\\n\\r\\nA versatile breed, the Bas Rouge is used to both guard and herd sheep and cattle. It was once very useful against wolves, now long gone from central France. The breed served in both world wars as messenger dog, supply transport dog, land mine detection dog, search dog, police dog and rescue dog.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis breed stands 61 to 70?cm (24 to 27.5?inches) in height and weighs 30 to 45?kg (66 to 100 pounds). The Beauceron has a hard outer coat and a woolly undercoat that grows thick in cold weather, especially if the dog sleeps outdoors. Its standard colouring is black and tan (the latter colour referred to in French as rouge ecureuil, squirrel-red) or grey, black and tan called harlequin. Other colours, such as the once prevalent tawny, grey or grey/black, are now banned by the breed standard. The merle coats should have more black than gray with no white. In the black and tan dogs the tan markings appear in two dots above the eyes, on the sides of the muzzle, fading off to the cheeks, but do not reach the underside of the ears. Also on the throat, under the tail and on the legs and the chest. Tan markings on the chest should appear as two spots but a chest plate is acceptable.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough most breeds may or may not have dewclaws (many owners of other breeds remove dewclaws, especially if the dog is used for field and hunting), an important feature of the Beauceron is the double dewclaw. In order to be shown, a beauceron must have double dewclaws that form well-separated \\"thumbs\\" with nails on each rear leg; anything less will result in disqualification from dog shows.[1][2][3]\\r\\n\\r\\nEar cropping is no longer allowed in Europe.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Beauceron is known in France as a guard dog, a helper around the farm (herding sheep or cattle), and/or a ring sport dog (primarily protection training). This athletic, healthy and long-lived breed has been bred to be intelligent, calm, gentle, and fearless.[4] Adults are typically suspicious of strangers and are excellent natural guard dogs. On the other hand, they typically take their cue from their handlers when it comes to greeting strangers, and are neither sharp nor shy. They do best when raised within the family but they can sleep outside, the better to act as guards (their weatherproof coats make them ideal kennel users even in the coldest winters). They are eager learners and can be trained to a high level. However, their physical and mental development is slow, relative to other similar breeds (e.g. German and other large shepherds): they are not mentally or physically mature until the age of about three years, so their training should not be rushed. Several five- or ten-minute play-training exercises per day in the early years can achieve better results than long or rigorous training sessions.\\r\\n\\r\\nBeaucerons can compete in dog agility trials, obedience, showmanship, flyball, tracking, and herding events. Herding instincts and trainability can be measured at noncompetitive herding tests. Beaucerons exhibiting basic herding instincts can be trained to compete in herding trials.[5] They are excellent search and rescue dogs.","input":"What type of dog is bosco from marmaduke?"},{"output":"December 4, 1991","context":"","input":"When did pan american go out of business?"},{"output":"Middle East,","context":"","input":"What region of the world is israel located?"},{"output":"Mustard seed","context":"Mustard plants are any of several plant species in the genera Brassica and Sinapis in the family Brassicaceae.

Canada and Nepal are the world's major producers of mustard seed, between them accounting for around 57% of world production in 2010.[4] White mustard (Sinapis alba) is commonly used as a cover crop in Europe (between UK and Ukraine). A large number of varieties exist, e.g. in Germany, Netherlands, mainly differing in lateness of flowering and resistance against white beet-cyst nematode (Heterodera schachtii). Farmers prefer late flowering varieties, which do not produce seeds, they may become weeds in the subsequent year. Early vigour is important to cover the soil quickly and suppress weeds and protect the soil against erosion. In rotations with sugar beets, suppression of the white beet-cyst nematode is an important trait. Resistant white mustard varieties decline nematode populations by 70-90%.\\r\\n\\r\\nRecent research has studied varieties of mustards with high oil contents for use in the production of biodiesel, a renewable liquid fuel similar to diesel fuel.

(Boston Tea Party)\\r\\nThirteen Colonies\\r\\nGreat Britain\\r\\nThe Boston Tea Party was a political protest by the Sons of Liberty in Boston, Massachusetts, on December 16, 1773. The demonstrators, some disguised as Native Americans, in defiance of the Tea Act of May 10, 1773, destroyed an entire shipment of tea sent by the East India Company. They boarded the ships and threw the chests of tea into Boston Harbor. The British government responded harshly and the episode escalated into the American Revolution. The Tea Party became an iconic event of American history, and since then other political protests such as the Tea Party movement have referred to themselves as historical successors to the Boston protest of 1773.\\r\\nThe Tea Party was the culmination of a resistance movement throughout British America against the Tea Act, which had been passed by the British Parliament in 1773. Colonists objected to the Tea Act because they believed that it violated their rights as Englishmen to \\"No taxation without representation\\", that is, to be taxed only by their own elected representatives and not by a British parliament in which they were not represented. Protesters had successfully prevented the unloading of taxed tea in three other colonies, but in Boston, embattled Royal Governor Thomas Hutchinson refused to allow the tea to be returned to Britain.\\r\\nThe Boston Tea Party was a significant event in the growth of the American Revolution. Parliament responded in 1774 with the Coercive Acts, or Intolerable Acts, which, among other provisions, ended local self-government in Massachusetts and closed Boston's commerce. Colonists up and down the Thirteen Colonies in turn responded to the Coercive Acts with additional acts of protest, and by convening the First Continental Congress, which petitioned the British monarch for repeal of the acts and coordinated colonial resistance to them. The crisis escalated, and the American Revolutionary War began near Boston in 1775.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Boston Tea Party arose from two issues confronting the British Empire in 1765: the financial problems of the British East India Company; and an ongoing dispute about the extent of Parliament's authority, if any, over the British American colonies without seating any elected representation. The North Ministry's attempt to resolve these issues produced a showdown that would eventually result in revolution.[2]\\r\\nAs Europeans developed a taste for tea in the 17th century, rival companies were formed to import the product from China.[3] In England, Parliament gave the East India Company a monopoly on the importation of tea in 1698.[4] When tea became popular in the British colonies, Parliament sought to eliminate foreign competition by passing an act in 1721 that required colonists to import their tea only from Great Britain.[5] The East India Company did not export tea to the colonies; by law, the company was required to sell its tea wholesale at auctions in England. British firms bought this tea and exported it to the colonies, where they resold it to merchants in Boston, New York, Philadelphia, and Charleston.[6]\\r\\nUntil 1767, the East India Company paid an ad valorem tax of about 25% on tea that it imported into Great Britain.[7] Parliament laid additional taxes on tea sold for consumption in Britain. These high taxes, combined with the fact that tea imported into the Dutch Republic was not taxed by the Dutch government, meant that Britons and British Americans could buy smuggled Dutch tea at much cheaper prices.[8] The biggest market for illicit tea was Englandby the 1760s the East India Company was losing S400,000 per year to smugglers in Great Britain[9]but Dutch tea was also smuggled into British America in significant quantities.[10]\\r\\nIn 1767, to help the East India Company compete with smuggled Dutch tea, Parliament passed the Indemnity Act, which lowered the tax on tea consumed in Great Britain, and gave the East India Company a refund of the 25% duty on tea that was re-exported to the colonies.[11] To help offset this loss of government revenue, Parliament also passed the Townshend Revenue Act of 1767, which levied new taxes, including one on tea, in the colonies.[12] Instead of solving the smuggling problem, however, the Townshend duties renewed a controversy about Parliament's right to tax the colonies.\\r\\nControversy between Great Britain and the colonies arose in the 1760s when Parliament sought, for the first time, to impose a direct tax on the colonies for the purpose of raising revenue. Some colonists, known in the colonies as Whigs, objected to the new tax program, arguing that it was a violation of the British Constitution. Britons and British Americans agreed that, according to the constitution, British subjects could not be taxed without the consent of their elected representatives. In Great Britain, this meant that taxes could only be levied by Parliament. Colonists, however, did not elect members of Parliament, and so American Whigs argued that the colonies could not be taxed by that body. According to Whigs, colonists could only be taxed by their own colonial assemblies. Colonial protests resulted in the repeal of the Stamp Act in 1766, but in the 1766 Declaratory Act, Parliament continued to insist that it had the right to legislate for the colonies \\"in all cases whatsoever\\".\\r\\nWhen new taxes were levied in the Townshend Revenue Act of 1767, Whig colonists again responded with protests and boycotts. Merchants organized a non-importation agreement, and many colonists pledged to abstain from drinking British tea, with activists in New England promoting alternatives, such as domestic Labrador tea.[13] Smuggling continued apace, especially in New York and Philadelphia, where tea smuggling had always been more extensive than in Boston. Dutied British tea continued to be imported into Boston, however, especially by Richard Clarke and the sons of Massachusetts Governor Thomas Hutchinson, until pressure from Massachusetts Whigs compelled them to abide by the non-importation agreement.[14]\\r\\nParliament finally responded to the protests by repealing the Townshend taxes in 1770, except for the tea duty, which Prime Minister Lord North kept to assert \\"the right of taxing the Americans\\".[15] This partial repeal of the taxes was enough to bring an end to the non-importation movement by October 1770.[16] From 1771 to 1773, British tea was once again imported into the colonies in significant amounts, with merchants paying the Townshend duty of three pence per pound.[17] Boston was the largest colonial importer of legal tea; smugglers still dominated the market in New York and Philadelphia.[18]\\r\\nThe Indemnity Act of 1767, which gave the East India Company a refund of the duty on tea that was re-exported to the colonies, expired in 1772. Parliament passed a new act in 1772 that reduced this refund, effectively leaving a 10% duty on tea imported into Britain.[19] The act also restored the tea taxes within Britain that had been repealed in 1767, and left in place the three pence Townshend duty in the colonies. With this new tax burden driving up the price of British tea, sales plummeted. The company continued to import tea into Great Britain, however, amassing a huge surplus of product that no one would buy.[20] For these and other reasons, by late 1772 the East India Company, one of Britain's most important commercial institutions, was in a serious financial crisis.[21] The severe famine in Bengal from 1769 to 1773 had drastically reduced the revenue of the East India Company from India bringing the Company to the verge of bankruptcy and the Tea Act of 1773 was enacted to help the East India Company.\\r\\nEliminating some of the taxes was one obvious solution to the crisis. The East India Company initially sought to have the Townshend duty repealed, but the North ministry was unwilling because such an action might be interpreted as a retreat from Parliament's position that it had the right to tax the colonies.[22] More importantly, the tax collected from the Townshend duty was used to pay the salaries of some colonial governors and judges.[23] This was in fact the purpose of the Townshend tax: previously these officials had been paid by the colonial assemblies, but Parliament now paid their salaries to keep them dependent on the British government rather than allowing them to be accountable to the colonists.[24]\\r\\nAnother possible solution for reducing the growing mound of tea in the East India Company warehouses was to sell it cheaply in Europe. This possibility was investigated, but it was determined that the tea would simply be smuggled back into Great Britain, where it would undersell the taxed product.[25] The best market for the East India Company's surplus tea, so it seemed, was the American colonies, if a way could be found to make it cheaper than the smuggled Dutch tea.[26]\\r\\nThe North ministry's solution was the Tea Act, which received the assent of King George on May 10, 1773.[27] This act restored the East India Company's full refund on the duty for importing tea into Britain, and also permitted the company, for the first time, to export tea to the colonies on its own account. This would allow the company to reduce costs by eliminating the middlemen who bought the tea at wholesale auctions in London.[28] Instead of selling to middlemen, the company now appointed colonial merchants to receive the tea on consignment; the consignees would in turn sell the tea for a commission. In July 1773, tea consignees were selected in New York, Philadelphia, Boston, and Charleston.[29]\\r\\nThe Tea Act retained the three pence Townshend duty on tea imported to the colonies. Some members of Parliament wanted to eliminate this tax, arguing that there was no reason to provoke another colonial controversy. Former Chancellor of the Exchequer William Dowdeswell, for example, warned Lord North that the Americans would not accept the tea if the Townshend duty remained.[30] But North did not want to give up the revenue from the Townshend tax, primarily because it was used to pay the salaries of colonial officials; maintaining the right of taxing the Americans was a secondary concern.[31] According to historian Benjamin Labaree, \\"A stubborn Lord North had unwittingly hammered a nail in the coffin of the old British Empire.\\"[32]\\r\\nEven with the Townshend duty in effect, the Tea Act would allow the East India Company to sell tea more cheaply than before, undercutting the prices offered by smugglers, but also undercutting colonial tea importers, who paid the tax and received no refund. In 1772, legally imported Bohea, the most common variety of tea, sold for about 3 shillings (3s) per pound.[33] After the Tea Act, colonial consignees would be able to sell it for 2 shillings per pound (2s), just under the smugglers' price of 2 shillings and 1 penny (2s 1d).[34] Realizing that the payment of the Townshend duty was politically sensitive, the company hoped to conceal the tax by making arrangements to have it paid either in London once the tea was landed in the colonies, or have the consignees quietly pay the duties after the tea was sold. This effort to hide the tax from the colonists was unsuccessful.[35]\\r\\nIn September and October 1773, seven ships carrying East India Company tea were sent to the colonies: four were bound for Boston, and one each for New York, Philadelphia, and Charleston.[36] In the ships were more than 2,000 chests containing nearly 600,000 pounds of tea.[37] Americans learned the details of the Tea Act while the ships were en route, and opposition began to mount.[38] Whigs, sometimes calling themselves Sons of Liberty, began a campaign to raise awareness and to convince or compel the consignees to resign, in the same way that stamp distributors had been forced to resign in the 1765 Stamp Act crisis.[39]\\r\\nThe protest movement that culminated with the Boston Tea Party was not a dispute about high taxes. The price of legally imported tea was actually reduced by the Tea Act of 1773. Protesters were instead concerned with a variety of other issues. The familiar \\"no taxation without representation\\" argument, along with the question of the extent of Parliament's authority in the colonies, remained prominent.[40] Samuel Adams considered the British tea monopoly to be \\"equal to a tax\\" and to raise the same representation issue whether or not a tax was applied to it.[41] Some regarded the purpose of the tax programto make leading officials independent of colonial influenceas a dangerous infringement of colonial rights.[42] This was especially true in Massachusetts, the only colony where the Townshend program had been fully implemented.[43]\\r\\nColonial merchants, some of them smugglers, played a significant role in the protests. Because the Tea Act made legally imported tea cheaper, it threatened to put smugglers of Dutch tea out of business.[44] Legitimate tea importers who had not been named as consignees by the East India Company were also threatened with financial ruin by the Tea Act.[45] Another major concern for merchants was that the Tea Act gave the East India Company a monopoly on the tea trade, and it was feared that this government-created monopoly might be extended in the future to include other goods.[46]\\r\\nSouth of Boston, protesters successfully compelled the tea consignees to resign. In Charleston, the consignees had been forced to resign by early December, and the unclaimed tea was seized by customs officials.[47] There were mass protest meetings in Philadelphia. Benjamin Rush urged his fellow countrymen to oppose the landing of the tea, because the cargo contained \\"the seeds of slavery\\".[48] By early December, the Philadelphia consignees had resigned and the tea ship returned to England with its cargo following a confrontation with the ship's captain.[49] The tea ship bound for New York City was delayed by bad weather; by the time it arrived, the consignees had resigned, and the ship returned to England with the tea.[50]\\r\\nIn every colony except Massachusetts, protesters were able to force the tea consignees to resign or to return the tea to England.[51] In Boston, however, Governor Hutchinson was determined to hold his ground. He convinced the tea consignees, two of whom were his sons, not to back down.[52]\\r\\nWhen the tea ship Dartmouth arrived in the Boston Harbor in late November, Whig leader Samuel Adams called for a mass meeting to be held at Faneuil Hall on November 29, 1773. Thousands of people arrived, so many that the meeting was moved to the larger Old South Meeting House.[53] British law required the Dartmouth to unload and pay the duties within twenty days or customs officials could confiscate the cargo.[54] The mass meeting passed a resolution, introduced by Adams and based on a similar set of resolutions promulgated earlier in Philadelphia, urging the captain of the Dartmouth to send the ship back without paying the import duty. Meanwhile, the meeting assigned twenty-five men to watch the ship and prevent the teaincluding a number of chests from Davison, Newman and Co. of Londonfrom being unloaded.[55]\\r\\nGovernor Hutchinson refused to grant permission for the Dartmouth to leave without paying the duty. Two more tea ships, the Eleanor and the Beaver, arrived in Boston Harbor (there was another tea ship headed for Boston, the William, but it encountered a storm and was destroyed before it could reach its destination[56]). On December 16the last day of the Dartmouth's deadlineabout 7,000 people had gathered around the Old South Meeting House.[57] After receiving a report that Governor Hutchinson had again refused to let the ships leave, Adams announced that \\"This meeting can do nothing further to save the country.\\" According to a popular story, Adams's statement was a prearranged signal for the \\"tea party\\" to begin. However, this claim did not appear in print until nearly a century after the event, in a biography of Adams written by his great-grandson, who apparently misinterpreted the evidence.[58] According to eyewitness accounts, people did not leave the meeting until ten or fifteen minutes after Adams's alleged \\"signal\\", and Adams in fact tried to stop people from leaving because the meeting was not yet over.[59]\\r\\nWhile Samuel Adams tried to reassert control of the meeting, people poured out of the Old South Meeting House to prepare to take action. In some cases, this involved donning what may have been elaborately prepared Mohawk costumes.[60] While disguising their individual faces was imperative, because of the illegality of their protest, dressing as Mohawk warriors was a specific and symbolic choice. It showed that the Sons of Liberty identified with America, over their official status as subjects of Great Britain.[61]\\r\\nThat evening, a group of 30 to 130 men, some dressed in the Mohawk warrior disguises, boarded the three vessels and, over the course of three hours, dumped all 342 chests of tea into the water.[62] The precise location of the Griffin's Wharf site of the Tea Party has been subject to prolonged uncertainty; a comprehensive study[63] places it near the foot of Hutchinson Street (today's Pearl Street).\\r\\nWhether or not Samuel Adams helped plan the Boston Tea Party is disputed, but he immediately worked to publicize and defend it.[64] He argued that the Tea Party was not the act of a lawless mob, but was instead a principled protest and the only remaining option the people had to defend their constitutional rights.[65]\\r\\nBy \\"constitution\\" he referred to the idea that all governments have a constitution, written or not, and that the constitution of Great Britain could be interpreted as banning the levying of taxes without representation. For example, the Bill of Rights of 1689 established that long-term taxes could not be levied without Parliament, and other precedents said that Parliament must actually represent the people it ruled over, in order to \\"count\\".\\r\\nGovernor Thomas Hutchinson had been urging London to take a hard line with the Sons of Liberty. If he had done what the other royal governors had done and let the ship owners and captains resolve the issue with the colonists, the Dartmouth, Eleanor and the Beaver would have left without unloading any tea.\\r\\nIn Britain, even those politicians considered friends of the colonies were appalled and this act united all parties there against the colonies. The Prime Minister Lord North said, \\"Whatever may be the consequence, we must risk something; if we do not, all is over\\".[66] The British government felt this action could not remain unpunished, and responded by closing the port of Boston and putting in place other laws known as the \\"Coercive Acts.\\" Benjamin Franklin stated that the destroyed tea must be paid for, all ninety thousand pounds (which, at two shillings per pound, came to S9,000, or S1.03?million [2014, approx. $1.7 million US]).[67] Robert Murray, a New York merchant, went to Lord North with three other merchants and offered to pay for the losses, but the offer was turned down.[68]\\r\\nThe incident resulted in a similar effect in America when news of the Boston Tea Party reached London in January and Parliament responded with a series of acts known collectively in the colonies as the Intolerable Acts. These were intended to punish Boston for the destruction of private property, restore British authority in Massachusetts, and otherwise reform colonial government in America. Although the first two, the Boston Port Act and the Massachusetts Government Act, applied only to Massachusetts, colonists outside that colony feared that their governments could now also be changed by legislative fiat in England. The Intolerable Acts were viewed as a violation of constitutional rights, natural rights, and colonial charters, and united many colonists throughout America,[69] exemplified by the calling of the First Continental Congress in September 1774.\\r\\nA number of colonists were inspired by the Boston Tea Party to carry out similar acts, such as the burning of the Peggy Stewart. The Boston Tea Party eventually proved to be one of the many reactions that led to the American Revolutionary War.[citation needed] In his December 17, 1773 entry in his diary, John Adams wrote:\\r\\nLast Night 3 Cargoes of Bohea Tea were emptied into the Sea. This Morning a Man of War sails.\\r\\nThis is the most magnificent Movement of all. There is a Dignity, a Majesty, a Sublimity, in this last Effort of the Patriots, that I greatly admire. The People should never rise, without doing something to be rememberedsomething notable And striking. This Destruction of the Tea is so bold, so daring, so firm, intrepid and inflexible, and it must have so important Consequences, and so lasting, that I cant but consider it as an Epocha in History.[70]\\r\\nThere was a repeat performance on March 7, 1774, but it was much less destructive.[71]\\r\\nIn February 1775, Britain passed the Conciliatory Resolution, which ended taxation for any colony that satisfactorily provided for the imperial defense and the upkeep of imperial officers. The tax on tea was repealed with the Taxation of Colonies Act 1778, part of another Parliamentary attempt at conciliation that failed.\\r\\nJohn Adams and many other Americans considered tea drinking to be unpatriotic following the Boston Tea Party. Tea drinking declined during and after the Revolution, resulting in a shift to coffee as the preferred hot drink.[73]\\r\\nAccording to historian Alfred Young, the term \\"Boston Tea Party\\" did not appear in print until 1834.[74] Before that time, the event was usually referred to as the \\"destruction of the tea\\". According to Young, American writers were for many years apparently reluctant to celebrate the destruction of property, and so the event was usually ignored in histories of the American Revolution. This began to change in the 1830s, however, especially with the publication of biographies of George Robert Twelves Hewes, one of the few still-living participants of the \\"tea party\\", as it then became known.[75]\\r\\nThe issue was never the tax but how the tax was passed without American input; United States Congress taxed tea from 1789 to 1872.[76]\\r\\nThe Boston Tea Party has often been referenced in other political protests. When Mohandas K. Gandhi led a mass burning of Indian registration cards in South Africa in 1908, a British newspaper compared the event to the Boston Tea Party.[77] When Gandhi met with the British viceroy in 1930 after the Indian salt protest campaign, Gandhi took some duty-free salt from his shawl and said, with a smile, that the salt was \\"to remind us of the famous Boston Tea Party.\\"[78]\\r\\nAmerican activists from a variety of political viewpoints have invoked the Tea Party as a symbol of protest. In 1973, on the 200th anniversary of the Tea Party, a mass meeting at Faneuil Hall called for the impeachment of President Richard Nixon and protested oil companies in the ongoing oil crisis. Afterwards, protesters boarded a replica ship in Boston Harbor, hanged Nixon in effigy, and dumped several empty oil drums into the harbor.[79] In 1998, two conservative US Congressmen put the federal tax code into a chest marked \\"tea\\" and dumped it into the harbor.[80]\\r\\nIn 2006, a libertarian political party called the \\"Boston Tea Party\\" was founded. In 2007, the Ron Paul \\"Tea Party\\" money bomb, held on the 234th anniversary of the Boston Tea Party, broke the one-day fund-raising record by raising $6.04 million in 24 hours.[81] Subsequently, these fund-raising \\"Tea parties\\" grew into the Tea Party movement, which dominated politics for the next two years, culminating in a voter victory for the Republicans in 2010 who were widely elected to seats in the United States House of Representatives.\\r\\nThe Boston Tea Party Museum is located on the Congress Street Bridge in Boston. It features reenactments, a documentary, and a number of interactive exhibits. The museum features two replica ships of the period, the Eleanor and the Beaver. Additionally, the museum possesses one of two known tea chests from the original event, part of its permanent collection.[82]","input":"How much was the tax that caused the boston tea party?"},{"output":"stimulation of phagocytes to clear foreign and damaged material","context":"The complement system is a part of the immune system that enhances (complements) the ability of antibodies and phagocytic cells to clear microbes and damaged cells from an organism, promotes inflammation, and attacks the pathogen's plasma membrane. It is part of the innate immune system,[1] which is not adaptable and does not change over the course of an individual's lifetime. It can be recruited and brought into action by antibodies generated by the adaptive immune system.\\r\\nThe complement system consists of a number of small proteins found in the blood, in general synthesized by the liver, and normally circulating as inactive precursors (pro-proteins). When stimulated by one of several triggers, proteases in the system cleave specific proteins to release cytokines and initiate an amplifying cascade of further cleavages. The end result of this complement activation or complement fixation cascade is stimulation of phagocytes to clear foreign and damaged material, proxy inflammation to attract additional phagocytes, and activation of the cell-killing membrane attack complex. Over 30 proteins and protein fragments make up the complement system, including serum proteins, serosal proteins, and cell membrane receptors. They account for about 10% of the globulin fraction of blood serum and can serve as opsonins.[citation needed]\\r\\nThree biochemical pathways activate the complement system: the classical complement pathway, the alternative complement pathway, and the lectin pathway.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1888, George Nuttall found that sheep blood serum had mild killing activity against the bacterium that causes anthrax. The killing activity disappeared when he heated the blood.[3] In 1891, Hans Ernst August Buchner, noting the same property of blood in his experiments, named the killing property \\"alexin,\\" which means \\"to ward off\\" in Greek.[4] By 1884, several laboratories had demonstrated that serum from guinea pigs that had recovered from cholera killed the cholera bacterium in vitro. Heating the serum destroyed its killing activity. Nevertheless, the heat-inactivated serum, when injected into guinea pigs exposed to the cholera bacteria, maintained its ability to protect the animals from illness. Jules Bordet, a young Belgian scientist in Paris at the Pasteur Institute, concluded that this principle has two components, one that maintained a \\"sensitizing\\" effect after being heated and one (alexin) whose toxic effect was lost after being heated. The heat-stable component was responsible for immunity against specific microorganisms, whereas the heat-sensitive component was responsible for the non-specific antimicrobial activity conferred by all normal sera. In 1899, Paul Ehrlich renamed the heat-sensitive component \\"complement.\\"[3]\\r\\nEhrlich introduced the term \\"complement\\" as part of his larger theory of the immune system. According to this theory, the immune system consists of cells that have specific receptors on their surface to recognize antigens. Upon immunisation with an antigen, more of these receptors are formed, and they are then shed from the cells to circulate in the blood. These receptors, which we now call \\"antibodies,\\" were called by Ehrlich \\"amboceptors\\" to emphasise their bifunctional binding capacity: They recognise and bind to a specific antigen, but they also recognise and bind to the heat-labile antimicrobial component of fresh serum. Ehrlich, therefore, named this heat-labile component \\"complement,\\" because it is something in the blood that \\"complements\\" the cells of the immune system. Ehrlich believed that each antigen-specific amboceptor has its own specific complement, whereas Bordet believed that there is only one type of complement. In the early 20th century, this controversy was resolved when it became understood that complement can act in combination with specific antibodies, or on its own in a non-specific way.[citation needed]\\r\\nComplement triggers the following immune functions:[5]\\r\\nMost of the proteins and glycoproteins that constitute the complement system are synthesized by hepatocytes. But significant amounts are also produced by tissue macrophages, blood monocytes, and epithelial cells of the genitourinal tract and gastrointestinal tract. The three pathways of activation all generate homologous variants of the protease C3-convertase. The classical complement pathway typically requires antigenantibody complexes (immune complexes) for activation (specific immune response), whereas the alternative pathway can be activated by C3 hydrolysis, foreign material, pathogens, or damaged cells. The mannose-binding lectin pathway can be activated by C3 hydrolysis or antigens without the presence of antibodies (non-specific immune response). In all three pathways, C3-convertase cleaves and activates component C3, creating C3a and C3b, and causes a cascade of further cleavage and activation events. C3b binds to the surface of pathogens, leading to greater internalization by phagocytic cells by opsonization.\\r\\nIn the alternative pathway, C3b binds to Factor B. Factor D releases Factor Ba from Factor B bound to C3b. The complex of C3b(2)Bb is a protease which cleaves C5 into C5b and C5a. C5 convertase is also formed by the Classical Pathway when C3b binds C4b and C2a. C5a is an important chemotactic protein, helping recruit inflammatory cells. C3a is the precursor of an important cytokine (adipokine) named ASP (although this is not universally accepted [6]) and is usually rapidly cleaved by carboxypeptidase B. Both C3a and C5a have anaphylatoxin activity, directly triggering degranulation of mast cells as well as increasing vascular permeability and smooth muscle contraction.[6] C5b initiates the membrane attack pathway, which results in the membrane attack complex (MAC), consisting of C5b, C6, C7, C8, and polymeric C9.[7] MAC is the cytolytic endproduct of the complement cascade; it forms a transmembrane channel, which causes osmotic lysis of the target cell. Kupffer cells and other macrophage cell types help clear complement-coated pathogens. As part of the innate immune system, elements of the complement cascade can be found in species earlier than vertebrates; most recently in the protostome horseshoe crab species, putting the origins of the system back further than was previously thought.\\r\\nThe classical pathway is triggered by activation of the C1-complex. The C1-complex is composed of 1 molecule of C1q, 2 molecules of C1r and 2 molecules of C1s, or C1qr2s2. This occurs when C1q binds to IgM or IgG complexed with antigens. A single pentameric IgM can initiate the pathway, while several, ideally six, IgGs are needed. This also occurs when C1q binds directly to the surface of the pathogen. Such binding leads to conformational changes in the C1q molecule, which leads to the activation of two C1r molecules. C1r is a serine protease. They then cleave C1s (another serine protease). The C1r2s2 component now splits C4 and then C2, producing C4a, C4b, C2a, and C2b. C4b and C2b (historically, the larger fragment of C2 was called C2a but is now referred to as C2b) bind to form the classical pathway C3-convertase (C4b2b complex), which promotes cleavage of C3 into C3a and C3b. C3b later joins with C4b2b to make C5 convertase (C4b2b3b complex).\\r\\nThe alternative pathway is continuously activated at a low level, analogous to a car engine at idle, as a result of spontaneous C3 hydrolysis due to the breakdown of the internal thioester bond (C3 is mildly unstable in aqueous environment). The alternative pathway does not rely on pathogen-binding antibodies like the other pathways.[2] C3b that is generated from C3 by a C3 convertase enzyme complex in the fluid phase is rapidly inactivated by factor H and factor I, as is the C3b-like C3 that is the product of spontaneous cleavage of the internal thioester. In contrast, when the internal thioester of C3 reacts with a hydroxyl or amino group of a molecule on the surface of a cell or pathogen, the C3b that is now covalently bound to the surface is protected from factor H-mediated inactivation. The surface-bound C3b may now bind factor B to form C3bB. This complex in the presence of factor D will be cleaved into Ba and Bb. Bb will remain associated with C3b to form C3bBb, which is the alternative pathway C3 convertase.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe C3bBb complex is stabilized by binding oligomers of factor P (Properdin). The stabilized C3 convertase, C3bBbP, then acts enzymatically to cleave much more C3, some of which becomes covalently attached to the same surface as C3b. This newly bound C3b recruits more B, D and P activity and greatly amplifies the complement activation. When complement is activated on a cell surface, the activation is limited by endogenous complement regulatory proteins, which include CD35, CD46, CD55 and CD59, depending on the cell. Pathogens, in general, don't have complement regulatory proteins (there are many exceptions, which reflect adaptation of microbial pathogens to vertebrate immune defenses). Thus, the alternative complement pathway is able to distinguish self from non-self on the basis of the surface expression of complement regulatory proteins. Host cells don't accumulate cell surface C3b (and the proteolytic fragment of C3b called iC3b) because this is prevented by the complement regulatory proteins, while foreign cells, pathogens and abnormal surfaces may be heavily decorated with C3b and iC3b. Accordingly, the alternative complement pathway is one element of innate immunity.[citation needed]\\r\\nOnce the alternative C3 convertase enzyme is formed on a pathogen or cell surface, it may bind covalently another C3b, to form C3bBbC3bP, the C5 convertase. This enzyme then cleaves C5 to C5a, a potent anaphylatoxin, and C5b. The C5b then recruits and assembles C6, C7, C8 and multiple C9 molecules to assemble the membrane attack complex. This creates a hole or pore in the membrane that can kill or damage the pathogen or cell.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe lectin pathway is homologous to the classical pathway, but with the opsonin, mannose-binding lectin (MBL), and ficolins, instead of C1q. This pathway is activated by binding of MBL to mannose residues on the pathogen surface, which activates the MBL-associated serine proteases, MASP-1, and MASP-2 (very similar to C1r and C1s, respectively), which can then split C4 into C4a and C4b and C2 into C2a and C2b. C4b and C2b then bind together to form the classical C3-convertase, as in the classical pathway. Ficolins are homologous to MBL and function via MASP in a similar way. Several single-nucleotide polymorphisms have been described in M-ficolin in humans, with effect on ligand-binding ability and serum levels. Historically, the larger fragment of C2 was named C2a, but it is now referred to as C2b.[8] In invertebrates without an adaptive immune system, ficolins are expanded and their binding specificities diversified to compensate for the lack of pathogen-specific recognition molecules.\\r\\nImmunology textbooks have used different naming assignments for the smaller and larger fragments of C2 as C2a and C2b. The preferred assignment appears to be that the smaller fragment be designated as C2a: as early as 1994, a well known textbook recommended that the larger fragment of C2 should be designated C2b.[9] However, this was amplified in their 1999 4th edition, to say that:[10] \\"It is also useful to be aware that the larger active fragment of C2 was originally designated C2a, and is still called that in some texts and research papers. Here, for consistency, we shall call all large fragments of complement b, so the larger fragment of C2 will be designated C2b. In the classical and lectin pathways the C3 convertase enzyme is formed from membrane-bound C4b with C2b.\\"[10]\\r\\nThis nomenclature is used in another literature:[11] \\"(Note that, in older texts, the smaller fragment is often called C2b, and the larger one is called C2a for historical reason.)\\"[12] The assignment is mixed in the latter literature, though. Some sources designate the larger and smaller fragments as C2a and C2b respectively[13][14][15][16][17][18][19][20][21] while other sources apply the converse.[9][10][22][23][24] However, due to the widely established convention, C2b here is the larger fragment, which, in the classical pathway, forms C4b2b (classically C4b2a). It may be noteworthy that, in a series of editions of Janeway's book, 1st to 7th, in the latest edition[20] they withdraw the stance to indicate the larger fragment of C2 as C2b.\\r\\nFixation of the C1a protein on viral surfaces has also been shown to enhance neutralization of viral pathogens.[25]\\r\\nIn the classical pathway, C1 binds with its C1q subunits to Fc fragments (made of CH2 region) of IgG or IgM, which has formed a complex with antigens. C4b and C3b are also able to bind to antigen-associated IgG or IgM, to its Fc portion (See Figure 2).[11][17][20]\\r\\nSuch immunoglobulin-mediated binding of the complement may be interpreted as that the complement uses the ability of the immunoglobulin to detect and bind to non-self antigens as its guiding stick. The complement itself is able to bind non-self pathogens after detecting their pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs),[20] however, utilizing specificity of antibody, complements are able to detect non-self enemies much more specifically.\\r\\nFigure 2 shows the classical and the alternative pathways with the late steps of complement activation schematically.[11][17][20] Some components have a variety of binding sites. In the classical pathway C4 binds to Ig-associated C1q and C1r2s2 enzyme cleave C4 to C4b and 4a. C4b binds to C1q, antigen-associated Ig (specifically to its Fc portion), and even to the microbe surface. C3b binds to antigen-associated Ig and to the microbe surface. Ability of C3b to bind to antigen-associated Ig would work effectively against antigen-antibody immune complexes to make them soluble. In the figure, C2b refers to the larger of the C2 fragments.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe complement system has the potential to be extremely damaging to host tissues, meaning its activation must be tightly regulated. The complement system is regulated by complement control proteins, which are present at a higher concentration in the blood plasma than the complement proteins themselves. Some complement control proteins are present on the membranes of self-cells preventing them from being targeted by complement. One example is CD59, also known as protectin, which inhibits C9 polymerisation during the formation of the membrane attack complex. The classical pathway is inhibited by C1-inhibitor, which binds to C1 to prevent its activation.[citation needed]\\r\\nC3-convertase can be inhibited by Decay accelerating factor (DAF), which is bound to erythrocyte plasma membranes via a GPI anchor.[citation needed]\\r\\nIt is thought that the complement system might play a role in many diseases with an immune component, such as Barraquer-Simons Syndrome, asthma, lupus erythematosus, glomerulonephritis, various forms of arthritis, autoimmune heart disease, multiple sclerosis, inflammatory bowel disease, paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome and ischemia-reperfusion injuries,[26][27] and rejection of transplanted organs.[28]\\r\\nThe complement system is also becoming increasingly implicated in diseases of the central nervous system such as Alzheimer's disease and other neurodegenerative conditions such as spinal cord injuries.[29][30][31]\\r\\nDeficiencies of the terminal pathway predispose to both autoimmune disease and infections (particularly Neisseria meningitidis, due to the role that the membrane attack complex (\\"MAC\\") plays in attacking Gram-negative bacteria).[citation needed]\\r\\nInfections with N. meningitidis and N. gonorrhoeae are the only conditions known to be associated with deficiencies in the MAC components of complement.[32] 40-50% of those with MAC deficiencies experience recurrent infections with N. meningitidis.[33]\\r\\nMutations in the complement regulators factor H and membrane cofactor protein have been associated with atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome.[34][35] Moreover, a common single nucleotide polymorphism in factor H (Y402H) has been associated with the common eye disease age-related macular degeneration.[36] Polymorphisms of complement component 3, complement factor B, and complement factor I, as well as deletion of complement factor H-related 3 and complement factor H-related 1 also affect a person's risk of developing age-related macular degeneration.[37] Both of these disorders are currently thought to be due to aberrant complement activation on the surface of host cells.\\r\\nMutations in the C1 inhibitor gene can cause hereditary angioedema, a genetic condition resulting from reduced regulation of bradykinin by C1-INH.[citation needed]\\r\\nParoxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria is caused by complement breakdown of RBCs due to an inability to make GPI. Thus the RBCs are not protected by GPI anchored proteins such as DAF.[38]\\r\\nDiagnostic tools to measure complement activity include the total complement activity test.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe presence or absence of complement fixation upon a challenge can indicate whether particular antigens or antibodies are present in the blood. This is the principle of the complement fixation test.\\r\\nRecent research has suggested that the complement system is manipulated during HIV/AIDS to further damage the body.[39]","input":"What is the outcome of the complement cascade?"},{"output":"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis","context":"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), also known as motor neurone disease (MND), and Lou Gehrig's disease, is a specific disease which causes the death of neurons controlling voluntary muscles.[3][5][11] Some also use the term motor neuron disease for a group of conditions of which ALS is the most common.[2] ALS is characterized by stiff muscles, muscle twitching, and gradually worsening weakness due to muscles decreasing in size.[2] This results in difficulty speaking, swallowing, and eventually breathing.[2][3]\\r\\nThe cause is not known in 90% to 95% of cases.[5] The remaining 5ÿ10% of cases are inherited from a person's parents.[4] About half of these genetic cases are due to one of two specific genes.[5] The underlying mechanism involves damage to both upper and lower motor neurons.[2] The diagnosis is based on a person's signs and symptoms, with testing done to rule out other potential causes.[5]\\r\\nNo cure for ALS is known.[5] A medication called riluzole may extend life by about two to three months.[7] Non-invasive ventilation may result in both improved quality and length of life.[6] The disease can affect people of any age, but usually starts around the age of 60 and in inherited cases around the age of 50.[4] The average survival from onset to death is two to four years.[9] About 10% survive longer than 10 years.[5] Most die from respiratory failure.[4] In much of the world, rates of ALS are unknown.[4] In Europe and the United States the disease affects about two to three people per 100,000 per year.[4][12][10]\\r\\nDescriptions of the disease date back to at least 1824 by Charles Bell.[13] In 1869, the connection between the symptoms and the underlying neurological problems was first described by Jean-Martin Charcot, who in 1874 began using the term amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.[13] It became well known in the United States in the 20th century when in 1939 it affected the baseball player Lou Gehrig and later worldwide following the 1963 diagnosis of cosmologist Stephen Hawking.[14][15] In 2014, videos of the Ice Bucket Challenge went viral on the Internet and increased public awareness of the condition.[16]\\r\\nALS is a motor neuron disease, also spelled \\"motor neurone disease\\", which is a group of neurological disorders that selectively affect motor neurons, the cells that control voluntary muscles of the body, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), primary lateral sclerosis, progressive muscular atrophy, progressive bulbar palsy, pseudobulbar palsy, and spinal muscular atrophy.[2]\\r\\nALS itself can be classified a few different ways: by how fast the disease progresses (slow vs fast progressors), by whether it is inherited or sporadic, and by where it starts.[5] Most commonly (~70% of the time) the limbs are affected first. In this case, neurons in the brain (upper motor neurons) and in the spinal cord (lower motor neurons) are dying and this form is called \\"limb onset\\". In about 25% of cases, muscles in the face, mouth, and throat are affected first, because motor neurons in the part of the brain stem called the medulla oblongata (formerly called the \\"bulb\\") start to die first along with lower motor neurons. This form is called \\"bulbar onset\\". In about 5% of cases muscles in the trunk of the body are affected first. In all cases the disease spreads and affects other regions.[4] The symptoms may also be limited to one spinal region.\\r\\nThose with leg amyotrophic diplegia and brachial amyotrophic diplegia have a longer survival compared to classic onset ALS.[17]\\r\\nThe disorder causes muscle weakness, atrophy, and muscle spasms throughout the body due to the degeneration of the upper motor and lower motor neurons. Individuals affected by the disorder may ultimately lose the ability to initiate and control all voluntary movement, although bladder and bowel function and the muscles responsible for eye movement are usually spared until the final stages of the disorder.[9]\\r\\nCognitive or behavioral dysfunction is present in 30ÿ50% of individuals with ALS.[18] Around half of people with ALS will experience mild changes in cognition and behavior, and 10ÿ15% will show signs of frontotemporal dementia.[9] Repeating phrases or gestures, apathy, and loss of inhibition are frequently reported behavioral features of ALS.[19] Language dysfunction, executive dysfunction, and troubles with social cognition and verbal memory are the most commonly reported cognitive symptoms in ALS; a meta-analysis found no relationship between dysfunction and disease severity.[20] However, cognitive and behavioral dysfunctions have been found to correlate with reduced survival in people with ALS and increased caregiver burden; this may be due in part to deficits in social cognition.[20] About half the people who have ALS experience emotional lability, in which they cry or laugh for no reason.[9]\\r\\nSensory nerves and the autonomic nervous system are generally unaffected, meaning the majority of people with ALS maintain hearing, sight, touch, smell, and taste.[5]\\r\\nThe start of ALS may be so subtle that the symptoms are overlooked.[5] The earliest symptoms of ALS are muscle weakness or muscle atrophy. Other presenting symptoms include trouble swallowing or breathing, cramping, or stiffness of affected muscles; muscle weakness affecting an arm or a leg; or slurred and nasal speech. The parts of the body affected by early symptoms of ALS depend on which motor neurons in the body are damaged first.[21]\\r\\nIn limb-onset ALS, people first experience awkwardness when walking or running or even tripping over or stumbling may be experienced and often this is marked by walking with a \\"dropped foot\\" which drags gently on the ground. Or if arm-onset, difficulty with tasks requiring manual dexterity such as buttoning a shirt, writing, or turning a key in a lock may be experienced.[21]\\r\\nIn bulbar-onset ALS, initial symptoms will mainly be of difficulty speaking clearly or swallowing. Speech may become slurred, nasal in character, or quieter. There may be difficulty in swallowing and loss of tongue mobility. A smaller proportion of people experience \\"respiratory-onset\\" ALS, where the intercostal muscles that support breathing are affected first.[4]\\r\\nOver time, people experience increasing difficulty moving, swallowing (dysphagia), and speaking or forming words (dysarthria). Symptoms of upper motor neuron involvement include tight and stiff muscles (spasticity) and exaggerated reflexes (hyperreflexia) including an overactive gag reflex. An abnormal reflex commonly called Babinski's sign also indicates upper motor neuron damage. Symptoms of lower motor neuron degeneration include muscle weakness and atrophy, muscle cramps, and fleeting twitches of muscles that can be seen under the skin (fasciculations) although twitching is not a diagnostic symptom and more of a side effect so twitching would either occur after or accompany weakness and atrophy.[5]\\r\\nAlthough the order and rate of symptoms vary from person to person, the disease eventually spreads to unaffected regions and the affected regions become more affected. Most people eventually are not able to walk or use their hands and arms, lose the ability to speak and swallow food and their own saliva, and begin to lose the ability to cough and to breathe on their own.[9]\\r\\nThe rate of progression can be measured using an outcome measure called the \\"ALS Functional Rating Scale Revised (ALSFRS-R)\\", a 12-item instrument administered as a clinical interview or self-reported questionnaire that produces a score between 48 (normal function) and 0 (severe disability);[22] it is the most commonly used outcome measure in clinical trials and is used by doctors to track disease progression.[23] Though the degree of variability is high and a small percentage of people have a much slower disorder, on average, people with ALS lose about 0.9 FRS points per month. A survey-based study among clinicians showed that they rated a 20% change in the slope of the ALSFRS-R as being clinically meaningful.[24]\\r\\nDisorder progression tends to be slower in people who are younger than 40 at onset,[25] are mildly obese,[26] have disorder restricted primarily to one limb, and those with primarily upper motor neuron symptoms.[27] Conversely, progression is faster and prognosis poorer in people with bulbar-onset disorder, respiratory-onset disorder, and frontotemporal dementia.[27]\\r\\nThe CX3CR1 allelic variants have also been shown to have an effect on the disorder's progression and life expectancy.[28]\\r\\nDifficulty in chewing and swallowing makes eating very difficult and increases the risk of choking or of aspirating food into the lungs. In later stages of the disorder, aspiration pneumonia can develop, and maintaining a healthy weight can become a significant problem that may require the insertion of a feeding tube. As the diaphragm and intercostal muscles of the rib cage that support breathing weaken, measures of lung function such as vital capacity and inspiratory pressure diminish. In respiratory-onset ALS, this may occur before significant limb weakness is apparent. Most people with ALS die of respiratory failure or pneumonia.[4]\\r\\nAlthough respiratory support can ease problems with breathing and prolong survival, it does not affect the progression of ALS. Most people with ALS die between two and four years after the diagnosis.[9] Around half of people with ALS die within 30 months of their symptoms beginning, and about 20% of people with ALS live between five and 10 years after symptoms begin.[4] Guitarist Jason Becker has lived since 1989 with the disorder, while cosmologist Stephen Hawking lived for 55 more years following his diagnosis, but they are considered unusual cases.[29]\\r\\nMost people with ALS die in their own home, with their breath stopping while they sleep.[11]\\r\\nAbout 5ÿ10% of cases are directly inherited from a person's parents.[4] Overall, first-degree relatives of an individual with ALS have a 1% risk of developing ALS.[30][31]\\r\\nA defect on chromosome 21, which codes for superoxide dismutase, is associated with about 20% of familial cases of ALS, or about 2% of ALS cases overall.[32][33][34] This mutation is believed to be transmitted in an autosomal dominant manner, and has over a hundred different forms of mutation. The most common ALS-causing mutation is a mutant SOD1 gene, seen in North America; this is characterized by an exceptionally rapid progression from onset to death. The most common mutation found in Scandinavian countries, D90A-SOD1, is more slowly progressive than typical ALS, and people with this form of the disorder survive for an average of 11 years.[35][medical citation needed]\\r\\nMutations in C9orf72 are reported to cause 25-40% of familial cases of ALS, as well as a small percentage of sporadic cases.[36]\\r\\nMutations in TDP-43,FUS, C9orf72 and other genes can cause ALS as well as related forms of frontotemporal dementia (FTD/ALS). Proteins made by these genes appear have prion-like activity and form inclusion bodies in some instances of ALS.[37][38]\\r\\nWhile moderate to severe traumatic brain injury is a risk for ALS, if mild traumatic brain injury increases rates is unclear.[39][40]\\r\\nIn 1994 the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health reported an insignificant increase in nervous system disorders due to four cases of ALS among National Football League (NFL) players. Whether this was due to chance or not is unknown.[41] Another study from 2012 also found a possible increase in ALS in NFL football players.[42] An older study did not find an increased risk among high school football players.[39] A 2007 review found an increased risk among soccer players.[40] ALS may also occur more often among the US military veterans, but the reason is unknown.[43] This may be due to head injury.[39]\\r\\nAfter the 2012 report was released, some NFL players involved in the legal settlement with the NFL complained that the NFL, which initially agreed to pay $765 million, was not doing enough to help players. The judge in the case concurred, and the NFL then agreed to pay an unlimited amount of damages for players found to have ALS, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, and dementia.[44]\\r\\nWhere no family history of the disease is present? around 90% of cases? no cause is known. Possible associations for which evidence is inconclusive include military service and smoking.[18] Although studies on military history and ALS frequency are inconsistent, there is weak evidence for a positive correlation.[45] Various proposed factors include exposure to environmental toxins (inferred from geographical deployment studies), as well as alcohol and tobacco use during military service.[45]\\r\\nIn a 2017 study by the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention analyzing U.S. deaths from 1985 to 2011, occupations correlated with ALS deaths were white collar, such as in management, financial, architectural, computing, legal, and education jobs.[46] Other potential risk factors remain unconfirmed, including chemical exposure, electromagnetic field exposure, occupation, physical trauma, and electric shock.[47][48] There is a tentative association with exposure to various pesticides, including the organochlorine insecticides aldrin, dieldrin, DDT, and toxaphene.[49][50][51]\\r\\nThe defining feature of ALS is the death of both upper and lower motor neurons in the motor cortex of the brain, the brain stem, and the spinal cord. Prior to their destruction, motor neurons develop protein-rich inclusions in their cell bodies and axons. This may be partly due to defects in protein degradation.[52] These inclusions often contain ubiquitin, and generally incorporate one of the ALS-associated proteins: SOD1, TAR DNA binding protein (TDP-43, or TARDBP), or FUS.[53] The mutant SOD1 may also contribute to motor neuron cell death through generating free radicals.[54]\\r\\nExcitotoxicity, or cell death caused by high levels of intracellular calcium caused by excessive activity of excitatory neurotransmitters, may be a mechanism of ALS. This concept has been supported by increased glutamate and dysfunctional glutamate transporterÿRNA in cerebrospinal fluid of those with ALS.[3] This is further supported by the only effective treatment being an anti-glutaminergic drug (Riluzole), as well as the poor ability to buffer calcium in motor neurons relative to other neurons.[55]\\r\\nNeurofilament accumulation in axons has been observed in sporadic cases of ALS, as well as in SOD1 patients, possibly interfering with axonal transport, leading to cell death from SOD1 toxicity.[56]\\r\\nNo test can provide a definite diagnosis of ALS, although the presence of upper and lower motor neuron signs in a single limb is strongly suggestive.[5] Instead, the diagnosis of ALS is primarily based on the symptoms and signs the physician observes in the person and a series of tests to rule out other diseases.[5] Physicians obtain the person's full medical history and usually conduct a neurologic examination at regular intervals to assess whether symptoms such as muscle weakness, atrophy of muscles, hyperreflexia, and spasticity are worsening.[5] A number of biomarkers are being studied for the condition, but so far are not in general medical use.[57][58]\\r\\nBecause symptoms of ALS can be similar to those of a wide variety of other, more treatable diseases or disorders, appropriate tests must be conducted to exclude the possibility of other conditions.[5] One of these tests is electromyography (EMG), a special recording technique that detects electrical activity in muscles.[5] Certain EMG findings can support the diagnosis of ALS.[5] Another common test measures nerve conduction velocity (NCV).[5] Specific abnormalities in the NCV results may suggest, for example, that the person has a form of peripheral neuropathy (damage to peripheral nerves) or myopathy (muscle disease) rather than ALS. While a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is often normal in people with early stage ALS, it can reveal evidence of other problems that may be causing the symptoms, such as a spinal cord tumor, multiple sclerosis, a herniated disk in the neck, syringomyelia, or cervical spondylosis.[5]\\r\\nBased on the person's symptoms and findings from the examination and from these tests, the physician may order tests on blood and urine samples to eliminate the possibility of other diseases, as well as routine laboratory tests.[5] In some cases, for example, if a physician suspects the person may have a myopathy rather than ALS, a muscle biopsy may be performed.[5]\\r\\nViral infectious diseases such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), human T-lymphotropic virus (HTLV), Lyme disease,[59] syphilis[60] and tick-borne encephalitis[61] can in some cases cause ALS-like symptoms.[5] Neurological disorders such as multiple sclerosis, post-polio syndrome, multifocal motor neuropathy, CIDP, spinal muscular atrophy, and spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy can also mimic certain aspects of the disease and should be considered.[5]\\r\\nALS must be differentiated from the \\"ALS mimic syndromes\\" which are unrelated disorders that may have a similar presentation and clinical features to ALS or its variants.[62] Because of the prognosis carried by this diagnosis and the variety of diseases or disorders that can resemble ALS in the early stages of the disease, people with ALS symptoms should always obtain a specialist neurological opinion in order to rule out alternative diagnoses. Myasthenic syndrome, also known as LambertÿEaton syndrome, can mimic ALS, and its initial presentation can be similar to that of myasthenia gravis (MG), a treatable autoimmune disease sometimes mistaken for ALS.[63][64] Benign fasciculation syndrome is another condition that mimics some of the early symptoms of ALS, but is accompanied by normal EMG readings and no major disablement.[65]\\r\\nMost cases of ALS, however, are correctly diagnosed, with the error rate of diagnosis in large ALS clinics is less than 10%.[66][67] One study examined 190 people who met the MND/ALS diagnostic criteria, complemented with laboratory research in compliance with both research protocols and regular monitoring. Thirty of these people (16%) had their diagnosis completely changed during the clinical observation development period.[68] In the same study, three people had a false negative diagnosis of MG, which can mimic ALS and other neurological disorders, leading to a delay in diagnosis and treatment. MG is eminently treatable; ALS is not.[69]\\r\\nManagement of ALS attempts to relieve symptoms and extend life expectancy. This supportive care is best provided by multidisciplinary teams of healthcare professionals working with the person and their caregivers to keep them as mobile and comfortable as possible.[citation needed]\\r\\nRiluzole has been found to modestly prolong survival by about 2-3 months.[70][7] It may have a greater survival benefit for those with a bulbar onset.[7] It is approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration and recommended by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence in England and Wales). Riluzole does not reverse damage already done to motor neurons,[71] but affects neurons by reducing their activity through blocking Na+ entrance into the neurons, thus blocking the release of the chemicals that cause the activity of the motor neurons.[72] The reduction in activity prevents the ruining of the neuronal muscle and so the drug can act as a protective chemical.[72] The function of this drug is dependent on the amount taken at a given time. The higher the concentration, the better the drug will protect the neurons from ruin.[72] The recommended dosage of riluzole is 50?mg, twice a day for people with known ALS for more than five years.[3]\\r\\nA number of side effects are caused by the drug including the feeling of weakness in muscles, but this is normal due to the function of the drug.[72] Studies have shown that people on the drug are not likely to stop responding to it or develop symptoms that might cause the activity of neurons to rise again, making it an effective drug for prolonging survival.[73]\\r\\nIn 2015, edaravone was approved in Japan for treatment of ALS after studying how and whether it works on 137 people with ALS[74] and has obtained orphan drug status in the European Union and United States.[75] On May 5, 2017, the FDA approved edaravone to extend the survival period of people with ALS.[8] It costs about US$145,000 per year in the United States and US$35,000 per year in Japan.[76]\\r\\nOther medications may be used to help reduce fatigue, ease muscle cramps, control spasticity, and reduce excess saliva and phlegm. Drugs also are available to help people with pain, such as nonsteroidal and anti-inflammatory drugs and opioids,[77] depression, sleep disturbances, dysphagia, and constipation. Baclofen and diazepam are often prescribed to control the spasticity caused by ALS, and trihexyphenidyl, amitriptyline or most commonly glycopyrrolate[3] may be prescribed when people with ALS begin having trouble swallowing their saliva.[9] There is no evidence that medications are effective at reducing muscle cramps experienced by people with ALS.[78]\\r\\nRespiratory failure is the most common cause of death in people with ALS and is the most prominent symptom, second to the destruction of motor neurons and weakening of muscle.[3] When the muscles that assist in breathing weaken, several symptoms start to arise including shortness of breath when undergoing physical activity or talking, fatigue, morning headaches, poor concentration and depression.[3] The use of ventilatory assistance (intermittent positive pressure ventilation, bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP), or biphasic cuirass ventilation (BCV) may be used to aid breathing. Such devices artificially inflate the person's lungs from various external sources that are applied directly to the face or body. When muscles are no longer able to maintain oxygen and carbon dioxide levels, these devices may be used full-time. BCV has the added advantage of being able to assist in clearing secretions by using high-frequency oscillations followed by several positive expiratory breaths.[79] People may eventually consider forms of mechanical ventilation (respirators) in which a machine inflates and deflates the lungs. To be effective, this may require a tube that passes from the nose or mouth to the windpipe (trachea) and for long-term use, an operation such as a tracheotomy, in which a plastic breathing tube is inserted directly in the person's windpipe through an opening in the neck.[citation needed]\\r\\nPersons and their families should consider several factors when deciding whether and when to use one of these options. Ventilation devices differ in their effect on the person's quality of life and in cost. Although ventilation support can ease problems with breathing and prolong survival, it does not affect the progression of ALS. People need to be fully informed about these considerations and the long-term effects of life without movement before they make decisions about ventilation support and have deep discussions on quality of life. Some persons under long-term tracheostomy intermittent positive pressure ventilation with deflated cuffs or cuffless tracheostomy tubes (leak ventilation) are able to speak, provided their bulbar muscles are strong enough, though in all cases speech will be lost as the disease progresses. This technique preserves speech in some persons with long-term mechanical ventilation. Other persons may be able to use a speaking valve such as a Passey-Muir speaking valve with the assistance and guidance of a speech-language pathologist.[citation needed]\\r\\nExternal ventilation machines that use the ventilation mode of BiPAP are frequently used to treat respiratory insufficiency at night, and later during the daytime.[3] The use of BPAP (more often referred to as noninvasive ventilation, NIV) has shown to prolong survival and slow down the progression of forced vital capacity,[3] but long before BPAP stops being effective, persons should decide whether to have a tracheotomy and long-term mechanical ventilation. At this point, some persons choose palliative hospice care.[citation needed]\\r\\nPhysical therapy plays a large role in rehabilitation for individuals with ALS. Specifically, physical, occupational, and speech therapists can set goals and promote benefits for individuals with ALS by delaying loss of strength, maintaining endurance, limiting pain, improving speech and swallowing, preventing complications, and promoting functional independence.[80][81]\\r\\nOccupational therapy and special equipment such as assistive technology can also enhance people's independence and safety throughout the course of ALS.[82] Gentle, low-impact aerobic exercise such as performing activities of daily living, walking, swimming, and stationary bicycling can strengthen unaffected muscles, improve cardiovascular health, and help people fight fatigue and depression. Range of motion and stretching exercises can help prevent painful spasticity and shortening (contracture) of muscles. Physical and occupational therapists can recommend exercises that provide these benefits without overworking muscles, because muscle exhaustion can lead to worsening of symptoms associated with ALS, rather than providing help to people with ALS.[77] They can suggest devices such as ramps, braces, walkers, bathroom equipment (shower chairs, toilet risers, etc.), and wheelchairs that help people remain mobile. Occupational therapists can provide or recommend equipment and adaptations to enable ALS people to retain as much safety and independence in activities of daily living as possible.[82]\\r\\nPeople with ALS who have difficulty speaking may benefit from working with a speech-language pathologist.[81] These health professionals can teach people adaptive strategies such as techniques to help them speak louder and more clearly. As ALS progresses, speech-language pathologists can recommend the use of augmentative and alternative communication such as voice amplifiers, speech-generating devices (or voice output communication devices) or low-tech communication techniques such as head mounted laser pointers, alphabet boards or yes/no signals.[81]\\r\\nPeople with ALS and caregivers can learn from dieticians how to plan and prepare numerous small meals throughout the day that provide enough calories, fiber and fluid, and how to avoid foods that are difficult to swallow. Providing meals with vitamin E and taking vitamin E supplements have shown to slow down the progression of ALS.[3] People may begin using suction devices to remove excess fluids or saliva and prevent choking. Occupational therapists can assist with recommendations for adaptive equipment to ease the physical task of self-feeding. Speech-language pathologists make food choice recommendations that are more conducive to their unique deficits and abilities. When people with ALS can no longer get enough nourishment from eating, doctors may advise inserting a feeding tube into the stomach.[3]\\r\\nSocial workers and home care and hospice nurses help people with ALS, their families, and caregivers with the medical, emotional, and financial challenges of coping, particularly during the final stages of the disease. Social workers provide support such as assistance in obtaining financial aid, arranging durable power of attorney, preparing a living will, and finding support groups for patients and caregivers. Home nurses are available not only to provide medical care, but also to teach caregivers about tasks such as maintaining respirators, giving feedings, and moving people to avoid painful skin problems and contractures. Home hospice nurses work in consultation with physicians to ensure proper medication, pain control, and other care affecting the quality of life of people with ALS who wish to remain at home. The home hospice team can also counsel people with ALS and caregivers about end-of-life issues.[citation needed]\\r\\nIn much of the world, rates of ALS are unknown.[4] In Europe, the disease affects about 2.6 people per 100,000 per year.[10] In the United States, more than 5,600 are diagnosed every year (over 1.5 per 100,000 per year), and up to 30,000 Americans are currently affected. ALS is responsible for two deaths per 100,000 Americans per year.[83][84][85]\\r\\nALS is classified as a rare disease designated by the FDA as an \\"orphan\\" disease (affecting fewer than 200,000 people in the United States), but is the most common motor neuron disease. One or two of 100,000 people develop ALS each year.[86] ALS cases are estimated at 1.2ÿ4.0 per 100,000 individuals in Caucasian populations with a lower rate in other ethnic populations.[87] People of all races and ethnic backgrounds may be affected. Filipinos are second to Caucasians in terms of ALS prevalence, with 1.1-2.8 per 100,000 individuals.[84] The disease can affect people at any age, but usually starts around the ages of 58 to 63 years for sporadic disease and 47 to 52 years for familial disease.[4][18]\\r\\nDescriptions of the disease date back to at least 1824 by Charles Bell.[13]\\r\\nEnglish scientist Augustus Waller described the appearance of shriveled nerve fibers in 1850. In 1869, the connection between the symptoms and the underlying neurological problems were first described by Jean-Martin Charcot, who initially introduced the term amyotrophic lateral sclerosis in his 1874 paper.[13] In 1881, the article was translated into English and published in a three-volume edition of Lectures on the Diseases of the Nervous System.\\r\\nALS became a cause clbre in the United States in 1939 when baseball legend Lou Gehrig's career, and two years later, his life, were ended by the disease.[88]\\r\\nIn the 1950s, an epidemic occurred among the Chamorro people on Guam, which bore similarities to many conditions, including ALS.[89]\\r\\nBy 1991, researchers had linked chromosome 21 to familial ALS (FALS). In 1993, the SOD1 gene on chromosome 21 was found to play a role in some cases of FALS. In 1996, riluzole became the first FDA-approved drug for ALS.[citation needed]\\r\\nIn 1998, the El Escorial criteria were developed as the standard for classifying people with ALS in clinical research. The next year, the revised ALS Functional Rating Scale was published and soon becomes a gold standard for clinical research. Noncoding repeat expansions in C9ORF72 were found to be a major cause of ALS and frontotemporal dementia in 2011.[citation needed]\\r\\nAmyotrophic comes from the Greek word amyotrophia: a- means \\"no\\", myo refers to \\"muscle\\", and trophia means \\"nourishment\\"; amyotrophia therefore means \\"no muscle nourishment,\\" which describes the characteristic atrophy of the sufferer's disused muscle tissue. Lateral identifies the areas in a person's spinal cord where affected portions of the nerve cells are located. Degeneration in this area leads to scarring or hardening (\\"sclerosis\\").\\r\\nIn Commonwealth countries, the term \\"motor neurone disease\\" (MND) is commonly used.[11]\\r\\nIn August 2014, a challenge went viral online, commonly known as the \\"ALS Ice Bucket Challenge\\".[90] Contestants fill a bucket full of ice and water, then state who nominated them to do the challenge, and nominate three other individuals of their choice to take part in it. The contestants then dump the buckets of ice and water onto themselves. However, it can be done in a different order. The contestants then donate at least US$10 (or a similar amount in their local currency) to ALS research at the ALS Association, the ALS Therapy Development Institute, ALS Society of Canada or Motor Neurone Disease Association in the UK. Any contestants who refuse to have the ice and water dumped on them are expected to donate at least US$100 to ALS research. As of July 2015[update], the Ice Bucket Challenge had raised $115 million for the ALS Association.[91] Many celebrities have taken part in the challenge.[92] The Ice Bucket Challenge was credited with helping to raise funds that contributed to the discovery that the gene NEK1 may potentially contribute to the development for ALS.[93][94]\\r\\nRepetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation had been studied in ALS in small and poorly designed clinical trials; as of 2013, evidence was insufficient to know whether rTMS is safe or effective for ALS.[95]\\r\\nOne 2016 review of stem-cell therapy trials found tentative evidence that intraspinal stem cell implantation was relatively safe and possibly effective.[96] A 2016 Cochrane review of cell based therapies found that there was insufficient evidence to speculate about efficacy.[97] Stem cell therapy can provide additional proteins and enzymes that have shown to help prolong survival and control the symptoms associated with ALS.[77][98] Those proteins include neurotrophic factors and insulin-like growth factor 1. Both those proteins are still under clinical trials and need to be further studied to evaluate their efficiency and associated side effects.[77][98]\\r\\nMasitinib has been approved as an orphan drug in Europe and the United States, with studies ongoing as of 2016.[99] Medications tested, but without evidence for efficacy include lamotrigine, dextromethorphan, gabapentin, BCAAs, Vitamin E, acetylcysteine, selegiline, amantadine, cyclophosphamide, various neurotrophic factors, which has shown promise in both in vitro and in vivo models of ALS, but is yet to be effective in human models of ALS[77][98][100] and creatine.[101] Beta-adrenergic agonist drugs have been proposed as a treatment for their effects on muscle growth and neuroprotection, but research in humans is insufficient to determine their efficacy.[102]\\r\\nWith the discovery that TDP-43,FUS, and C9orf72 can cause ALS as well as related forms of frontotemporal dementia (FTD/ALS)[37][38] there has been intense effort to understand how these mutations cause disease, and whether other protein dysfunction may be important. As of 2013 it appeared that differences in the methylation of arginine residues in FUS protein may be relevant, and methylation status may be a way to distinguish some forms of FTD from ALS.[103]","input":"What is the full form of als disease?"},{"output":"2,936 acres","context":"Silver Lake State Park is a public recreation area covering 2,936 acres (1,188?ha) bordering Lake Michigan and Silver Lake near Mears in Oceana County, Michigan.[2] The state park is composed of mature forest land and over 2,000 acres (810?ha) of sand dunes. The park is 1.5 miles (2.4?km) wide and 3 miles (4.8?km) long and is divided into three segments: The northern area is an all-terrain vehicle dunes area where private motorized vehicle may be driven,[3] the middle of the park is a non-vehicle area (the Walking Dunes), and the southernmost section is leased to a private operator.[2] The park grounds include the Little Sable Point Light on Lake Michigan and one mile of shoreline on 690-acre (280?ha)[4] Silver Lake.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe park originated in 1920 when 25 acres on the east side of Silver Lake were donated for park purposes by Carrie E. Mears, the daughter of lumber baron Charles Mears. In 1926, the federal government transferred 900 acres to the state, which became Sand Dunes State Park in 1949. Based upon a 1949 master plan, the two were merged, with Silver Lake State Park seeing its new boundaries dedicated in 1951.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe park is considered a multi-use park with recreational opportunities that include camping, hunting, swimming, hiking, boating, fishing, picnicking, and off-road vehicle driving.[2][5]","input":"How many acres is silver lake in mears mi?"},{"output":"smooth","context":"Muscle is a soft tissue found in most animals. Muscle cells contain protein filaments of actin and myosin that slide past one another, producing a contraction that changes both the length and the shape of the cell. Muscles function to produce force and motion. They are primarily responsible for maintaining and changing posture, locomotion, as well as movement of internal organs, such as the contraction of the heart and the movement of food through the digestive system via peristalsis.\\r\\nMuscle tissues are derived from the mesodermal layer of embryonic germ cells in a process known as myogenesis. There are three types of muscle, skeletal or striated, cardiac, and smooth. Muscle action can be classified as being either voluntary or involuntary. Cardiac and smooth muscles contract without conscious thought and are termed involuntary, whereas the skeletal muscles contract upon command.[1] Skeletal muscles in turn can be divided into fast and slow twitch fibers.\\r\\nMuscles are predominantly powered by the oxidation of fats and carbohydrates, but anaerobic chemical reactions are also used, particularly by fast twitch fibers. These chemical reactions produce adenosine triphosphate (ATP) molecules that are used to power the movement of the myosin heads.[2]\\r\\nThe term muscle is derived from the Latin musculus meaning \\"little mouse\\" perhaps because of the shape of certain muscles or because contracting muscles look like mice moving under the skin.[3][4]\\r\\nThe anatomy of muscles includes gross anatomy, which comprises all the muscles of an organism, and microanatomy, which comprises the structures of a single muscle.\\r\\nMuscle tissue is a soft tissue, and is one of the four fundamental types of tissue present in animals. There are three types of muscle tissue recognized in vertebrates:\\r\\nCardiac and skeletal muscles are \\"striated\\" in that they contain sarcomeres that are packed into highly regular arrangements of bundles; the myofibrils of smooth muscle cells are not arranged in sarcomeres and so are not striated. While the sarcomeres in skeletal muscles are arranged in regular, parallel bundles, cardiac muscle sarcomeres connect at branching, irregular angles (called intercalated discs). Striated muscle contracts and relaxes in short, intense bursts, whereas smooth muscle sustains longer or even near-permanent contractions.\\r\\nSkeletal (voluntary) muscle is further divided into two broad types: slow twitch and fast twitch:\\r\\nThe density of mammalian skeletal muscle tissue is about 1.06?kg/liter.[8] This can be contrasted with the density of adipose tissue (fat), which is 0.9196?kg/liter.[9] This makes muscle tissue approximately 15% denser than fat tissue.\\r\\nSkeletal muscles are sheathed by a tough layer of connective tissue called the epimysium. The epimysium anchors muscle tissue to tendons at each end, where the epimysium becomes thicker and collagenous. It also protects muscles from friction against other muscles and bones. Within the epimysium are multiple bundles called fascicles, each of which contains 10 to 100 or more muscle fibers collectively sheathed by a perimysium. Besides surrounding each fascicle, the perimysium is a pathway for nerves and the flow of blood within the muscle. The threadlike muscle fibers are the individual muscle cells (myocytes), and each cell is encased within its own endomysium of collagen fibers. Thus, the overall muscle consists of fibers (cells) that are bundled into fascicles, which are themselves grouped together to form muscles. At each level of bundling, a collagenous membrane surrounds the bundle, and these membranes support muscle function both by resisting passive stretching of the tissue and by distributing forces applied to the muscle.[10] Scattered throughout the muscles are muscle spindles that provide sensory feedback information to the central nervous system. (This grouping structure is analogous to the organization of nerves which uses epineurium, perineurium, and endoneurium).\\r\\nThis same bundles-within-bundles structure is replicated within the muscle cells. Within the cells of the muscle are myofibrils, which themselves are bundles of protein filaments. The term \\"myofibril\\" should not be confused with \\"myofiber\\", which is a simply another name for a muscle cell. Myofibrils are complex strands of several kinds of protein filaments organized together into repeating units called sarcomeres. The striated appearance of both skeletal and cardiac muscle results from the regular pattern of sarcomeres within their cells. Although both of these types of muscle contain sarcomeres, the fibers in cardiac muscle are typically branched to form a network. Cardiac muscle fibers are interconnected by intercalated discs,[11] giving that tissue the appearance of a syncytium.\\r\\nThe filaments in a sarcomere are composed of actin and myosin.\\r\\nThe gross anatomy of a muscle is the most important indicator of its role in the body. There is an important distinction seen between pennate muscles and other muscles. In most muscles, all the fibers are oriented in the same direction, running in a line from the origin to the insertion. However, In pennate muscles, the individual fibers are oriented at an angle relative to the line of action, attaching to the origin and insertion tendons at each end. Because the contracting fibers are pulling at an angle to the overall action of the muscle, the change in length is smaller, but this same orientation allows for more fibers (thus more force) in a muscle of a given size. Pennate muscles are usually found where their length change is less important than maximum force, such as the rectus femoris.\\r\\nSkeletal muscle is arranged in discrete muscles, an example of which is the biceps brachii (biceps). The tough, fibrous epimysium of skeletal muscle is both connected to and continuous with the tendons. In turn, the tendons connect to the periosteum layer surrounding the bones, permitting the transfer of force from the muscles to the skeleton. Together, these fibrous layers, along with tendons and ligaments, constitute the deep fascia of the body.\\r\\nThe muscular system consists of all the muscles present in a single body. There are approximately 650 skeletal muscles in the human body,[12] but an exact number is difficult to define. The difficulty lies partly in the fact that different sources group the muscles differently and partly in that some muscles, such as palmaris longus, are not always present.\\r\\nA muscular slip is a narrow length of muscle that acts to augment a larger muscle or muscles.\\r\\nThe muscular system is one component of the musculoskeletal system, which includes not only the muscles but also the bones, joints, tendons, and other structures that permit movement.\\r\\nAll muscles are derived from paraxial mesoderm. The paraxial mesoderm is divided along the embryo's length into somites, corresponding to the segmentation of the body (most obviously seen in the vertebral column.[13] Each somite has 3 divisions, sclerotome (which forms vertebrae), dermatome (which forms skin), and myotome (which forms muscle). The myotome is divided into two sections, the epimere and hypomere, which form epaxial and hypaxial muscles, respectively. The only epaxial muscles in humans are the erector spinae and small intervertebral muscles, and are innervated by the dorsal rami of the spinal nerves. All other muscles, including those of the limbs are hypaxial, and inervated by the ventral rami of the spinal nerves.[13]\\r\\nDuring development, myoblasts (muscle progenitor cells) either remain in the somite to form muscles associated with the vertebral column or migrate out into the body to form all other muscles. Myoblast migration is preceded by the formation of connective tissue frameworks, usually formed from the somatic lateral plate mesoderm. Myoblasts follow chemical signals to the appropriate locations, where they fuse into elongate skeletal muscle cells.[13]\\r\\nThe three types of muscle (skeletal, cardiac and smooth) have significant differences. However, all three use the movement of actin against myosin to create contraction. In skeletal muscle, contraction is stimulated by electrical impulses transmitted by the nerves, the motoneurons (motor nerves) in particular. Cardiac and smooth muscle contractions are stimulated by internal pacemaker cells which regularly contract, and propagate contractions to other muscle cells they are in contact with. All skeletal muscle and many smooth muscle contractions are facilitated by the neurotransmitter acetylcholine.\\r\\nThe action a muscle generates is determined by the origin and insertion locations. The cross-sectional area of a muscle (rather than volume or length) determines the amount of force it can generate by defining the number of \\"sarcomeres\\" which can operate in parallel. Each skeletal muscle contains long units called myofibrils, and each myofibril is a chain of sarcomeres. Since contraction occurs at the same time for all connected sarcomeres in a muscles cell, these chains of sarcomeres shorten together, thus shortening the muscle fiber, resulting in overall length change.[14] The amount of force applied to the external environment is determined by lever mechanics, specifically the ratio of in-lever to out-lever. For example, moving the insertion point of the biceps more distally on the radius (farther from the joint of rotation) would increase the force generated during flexion (and, as a result, the maximum weight lifted in this movement), but decrease the maximum speed of flexion. Moving the insertion point proximally (closer to the joint of rotation) would result in decreased force but increased velocity. This can be most easily seen by comparing the limb of a mole to a horse - in the former, the insertion point is positioned to maximize force (for digging), while in the latter, the insertion point is positioned to maximize speed (for running).\\r\\nThe efferent leg of the peripheral nervous system is responsible for conveying commands to the muscles and glands, and is ultimately responsible for voluntary movement. Nerves move muscles in response to voluntary and autonomic (involuntary) signals from the brain. Deep muscles, superficial muscles, muscles of the face and internal muscles all correspond with dedicated regions in the primary motor cortex of the brain, directly anterior to the central sulcus that divides the frontal and parietal lobes.\\r\\nIn addition, muscles react to reflexive nerve stimuli that do not always send signals all the way to the brain. In this case, the signal from the afferent fiber does not reach the brain, but produces the reflexive movement by direct connections with the efferent nerves in the spine. However, the majority of muscle activity is volitional, and the result of complex interactions between various areas of the brain.\\r\\nNerves that control skeletal muscles in mammals correspond with neuron groups along the primary motor cortex of the brain's cerebral cortex. Commands are routed though the basal ganglia and are modified by input from the cerebellum before being relayed through the pyramidal tract to the spinal cord and from there to the motor end plate at the muscles. Along the way, feedback, such as that of the extrapyramidal system contribute signals to influence muscle tone and response.\\r\\nDeeper muscles such as those involved in posture often are controlled from nuclei in the brain stem and basal ganglia.\\r\\nIn skeletal muscles, muscle spindles convey information about the degree of muscle length and stretch to the central nervous system to assist in maintaining posture and joint position. The sense of where our bodies are in space is called proprioception, the perception of body awareness, the \\"unconscious\\" awareness of where the various regions of the body are located at any one time. Several areas in the brain coordinate movement and position with the feedback information gained from proprioception. The cerebellum and red nucleus in particular continuously sample position against movement and make minor corrections to assure smooth motion.[citation needed]\\r\\nMuscular activity accounts for much of the body's energy consumption. All muscle cells produce adenosine triphosphate (ATP) molecules which are used to power the movement of the myosin heads. Muscles have a short-term store of energy in the form of creatine phosphate which is generated from ATP and can regenerate ATP when needed with creatine kinase. Muscles also keep a storage form of glucose in the form of glycogen. Glycogen can be rapidly converted to glucose when energy is required for sustained, powerful contractions. Within the voluntary skeletal muscles, the glucose molecule can be metabolized anaerobically in a process called glycolysis which produces two ATP and two lactic acid molecules in the process (note that in aerobic conditions, lactate is not formed; instead pyruvate is formed and transmitted through the citric acid cycle). Muscle cells also contain globules of fat, which are used for energy during aerobic exercise. The aerobic energy systems take longer to produce the ATP and reach peak efficiency, and requires many more biochemical steps, but produces significantly more ATP than anaerobic glycolysis. Cardiac muscle on the other hand, can readily consume any of the three macronutrients (protein, glucose and fat) aerobically without a 'warm up' period and always extracts the maximum ATP yield from any molecule involved. The heart, liver and red blood cells will also consume lactic acid produced and excreted by skeletal muscles during exercise.\\r\\nAt rest, skeletal muscle consumes 54.4 kJ/kg?(13.0?kcal/kg) per day. This is larger than adipose tissue (fat) at 18.8?kJ/kg (4.5?kcal/kg), and bone at 9.6?kJ/kg (2.3?kcal/kg).[15]\\r\\nThe efficiency of human muscle has been measured (in the context of rowing and cycling) at 18% to 26%. The efficiency is defined as the ratio of mechanical work output to the total metabolic cost, as can be calculated from oxygen consumption. This low efficiency is the result of about 40% efficiency of generating ATP from food energy, losses in converting energy from ATP into mechanical work inside the muscle, and mechanical losses inside the body. The latter two losses are dependent on the type of exercise and the type of muscle fibers being used (fast-twitch or slow-twitch). For an overall efficiency of 20 percent, one watt of mechanical power is equivalent to 4.3 kcal per hour. For example, one manufacturer of rowing equipment calibrates its rowing ergometer to count burned calories as equal to four times the actual mechanical work, plus 300 kcal per hour,[16] this amounts to about 20 percent efficiency at 250 watts of mechanical output. The mechanical energy output of a cyclic contraction can depend upon many factors, including activation timing, muscle strain trajectory, and rates of force rise & decay. These can be synthesized experimentally using work loop analysis.\\r\\nMuscle is a result of three factors that overlap: physiological strength (muscle size, cross sectional area, available crossbridging, responses to training), neurological strength (how strong or weak is the signal that tells the muscle to contract), and mechanical strength (muscle's force angle on the lever, moment arm length, joint capabilities).[citation needed]\\r\\nVertebrate muscle typically produces approximately 25ÿ33?N (5.6ÿ7.4?lbf) of force per square centimeter of muscle cross-sectional area when isometric and at optimal length.[17] Some invertebrate muscles, such as in crab claws, have much longer sarcomeres than vertebrates, resulting in many more sites for actin and myosin to bind and thus much greater force per square centimeter at the cost of much slower speed. The force generated by a contraction can be measured non-invasively using either mechanomyography or phonomyography, be measured in vivo using tendon strain (if a prominent tendon is present), or be measured directly using more invasive methods.\\r\\nThe strength of any given muscle, in terms of force exerted on the skeleton, depends upon length, shortening speed, cross sectional area, pennation, sarcomere length, myosin isoforms, and neural activation of motor units. Significant reductions in muscle strength can indicate underlying pathology, with the chart at right used as a guide.\\r\\nSince three factors affect muscular strength simultaneously and muscles never work individually, it is misleading to compare strength in individual muscles, and state that one is the \\"strongest\\". But below are several muscles whose strength is noteworthy for different reasons.\\r\\nExercise is often recommended as a means of improving motor skills, fitness, muscle and bone strength, and joint function. Exercise has several effects upon muscles, connective tissue, bone, and the nerves that stimulate the muscles. One such effect is muscle hypertrophy, an increase in size. This is used in bodybuilding.\\r\\nVarious exercises require a predominance of certain muscle fiber utilization over another. Aerobic exercise involves long, low levels of exertion in which the muscles are used at well below their maximal contraction strength for long periods of time (the most classic example being the marathon). Aerobic events, which rely primarily on the aerobic (with oxygen) system, use a higher percentage of Type I (or slow-twitch) muscle fibers, consume a mixture of fat, protein and carbohydrates for energy, consume large amounts of oxygen and produce little lactic acid. Anaerobic exercise involves short bursts of higher intensity contractions at a much greater percentage of their maximum contraction strength. Examples of anaerobic exercise include sprinting and weight lifting. The anaerobic energy delivery system uses predominantly Type II or fast-twitch muscle fibers, relies mainly on ATP or glucose for fuel, consumes relatively little oxygen, protein and fat, produces large amounts of lactic acid and can not be sustained for as long a period as aerobic exercise. Many exercises are partially aerobic and partially anaerobic; for example, soccer and rock climbing involve a combination of both.\\r\\nThe presence of lactic acid has an inhibitory effect on ATP generation within the muscle; though not producing fatigue, it can inhibit or even stop performance if the intracellular concentration becomes too high. However, long-term training causes neovascularization within the muscle, increasing the ability to move waste products out of the muscles and maintain contraction. Once moved out of muscles with high concentrations within the sarcomere, lactic acid can be used by other muscles or body tissues as a source of energy, or transported to the liver where it is converted back to pyruvate. In addition to increasing the level of lactic acid, strenuous exercise causes the loss of potassium ions in muscle and causing an increase in potassium ion concentrations close to the muscle fibres, in the interstitium. Acidification by lactic acid may allow recovery of force so that acidosis may protect against fatigue rather than being a cause of fatigue.[19]\\r\\nDelayed onset muscle soreness is pain or discomfort that may be felt one to three days after exercising and generally subsides two to three days later. Once thought to be caused by lactic acid build-up, a more recent theory is that it is caused by tiny tears in the muscle fibers caused by eccentric contraction, or unaccustomed training levels. Since lactic acid disperses fairly rapidly, it could not explain pain experienced days after exercise.[20]\\r\\nHumans are genetically predisposed with a larger percentage of one type of muscle group over another. An individual born with a greater percentage of Type I muscle fibers would theoretically be more suited to endurance events, such as triathlons, distance running, and long cycling events, whereas a human born with a greater percentage of Type II muscle fibers would be more likely to excel at sprinting events such as 100 meter dash.[citation needed]\\r\\nIndependent of strength and performance measures, muscles can be induced to grow larger by a number of factors, including hormone signaling, developmental factors, strength training, and disease. Contrary to popular belief, the number of muscle fibres cannot be increased through exercise. Instead, muscles grow larger through a combination of muscle cell growth as new protein filaments are added along with additional mass provided by undifferentiated satellite cells alongside the existing muscle cells.[12]\\r\\nBiological factors such as age and hormone levels can affect muscle hypertrophy. During puberty in males, hypertrophy occurs at an accelerated rate as the levels of growth-stimulating hormones produced by the body increase. Natural hypertrophy normally stops at full growth in the late teens. As testosterone is one of the body's major growth hormones, on average, men find hypertrophy much easier to achieve than women. Taking additional testosterone or other anabolic steroids will increase muscular hypertrophy.\\r\\nMuscular, spinal and neural factors all affect muscle building. Sometimes a person may notice an increase in strength in a given muscle even though only its opposite has been subject to exercise, such as when a bodybuilder finds her left biceps stronger after completing a regimen focusing only on the right biceps. This phenomenon is called cross education.[citation needed]\\r\\nInactivity and starvation in mammals lead to atrophy of skeletal muscle, a decrease in muscle mass that may be accompanied by a smaller number and size of the muscle cells as well as lower protein content.[21] Muscle atrophy may also result from the natural aging process or from disease.\\r\\nIn humans, prolonged periods of immobilization, as in the cases of bed rest or astronauts flying in space, are known to result in muscle weakening and atrophy. Atrophy is of particular interest to the manned spaceflight community, because the weightlessness experienced in spaceflight results is a loss of as much as 30% of mass in some muscles.[22][23] Such consequences are also noted in small hibernating mammals like the golden-mantled ground squirrels and brown bats.[24]\\r\\nDuring aging, there is a gradual decrease in the ability to maintain skeletal muscle function and mass, known as sarcopenia. The exact cause of sarcopenia is unknown, but it may be due to a combination of the gradual failure in the \\"satellite cells\\" that help to regenerate skeletal muscle fibers, and a decrease in sensitivity to or the availability of critical secreted growth factors that are necessary to maintain muscle mass and satellite cell survival. Sarcopenia is a normal aspect of aging, and is not actually a disease state yet can be linked to many injuries in the elderly population as well as decreasing quality of life.[25]\\r\\nThere are also many diseases and conditions that cause muscle atrophy. Examples include cancer and AIDS, which induce a body wasting syndrome called cachexia. Other syndromes or conditions that can induce skeletal muscle atrophy are congestive heart disease and some diseases of the liver.\\r\\nNeuromuscular diseases are those that affect the muscles and/or their nervous control. In general, problems with nervous control can cause spasticity or paralysis, depending on the location and nature of the problem. A large proportion of neurological disorders, ranging from cerebrovascular accident (stroke) and Parkinson's disease to CreutzfeldtÿJakob disease, can lead to problems with movement or motor coordination.\\r\\nSymptoms of muscle diseases may include weakness, spasticity, myoclonus and myalgia. Diagnostic procedures that may reveal muscular disorders include testing creatine kinase levels in the blood and electromyography (measuring electrical activity in muscles). In some cases, muscle biopsy may be done to identify a myopathy, as well as genetic testing to identify DNA abnormalities associated with specific myopathies and dystrophies.\\r\\nA non-invasive elastography technique that measures muscle noise is undergoing experimentation to provide a way of monitoring neuromuscular disease. The sound produced by a muscle comes from the shortening of actomyosin filaments along the axis of the muscle. During contraction, the muscle shortens along its longitudinal axis and expands across the transverse axis, producing vibrations at the surface.[26]\\r\\nThe evolutionary origin of muscle cells in metazoans is a highly debated topic. In one line of thought scientists have believed that muscle cells evolved once and thus all animals with muscles cells have a single common ancestor. In the other line of thought, scientists believe muscles cells evolved more than once and any morphological or structural similarities are due to convergent evolution and genes that predate the evolution of muscle and even the mesoderm - the germ layer from which many scientists believe true muscle cells derive.\\r\\nSchmid and Seipel argue that the origin of muscle cells is a monophyletic trait that occurred concurrently with the development of the digestive and nervous systems of all animals and that this origin can be traced to a single metazoan ancestor in which muscle cells are present. They argue that molecular and morphological similarities between the muscles cells in cnidaria and ctenophora are similar enough to those of bilaterians that there would be one ancestor in metazoans from which muscle cells derive. In this case, Schmid and Seipel argue that the last common ancestor of bilateria, ctenophora, and cnidaria was a triploblast or an organism with three germ layers and that diploblasty, meaning an organism with two germ layers, evolved secondarily due to their observation of the lack of mesoderm or muscle found in most cnidarians and ctenophores. By comparing the morphology of cnidarians and ctenophores to bilaterians, Schmid and Seipel were able to conclude that there were myoblast-like structures in the tentacles and gut of some species of cnidarians and in the tentacles of ctenophores. Since this is a structure unique to muscle cells, these scientists determined based on the data collected by their peers that this is a marker for striated muscles similar to that observed in bilaterians. The authors also remark that the muscle cells found in cnidarians and ctenophores are often contests due to the origin of these muscle cells being the ectoderm rather than the mesoderm or mesendoderm. The origin of true muscles cells is argued by others to be the endoderm portion of the mesoderm and the endoderm. However, Schmid and Seipel counter this skepticism about whether or not the muscle cells found in ctenophores and cnidarians are true muscle cells by considering that cnidarians develop through a medusa stage and polyp stage. They observe that in the hydrozoan medusa stage there is a layer of cells that separate from the distal side of the ectoderm to form the striated muscle cells in a way that seems similar to that of the mesoderm and call this third separated layer of cells the ectocodon. They also argue that not all muscle cells are derived from the mesendoderm in bilaterians with key examples being that in both the eye muscles of vertebrates and the muscles of spiralians these cells derive from the ectodermal mesoderm rather than the endodermal mesoderm. Furthermore, Schmid and Seipel argue that since myogenesis does occur in cnidarians with the help of molecular regulatory elements found in the specification of muscles cells in bilaterians that there is evidence for a single origin for striated muscle.[27]\\r\\nIn contrast to this argument for a single origin of muscle cells, Steinmetz et al. argue that molecular markers such as the myosin II protein used to determine this single origin of striated muscle actually predate the formation of muscle cells. This author uses an example of the contractile elements present in the porifera or sponges that do truly lack this striated muscle containing this protein. Furthermore, Steinmetz et al. present evidence for a polyphyletic origin of striated muscle cell development through their analysis of morphological and molecular markers that are present in bilaterians and absent in cnidarians, ctenophores, and bilaterians. Steimetz et al. showed that the traditional morphological and regulatory markers such as actin, the ability to couple myosin side chains phosphorylation to higher concentrations of the positive concentrations of calcium, and other MyHC elements are present in all metazoans not just the organisms that have been shown to have muscle cells. Thus, the usage of any of these structural or regulatory elements in determining whether or not the muscle cells of the cnidarians and ctenophores are similar enough to the muscle cells of the bilaterians to confirm a single lineage is questionable according to Steinmetz et al. Furthermore, Steinmetz et al. explain that the orthologues of the MyHc genes that have been used to hypothesize the origin of striated muscle occurred through a gene duplication event that predates the first true muscle cells (meaning striated muscle), and they show that the MyHc genes are present in the sponges that have contractile elements but no true muscle cells. Furthermore, Steinmetz et all showed that the localization of this duplicated set of genes that serve both the function of facilitating the formation of striated muscle genes and cell regulation and movement genes were already separated into striated myhc and non-muscle myhc. This separation of the duplicated set of genes is shown through the localization of the striated myhc to the contractile vacuole in sponges while the non-muscle myhc was more diffusely expressed during developmental cell shape and change. Steinmetz et al. found a similar pattern of localization in cnidarians with except with the cnidarian N. vectensis having this striated muscle marker present in the smooth muscle of the digestive track. Thus, Steinmetz et al. argue that the pleisiomorphic trait of the separated orthologues of myhc cannot be used to determine the monophylogeny of muscle, and additionally argue that the presence of a striated muscle marker in the smooth muscle of this cnidarian shows a fundamentally different mechanism of muscle cell development and structure in cnidarians.[28]\\r\\nSteinmetz et al. continue to argue for multiple origins of striated muscle in the metazoans by explaining that a key set of genes used to form the troponin complex for muscle regulation and formation in bilaterians is missing from the cnidarians and ctenophores, and of 47 structural and regulatory proteins observed, Steinmetz et al. were not able to find even on unique striated muscle cell protein that was expressed in both cnidarians and bilaterians. Furthermore, the Z-disc seemed to have evolved differently even within bilaterians and there is a great deal diversity of proteins developed even between this clade, showing a large degree of radiation for muscle cells. Through this divergence of the Z-disc, Steimetz et al. argue that there are only four common protein components that were present in all bilaterians muscle ancestors and that of these for necessary Z-disc components only an actin protein that they have already argued is an uninformative marker through its pleisiomorphic state is present in cnidarians. Through further molecular marker testing, Steinmetz et al. observe that non-bilaterians lack many regulatory and structural components necessary for bilaterians muscle formation and do not find any unique set of proteins to both bilaterians and cnidarians and ctenophores that are not present in earlier, more primitive animals such as the sponges and amoebozoans. Through this analysis the authors conclude that due to the lack of elements that bilaterians muscles are dependent on for structure and usage, nonbilaterian muscles must be of a different origin with a different set regulatory and structural proteins.[28]\\r\\nIn another take on the argument, Andrikou and Arnone use the newly available data on gene regulatory networks to look at how the hierarchy of genes and morphogens and other mechanism of tissue specification diverge and are similar among early deuterostomes and protostomes. By understanding not only what genes are present in all bilaterians but also the time and place of deployment of these genes, Andrikou and Arnone discuss a deeper understanding of the evolution of myogenesis.[29]\\r\\nIn their paper Andrikou and Arnone argue that to truly understand the evolution of muscle cells the function of transcriptional regulators must be understood in the context of other external and internal interactions. Through their analysis, Andrikou and Arnone found that there were conserved orthologues of the gene regulatory network in both invertebrate bilaterians and in cnidarians. They argue that having this common, general regulatory circuit allowed for a high degree of divergence from a single well functioning network. Andrikou and Arnone found that the orthologues of genes found in vertebrates had been changed through different types of structural mutations in the invertebrate deuterostomes and protostomes, and they argue that these structural changes in the genes allowed for a large divergence of muscle function and muscle formation in these species. Andrikou and Arnone were able to recognize not only any difference due to mutation in the genes found in vertebrates and invertebrates but also the integration of species specific genes that could also cause divergence from the original gene regulatory network function. Thus, although a common muscle patterning system has been determined, they argue that this could be due to a more ancestral gene regulatory network being coopted several times across lineages with additional genes and mutations causing very divergent development of muscles. Thus it seems that myogenic patterning framework may be an ancestral trait. However, Andrikou and Arnone explain that the basic muscle patterning structure must also be considered in combination with the cis regulatory elements present at different times during development. In contrast with the high level of gene family apparatuses structure, Andrikou and Arnone found that the cis regulatory elements were not well conserved both in time and place in the network which could show a large degree of divergence in the formation of muscle cells. Through this analysis, it seems that the myogenic GRN is an ancestral GRN with actual changes in myogenic function and structure possibly being linked to later coopts of genes at different times and places.[29]\\r\\nEvolutionarily, specialized forms of skeletal and cardiac muscles predated the divergence of the vertebrate/arthropod evolutionary line.[30] This indicates that these types of muscle developed in a common ancestor sometime before 700 million years ago (mya). Vertebrate smooth muscle was found to have evolved independently from the skeletal and cardiac muscle types.","input":"What type of muscle is the digestive system?"},{"output":"1926/27","context":"Test kit\\r\\nODI kit\\r\\nThe Queensland cricket team or the Queensland Bulls, is the Brisbane-based Queensland representative cricket side in Australia's domestic cricket tournaments:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first European settlement in Queensland was a penal colony established at Redcliffe in 1824, which moved to Brisbane the following year. Free settlers first arrived in 1842.\\r\\nThe earliest evidence of cricket being played in Queensland is in 1857, two years prior to separation from New South Wales and statehood. A match between Brisbane and Ipswich was held in 1859 while in 1860 a Toowoomba team played Dalby. By 1862 there were also teams in Warwick, Maryborough, Gayndah, Gympie, Rockhampton and the Lockyer Valley.[1]\\r\\nQueensland's first inter-colonial (i.e. representative) match was in 1864 when their XXII was beaten by a New South Wales XI.[2] In 1875, Queensland recorded their first victory when their XVIII beat the NSW XI. That victory was a catalyst for the formation of the Queensland Cricket Association in 1876.[1] Queensland was finally granted first-class status in 1892/93, winning its inaugural first-class match against NSW in that season by 14 runs.[3] Queensland rarely played more than two inter-colonial matches per season from 1892/93, with generally one match (and often both) against New South Wales. The tyranny of distance and non-professional status of the players severely limited opportunities for more first-class competition during this period.\\r\\nThe Sheffield Shield competition commenced in 1892/93 but Queensland's initial applications for admission were refused.[2] Despite their minimal first-class exposure, Queensland still produced four Australian Test players prior to their Sheffield Shield debut, though none played more than six Tests. The first was the colourful Arthur Coningham who played his only Test in 1895. Remarkably, he took a wicket with his very first delivery[4] (it was also the first ball of the Test). He also scored Queensland's initial first-class century, 151 against NSW.[5]\\r\\n1910/11 was a very successful season as Queensland recorded three first-class wins for the first time, beating NSW home and away and Victoria in Melbourne in their only three games of the summer.[6]\\r\\nQueensland was finally admitted to the Sheffield Shield in 1926/27 and had a successful debut year, defeating NSW in their first ever Shield match and also eventual winners SA in their only meeting. Like most new teams the side struggled to maintain that level of performance and finished last in the (then) four-team competition 15 times in its first 19 seasons. However the decision to include Queensland quickly paid off with the emergence of regular Test players such as Bill Brown, Don Tallon, Percy Hornibrook and Ron Oxenham. Brisbane hosted its first Test match in 1928/29 when Australia met England at the Exhibition Ground.\\r\\nBy the early 1950s Queensland had a very competitive side and was regularly finishing in the top three of the (now) five team Shield following Western Australia's admission in 1946/47. In 1956/57 they finished an agonising one point behind winners NSW.[7] More Australian players were produced, including Ron Archer, Wally Grout, Ken 'Slasher' Mackay and Peter Burge. Another highlight of this period was the dramatic Tied Test between Australia and the West Indies at the Gabba in 1960/61.\\r\\nThis period was undoubtedly Queensland's worst era, finishing last eight times in nine Shield seasons. Rock bottom was reached in 1967/68 when the side failed to win a single game. The QCA decided to recruit high-profile interstate players to revive the team's fortunes. Greg Chappell was vice-captain of South Australia under brother Ian and was lured north for the 1973/74 season with the promise of the Queensland captaincy. Emerging pace bowler Jeff Thomson followed the next year.\\r\\nThe addition of Chappell and Thomson to a side containing players such as Sam Trimble, Martin Kent, Tony Dell and Geoff Dymock had an immediate impact. Queensland gained four seconds and a third over the next five seasons, as well as winning the domestic one day cup in 1975/76, Queensland's first piece of silverware.\\r\\nThe Queensland teams of the 1980s were even stronger, featuring many outstanding cricketers, both \\"home-grown\\" like Craig McDermott, Carl Rackemann and Ian Healy and others attracted from interstate or overseas such as Vivian Richards, Allan Border, Kepler Wessels and Ian Botham. Queensland were runners up five times in seven seasons[8] in the 1980s (including a heartbreaking one wicket loss to NSW in 1984/85), and won the one-day trophy three more times in this period, but that first Shield win was still elusive.\\r\\nThe 68-year wait finally came to an end in the 1994/95 season when Stuart Law led Queensland to their inaugural Sheffield Shield win after finishing last the previous year.\\r\\nSince their breakthrough win, Queensland has enjoyed a golden era winning the competition a further six times (including three consecutive seasons from 1999/2000 to 2001/02) and also finishing as runners-up six times. Their most recent title, a victory over the Tasmanian Tigers in 2011ÿ12 saw the Bulls win by 7 wickets in one of the most closely contested finals of recent times. Since a final was introduced to the Sheffield Shield competition in the 1982/83 cricket season the Queensland Bulls have contested 18 out of 30 finals. Since Tasmania were admitted in 1977/78, the Bulls have finished in sixth (i.e. last) just twice.\\r\\nThe primary club colour of Queensland Bulls is Maroon, which represents the state colour of Queensland. The secondary club colour is Gold, with additional contrasting colour of white.\\r\\nThe \\"Bulls\\" mascot and nickname were adopted at the commencement of the 1993/94 season.\\r\\nThe side plays most of its home games at the Brisbane Cricket Ground, generally referred to as \\"the Gabba\\", a contraction of the suburb name of Woolloongabba in which it is located.

Long-term use for the management of epilepsy is not recommended due to the significant risk of tolerance (which renders midazolam and other benzodiazepines ineffective) and the significant side effect of sedation.[12] A benefit of midazolam is that in children it can be administered buccally or intranasally at home or at school for emergency control of acute seizures, including status epilepticus.[13][needs update][14] Midazolam is effective for status epilepticus that has not improved following other treatments or when intravenous access cannot be obtained, and has advantages of being water-soluble, having a rapid onset of action and not causing metabolic acidosis from the propylene glycol vehicle, which occurs with other benzodiazepines. Drawbacks include a high degree of breakthrough seizuresdue to the short half-life of midazolamin over 50% of people treated, as well as treatment failure in 14ÿ18% of people with refractory status epilepticus. Tolerance develops rapidly to the anticonvulsant effect, and the dose may need to be increased by several times to maintain anticonvulsant therapeutic effects. With prolonged use, tolerance and tachyphylaxis can occur and the elimination half-life may increase, up to days.[6][15] There is evidence buccal and intranasal midazolam is easier to administer and more effective than rectally administered diazepam in the emergency control of seizures.[16][17][18]\\r\\n\\r\\nIntravenous midazolam is indicated for procedural sedation (often in combination with an opioid, such as fentanyl), for preoperative sedation, for the induction of general anesthesia, and for sedation of people who are ventilated in critical care units.[19][20] Midazolam is superior to diazepam in impairing memory of endoscopy procedures, but propofol has a quicker recovery time and a better memory-impairing effect.[21] It is the most popular benzodiazepine in the intensive care unit (ICU) because of its short elimination half-life, combined with its water solubility and its suitability for continuous infusion. However, for long-term sedation, lorazepam is preferred due to its long duration of action,[22] and propofol has advantages over midazolam when used in the ICU for sedation, such as shorter weaning time and earlier tracheal extubation.[23]\\r\\n\\r\\nMidazolam is sometimes used in neonatal intensive care units. When used, additional caution is required in newborns; midazolam should not be used for longer than 72 hours due to risks of tachyphylaxis, and the possibility of development of a benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome, as well as neurological complications. Bolus injections should be avoided due to the increased risk of cardiovascular depression, as well as neurological complications.[24]\\r\\nMidazolam is also sometimes used in newborns who are receiving mechanical ventilation, although morphine is preferred, owing to its better safety profile for this indication.[25]\\r\\n\\r\\nOral midazolam is indicated for the short-term treatment of moderately severe insomnia in people who have not reacted adequately to other hypnotics, and who have persistent trouble in falling asleep. Because of midazolam's extremely short duration, it is not used for people who have trouble staying asleep through the night; moderate- to long-acting benzodiazepines, such as temazepam, nitrazepam, flunitrazepam, and lormetazepam, are used for those purposes. Midazolam and other benzodiazepines may cause a deterioration in sleep quality.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nMidazolam, in combination with an antipsychotic drug, is indicated for the acute management of schizophrenia when it is associated with aggressive or out-of-control behaviour.[26]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the final stages of end-of-life care, midazolam is routinely used at low doses via subcutaneous injection to help with agitation, myoclonus, restlessness or anxiety in the last hours or days of life.[27] At higher doses during the last weeks of life, midazolam is considered a first line agent in palliative continuous deep sedation therapy when it is necessary to alleviate intolerable suffering not responsive to other treatments,[28] but the need for this is rare.[29]\\r\\n\\r\\nBenzodiazepines require special precaution if used in the elderly, during pregnancy, in children, in alcohol- or other drug-dependent individuals or those with comorbid psychiatric disorders.[30] Additional caution is required in critically ill patients, as accumulation of midazolam and its active metabolites may occur.[31] Kidney or liver impairments may slow down the elimination of midazolam leading to prolonged and enhanced effects.[32][33] Contraindications include hypersensitivity, acute narrow-angle glaucoma, shock, hypotension, or head injury. Most are relative contraindications.\\r\\n\\r\\nSide effects of midazolam in the elderly are listed above.[6] People experiencing amnesia as a side effect of midazolam are generally unaware their memory is impaired, unless they had previously known it as a side effect.[34]\\r\\n\\r\\nLong-term use of benzodiazepines has been associated with long-lasting deficits of memory, and show only partial recovery six months after stopping benzodiazepines.[6] It is unclear whether full recovery occurs after longer periods of abstinence. Benzodiazepines can cause or worsen depression.[6] Paradoxical excitement occasionally occurs with benzodiazepines, including a worsening of seizures. Children and elderly individuals or those with a history of alcohol abuse and individuals with a history of aggressive behavior or anger are at increased risk of paradoxical effects.[6] Paradoxical reactions are particularly associated with intravenous administration.[35] After nighttime administration of midazolam, residual 'hangover' effects, such as sleepiness and impaired psychomotor and cognitive functions, may persist into the next day. This may impair the ability of users to drive safely and may increase the risk of falls and hip fractures.[36] Sedation, respiratory depression and hypotension due to a reduction in systematic vascular resistance, and an increase in heart rate can occur.[14][32] If intravenous midazolam is given too quickly, hypotension may occur. A \\"midazolam infusion syndrome\\" may result from high doses, and is characterised by delayed arousal hours to days after discontinuation of midazolam, and may lead to an increase in the length of ventilatory support needed.[37]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn susceptible individuals, midazolam has been known to cause a paradoxical reaction, a well-documented complication with benzodiazepines. When this occurs, the individual may experience anxiety, involuntary movements, aggressive or violent behavior, uncontrollable crying or verbalization, and other similar effects. This seems to be related to the altered state of consciousness or disinhibition produced by the drug. Paradoxical behavior is often not recalled by the patient due to the amnesia-producing properties of the drug. In extreme situations, flumazenil can be administered to inhibit or reverse the effects of midazolam.  Antipsychotic medications, such as haloperidol, have also been used for this purpose.[38]\\r\\n\\r\\nMidazolam is known to cause respiratory depression. In healthy humans, 0.15?mg/kg of midazolam may cause respiratory depression, which is postulated to be a central nervous system (CNS) effect.[39] When midazolam is administered in combination with fentanyl, the incidence of hypoxemia or apnea becomes more likely.[40]\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough the incidence of respiratory depression/arrest is low (0.1ÿ0.5%) when midazolam is administered alone at normal doses,[41][42] the concomitant use with CNS acting drugs, mainly analgesic opiates, may increase the possibility of hypotension, respiratory depression, respiratory arrest, and death, even at therapeutic doses.[40][41][43][44] Potential drug interactions involving at least one CNS depressant were observed for 84% of midazolam users who were subsequently required to receive the benzodiazepine antagonist flumazenil.[45] Therefore, efforts directed toward monitoring drug interactions and preventing injuries from midazolam administration are expected to have a substantial impact on the safe use of this drug.[45]\\r\\n\\r\\nMidazolam, when taken during the third trimester of pregnancy, may cause risk to the neonate, including benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome, with possible symptoms including hypotonia, apnoeic spells, cyanosis, and impaired metabolic responses to cold stress. Symptoms of hypotonia and the neonatal benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome have been reported to persist from hours to months after birth.[46] Other neonatal withdrawal symptoms include hyperexcitability, tremor, and gastrointestinal upset (diarrhea or vomiting). Breastfeeding by mothers using midazolam is not recommended.[47]\\r\\n\\r\\nAdditional caution is required in the elderly, as they are more sensitive to the pharmacological effects of benzodiazepines, metabolise them more slowly, and are more prone to adverse effects, including drowsiness, amnesia (especially anterograde amnesia), ataxia, hangover effects, confusion, and falls.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nA benzodiazepine dependence occurs in about one-third of individuals who are treated with benzodiazepines for longer than 4 weeks,[6] which typically results in tolerance and benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome when the dose is reduced too rapidly. Midazolam infusions may induce tolerance and a withdrawal syndrome in a matter of days. The risk factors for dependence include dependent personality, use of a benzodiazepine that is short-acting, high potency and long-term use of benzodiazepines. Withdrawal symptoms from midazolam can range from insomnia and anxiety to seizures and psychosis. Withdrawal symptoms can sometimes resemble a persons underlying condition. Gradual reduction of midazolam after regular use can minimise withdrawal and rebound effects. Tolerance and the resultant withdrawal syndrome may be due to receptor down-regulation and GABAA receptor alterations in gene expression, which causes long-term changes in the function of the GABAergic neuronal system.[6][48][49]\\r\\n\\r\\nChronic users of benzodiazepine medication who are given midazolam experience reduced therapeutic effects of midazolam, due to tolerance to benzodiazepines.[37][50] Prolonged infusions with midazolam results in the development of tolerance; if midazolam is given for a few days or more a withdrawal syndrome can occur. Therefore, preventing a withdrawal syndrome requires that a prolonged infusion be gradually withdrawn, and sometimes, continued tapering of dose with an oral long-acting benzodiazepine such as clorazepate dipotassium. When signs of tolerance to midazolam occur during intensive care unit sedation the addition of an opioid or propofol is recommended. Withdrawal symptoms can include irritability, abnormal reflexes, tremors, clonus, hypertonicity, delirium and seizures, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, tachycardia, hypertension, and tachypnea.[37] In those with significant dependence, sudden discontinuation may result in withdrawal symptoms such as status epilepticus that may be fatal.\\r\\n\\r\\nA midazolam overdose is considered a medical emergency and generally requires the immediate attention of medical personnel. Benzodiazepine overdose in healthy individuals is rarely life-threatening with proper medical support; however, the toxicity of benzodiazepines increases when they are combined with other CNS depressants such as alcohol, opioids, or tricyclic antidepressants. The toxicity of benzodiazepine overdose and risk of death is also increased in the elderly and those with obstructive pulmonary disease or when used intravenously. Treatment is supportive; activated charcoal can be used within an hour of the overdose. The antidote for an overdose of midazolam (or any other benzodiazepine) is flumazenil.[32] While effective in reversing the effects of benzodiazepines it is not used in most cases as it may trigger seizures in mixed overdoses and benzodiazepine dependent individuals.[51][52]\\r\\n\\r\\nSymptoms of midazolam overdose can include:[51][52]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nConcentrations of midazolam or its major metabolite, 1-hydroxymidazolam glucuronide, may be measured in plasma, serum, or whole blood to monitor for safety in those receiving the drug therapeutically, to confirm a diagnosis of poisoning in hospitalized patients, or to assist in a forensic investigation of a case of fatal overdosage. Patients with renal dysfunction may exhibit prolongation of elimination half-life for both the parent drug and its active metabolite, with accumulation of these two substances in the bloodstream and the appearance of adverse depressant effects.[53]\\r\\n\\r\\nProtease inhibitors, nefazodone, sertraline, grapefruit, fluoxetine, erythromycin, diltiazem, clarithromycin inhibit the metabolism of midazolam, leading to a prolonged action. St John's wort, rifapentine, rifampin, rifabutin, phenytoin enhance the metabolism of midazolam leading to a reduced action. Sedating antidepressants, antiepileptic drugs such as phenobarbital, phenytoin and carbamazepine, sedative antihistamines, opioids, antipsychotics and alcohol enhance the sedative effects of midazolam.[6] Midazolam is metabolized almost completely by cytochrome P450-3A4. Atorvastatin administration along with midazolam results in a reduced elimination rate of midazolam.[54] St John's wort decreases the blood levels of midazolam.[55] Grapefruit juice reduces intestinal 3A4 and results in less metabolism and higher plasma concentrations.[56]\\r\\n\\r\\nMidazolam is a short-acting benzodiazepine in adults with an elimination half-life of 1.5-2.5 hours.[4] In the elderly, as well as young children and adolescents, the elimination half-life is longer.[35][57] Midazolam is metabolised into an active metabolite alpha1-hydroxymidazolam. Age-related deficits, renal and liver status affect the pharmacokinetic factors of midazolam as well as its active metabolite.[58] However, the active metabolite of midazolam is minor and contributes to only 10 percent of biological activity of midazolam. Midazolam is poorly absorbed orally, with only 50 percent of the drug reaching the bloodstream.[6] Midazolam is metabolised by cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes and by glucuronide conjugation. The therapeutic as well as adverse effects of midazolam are due to its effects on the GABAA receptors; midazolam does not activate GABAA receptors directly but, as with other benzodiazepines, it enhances the effect of the neurotransmitter GABA on the GABAA receptors ( frequency of Cl? channel opening) resulting in neural inhibition. Almost all of the properties can be explained by the actions of benzodiazepines on GABAA receptors. This results in the following pharmacological properties being produced: sedation, induction of sleep, reduction in anxiety, anterograde amnesia, muscle relaxation and anticonvulsant effects.[32]\\r\\n\\r\\nMidazolam is among about 35 benzodiazepines currently used medically,[59] and was synthesized in 1975 by Walser and Fryer at Hoffmann-LaRoche, Inc in the United States.[60] Owing to its water solubility, it was found to be less likely to cause thrombophlebitis than similar drugs.[61][62] The anticonvulsant properties of midazolam were studied in the late 1970s, but not until the 1990s did it emerge as an effective treatment for convulsive status epilepticus.[63] As of  2010[update], it is the most commonly used benzodiazepine in anesthetic medicine.[64] In acute medicine, midazolam has become more popular than other benzodiazepines, such as lorazepam and diazepam, because it is shorter lasting, is more potent, and causes less pain at the injection site.[59] Midazolam is also becoming increasingly popular in veterinary medicine due to its water solubility.[65]\\r\\n\\r\\nMidazolam is available as a generic medication and is not very expensive.[7] The wholesale price of a vial is about US$0.35.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nMidazolam is available in the United States as a syrup or as an injectable solution.[66]\\r\\n\\r\\nDormicum brand midazolam is marketed by Roche as white, oval, 7.5-mg tablets in boxes of two or three blister strips of 10 tablets, and as blue, oval, 15-mg tablets in boxes of two (Dormonid 3x) blister strips of 10 tablets. The tablets are imprinted with \\"Roche\\" on one side and the dose of the tablet on the other side. Dormicum is also available as 1-, 3-, and 10-ml ampoules at a concentration of 5?mg/ml. Another manufacturer, Novell Pharmaceutical Laboratories, makes it available as Miloz in 3- and 5-ml ampoules. Midazolam is the only water-soluble benzodiazepine available. Another maker is Roxanne Laboratories; the product in an oral solution, Midazolam HCl Syrup, 2?mg/ml clear, in a red to purplish-red syrup, cherry in flavor. It becomes soluble when the injectable solution is buffered to a pH of 2.9ÿ3.7. Midazolam is also available in liquid form.[6] It can be administered intramuscularly,[14] intravenously,[67] intrathecally,[68] intranasally,[17] buccally,[69] or orally.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the Netherlands, midazolam is a List II drug of the Opium Law.\\r\\nMidazolam is a Schedule IV drug under the Convention on Psychotropic Substances.[70] In the United Kingdom, midazolam is a Schedule 3/Class C controlled drug.[71] In the United States, midazolam (DEA number 2884) is on the Schedule IV list of the Controlled Substances Act as a non-narcotic agent with low potential for abuse.[72]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2011, the European Medicines Agency granted a marketing authorisation for a buccal application form of midazolam, sold under the trade name Buccolam. Buccolam was approved for the treatment of prolonged, acute, convulsive seizures in people from three months to less than 18 years of age. This was the first application of a paediatric-use marketing authorisation.[73][74]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe drug has been introduced for use in executions by lethal injection in certain jurisdictions in the United States in combination with other drugs. It was introduced to replace pentobarbital after the latter's manufacturer disallowed that drug's use for executions.[75]\\r\\n\\r\\nMidazolam has been used as part of a three-drug cocktail, with vecuronium bromide and potassium chloride in Florida and Oklahoma prisons.[76]  Midazolam has also been used along with hydromorphone in a two-drug protocol in Ohio and Arizona.[76] Ohio used midazolam in the execution of Dennis McGuire in January 2014; it took McGuire 24 minutes to die after the procedure started, and he gasped and appeared to be choking during that time, leading to questions about the dosing and timing of the drug administration, as well as the choice of drugs.[77]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn October 2016, the U.S. state of Ohio announced that it would resume executions in January 2017, using the midazolam-vecuronium bromide-potassium chloride cocktail, but this was blocked by a Federal judge.[78][79] On 25 July 2017, Ronald Phillips was executed with a three-drug cocktail including midazolam after the Supreme Court refused to grant a stay.[80] Prior to this, the last execution in Ohio had been that of Dennis McGuire.[81] Murderer Gary Otte's lawyers unsuccessfully challenged his Ohio execution, arguing that midazolam might not protect him from serious pain when the other drugs are administered. He died without incident in about 14 minutes on September 13, 2017.[82]\\r\\n\\r\\nMidazolam acts as a sedative to render the condemned prisoner unconscious, at which time the vecuronium bromide and potassium chloride are administered, stopping the prisoner's breathing and heart, respectively. Florida used midazolam to execute William Happ in October 2013.[83] The usage of midazolam in executions has become controversial after condemned inmate Clayton Lockett apparently regained consciousness and started speaking midway through his execution when the state of Oklahoma attempted to execute him with an untested three-drug lethal injection cocktail using 100?mg of midazolam. Prison officials reportedly discussed taking him to a hospital before he was pronounced dead of a heart attack 40 minutes after the execution began. An observing doctor stated that Lockett's vein had ruptured. It is not clear which drug or drugs caused his death or what quantities of vecuronium bromide and potassium chloride were released before the execution was cancelled.[84][85]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Glossip v. Gross, attorneys for three Oklahoma inmates argued that midazolam could not achieve the level of unconsciousness required for surgery, meaning severe pain and suffering was likely. They argued that midazolam was cruel and unusual punishment and thus contrary to the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution.  In June 2015, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled they failed to prove that midazolam was cruel and unusual when compared to known, available alternatives.[86]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe execution of Ronald Bert Smith in Alabama on December 8, 2016 \\"went awry soon after (midazolam) was administered\\"[87]\\r\\nagain putting the effectiveness of the drug in question.[75]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn April 24, 2017, Arkansas carried out a double-execution of Jack Jones, 52, and Marcel Williams, 46. The state of Arkansas attempted to execute eight people before its supply of midazolam expired on April 30, 2017. Two of them were granted a stay of execution, and another, Ledell T. Lee, 51, was executed on April 20, 2017.[88]\\r\\n\\r\\n? Clonazolam","input":"How long does the effect of midazolam last?"},{"output":"about 30,000 years","context":"The Oort cloud (/??rt, ??rt/),[1] named after the Dutch astronomer Jan Oort, sometimes called the ?pikÿOort cloud,[2] is a theoretical cloud of predominantly icy planetesimals proposed to surround the Sun to as far as somewhere between 50,000 and 200,000?AU (0.8 and 3.2?ly).[note 1][3] It is divided into two regions: a disc-shaped inner Oort cloud (or Hills cloud) and a spherical outer Oort cloud. Both regions lie beyond the heliosphere and in interstellar space.[3][4] The Kuiper belt and the scattered disc, the other two reservoirs of trans-Neptunian objects, are less than one thousandth as far from the Sun as the Oort cloud.\\r\\nThe outer limit of the Oort cloud defines the cosmographical boundary of the Solar System and the extent of the Sun's Hill sphere.[5] The outer Oort cloud is only loosely bound to the Solar System, and thus is easily affected by the gravitational pull both of passing stars and of the Milky Way itself. These forces occasionally dislodge comets from their orbits within the cloud and send them toward the inner Solar System.[3] Based on their orbits, most of the short-period comets may come from the scattered disc, but some may still have originated from the Oort cloud.[3][6]\\r\\nAstronomers conjecture that the matter composing the Oort cloud formed closer to the Sun and was scattered far into space by the gravitational effects of the giant planets early in the Solar System's evolution.[3] Although no confirmed direct observations of the Oort cloud have been made, it may be the source of all long-period and Halley-type comets entering the inner Solar System, and many of the centaurs and Jupiter-family comets as well.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are two main classes of comet: short-period comets (also called ecliptic comets) and long-period comets (also called nearly isotropic comets). Ecliptic comets have relatively small orbits, below 10?AU, and follow the ecliptic plane, the same plane in which the planets lie. All long-period comets have very large orbits, on the order of thousands of AU, and appear from every direction in the sky.[7]\\r\\nA. O. Leuschner in 1907 suggested that many comets believed to have parabolic orbits, and thus making single visits to the solar system, actually had elliptical orbits and would return after very long periods.[8] In 1932 Estonian astronomer Ernst ?pik postulated that long-period comets originated in an orbiting cloud at the outermost edge of the Solar System.[9] Dutch astronomer Jan Oort independently revived the idea in 1950 as a means to resolve a paradox:[10]\\r\\nThus, Oort reasoned, a comet could not have formed while in its current orbit and must have been held in an outer reservoir for almost all of its existence.[10][11][7] He noted that there was a peak in numbers of long-period comets with aphelia (their farthest distance from the Sun) of roughly 20,000?AU, which suggested a reservoir at that distance with a spherical, isotropic distribution. Those relatively rare comets with orbits of about 10,000?AU have probably gone through one or more orbits through the Solar System and have had their orbits drawn inward by the gravity of the planets.[7]\\r\\nThe Oort cloud is thought to occupy a vast space from somewhere between 2,000 and 5,000?AU (0.03 and 0.08?ly)[7] to as far as 50,000?AU (0.79?ly)[3] from the Sun. Some estimates place the outer edge at between 100,000 and 200,000?AU (1.58 and 3.16?ly).[7] The region can be subdivided into a spherical outer Oort cloud of 20,000ÿ50,000?AU (0.32ÿ0.79?ly), and a torus-shaped inner Oort cloud of 2,000ÿ20,000?AU (0.0ÿ0.3?ly). The outer cloud is only weakly bound to the Sun and supplies the long-period (and possibly Halley-type) comets to inside the orbit of Neptune.[3] The inner Oort cloud is also known as the Hills cloud, named after Jack G. Hills, who proposed its existence in 1981.[12] Models predict that the inner cloud should have tens or hundreds of times as many cometary nuclei as the outer halo;[12][13][14] it is seen as a possible source of new comets to resupply the tenuous outer cloud as the latter's numbers are gradually depleted. The Hills cloud explains the continued existence of the Oort cloud after billions of years.[15]\\r\\nThe outer Oort cloud may have trillions of objects larger than 1?km (0.62?mi),[3] and billions with absolute magnitudes[16] brighter than 11 (corresponding to approximately 20-kilometre (12?mi) diameter), with neighboring objects tens of millions of kilometres apart.[6][17] Its total mass is not known, but, assuming that Halley's Comet is a suitable prototype for comets within the outer Oort cloud, roughly the combined mass is 3G1025 kilograms (6.6G1025?lb), or five times that of Earth.[3][18] Earlier it was thought to be more massive (up to 380 Earth masses),[19] but improved knowledge of the size distribution of long-period comets led to lower estimates. The mass of the inner Oort cloud has not been characterized.\\r\\nIf analyses of comets are representative of the whole, the vast majority of Oort-cloud objects consist of ices such as water, methane, ethane, carbon monoxide and hydrogen cyanide.[20] However, the discovery of the object 1996 PW, an object whose appearance was consistent with a D-type asteroid[21][22] in an orbit typical of a long-period comet, prompted theoretical research that suggests that the Oort cloud population consists of roughly one to two percent asteroids.[23] Analysis of the carbon and nitrogen isotope ratios in both the long-period and Jupiter-family comets shows little difference between the two, despite their presumably vastly separate regions of origin. This suggests that both originated from the original protosolar cloud,[24] a conclusion also supported by studies of granular size in Oort-cloud comets[25] and by the recent impact study of Jupiter-family comet Tempel 1.[26]\\r\\nThe Oort cloud is thought to be a remnant of the original protoplanetary disc that formed around the Sun approximately 4.6?billion years ago.[3] The most widely accepted hypothesis is that the Oort cloud's objects initially coalesced much closer to the Sun as part of the same process that formed the planets and minor planets, but that gravitational interaction with young gas giants such as Jupiter ejected the objects into extremely long elliptic or parabolic orbits.[3][27] Recent research has been cited by NASA hypothesizing that a large number of Oort cloud objects are the product of an exchange of materials between the Sun and its sibling stars as they formed and drifted apart, and it is suggested that manypossibly the majority ofOort cloud objects did not form in close proximity to the Sun.[28] Simulations of the evolution of the Oort cloud from the beginnings of the Solar System to the present suggest that the cloud's mass peaked around 800?million years after formation, as the pace of accretion and collision slowed and depletion began to overtake supply.[3]\\r\\nModels by Julio ngel Fernndez suggest that the scattered disc, which is the main source for periodic comets in the Solar System, might also be the primary source for Oort cloud objects. According to the models, about half of the objects scattered travel outward toward the Oort cloud, whereas a quarter are shifted inward to Jupiter's orbit, and a quarter are ejected on hyperbolic orbits. The scattered disc might still be supplying the Oort cloud with material.[29] A third of the scattered disc's population is likely to end up in the Oort cloud after 2.5?billion years.[30]\\r\\nComputer models suggest that collisions of cometary debris during the formation period play a far greater role than was previously thought. According to these models, the number of collisions early in the Solar System's history was so great that most comets were destroyed before they reached the Oort cloud. Therefore, the current cumulative mass of the Oort cloud is far less than was once suspected.[31] The estimated mass of the cloud is only a small part of the 50ÿ100 Earth masses of ejected material.[3]\\r\\nGravitational interaction with nearby stars and galactic tides modified cometary orbits to make them more circular. This explains the nearly spherical shape of the outer Oort cloud.[3] On the other hand, the Hills cloud, which is bound more strongly to the Sun, has not acquired a spherical shape. Recent studies have shown that the formation of the Oort cloud is broadly compatible with the hypothesis that the Solar System formed as part of an embedded cluster of 200ÿ400 stars. These early stars likely played a role in the cloud's formation, since the number of close stellar passages within the cluster was much higher than today, leading to far more frequent perturbations.[32]\\r\\nIn June 2010 Harold F. Levison and others suggested on the basis of enhanced computer simulations that the Sun \\"captured comets from other stars while it was in its birth cluster\\". Their results imply that \\"a substantial fraction of the Oort cloud comets, perhaps exceeding 90%, are from the protoplanetary discs of other stars\\".[33][34]\\r\\nComets are thought to have two separate points of origin in the Solar System. Short-period comets (those with orbits of up to 200?years) are generally accepted to have emerged from either the Kuiper belt or the scattered disc, which are two linked flat discs of icy debris beyond Neptune's orbit at 30?AU and jointly extending out beyond 100?AU from the Sun. Long-period comets, such as comet HaleÿBopp, whose orbits last for thousands of years, are thought to originate in the Oort cloud. The orbits within the Kuiper belt are relatively stable, and so very few comets are thought to originate there. The scattered disc, however, is dynamically active, and is far more likely to be the place of origin for comets.[7] Comets pass from the scattered disc into the realm of the outer planets, becoming what are known as centaurs.[35] These centaurs are then sent farther inward to become the short-period comets.[36]\\r\\nThere are two main varieties of short-period comet: Jupiter-family comets (those with semi-major axes of less than 5?AU) and Halley-family comets. Halley-family comets, named for their prototype, Halley's Comet, are unusual in that although they are short-period comets, it is hypothesized that their ultimate origin lies in the Oort cloud, not in the scattered disc. Based on their orbits, it is suggested they were long-period comets that were captured by the gravity of the giant planets and sent into the inner Solar System.[11] This process may have also created the present orbits of a significant fraction of the Jupiter-family comets, although the majority of such comets are thought to have originated in the scattered disc.[6]\\r\\nOort noted that the number of returning comets was far less than his model predicted, and this issue, known as \\"cometary fading\\", has yet to be resolved. No dynamical process are known to explain the smaller number of observed comets than Oort estimated. Hypotheses for this discrepancy include the destruction of comets due to tidal stresses, impact or heating; the loss of all volatiles, rendering some comets invisible, or the formation of a non-volatile crust on the surface.[37] Dynamical studies of hypothetical Oort cloud comets have estimated that their occurrence in the outer-planet region would be several times higher than in the inner-planet region. This discrepancy may be due to the gravitational attraction of Jupiter, which acts as a kind of barrier, trapping incoming comets and causing them to collide with it, just as it did with Comet ShoemakerÿLevy 9 in 1994.[38]\\r\\nMost of the comets seen close to the Sun seem to have reached their current positions through gravitational perturbation of the Oort cloud by the tidal force exerted by the Milky Way. Just as the Moon's tidal force deforms Earth's oceans, causing the tides to rise and fall, the galactic tide also distorts the orbits of bodies in the outer Solar System. In the charted regions of the Solar System, these effects are negligible compared to the gravity of the Sun, but in the outer reaches of the system, the Sun's gravity is weaker and the gradient of the Milky Way's gravitational field has substantial effects. Galactic tidal forces stretch the cloud along an axis directed toward the galactic centre and compress it along the other two axes; these small perturbations can shift orbits in the Oort cloud to bring objects close to the Sun.[39] The point at which the Sun's gravity concedes its influence to the galactic tide is called the tidal truncation radius. It lies at a radius of 100,000 to 200,000 AU, and marks the outer boundary of the Oort cloud.[7]\\r\\nSome scholars theorise that the galactic tide may have contributed to the formation of the Oort cloud by increasing the perihelia (smallest distances to the Sun) of planetesimals with large aphelia (largest distances to the Sun).[40] The effects of the galactic tide are quite complex, and depend heavily on the behaviour of individual objects within a planetary system. Cumulatively, however, the effect can be quite significant: up to 90% of all comets originating from the Oort cloud may be the result of the galactic tide.[41] Statistical models of the observed orbits of long-period comets argue that the galactic tide is the principal means by which their orbits are perturbed toward the inner Solar System.[42]\\r\\nBesides the galactic tide, the main trigger for sending comets into the inner Solar System is thought to be interaction between the Sun's Oort cloud and the gravitational fields of nearby stars[3] or giant molecular clouds.[38] The orbit of the Sun through the plane of the Milky Way sometimes brings it in relatively close proximity to other stellar systems. For example, it is hypothesized that 70?thousand years ago, perhaps Scholz's star passed through the outer Oort cloud (although its low mass and high relative velocity limited its effect).[43] During the next 10?million years the known star with the greatest possibility of perturbing the Oort cloud is Gliese 710.[44] This process could also scatter Oort cloud objects out of the ecliptic plane, potentially also explaining its spherical distribution.[44][45]\\r\\nIn 1984, Physicist Richard A. Muller postulated that the Sun has a heretofore undetected companion, either a brown dwarf or a red dwarf, in an elliptical orbit within the Oort cloud. This object, known as Nemesis, was hypothesized to pass through a portion of the Oort cloud approximately every 26?million years, bombarding the inner Solar System with comets. However, to date no evidence of Nemesis or the Oort cloud have been found, and many lines of evidence (such as crater counts), have thrown their existence into doubt.[46][47] Recent scientific analysis no longer supports the idea that extinctions on Earth happen at regular, repeating intervals.[48] Thus, the Nemesis hypothesis is no longer needed to explain current assumptions.[48]\\r\\nA somewhat similar hypothesis was advanced by astronomer John J. Matese of the University of Louisiana at Lafayette in 2002. He contends that more comets are arriving in the inner Solar System from a particular region of the postulated Oort cloud than can be explained by the galactic tide or stellar perturbations alone, and that the most likely cause would be a Jupiter-mass object in a distant orbit.[49] This hypothetical gas giant was nicknamed Tyche. The WISE mission, an all-sky survey using parallax measurements in order to clarify local star distances, was capable of proving or disproving the Tyche hypothesis.[48] In 2014, NASA announced that the WISE survey had ruled out any object as they had defined it.[50]\\r\\nSpace probes have yet to reach the area of the Oort cloud. Voyager 1, the fastest[51] and farthest[52][53] of the interplanetary space probes currently leaving the Solar System, will reach the Oort cloud in about 300 years[4][54] and would take about 30,000 years to pass through it.[55][56] However, around 2025, the radioisotope thermoelectric generators on Voyager 1 will no longer supply enough power to operate any of its scientific instruments, preventing any exploration by Voyager 1. The other four probes currently escaping the Solar System either are already or are predicted to be non-functional when they reach the Oort cloud; however, it may be possible to find an object from the cloud that has been knocked into the inner Solar System.\\r\\nIn the 1980s there was a concept for a probe to reach 1,000 AU in 50 years called TAU; among its missions would be to look for the Oort cloud.[57]\\r\\nIn the 2014 Announcement of Opportunity for the Discovery program, an observatory to detect the objects in the Oort cloud (and Kuiper belt) called the \\"Whipple Mission\\" was proposed.[58] It would monitor distant stars with a photometer, looking for transits up to 10,000 AU away.[58] The observatory was proposed for halo orbiting around L2 with a suggested 5-year mission.[58] It has been suggested that the Kepler observatory may also be able to detect objects in the Oort cloud.[59]\\r\\n\\r\\nSolar System?L Local Interstellar Cloud?L Local Bubble?L Gould Belt?L Orion Arm?L Milky Way?L Milky Way subgroup?L Local Group?L Virgo Supercluster?L Laniakea Supercluster?L Observable universe?L Universe\\r\\nEach arrow (L) may be read as \\"within\\" or \\"part of\\".","input":"How long will it take voyager to pass through the oort cloud?"}]`),I={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:C},data(){return{visibleCount:20,poemsData:M}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{loadMore(){this.visibleCount+=20}}},x={class:"card-container"};function B(h,t,n,c,u,i){const m=p("PoemCard");return a(),o(l,null,[t[1]||(t[1]=e("section",null,[e("div",{class:"top-Banner"},[e("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title"},[e("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title-Text"},"🎉Q&A Life🥳")])])],-1)),e("section",null,[e("div",x,[(a(!0),o(l,null,g(i.visiblePoems,(r,f)=>(a(),y(m,{key:f,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(a(),o("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",onClick:t[0]||(t[0]=(...r)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...r))},"See more")):w("",!0)])],64)}const P=d(I,[["render",B]]),N=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"qapage/8.md","filePath":"qapage/8.md"}'),F={name:"qapage/8.md"},D=Object.assign(F,{setup(h){return(t,n)=>(a(),o("div",null,[b(P)]))}});export{N as __pageData,D as default};
