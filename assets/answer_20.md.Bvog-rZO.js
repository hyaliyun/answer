The nucleosynthesis , or fusion of lighter elements into heavier ones , occurs during explosive oxygen burning and silicon burning processes . Those fusion reactions create the elements silicon , sulfur , chlorine , argon , sodium , potassium , calcium , scandium , titanium and iron peak elements : vanadium , chromium , manganese , iron , cobalt , and nickel . These are called \`\` primary elements '' , in that they can be fused from pure hydrogen and helium in massive stars . As a result of their ejection from supernovae , their abundances increase within the interstellar medium . Elements heavier than nickel are created primarily by a rapid capture of neutrons in a process called the r - process . However , these are much less abundant than the primary chemical elements . Other processes are thought to be responsible for some nucleosynthesis of other such heavy elements , notably , the proton capture process known as the rp - process and a photodisintegration process known as the gamma ( or p ) process . The latter synthesizes the lightest , most neutron - poor , isotopes of the heavy elements ."},{"query":"where does andy work in 40 year old virgin","short_answer":"","abstract":"The 40 - Year - Old Virgin is a 2005 American sex comedy film co-written , produced and directed by Judd Apatow , about a middle - aged man 's journey to finally have sex .

It is stimulated by decreased O in circulation , which is detected by the kidneys , which then secrete the hormone erythropoietin . This hormone stimulates proliferation and differentiation of red cell precursors , which activates increased erythropoiesis in the hemopoietic tissues , ultimately producing red blood cells ( erythrocytes ) . In postnatal birds and mammals ( including humans ) , this usually occurs within the red bone marrow . In the early fetus , erythropoiesis takes place in the mesodermal cells of the yolk sac . By the third or fourth month , erythropoiesis moves to the liver . After seven months , erythropoiesis occurs in the bone marrow . Increased level of physical activity can cause an increase in erythropoiesis . However , in humans with certain diseases and in some animals , erythropoiesis also occurs outside the bone marrow , within the spleen or liver .

The most prominent event in the Late Pleistocene is differentiated from previous Quaternary pulse extinctions by the widespread absence of ecological succession to replace these extinct species , and the regime shift of previously established faunal relationships and habitats as a consequence . The earliest casualties were incurred at 130,000 BCE ( the start of the Late Pleistocene ) , however the great majority of extinctions in Afro - Eurasia and the Americas occurred during the transition from the Pleistocene to the Holocene epoch ( 13,000 BCE to 8,000 BCE ) . However , this extinction wave did not stop at the end of the Pleistocene , but continued , especially on isolated islands , in human - caused extinctions , although there is debate as to whether these should be considered separate events or part of the same event . Among the main causes hypothesized by paleontologists are overkill by the widespread appearance of humans and natural climate change . A notable modern human presence first appeared during the Middle Pleistocene in Africa , and started to establish continuous , permanent populations in Eurasia and Australasia from 80,000 BCE , and the Americas from 22,000 BCE . A variant of the former possibility is the second - order predation hypothesis , which focuses more on the indirect damage caused by overcompetition with nonhuman predators . Recent studies have tended to favor the human - overkill theory ."},{"query":"who evolved the national consciousness as a formal concept","short_answer":"","abstract":"A national consciousness is a shared sense of national identity ; that is , a shared understanding that a people group shares a common ethnic / linguistic / cultural background .

Balaam refused to speak what God did not speak and would not curse the Israelites , even though King Balak of Moab offered him money to do so ( Numbers 22 -- 24 ) . But Balaam 's error and the source of his wickedness came from sabotaging the Israelites as they entered the Promised Land . According to Revelation 2 : 14 , Balaam told King Balak how to get the Israelites to commit sin by enticing them with sexual immorality and food sacrificed to idols . The Israelites fell into transgression due to these traps and God sent a deadly plague to them as a result ( Numbers 31 : 16 ) ."},{"query":"if acetylcholine causes inhibition of a postsynaptic neuron","short_answer":"","abstract":"An inhibitory postsynaptic potential ( IPSP ) is a kind of synaptic potential that makes a postsynaptic neuron less likely to generate an action potential . The opposite of an inhibitory postsynaptic potential is an excitatory postsynaptic potential ( EPSP ) , which is a synaptic potential that makes a postsynaptic neuron more likely to generate an action potential . IPSPs can take place at all chemical synapses , which use the secretion of neurotransmitters to create cell to cell signalling . Inhibitory presynaptic neurons release neurotransmitters that then bind to the postsynaptic receptors ; this induces a change in the permeability of the postsynaptic neuronal membrane to particular ions . An electric current that changes the postsynaptic membrane potential to create a more negative postsynaptic potential is generated , i.e. the postsynaptic membrane potential becomes more negative than the resting membrane potential , and this is called hyperpolarisation . In order for an action potential to be generated , depolarisation of the postsynaptic membrane needs to occur , where the membrane potential becomes more positive than resting membrane potential . Therefore , hyperpolarisation of the postsynaptic membrane makes it less likely for depolarisation to sufficiently occur to generate an action potential in the postsynaptic neurone ."},{"query":"who played michelle tanner's friends on full house","short_answer":"","abstract":""},{"query":"what is the song zoot suit riot about","short_answer":"the Los Angeles Zoot Suit riots of the 1940s","abstract":""},{"query":"who plays morton in last of the summer wine","short_answer":"","abstract":"The following is a list of characters in the BBC sitcom Last of the Summer Wine .

The main function of the SR is to store calcium ions ( Ca ) . Calcium ion levels are kept relatively constant , with the concentration of calcium ions within a cell being 100,000 times smaller than the concentration of calcium ions outside the cell . This means that small increases in calcium ions within the cell are easily detected and can bring about important cellular changes ( the calcium is said to be a second messenger ; see calcium in biology for more details ) . Calcium is used to make calcium carbonate ( found in chalk ) and calcium phosphate , two compounds that the body uses to make teeth and bones . This means that too much calcium within the cells can lead to hardening ( calcification ) of certain intracellular structures , including the mitochondria , leading to cell death . Therefore , it is vital that calcium ion levels are controlled tightly , and can be released into the cell when necessary and then remove from the cell ."},{"query":"where did the bye bye man come from","short_answer":"","abstract":""},{"query":"who plays blink in days of future past","short_answer":"Fan Bingbing","abstract":"X-Men : Days of Future Past is a 2014 American superhero film based on the fictional X-Men characters that appear in Marvel Comics .

When the potential difference between the conductors exceeds the breakdown voltage of the gas within the gap , a spark forms , ionizing the gas and drastically reducing its electrical resistance . An electric current then flows until the path of ionized gas is broken or the current reduces below a minimum value called the \`\` holding current '' . This usually happens when the voltage drops , but in some cases occurs when the heated gas rises , stretching out and then breaking the filament of ionized gas . Usually , the action of ionizing the gas is violent and disruptive , often leading to sound ( ranging from a snap for a spark plug to thunder for a lightning discharge ) , light and heat ."},{"query":"who played mike logan on law and order","short_answer":"Chris Noth","abstract":"Michael Logan is a fictional character in the police procedural and legal drama television series Law & Order franchise , played by Chris Noth .

The development of rules for scientific reasoning has not been straightforward ; scientific method has been the subject of intense and recurring debate throughout the history of science , and eminent natural philosophers and scientists have argued for the primacy of one or another approach to establishing scientific knowledge . Despite the disagreements about approaches , scientific method has advanced in definite steps . Rationalist explanations of nature , including atomism , appeared both in ancient Greece in the thought of Leucippus and Democritus , and in ancient India , in the Nyaya , Vaisesika and Buddhist schools , while Charvaka materialism rejected inference as a source of knowledge in favour of an empiricism that was always subject to doubt .

If the refractive index is lower on the other side of the boundary and the incident angle is greater than the critical angle , the wave can not pass through and is entirely reflected . The critical angle is the angle of incidence above which the total internal reflection occurs . This is particularly common as an optical phenomenon , where light waves are involved , but it occurs with many types of waves , such as electromagnetic waves in general or sound waves . When a wave reaches a boundary between different materials with different refractive indices , the wave will in general be partially refracted at the boundary surface , and partially reflected . However , if the angle of incidence is greater ( i.e. the direction of propagation is closer to being parallel to the boundary ) than the critical angle -- the angle of incidence at which light is refracted such that it travels along the boundary -- then the wave will not cross the boundary , but will instead be totally reflected back internally . This can only occur when the wave in a medium with a higher refractive index ( n ) reaches a boundary with a medium of lower refractive index ( n ) . For example , it will occur with light reaching air from glass , but not when reaching glass from air ."},{"query":"who won the mens ncaa tournament last year","short_answer":"","abstract":"The National Collegiate Athletic Association ( NCAA ) Men 's Division I Basketball Championship , or NCAA Tournament , is a single - elimination tournament for men 's college basketball teams in the United States .

The pressure is relieved by allowing the pressurised fluid to flow from an auxiliary passage out of the system . The relief valve is designed or set to open at a predetermined set pressure to protect pressure vessels and other equipment from being subjected to pressures that exceed their design limits . When the set pressure is exceeded , the relief valve becomes the \`\` path of least resistance '' as the valve is forced open and a portion of the fluid is diverted through the auxiliary route . The diverted fluid ( liquid , gas or liquid -- gas mixture ) is usually routed through a piping system known as a flare header or relief header to a central , elevated gas flare where it is usually burned and the resulting combustion gases are released to the atmosphere . As the fluid is diverted , the pressure inside the vessel will stop rising . Once it reaches the valve 's reseating pressure , the valve will close . The blowdown is usually stated as a percentage of set pressure and refers to how much the pressure needs to drop before the valve reseats . The blowdown can vary from roughly 2 -- 20 % , and some valves have adjustable blowdowns ."},{"query":"what are the top 10 metro areas in the us","short_answer":"","abstract":"Population"},{"query":"why is the unit of mass called fundamental unit","short_answer":"","abstract":"The slug is a derived unit of mass in the weight - based system of measures , most notably within the British Imperial measurement system and in the United States customary measures system .

In endospore formation , the bacterium divides within its cell wall , and one side then engulfs the other . Endospores enable bacteria to lie dormant for extended periods , even centuries . There are many reports of spores remaining viable over 10,000 years , and revival of spores millions of years old has been claimed . There is one report of viable spores of Bacillus marismortui in salt crystals approximately 250 million years old . When the environment becomes more favorable , the endospore can reactivate itself to the vegetative state . Most types of bacteria can not change to the endospore form . Examples of bacteria that can form endospores include Bacillus and Clostridium ."},{"query":"who did jls lose to on x factor","short_answer":"Alexandra Burke","abstract":"The fifth UK series of The X Factor was broadcast on ITV .

It would also be considered the final year where undrafted college underclassmen were forced to begin their professional careers early ; on August 8 , 2018 , the NCAA announced that players who declared for the NBA draft and were n't selected would have the opportunity to return to their school for at least another year .

An EF0 tornado will probably damage trees but not substantial structures , whereas an EF5 tornado can rip buildings off their foundations leaving them bare and even deform large skyscrapers . The similar TORRO scale ranges from a T0 for extremely weak tornadoes to T11 for the most powerful known tornadoes .

For example , if two electrons reside in the same orbital , and if their n , l , and m values are the same , then their m must be different , and thus the electrons must have opposite half - integer spin projections of 1 / 2 and − 1 / 2 . This principle was formulated by Austrian physicist Wolfgang Pauli in 1925 for electrons , and later extended to all fermions with his spin -- statistics theorem of 1940 ."},{"query":"mark wrote his gospel for most likely those living in","short_answer":"","abstract":"The Gospel According to Mark ( Greek : τὸ κατὰ Μᾶρκον εὐαγγέλιον , to kata Markon euangelion ) , is one of the four canonical gospels and one of the three synoptic gospels .

It is the belief that individuals tend to ascribe success to their own abilities and efforts , but ascribe failure to external factors . When individuals reject the validity of negative feedback , focus on their strengths and achievements but overlook their faults and failures , or take more responsibility for their group 's work than they give to other members , they are protecting their ego from threat and injury . These cognitive and perceptual tendencies perpetuate illusions and error , but they also serve the self 's need for esteem . For example , a student who attributes earning a good grade on an exam to their own intelligence and preparation but attributes earning a poor grade to the teacher 's poor teaching ability or unfair test questions might be exhibiting the self - serving bias . Studies have shown that similar attributions are made in various situations , such as the workplace , interpersonal relationships , sports , and consumer decisions ."},{"query":"teamwork makes the dreamwork chitty chitty bang bang","short_answer":"","abstract":"Chitty Chitty Bang Bang is a stage musical based on the 1968 film produced by Albert R.

Tax incidence is said to \`\` fall '' upon the group that ultimately bears the burden of , or ultimately has to pay , the tax .

The central question for classical pluralism is how power and influence are distributed in a political process . Groups of individuals try to maximize their interests . Lines of conflict are multiple and shifting as power is a continuous bargaining process between competing groups . There may be inequalities but they tend to be distributed and evened out by the various forms and distributions of resources throughout a population . Any change under this view will be slow and incremental , as groups have different interests and may act as \`\` veto groups '' to destroy legislation . The existence of diverse and competing interests is the basis for a democratic equilibrium , and is crucial for the obtaining of goals by individuals . A polyarchy -- a situation of open competition for electoral support within a significant part of the adult population -- ensures competition of group interests and relative equality . Pluralists stress civil rights , such as freedom of expression and organization , and an electoral system with at least two parties . On the other hand , since the participants in this process constitute only a tiny fraction of the populace , the public acts mainly as bystanders . This is not necessarily undesirable for two reasons : ( 1 ) it may be representative of a population content with the political happenings , or ( 2 ) political issues require continuous and expert attention , which the average citizen may not have ."},{"query":"who sings the theme song from gran torino","short_answer":"","abstract":"Gran Torino is a 2008 American drama film directed and produced by Clint Eastwood , who also starred in the film .

One of the most well - known and heavily studied hotspots in the world , the Hawaii plume is responsible for the creation of the Hawaiian -- Emperor seamount chain , a chain of volcanoes over 5,800 kilometres ( 3,600 mi ) long . Four of these volcanoes are active , two are dormant , and more than 123 are extinct , many having since been ground beneath the waves by erosion as seamounts and atolls . The chain extends from south of the island of Hawai ʻi to the edge of the Aleutian Trench , near the eastern edge of Russia . While most volcanoes are created by geological activity at tectonic plate boundaries , the Hawaii hotspot is located far from plate boundaries . The classic hotspot theory , first proposed in 1963 by John Tuzo Wilson , proposes that a single , fixed mantle plume builds volcanoes that then , cut off from their source by the movement of the Pacific Plate , become increasingly inactive and eventually erode below sea level over millions of years . According to this theory , the nearly 60 ° bend where the Emperor and Hawaiian segments of the chain meet was caused by a sudden shift in the movement of the Pacific Plate . In 2003 , fresh investigations of this irregularity led to the proposal of a mobile hotspot theory , suggesting that hotspots are mobile , not fixed , and that the 47 - million - year - old bend was caused by a shift in the hotspot 's motion rather than the plate 's ."},{"query":"where do you go to get a divorce","short_answer":"","abstract":"Divorce , also known as dissolution of marriage , is the termination of a marriage or marital union , the canceling or reorganizing of the legal duties and responsibilities of marriage , thus dissolving the bonds of matrimony between a married couple under the rule of law of the particular country or state .

With the beginnings of modern biological taxonomy in the late 17th century , two opposed ideas influenced Western biological thinking : essentialism , the belief that every species has essential characteristics that are unalterable , a concept which had developed from medieval Aristotelian metaphysics , and that fit well with natural theology ; and the development of the new anti-Aristotelian approach to modern science : as the Enlightenment progressed , evolutionary cosmology and the mechanical philosophy spread from the physical sciences to natural history . Naturalists began to focus on the variability of species ; the emergence of paleontology with the concept of extinction further undermined static views of nature . In the early 19th century Jean - Baptiste Lamarck ( 1744 -- 1829 ) proposed his theory of the transmutation of species , the first fully formed theory of evolution ."},{"query":"the order of steps in monroe’s motivated sequence","short_answer":"","abstract":"Monroe 's motivated sequence is a technique for organizing persuasive speeches that inspire people to take action .

A versatile hunting breed , being an all - purpose gun breed of dog suitable for both land and water , it is streamlined yet powerful with strong legs that make it able to move rapidly and turn quickly . It has moderately long floppy ears set high on the head . Its muzzle is long , broad , and strong , allowing it to retrieve even heavy game . The dog 's profile should be straight or strongly Roman nosed ; any dished appearance to the profile is incorrect . The eyes are generally brown , with darker eyes being desirable ; yellow or \`\` bird of prey '' eyes are a fault . The tail is commonly docked , although this is now prohibited in some countries . The correct location for docking for a GSP is after the caudal vertebrae start to curl , leaving enough tail to let the dog communicate through tail wagging and movement . The docked tail should not be too long or too short but should balance the appearance of the head and body . The GSP tail is carried at a jaunty angle , not curled under . When the GSP is in classic point stance , the tail should be held straight out from the body , forming a line with the pointing head and body . Like all German pointers , GSPs have webbed feet . They are known for going after water fowl in the water ."},{"query":"when does the second season of discovery start","short_answer":"January 2019","abstract":"The second season of the American television series Star Trek : Discovery is set roughly a decade before the events of the original Star Trek series and follows the crew of the USS Discovery .
