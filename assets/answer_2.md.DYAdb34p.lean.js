When compared to other macronutrient classes ( carbohydrates and protein ) , fatty acids yield the most ATP on an energy per gram basis , when they are completely oxidized to CO and water by beta oxidation and the citric acid cycle . Fatty acids ( mainly in the form of triglycerides ) are therefore the foremost storage form of fuel in most animals , and to a lesser extent in plants . In addition , fatty acids are important components of the phospholipids that form the phospholipid bilayers out of which all the membranes of the cell are constructed ( the cell wall , and the membranes that enclose all the organelles within the cells , such as the nucleus , the mitochondria , endoplasmic reticulum , and the Golgi apparatus ) . Fatty acids can also be cleaved , or partially cleaved , from their chemical attachments in the cell membrane to form second messengers within the cell , and local hormones in the immediate vicinity of the cell .

More specifically , the aperture and focal length of an optical system determine the cone angle of a bundle of rays that come to a focus in the image plane . The aperture determines how collimated the admitted rays are , which is of great importance for the appearance at the image plane . If an aperture is narrow , then highly collimated rays are admitted , resulting in a sharp focus at the image plane . A wide aperture admits uncollimated rays , resulting in a sharp focus only for rays coming from a certain distance . This means that a wide aperture results in an image that is sharp for things at the correct distance . The aperture also determines how many of the incoming rays are actually admitted and thus how much light reaches the image plane ( the narrower the aperture , the darker the image for a given exposure time ) . In the human eye , the pupil is the aperture ."},{"query":"when does star was the last jedi come out","short_answer":"December 15 , 2017","abstract":"Star Wars : The Last Jedi ( also known as Star Wars : Episode VIII -- The Last Jedi ) is a 2017 American epic space opera film written and directed by Rian Johnson .

Naturalists began to focus on the variability of species ; the emergence of paleontology with the concept of extinction further undermined static views of nature .

Another name for food web is consumer - resource system . Ecologists can broadly lump all life forms into one of two categories called trophic levels : 1 ) the autotrophs , and 2 ) the heterotrophs . To maintain their bodies , grow , develop , and to reproduce , autotrophs produce organic matter from inorganic substances , including both minerals and gases such as carbon dioxide . These chemical reactions require energy , which mainly comes from the Sun and largely by photosynthesis , although a very small amount comes from hydrothermal vents and hot springs . A gradient exists between trophic levels running from complete autotrophs that obtain their sole source of carbon from the atmosphere , to mixotrophs ( such as carnivorous plants ) that are autotrophic organisms that partially obtain organic matter from sources other than the atmosphere , and complete heterotrophs that must feed to obtain organic matter . The linkages in a food web illustrate the feeding pathways , such as where heterotrophs obtain organic matter by feeding on autotrophs and other heterotrophs . The food web is a simplified illustration of the various methods of feeding that links an ecosystem into a unified system of exchange . There are different kinds of feeding relations that can be roughly divided into herbivory , carnivory , scavenging and parasitism . Some of the organic matter eaten by heterotrophs , such as sugars , provides energy . Autotrophs and heterotrophs come in all sizes , from microscopic to many tonnes - from cyanobacteria to giant redwoods , and from viruses and bdellovibrio to blue whales ."},{"query":"who played the saxophone on long as i can see the light","short_answer":"John Fogerty","abstract":"Cosmo 's Factory is the fifth studio album by American rock band Creedence Clearwater Revival ( CCR ) , released by Fantasy Records in July 1970 , and released as Fantasy 8402 -- the same month as the single release of \`\` Lookin ' Out My Back Door '' with \`\` Long as I Can See the Light '' on the B side .

The empire was developed as the Roman Republic invaded and occupied most of Europe and portions of northern Africa and western Asia . Under the republic , regions of the empire were ruled by provincial governors answerable to and authorised by the \`\` Senate and People of Rome '' . Rome and its senate were ruled by a variety of magistrates -- of whom the consuls were the most powerful . The republic ended , and the emperors were created , when these magistrates became legally and practically subservient to one citizen with power over all other magistrates . Augustus , the first emperor , was careful to maintain the façade of republican rule , taking no specific title for his position and calling the concentration of magisterial power princeps senatus ( the first man of the senate ) . This style of government lasted for 300 years , and is thus called the Principate . The modern word ' emperor ' derives from the title imperator , which was granted by an army to a successful general ; during the initial phase of the empire , it still had to be earned by the princeps . The term emperor is a modern construction , used when describing rulers of the Roman Empire because it emphasises the strong links between the ruler and the army ( on whose support the ruler 's power depended ) , and does not discriminate between the personal styles of rule and titles in different phases of the Empire ."},{"query":"how many times has france reached the finals","short_answer":"","abstract":"This is a record of France 's results at the FIFA World Cup .

In other words , it is the end load against which the heart contracts to eject blood . Afterload is readily broken into components : one factor is the aortic pressure the left ventricular muscle must overcome to eject blood . The greater the aortic / pulmonary pressure , the greater the after load on the left / right ventricle , respectively . Following Laplace 's law , the tension upon the muscle fibers in the heart wall is the pressure within the ventricle multiplied by the volume within the ventricle divided by the wall thickness ( this ratio is the other factor in setting the afterload ) . Therefore , when comparing a normal heart to a heart with a dilated left ventricle , if the aortic pressure is the same in both hearts , the dilated heart must create a greater tension to overcome the same aortic pressure to eject blood because it has a larger internal radius and volume . Thus , the dilated heart has a greater total load ( tension ) on the myocytes , i.e. , has a higher afterload . This is also true in the eccentric hypertrophy consequent to high intensity aerobic training . Conversely , a concentrically hypertrophied left ventricle may have a lower afterload for a given aortic pressure . When contractility becomes impaired and the ventricle dilates , the afterload rises and limits output . This may start a vicious circle , in which cardiac output is reduced as oxygen requirements are increased ."},{"query":"what is the story of wrinkle in time","short_answer":"","abstract":"A Wrinkle in Time is a science fantasy novel written by American writer Madeleine L'Engle , first published in 1962 .

Expansion sets are the most numerous and prevalent type of expansion ; they primarily consist of new cards , with few or no reprints , and either explore a new setting , or advance the plot in an existing setting . Guilds of Ravnica is the most recent expansion set as of October , 2018 . Base sets , later renamed core sets , are the successors to the original Limited Edition and are meant to provide a baseline Magic experience ; they tended to consist either largely or entirely of reprints . Compilation sets also exist entirely of reprints , and tend to be made as either a special themed product , or as a way to increase supply of cards with small printings . Examples of compilation sets with randomized boosters include Chronicles and Modern Masters . There also exist compilation products with a pre-selected and fixed card pool , such as the Duel Decks and From The Vault series . Theme decks serve a similar function ; however , they are always attached to a specific set or block , while compilations are free to pick and choose cards from any set ."},{"query":"journal of international association of providers of aids care","short_answer":"","abstract":"The Journal of the International Association of Providers of AIDS Care is a bimonthly peer - reviewed medical journal that covers research on AIDS .

Clos networks are required when the physical circuit switching needs to exceed the capacity of the largest feasible single crossbar switch . The key advantage of Clos networks is that the number of crosspoints ( which make up each crossbar switch ) required can be far fewer than would be the case if the entire switching system were implemented with one large crossbar switch . When the Clos network was first devised , the number of crosspoints was a reasonable approximate indication of the total cost of the switching system . While this was important for electromechanical crossbars , it became less relevant with the advent of VLSI , wherein the interconnects often could be implemented either directly in silicon , or within a relatively small cluster of boards . However , the advent of complex data centers , with huge interconnect structures , each based on optical fiber links , means that they are again important ."},{"query":"where was the law of the twelve fables kept","short_answer":"","abstract":"The Grimms ' Fairy Tales , originally known as the Children 's and Household Tales ( German : Kinder - und Hausmärchen , pronounced ( ˌkɪndɐ ʔʊnt ˈhaʊsmɛːɐ̯çən ) ) , is a collection of fairy tales by the Grimm brothers or \`\` Brothers Grimm '' , Jacob and Wilhelm , first published on 20 December 1812 .

The second cranial nerve is not a true peripheral nerve but a tract of the diencephalon . Cranial nerve ganglia originated in the CNS . However , the remaining ten cranial nerve axons extend beyond the brain and are therefore considered part of the PNS . The autonomic nervous system is an involuntary control of smooth muscle and glands .

Proteins responsible for detecting stimuli are generally termed receptors , although in some cases the term sensor is used . The changes elicited by ligand binding ( or signal sensing ) in a receptor give rise to a signaling cascade , which is a chain of biochemical events along a signaling pathway . When signaling pathways interact with one another they form networks , which allow cellular responses to be coordinated , often by combinatorial signaling events . At the molecular level , such responses include changes in the transcription or translation of genes , and post-translational and conformational changes in proteins , as well as changes in their location . These molecular events are the basic mechanisms controlling cell growth , proliferation , metabolism and many other processes . In multicellular organisms , signal transduction pathways have evolved to regulate cell communication in a wide variety of ways ."},{"query":"where was the movie the tall man filmed","short_answer":"Kootenay region of Southeastern British Columbia","abstract":"The Tall Man is a 2012 Canadian and French mystery - horror film written and directed by Pascal Laugier .

Water is necessary for plants but only a small amount of water taken up by the roots is used for growth and metabolism . The remaining 97 -- 99.5 % is lost by transpiration and guttation . Leaf surfaces are dotted with pores called stomata , and in most plants they are more numerous on the undersides of the foliage . The stomata are bordered by guard cells and their stomatal accessory cells ( together known as stomatal complex ) that open and close the pore . Transpiration occurs through the stomatal apertures , and can be thought of as a necessary \`\` cost '' associated with the opening of the stomata to allow the diffusion of carbon dioxide gas from the air for photosynthesis . Transpiration also cools plants , changes osmotic pressure of cells , and enables mass flow of mineral nutrients and water from roots to shoots . Two major factors influence the rate of water flow from the soil to the roots : the hydraulic conductivity of the soil and the magnitude of the pressure gradient through the soil . Both of these factors influence the rate of bulk flow of water moving from the roots to the stomatal pores in the leaves via the xylem ."},{"query":"show me a map of the jordan river","short_answer":"","abstract":"The Jordan River ( also River Jordan ; Classical Syriac : ܢܗܪܐ ܕܝܘܪܕܢܢ ‎ , Hebrew : נְהַר הַיַּרְדֵּן ‬ Nahar ha - Yarden ; Arabic : نَهْر الْأُرْدُنّ ‎ Nahr al - Urdunn , Ancient Greek : Ιορδάνης , Iordànes ) is a 251 - kilometre ( 156 mi ) - long river in the Middle East that flows roughly north to south through the Sea of Galilee and on to the Dead Sea .

They are primarily composed of polymers of actin , but in cells are modified by and interact with numerous other proteins . Microfilaments are usually about 7 nm in diameter and composed of two strands of actin . Microfilament functions include cytokinesis , amoeboid movement and cell motility in general , changes in cell shape , endocytosis and exocytosis , cell contractility and mechanical stability .

Secondary messengers are therefore one of the initiating components of intracellular signal transduction cascades . Examples of second messenger molecules include cyclic AMP , cyclic GMP , inositol trisphosphate , diacylglycerol , and calcium . The cell releases second messenger molecules in response to exposure to extracellular signaling molecules -- the first messengers . First messengers are extracellular factors , often hormones or neurotransmitters , such as epinephrine , growth hormone , and serotonin . Because peptide hormones and neurotransmitters typically are biochemically hydrophilic molecules , these first messengers may not physically cross the phospholipid bilayer to initiate changes within the cell directly -- unlike steroid hormones , which usually do . This functional limitation necessitates the cell to devise signal transduction mechanisms to transduce first messenger into second messengers , so that the extracellular signal may be propagated intracellularly . An important feature of the second messenger signaling system is that second messengers may be coupled downstream to multi-cyclic kinase cascades to greatly amplify the strength of the original first messenger signal . For example , RasGTP signals link with the Mitogen Activated Protein Kinase ( MAPK ) cascade to amplify the allosteric activation of proliferative transcription factors such as Myc and CREB ."},{"query":"how many times has ou won against texas","short_answer":"46","abstract":"The Red River Showdown , commonly called the Red River Rivalry , the Red River Classic , or the Red River Shootout , is an American college football rivalry game played annually at the Cotton Bowl stadium in Dallas , Texas , during the third weekend of the State Fair of Texas in October .

They were primarily used to demoralize , injure , and kill entrenched defenders , against whom the indiscriminate and generally very slow - moving or static nature of gas clouds would be most effective . The types of weapons employed ranged from disabling chemicals , such as tear gas , to lethal agents like phosgene , chlorine , and mustard gas . This chemical warfare was a major component of the first global war and first total war of the 20th century .

Another way to define membrane domains is the association of the lipid membrane with the cytoskeleton filaments and the extracellular matrix through membrane proteins .

Section 1956 prohibits individuals from engaging in a financial transaction with proceeds that were generated from certain specific crimes , known as \`\` specified unlawful activities '' ( SUAs ) . Additionally , the law requires that an individual specifically intend in making the transaction to conceal the source , ownership or control of the funds .
