A thermoconforming organism , by contrast , simply adopts the surrounding temperature as its own body temperature , thus avoiding the need for internal thermoregulation . The internal thermoregulation process is one aspect of homeostasis : a state of dynamic stability in an organism 's internal conditions , maintained far from thermal equilibrium with its environment ( the study of such processes in zoology has been called physiological ecology ) . If the body is unable to maintain a normal temperature and it increases significantly above normal , a condition known as hyperthermia occurs . For humans , this occurs when the body is exposed to constant temperatures of approximately 55 ° C ( 131 ° F ) , and with prolonged exposure ( longer than a few hours ) at this temperature and up to around 75 ° C ( 167 ° F ) death is almost inevitable . Humans may also experience lethal hyperthermia when the wet bulb temperature is sustained above 35 ° C ( 95 ° F ) for six hours . The opposite condition , when body temperature decreases below normal levels , is known as hypothermia . It results when the homeostatic control mechanisms of heat within the body malfunction , causing the body to lose heat faster than producing it . Normal body temperature is around 37 ° C ( 99 ° F ) , and hypothermia sets in when the core body temperature gets lower than 35 ° C ( 95 ° F ) . Usually caused by prolonged exposure to cold temperatures , hypothermia is usually treated by methods that attempt to raise the body temperature back to a normal range ."},{"query":"bryan adams song everything i do for you","short_answer":"","abstract":"\`\` ( Everything I Do ) I Do It for You '' is a song by Canadian singer - songwriter Bryan Adams .

This increase in membrane potential is what causes the cell membrane , which typically maintains a resting membrane potential of - 70 mV , to reach the threshold potential and consequently fire the next action potential ; thus , the pacemaker potential is what drives the self - generated rhythmic firing ( automaticity ) of pacemaker cells , and the rate of change ( i.e. , the slope ) of the pacemaker potential is what determines the timing of the next action potential and thus the intrinsic firing rate of the cell . In a healthy sinoatrial node ( SAN , a complex tissue within the right atrium containing pacemaker cells that normally determine the intrinsic firing rate for the entire heart ) , the pacemaker potential is the main determinant of the heart rate . Because the pacemaker potential represents the non-contracting time between heart beats ( diastole ) , it is also called the diastolic depolarization . The amount of net inward current required to move the cell membrane potential during the pacemaker phase is extremely small , in the order of few pAs , but this net flux arises from time to time changing contribution of several currents that flow with different voltage and time dependence . Evidence in support of the active presence of K , Ca , Na channels and Na / K exchanger during the pacemaker phase have been variously reported in the literature , but several indications point to the \`\` funny '' ( I ) current as one of the most important. ( see funny current ) . There is now substantial evidence that also sarcoplasmic reticulum ( SR ) Ca - transients participate to the generation of the diastolic depolarization via a process involving the Na -- Ca exchanger ."},{"query":"what season of blue bloods are we in","short_answer":"eighth season","abstract":"Blue Bloods is an American police procedural television series created by Robin Green and Mitchell Burgess .

If loading on a particular bone increases , the bone will remodel itself over time to become stronger to resist that sort of loading . The internal architecture of the trabeculae undergoes adaptive changes , followed by secondary changes to the external cortical portion of the bone , perhaps becoming thicker as a result . The inverse is true as well : if the loading on a bone decreases , the bone will become less dense and weaker due to the lack of the stimulus required for continued remodeling . This reduction in bone density ( osteopenia ) is known as stress shielding and can occur as a result of a hip replacement ( or other prosthesis ) .

When the contractors discovered a series of old coal shafts improperly filled with debris , they chose to continue work rather than properly blocking them up . The result was that on 11 December 1860 , shortly after being filled for the first time , Rylands ' reservoir burst and flooded a neighbouring mine , run by Fletcher , causing £ 937 worth of damage , equivalent to £ 102,768 in 2015 terms .

Bramwell 's argument was affirmed , both by the Court of Exchequer Chamber and the House of Lords , leading to the development of the \`\` Rule in Rylands v Fletcher '' ; that \`\` the person who for his own purposes brings on his lands and collects and keeps there anything likely to do mischief if it escapes , must keep it in at his peril , and , if he does not do so , is prima facie answerable for all the damage which is the natural consequence of its escape '' .

Another name for food web is consumer - resource system . Ecologists can broadly lump all life forms into one of two categories called trophic levels : ( 1 the autotrophs , and 2 ) the heterotrophs . To maintain their bodies , grow , develop , and to reproduce , autotrophs produce organic matter from inorganic substances , including both minerals and gases such as carbon dioxide . These chemical reactions require energy , which mainly comes from the Sun and largely by photosynthesis , although a very small amount comes from hydrothermal vents and hot springs . A gradient exists between trophic levels running from complete autotrophs that obtain their sole source of carbon from the atmosphere , to mixotrophs ( such as carnivorous plants ) that are autotrophic organisms that partially obtain organic matter from sources other than the atmosphere , and complete heterotrophs that must feed to obtain organic matter . The linkages in a food web illustrate the feeding pathways , such as where heterotrophs obtain organic matter by feeding on autotrophs and other heterotrophs . The food web is a simplified illustration of the various methods of feeding that links an ecosystem into a unified system of exchange . There are different kinds of feeding relations that can be roughly divided into herbivory , carnivory , scavenging and parasitism . Some of the organic matter eaten by heterotrophs , such as sugars , provides energy . Autotrophs and heterotrophs come in all sizes , from microscopic to many tonnes - from cyanobacteria to giant redwoods , and from viruses and bdellovibrio to blue whales ."},{"query":"the number of valence electrons of the germanium element is","short_answer":"","abstract":"Germanium is a chemical element with symbol Ge and atomic number 32 .

At low Reynolds numbers flow tends to be dominated by laminar ( sheet - like ) flow , but at high Reynolds numbers turbulence results from differences in the fluid 's speed and direction , which may sometimes intersect or even move counter to the overall direction of the flow ( eddy currents ) . These eddy currents begin to churn the flow , using up energy in the process , and for liquids increasing the chances of cavitation . Reynolds number has wide applications , ranging from liquid flow in a pipe to the passage of air over an aircraft wing . It is used to predict the transition from laminar to turbulent flow , and used in the scaling of similar but different - sized flow situations , such as between an aircraft model in a wind tunnel and the full size version . The predictions of the onset of turbulence and the ability to calculate scaling effects can be used to help predict fluid behaviour on a larger scale , such as in local or global air or water movement and thereby the associated meteorological and climatological effects ."},{"query":"which elements would you use to predict the properties of ekasilicon","short_answer":"","abstract":"Dmitri Mendeleev published the first periodic table of the chemical elements in 1869 based on properties that appeared with some regularity as he laid out the elements from lightest to heaviest .

Age is thus a major fertility factor for women . Menarche , the first menstrual period , usually occurs around 12 - 13 , although it may happen earlier or later , depending on each girl . After puberty , female fertility increases and then decreases , with advanced maternal age causing an increased risk of female infertility . In humans , a woman 's fertility peaks in the early and mid-20s , after which it starts to decline slowly . While many sources suggest a more dramatic drop at around 35 , this is unclear since studies are still cited from the nineteenth century and earlier . One 2004 study of European women found fertility of the 27 - 34 and the 35 -- 39 groups had only a four - percent difference . At age 45 , a woman starting to try to conceive will have no live birth in 50 -- 80 percent of cases . Menopause , or the cessation of menstrual periods , generally occurs in the 40s and 50s and marks the cessation of fertility , although age - related infertility can occur before then .

Most impeachments have concerned alleged crimes committed while in office , though there have been a few cases in which Congress has impeached and convicted officials partly for prior crimes . The actual trial on such charges , and subsequent removal of an official upon conviction , is separate from the act of impeachment itself . Impeachment proceedings have been initiated against several presidents of the United States . Andrew Johnson and Bill Clinton are the only two presidents to have been successfully impeached by the House of Representatives , and both were later acquitted by the Senate . The impeachment process against Richard Nixon was never completed , as Nixon resigned his office before the vote of the full House for impeachment , but such a vote was widely expected to pass , and the threat of it and a subsequent conviction in the Senate was the impetus for Nixon 's departure . To date , no president has been removed from office by impeachment and conviction .

This leads to adolescents ' belief that other people are as attentive to their behaviors and appearance as they are of themselves .

They were primarily used to demoralize , injure , and kill entrenched defenders , against whom the indiscriminate and generally very slow - moving or static nature of gas clouds would be most effective . The types of weapons employed ranged from disabling chemicals , such as tear gas , to lethal agents like phosgene , chlorine , and mustard gas . This chemical warfare was a major component of the first global war and first total war of the 20th century . The killing capacity of gas was limited , with only about ninety thousand fatalities from a total of some 1.3 million casualties caused by gas attacks . Gas was unlike most other weapons of the period because it was possible to develop effective countermeasures , such as gas masks . In the later stages of the war , as the use of gas increased , its overall effectiveness diminished . The widespread use of these agents of chemical warfare , and wartime advances in the composition of high explosives , gave rise to an occasionally expressed view of World War I as \`\` the chemist 's war '' and also the era where \`\` weapons of mass destruction '' were created ."},{"query":"where do the electrons in the electron transport chain come from","short_answer":"from electron donors","abstract":"An electron transport chain ( ETC ) is a series of complexes that transfer electrons from electron donors to electron acceptors via redox ( both reduction and oxidation occurring simultaneously ) reactions , and couples this electron transfer with the transfer of protons ( H ions ) across a membrane .
